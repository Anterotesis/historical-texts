                  <note>The first part of this "second edition" appeared in two previous editions: Virgo triumphans; or, Virginia richly and truly valued, and, Virgo triumphans; or, Virginia in generall but the south part thereof in particular. Both had imprint: London : Printed by T. Harper for J. Stephenson, 1650, and both lacked the map by John Ferrar. Cf. NUC pre-1956 imprints.</note>
                  <note>The second part, or "addition," has special t.p.: Virginia's discovery of silke-vvormes, with their benefit ... London : Printed by T.H. for John Stephenson ..., 1650.</note>
                  <note>A third edition appeared in 1651, with title: Virginia in America richly valued ...</note>
                  <note>Quartich (General catalogue, v. 5, p. 2991-2992) says that John Farrer (or Ferrar), who is referred to in the preface, supplied Williams with the material for this work, and describes Ferrar's own copy of the 1st edition, with his marginalia and a drawing of a map dated 1650. Quartich also says that no map was issued with the 1st and 2nd editions, but that Ferrar's design was engraved in 1651 for the 3rd edition. However, this photographed copy of the 1650 2nd edition does contain the 1651 map, which was engraved by John Goddard.</note>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>And the same <hi>Tellier</hi> is bold to affirme, that <hi>non obstante</hi> the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeablenesse of the Country to that worme, in the Kingdome of France from the sole revenue now of Silke, arises a greater intrade then from their Corne, Oyle and Woad put together, which grow in that Kingdome in vast proportions. And another French Author affirmeth, that the benefit of the Silke worme, (of which France hath had no triall till within these fifty yeeres) ariseth to four Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>per annum,</hi> sterling, and this he pretends to have all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of truth and certainty, drawne from an exact computation to confirme it.</p>
                     <p>If France (an almost improper Countrey for this improvement) can rayse within the verge of fifty yeeres, so large and numerous a revenue, what shall we imagine Italy (a warmer Region, and by much more convenient, although not altogether Native, for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching creature) may meerely upon this Staple returne in their Treasury, having besides the advantage of Climate, a hundred and fifty yeeres precedency in the mystery, and their seed more strong, better fed, and lesse subject to diseases and casualties?</p>
                     <p>But Virginia a Countrey which Nature hath no lesse particularly assigned for the production, food, and perfection of this Creature then Persia or China, stored naturally with infinites of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-trees, some so large that the leaves thereof have by French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beene esteemed worth 5l. in which the indigenall and naturall Worme hath beene found as bigge as Wallnuts; and the using in the South thereof in admirable plenty and excellence; if this mystery were but duly followed, and industriously promoved, might be a Magazine for all the Westerne World, and singly in her selfe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy France, Spaine, and Italy, in all their advantages collected.</p>
                     <p>Heere the Leaves are onely sold by nature, who requires no other satisfaction then industry to make use of her bounty. Timber to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their Fabricks is provided, and costs no more then preparing a benevolent Sunne, and a Serene Sky, contributing their indulgence to its perfection. No narrow assignation of Ground (richer then

the most fertile France or Italy can pretend to, or boast of) to plant those Trees on, if not neare enough to the setled Plantations; in briefe, all the conveniences imaginable to assist and advance this to the Noblest Commerce in the World, if neglect and sloth make us not ingratefull to our selves, and nature, by abusing our selves, by not using her bounty.</p>
                     <p>To further this happy designe, let us descend into an unequall comparison: Let us compare our most incomparable Virginia, where the Mulberry and the Worme are aboriginall to Italy, where they are onely adventitious: Let us imagine our owne Worme of that strength and greatnesse onely equall to those of Brescia and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, where the usuall ofcome from sixe ounces of seede is 72, ot at least 60 pound weight of Silke, and adhearing to this Parallell; let us see the apparency in the profit.</p>
                     <p>A man and a boy, if their hands be not sleeping in their pockets, will feede as many Wormes as come of sixe or eight ounces of seed till they be past their foure first sicknesses, and within some 14 dayes of spinning: Indeed the last 14 dayes require a more extraordinary diligence and attendance, a more frequent and carefull feeding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in that time they conceive, gather, and store up the disposing matter from whence the Silke comes, which by an incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mystery of Nature, they after as it were vomit out of their mouthes, and spinne out of their bowells. At this more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar season, there is a necessity of adding the labour of three or foure helpes more (to which Women or Children are as proper as Men) which is an inconsiderable accession considering the gaine arising from it.</p>
                     <p>That you may know the reason why Women, Children, lame and impotent persons are as fitting to attend the last fourteene dayes, as Men, will appeare by their labour, which is nothing but to feede them within doores, cleanse, dry, and perfume their lodgings, with some strengthning but not overstrong odour.</p>
                     <p>And as one skilfull in this noble mystery is sufficient for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying, overseeing, and directing hundreds under him, so (the skill being rather experimentally to be taught, then built upon long and ambiguous precepts) he may bee able to perfect all those under him within the five or six weeekes time of their imployment in the full understanding the mystery. And the better to incourage both

the teacher and learner of the mystery, the master should be invited by reward to be liberall in communicating his knowledge, and those under his instruction encouraged by arguments of honour and profit proposed to the best proficient, would disperse seeds of emulation and diligence, since every one would imploy himselfe seriously to engrosse and appropriate to himselfe the reputation and advantage in the victory.</p>
                     <p>And in boyes and children, disputations frequently set on foot, with some slight distinction of merit, would make all that are inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously disposed, quicken their observation and diligence, to gaine the credit of prelation. Though to take off all disincouragement or despayre, from those lesse apprehensive and docible, in this noble and gainefull Trade of Silke, there is no such absolute necessity layd upon them to be supersticiously and precisely curious in observing the Booke Rules, and written Precepts, that upon the omission or unpunctuall observation of any of those Precepts in hatching, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, feeding, and tending of the Silke-wormes, wee should ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine such minute deviations might occasion an improsperity or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall failing: for wee will admit something may be wanting either in materialls, accommodation, or precisenesse of knowledge; yet may the worke (a higher and irresistible cause not interrupting it) prosper and succeede, notwithstanding such defect, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and gaine of them which keepe them.</p>
                     <p>Let us imagine it to be granted that the indigency of the person improving the incommodiousnesse of the place, or want of House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roome, which the Bookes exactly tye us to, be in many things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregular (though such a supposition may fall upon any other part of the World more justly then Virginia, where all materialls and convenien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There must be likewise a providentiall regard in a moist season, that the Mulberry leaves be carefully dryed after their gathering, before they be administred for food to the Silke-worme: But if the season pertake more of drought it will be wisedome to let the leaves lye and shade a little after their gathering, that they may have them coole and refreshing, and in seasons of temperature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued droughts, it may be very requisite to water the Roots of the Mulberry-tree, which will be a refreshing to the leaves, and this is usually practised in Spaine; especially if the Mulberry-tree be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a hot or dry ground, which otherwise must not be so prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed without particular caution.</p>

                     <p>Though it be certaine that all over those Countries drawing near the Center of the Sun a constant Brise arises and continues from 9. to 3. with a great mitigation during the violence and height of the Sun, and that during those intervalls, servants are so indulged as not to labour without doors, yet it is certain that the violentest of heats in that Southern is not hotter then some dayes which we feele in England.</p>
                     <p>And though ancient Philosophy may stumble at the doctrine (able to make reason herselfe almost blear-eyed) yet those no lesse signall experiencers of the modern will tell us, that the causes of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and habitability of those regions proceed from that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon our Patriarchs of learning, who upon favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that the (supposed dangerous) neighborhood of the Sun, and the rapid transit of the cele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The greatest defect that Colony can with consent complaine of, is their want of shipping, and the greatest with which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers finde themselves perplexed, is the want of industry to build them.

<pb facs="tcp:106657:41"/>

                  <p>I could cordially wish that there were such quantity of clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ground in <hi>Virginia,</hi> that every one at his first arrivall might fix upon the Plough, that the so much discoursed of Staples of Wheat and Rye, might be brought to an absolute ripenesse of perfection: But to imagine so many millions of trees of a facile removall, or that old Planters knowing the benefit thence arising, should part with them to others, and seeke new uncleared grounds for themselves, were meerely to dreame of impossibilities.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Vine, Almond,</hi> and <hi>Olive,</hi> may be set where the tree is onely barked about to hinder it from leaving; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides if there were a necessity to have absolutely cleared grounds, (which reason it selfe cannot imagine,) yet foure Acres of ground so cleared for the <hi>Vine,</hi> will returne (by much) more profit, and lesse trouble, then twenty Acres of Wheat, at such rates as they are prized in the common estimation.</p>
                  <p>But since this profit reverts to the Purse without the toyle of eradicating trees, as great emolument, as if the ground were altogether treelesse, to what purpose should we court sweat and affliction? or increase our miseries without any addition to our happinesse?</p>

                  <p>For transplantation there are infinite advantages both of well-growne and springing Mulberry trees, which may with much facility be removed, and with great felicity thrive upon such a removall, of which experience can afford frequent examples.</p>

No other distinction besides, the colour of the fruit discernes them one from the other, the Leaves of all three being of the same meane greatnesse of the same smooth feeling, the wood of the same internall yellownesse, almost as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But the silke taking his quality from the leafe make us lay aside the black Mulberry tree, since the bottomes from thence are too grosse and heavy, whereas the white Mulberry makes silke fine and light, to temper which many feed the Wormes with two sorts of meats by dictinction of times, <hi>viz.</hi> at the beginning with white leaves, that the silke may bee fine, in the closing, with black to fortifie it, and make it weigh: Yet this though it have an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of reason at the first inspection, rarely answers the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, the very alteration of the meate as from that which is more delicate, to that which is more grosse, being disagreable to the nature of the Worme, who must shew that diminution in the quality of his silkes which hee feeles in the impairing of his nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Let the bottomes, spread upon sheets be turned often, that the heate may destroy equally, no one excepted from this sharpe insolation; but this must not bee done with a rude hand, which instead of turning them may bruise the Worme, the slimy matter of whose body, being thus bruised, is very pr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Removing them therefore oftentimes during such sunning with a gentle hand, wrap them thus warmed in sheets, and let them lye in a fresh dry chamber.</p>
                     <p>But if the Sunne should faile, an Oven of such moderate heate as is usuall after two houres drawing the bread, or heated to such a degree of warmth (laying it over with boards, and the bottomes in sacks upon those boards, there remaining each time an houre and a halfe, repeating it till your experience by opening the most suspected bottome finde the inclosed Worme consumed) will bee of equall operation.</p>
                     <p>But that which is the best and least practised course is this: Take your bottomes, and fill such a Furnace or Copper as your Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers use, halfe full of Water: Within three fingers breadth of this boyling water, lay a lid or planke or board within the Copper, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through as thick with holes as a Cullender, and so fit to the side of the Furnace, that it by no meanes may sinke into the water: Upon this cover lay a thin Carpet of Darnix, or the like, and upon the Carpet the silke bottomes, which must bee often stirred, with care not to use too much violence.

                     <p>Surely this way of treading the Grape is derived from some ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenious man, who devised this stratagem under a pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediting the worke; but indeede to deter men from drinking that which is so uncomely prepared.

                     <p>THE Pomegranate tree, which may be planted either from the Branch or succour, is one of the most absolute encouragers of an idle person in the world; provided, it be exempt from the intemperate operation of the cold, neither the torrid heat of the Sun, nor the barrennesse of the Soyle, shal make him forgoe his glorious Rubies; no culture or dressing is required by it: yet if it be set in a rich soyle, it will be sure to make an advantage of it to his owne flourishing, and your profit: the wine thereof (for it affordeth Wine as wel as excellency of fruit) may be made after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take the ripe kernels, freed and cleansed from their skins, put them into the Presse, and exact the Wine, keep it in Vessels till it is fully fined from all working, which finished, distribute such a quantity if Oyle as may float over all the top of the Vessel, and this preserves it from sowring or corruption.</p>
                     <p>The Pomegranate apple put in a pot of new earth, well covered, and Luted with clay, and set into an Oven so long, till the Fruit may be resolved into powder, is of very Princely vertue; for (taking the weight of half a crown thereof in red Wine) it mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously stops the Bloudy flux. It is also good in divers diseases of women, which (because they are more arcanely peculiar to that Sex) I shal forbear to speak of.</p>

This heer is not altogether like those of Norway: for they make the piece of Timber approch the Sawes on certaine wheels with teeth; but because of reparations which those toothd wheeles are often subject unto, I will omit that use: and in stead thereof, put two weights, about 2. or 300. pound weight a piece, whereof one is marked A. the other B. The Cords wherewith the sayd weights doe hang, to be fastned at the end of the 2. peeces of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wood, which slide on two other peeces of fixed wood, by the meanes of certaine small pulleys, which should be within the house, and so the sayd weights should alwayes draw the sayd peeces of moving wood, which advancing alway towards the Sawes rising and falling, shall quickly be cut into 4. 5. or 6. peeces, as you shall please to put on Saws, and placed at what distance you will have for the thicknesse of the planks or bords ye will cut: and when a peece is cut, then let one with a Lever turne a Rowler, wherto shall be fastned a strong

Which once done, the ingenious Artist may easily convert the same to an Instrument of thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wheat, breaking of hempe or flax, and other as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable uses.</p>
