            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE came lately to my hands since I came to this place a Discourse stiled the <hi>Examination of Accademies,</hi> (which I herewith send you) It pretends to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Publick Schooles, and the promoting of all kind of science. I must confesse my selfe at first sight, very much pleased with the undertakeing, as being suitable to my owne frequent wishes, and what I conceived might with some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be hoped for in this inquisitive age. And therefore I came to the reading of it, with great expectations of finding somewhat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the noblenesse of the attempt.</p>
            <p>But I quickly discovered, that I was like to be much disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that hope, &amp; that besides a Torrent of affected insignificant tautologies with some peevish unworthy reflections, &amp; the repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some old &amp; trite cavills, together with severall bundles of grosse mistaks there was litle else to be expected from this Author.</p>
            <p>Two grand incapacityes for such a worke, he quickly discovers himselfe guilty of, that are not to be pardoned or excused in such an undertaker.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His ignorance of the present state of our Universityes which he pretends to reforme.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Ignorance in the common grounds of those Arts and Sciences which he undertakes to advance and promote. In both which respects he must needs fall under that censure of <hi>folly and shame,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 18.13.</note> which <hi>Solomon</hi> doth ascribe unto those that will venture to judge of a matter <hi>before they understand it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the present state of the Universityes. He supposes and takes it for granted, that they are so tyed up to the Dictates of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that whatsoeuer is taught either against or besides him by way of refutation or supply, they do by no meanes admit of, so much as to any consideration or debate, but are wholy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it.</p>
            <p>Which is so notoriously false, that I should very much wonder
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50857:3"/>
with what confidence he could suppose it, if I did not finde Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> likewise guilty of the same mistake. Whereas those that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d these places, do know that there is not to be wished a more generall liberty in point of judgment or debate, then what is here allowed. So that there is scarce any Hypothesis, which hath been formerly or lately entertained by Judicious men, and seemes to have in it any clearenesse or consistency, but hath here its stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Assertours, as the Atomicall and Magneticall in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the Copernican in Astronomy &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And though we do very much honour <hi>Aristotle</hi> for his profound judgment and universall learning, yet are we so farre from being tyed up to his opinions, that persons of all conditions amongst us take liberty to discent fom him, and to declare against him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as any contrary evidence doth ingage them, being ready to follow the Banner of truth by whomsoever it shall be lifted up.</p>
            <p>Witnesse the publick <hi>Lectures of our Professors,</hi> the Positions or Questions maintained in the <hi>publick Exercise of the Vniversitie</hi> for Degrees, &amp; in the <hi>private Exercises of Colledges,</hi> besides the <hi>Instructions and readings of many Tutors,</hi> wherein the principall things which this Author doth accuse us to be ignorant of, and enemies unto, are <hi>taught</hi> and owned, and I can assure him they are so well <hi>learnt,</hi> that for all his contempt of the Universityes, we have here many young boyes (who have not yet attained <hi>to that very proud &amp; vainglorious title of Bachelours of Art,</hi> (as he is pleased to phrase it) that are able to reforme this Reformer, in those things, wherein he thinks us all so ignorant, and himselfe so great a Master.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And for his ignorance in the common grounds of those things which he undertakes to advance and promote, his whole Discourse doth not so clearely prove any thing else, (not that which he intends by it,) as it doth prove this.</p>
            <p>Let any serious man but consider the two first Chapters of it, wherein he endeavours to prove, <hi>Vniversities are not in any kind usefull to fit men for the Ministry, but opposite thereunto,</hi> pag. 3. <hi>And that those Systems of Theology, which are therein taught are not only uselesse but hurtfull,</hi> pag. 10.</p>
            <p>One might reasonably expect that upon flinging out his Gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let for the defence of such positions as these, this Author should muster up his forces, and appeare at least with some seeming strength and reason. And yet he doth nothing lesse.</p>
            <p>His Arguments to this purpose being generally so triviall, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident, inconsequent, that we sh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld looke upon it as a signe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50857:3"/>
very great negligence or ignorance in many of our young Boyes, if they should debate matters in so impertinent and loose a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And I must observe by the way, how this Author doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in give sufficient warning what we are to expect from him in the <hi>Reforming of Logick,</hi> of the use of which he himselfe understands so little, that will teach a man how to <hi>define</hi> and <hi>distinguish,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>Consequences</hi> and <hi>Method,</hi> and by this meanes to speake <hi>clearely, strongly</hi> and <hi>plainly</hi>: To which he is altogether a stranger. Nor is it to be much wondered at, if he appeare an enemy to Syllogismes, (as he afterward professes) considering how wildly his own ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments would looke, if they were to be put into that dresse.</p>
            <p>He supposes in both these Chapters, that the Universities doe undertake to teach spirituall knowledge, and to furnish men with such gifts, as do only proceed from the Spirit of God. And this is the chiefe foundation that he doth erect his following heap of Arguments upon, then which nothing can be more groundlesse or false. There being no man, (that ever I heard of) who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or asserted any such thing. And I cannot think it any great presumption to believe that I understand the tenets of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity in this point as well as he. I am sure it hath been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion amongst them, that there are three kind of gifts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially requisite to compleat a man unto the Ministeriall functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Something to be infused by the Spirit of God, which must illuminate him to understand the misteries of the Gospell, and affect his heart with an experimentall savour, and acquaintance with those sacred truths wherein he is to instruct others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some naturall abilityes in respect of solidity of judgment, strength of memory, warmenes of affection, readinesse and volubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of speech, by which he may be rendered much more serviceable in that worke, then those that want these abilities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Something to be acquired by our own industry and the teaching others; Namely, a distinct and methodicall comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the severall subjects to be treated of, together with the meanes or advantages that helpe to facilitate the worke of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing others.</p>
            <p>In which respect it may be of singular use for a man to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the severall Scriptures and Reasons, that are more immediately pertinent to any particular head in Theologie, as concerning God, his Attributes, Workes: The fallen estate of man, the meanes of his restitution &amp;c. The dutyes of the Law and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50857:4"/>
Gospell together with many particular cases of Conscience which are incident to the various states and businesses of life.</p>
            <p>Concerning all which things, sure it can be no hinderance to a man (as this Author supposes) to have all the most materiall notions upon any subject, put together, cleared up and stated by the concurrent labours of many wise and good men, after much consideration and experience about them. And this is that Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, which the Universities do pretend to teach, and though it doth not exceed the sphere of those common gifts which meer naturall men are capeable of, yet is it of such singular use to enable a man to speake distinctly unto severall points, to confirme truth, to cleare up difficultyes, answer doubts and consequently to help in the worke of informing others. That I am not able to imagine any reason, why an eminent ability in <hi>this kind</hi> might not be sufficient to make a man capable of a civill degree, as well as skill in any other faculty.</p>
            <p>I am sure the preparatory studies required to the profession of Physick or Civill Law, are not more then for this Theology, nor is it lesse copious for its extent, or of lesse importance and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse for its end, then either of the other Faculties.</p>
            <p>Now unlesse this Author will say, that he who has grace, and is without these gifts, is better able to Teach, then he that hath both grace and these gifts too, he hath no reason to complaine of the uselesnesse and danger of Academicall education, in reference to the worke of the Ministry.</p>
            <p>Whereas he doth object that <hi>these common gifts are a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pride, confidence, boasting:</hi> That is meerely accidentall: So is health too, and liberty, and all other naturall or acquired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and he may upon as good grounds, hope to perswade men to love sicknesse and slavery, as to preferre Ignorance before that Knowledge of this kind that is to be learnt in the Universities; the best things that are (even Grace it selfe) may be accidentally hurtfull by the abuse of them, but that is no argument against their proper usefulnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Coloss. 2.8.</note>As for his objecting that place of the Apostle, where he bids to beware of Philosophy: If that prohibition be to be understood absolutely, and without limitation, why doth he here pretend so much to the knowledge of it himselfe, and to the Advancement of it in others? The same answer that he will make for his own vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, will serve for his Objection. But besides if he consider the place better, he will find the words to be, Beware least any <hi>man
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50857:4"/>
spoile you</hi> through Philosophy and vaine deceit. Where 'tis the abuse and not the use that is prohibited.</p>
            <p>I cannot passe over this subject without taking notice of the neare affinity betwixt his third and fourth Argument against schoole Theologie, <hi>pag.</hi> 14, 15. In one he quarrells with it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause tis drawn into a <hi>strict Logicall Method.</hi> And in the next, because <hi>tis a confused Chaos.</hi> Are they not judiciously put together? And is not the man very quarrellsome? That out of zeale to contradict his Adversaries, takes no care of contradicting himselfe.</p>
            <p>What a loose and wild kind of vapouring is that <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. about <hi>Cryptography,</hi> and the <hi>universall Character</hi> wherein he supposes the Universities to be wholly ignorant, <hi>none of them having so much as touched at these things. pag.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>But above all, the man doth give me the freest prospect of his depth and braine, in that canting Discourse about the language of nature, wherein he doth assent unto the highly illuminated fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the <hi>Rosycrucians</hi> In his large encomiums upon <hi>Iacob Behem,</hi> in that reverence which he professes to judiciall Astrologie, which may sufficiently convince what a kind of credulous fanatick Reformer he is like to prove.</p>
            <p>How wretchedly doth he abuse some ingenious opinions by his ignorant managing of them, particularly the copernican Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis; In the defence of which he urges such pittifull arguments as are enough to fright a serious man from the beliefe of it, &amp; to breed a prejudice against it in such as are that way inclined.</p>
            <p>It is enough to nauseate and make a man sick to peruse his crude and jejune Animadversions upon <hi>Logick, Mathematicks, Physickes, Metaphysickes,</hi> &amp;c. with the expedients or remedyes which he proposes, wherein he has abused some good Authors, by his ill managing the notions that they have suggested to him.</p>
            <p>I must needs confesse that at the first sight of this Book, I had a very great desire to know what the person was who had put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe forward to so noble an attempt, as reforming all Schooles, and advancing all Arts. But for that he doth in his Epistle at the beginning referre wholly to his Booke, whereby he saith he will discover himself <hi>as Hercules doth by his foot &amp; the Lion by his pawe.</hi> But if I were to judge of him by the impressions which he therein makes of his foote or pawe, I should not by that guesse him to be either a <hi>Hercules</hi> or a <hi>Lion,</hi> but some more weake and lesse generous Animal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50857:5"/>I have heard from very good hands that he is suspected to be a Friar, his conversation being much with men of that way, And the true designe of this Booke being very suitable to one of that profession, Besides that his superficiall and confused knowledge of things is much about that elevation.</p>
            <p>I should have been apt to have conjectured him to be some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure person, whose peevish malecontented humour had brought
him into the gang of the vulgar Levellers: Amongst whom his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to talke of some things out of the common road, hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to the reputation of being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, some extraordinary person; and by that meanes hath blowne him up to such a selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence, as to think himselfe fit to reforme the Universityes.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Sir</hi> have I given you my suddaine thoughts upon the cursory reading of this Examen. And though the Booke will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare unto all Judicious men but slight and contemptible, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may light into the hands of some weaker persons, who may be apt to take accusations for convictions: It would not be amisse if for their sakes some body would vouchfafe more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to examine this Examiner, and to disabuse such as may be seduced by him. It is part of that Scholastick imprudence, which men of our profession are subject unto, to sit downe and satisfie our selves in our owne knowledge of the weakenesse of such Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, without taking any paines to satisfie others, who are not so well able to judge.</p>
            <p>I shoud think that Mr <hi>Alex: Rosse</hi> might in some respects be very fit to enter the lists with this Champion. But I know not how farre he may at present be engaged in the Confutation of some better Booke. I am very sure <hi>Sir</hi> there are many of your acquaintance, who if their leisure and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would permit, are able to play with this <hi>Hercules,</hi> and I should think it a good recreation for some of their spare howers. And the hopes that you may be instrumentall for this is, the chiefe occasion that provoked me to trouble you with so large an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my present thoughts upon this subject.</p>
            <p>It may seem somewhat odde and strange to consider what seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinds of Adversaries have of late appeared against the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sityes. Mr <hi>Hobbs,</hi> Mr <hi>Dell,</hi> Mr <hi>Webster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of them being a person of good ability and solid parts, but otherwise highly magisteriall, and one that will be very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with all that do not presently submit to his dictates, And for advancing the reputation of his own skill, cares not what unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50857:5"/>
reflexions he casts on others. It were not amisse, if he were made acquainted, that for all his slighting of the Universityes, there are here many men, who have been very well versed in those noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Principles which he would be counted the inventer of, and that before his workes were published. And though he for his part may think it below him to acknowledge himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Mr <hi>Warners</hi> Manuscripts, yet those amongst us who haue seen and perused them must for many things give him the honour of precedency before Mr <hi>Hobbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other (as farre as his character may be pickt out of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) is an angry fanatick man, who wanting himselfe such Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall Learning as would become his relation, would needs perswade others against it, like the Ape in the Fable. But there is reason to hope that he may be shortly called to an account, and lay'd openby a person of eminent worth, whom he hath weakely provoked.</p>
            <p>The last is this worthy Author, who by a smattering and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall knowledge hath raised himselfe a repute amongst his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant followers. In the strength of which he comes forth to teach the Universities. I should have used him with much more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and respect, if it had not been very evident to me that it was not so much an ingenuous affection to the advancement of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as a froward and malicious prejudice against the Universities, that put him on to this worke.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF I should gaine no other fruit beside the pleasure of my gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving testimony to the service and respect I beare you, it were a reward exceedingly beyond the labour of the taske which you (by recommending) have imposed upon me. The advancement of Learning and the consideration of designes tending that way, are things exceedingly suitable to mydesires, these things have beene the argument of much discourse, which I have had the hapinesse to have with you. I must needs say that I should not more desire (next to the matters of the highest concernement) to meet with a Booke of any other argument, then such an one as should propose <hi>expedients for the perfecting and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all kinds of Science.</hi> And that is the undertaking of the Booke you are pleased to send me, (in the Title-Page of it) so that the pleasure you are pleased to give me in offering me under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of satisfying your desires that which is so suitable to my owne, takes off all consideration of labour in turning the times of my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to scribling, and yet leaves me the hopes of your Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as if I had taken paines, or done something in your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>I can easily conceive, that upon the ground which I have laid (of my delight in writings tending to the advancement of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.) I may raise a suspicion that out of compleasance to you I would diminish the service which herein I offer you. Seeing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of our earnest expectations in things we seriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, doth use to be unpleasant to us, and such a disappointment you have sufficiently fore warned me of in your Epistle. But I must professe I am farre from any such reach in Complement. <hi>Designes</hi> that way, do allwayes please me however managed, prouided it be not in the way of a dull and nauseous mediocrity. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Sir, impute this to some peculiary in my disposition. Yet I have observed in other men, that they have expressed as great a pleasure at the combate of <hi>Clinias</hi> and <hi>Dametas,</hi> as of <hi>Amphialus</hi> and <hi>Musidorus,</hi> and when <hi>Punteus</hi> was in towne, I saw the soberest of the spectatours as much affected at the imitations of the Zany, as at the Active, and (in their kind) admirable performances of the cheife Actor.</p>
            <p>There is an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy in that which is uncouth, aswell as in what is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50857:6"/>
handsome; and it is enough for me if any thing be excellent in its kind, and such I found (upon my slight perusall) to be the Booke you sent me, which to my Lord <hi>Bacons</hi> Advancement, and those which some others have designed, beares such proportion as I have intimated.</p>
            <p>It remaines therefore that I humbly thanke you for so farre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering my Genius, which allwayes inclining me to Idlenesse, you have found out a way to imploy my vacancyes with a just sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, such as doth arise rather from being slightly busied then not at all, rather from Trifling then perfect Idlenesse.</p>
            <p>In complyance therefore with your desire, I mean to runne over this reverend Authour, not staying upon his expressions, or making a toyle of a pleasure but briefely touching upon the things he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, taking no care either of my passions or expressions, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to reteine them within the compasse of civility.</p>
            <p>Those things which you have taken the paines to confute, I shall not so much as once recite, the remainder I shall carelesly and slightly (that is, in my apprehension most becomingly) speake to.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, you have given us a perfect character of him in your Epistle; but because some may conjecture that he knowes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, better then you know him (though in truth you are much a better judge of him then he is of himselfe:) I suppose it may not be unusefull to gather together that Character which he hath given of himselfe, that doing him no wrong, and forming a just <hi>Idea</hi> of him in the beginning of my Discourse, the Reader may be prepared for a due reception of that which followes.</p>
            <p>We may understand him by his stile (<hi>oratio indicat virum</hi>) and by his passions, wherein its hard for a man to dissemble.</p>
            <p>HE enters in feare &amp; proceedes in jelousies.<note place="margin">Epistle.</note> His first feare is (of affrighting the tender Scholars) least he should be looked on as some <hi>Goth or Vandall, Hunne or Scythian comming like a torrent from the Boreall mountaines of cold stupidity &amp;c.</hi> But for that his comfort is, that others cannot more <hi>Experimentally</hi> and <hi>Apodictically anatomize his Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocracy</hi> then himselfe, wherein besides the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of his elloquence, there is likewise a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of sence not fathomable by common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings; as how <hi>others</hi> should <hi>at all experimentally,</hi> or he <hi>himselfe</hi> should <hi>Apodictically anatomize</hi> his <hi>Idiocracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next is a doubtfull pang, least he should be charged with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much confidence, &amp; the proposall of fame for his Guerdon but here againe his bosome is his Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuary, I find him valiant (your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50857:7"/>
men are alwayes so) the sanctuary of his brest and a sentence of the <hi>Accedence</hi> are his retreat; &amp; this is his comfort a <hi>man is a man though he have but an hose on his head,</hi> and <hi>homo is a common name for all men.</hi> 'Tis to be hoped his Examen may be favourable to the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, who is thus beholding to the Accedence; Yet some men think he could not want an high degree of confidence that should expect fame from compiling such a worke as this.</p>
            <p>His next encounter is against the suspition of Avarice, as if he would ruine Universities to share in the spoile. But this he doth sufficiently confute by an Argument of such a weighty conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as I hope no man will be so uncivill as to deny. For he is <hi>no Deane nor Master President, nor Provost, Fellow, nor Pensioner,</hi> and least any man should suspect him to be of another order which he hath omitted <hi>viz.</hi> a Scholler; he gives assurance to the contrary by that new ellegance which he hath added to an old verse,
<q>
                  <l>Qui cadit in terram non habet unde cadat.</l>
               </q>
Which he hath reformed it into nonsence: Indeed although we hope that none could suspect him of any such interst; Yet all those Parties ought to thank him for his care in giving the world this satisfaction.</p>
            <p>By this time he supposes the drousy world awakened by the sound of his thundering stile (and by the Proclamation of his hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icall designes) to enquire into the Origine and Education of him that dares censure (and defy all the Universityes in the universe Though he might chose to answer; he won't be Cinicall but say, <hi>That Hercules is eastly known by his foot, and the Lyon by his paw,</hi> his Treatise shall shew that he is a <hi>free borne Englishman</hi> (of the house of the <hi>Websters</hi>) <hi>and thats enough for modest inquirers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now one would think this Herculean Lyon should be no more afraid, but againe behold he trembles, least some should think his Treatise to be like <hi>Plato's Republick</hi>: S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Mores Vtopia,</hi> or the <hi>Ld. Bacons new Atlantis.</hi> But if they should do so, they were surely much to blame, and 'twere an unpardonable errour, I should be very glad to rid him from this feare, but I consider it is the destiny of such <hi>Heroes,</hi> borne for reformers of the world, to be men of working fancies, subject to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y feares &amp; trances. His predecessor in the Military way (the famous <hi>Hero</hi> of the <hi>Mancha</hi> mistooke a windmill for an inchanted Castle, and this man (man did I say, this <hi>Hero</hi>) lyes under the same delusion, relieve him I cannot, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him I must,

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50857:7"/>He hath a petty scruple yet remaining, least he may possibly be charged with an infirmity of pilfering or nimming: But <hi>he can say, with Macrobius, Omne meum, Nihil meum,</hi> the Treatise is of his own invention (he found it in <hi>Helmont, Verulam, Gassendus,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) he hath indeed taken some <hi>hints</hi> to the mountenance of three quarters of the Treatise, but he <hi>took them from strong men, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the steely instruments of Demonstration &amp;c.</hi> and no man can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him of <hi>singularity,</hi> whilest Noble Heroes beare him <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have you Sir, a character of this Noble Reformer, given us liberally by himselfe, he would not calumniate the Academies, (but censure the <hi>corruptions</hi> of the present <hi>Generation</hi>) he professes he hath <hi>not done all he could,</hi> so that if he faile, we must blame his <hi>weaknesse</hi> not his <hi>Will</hi>; where by the way, observe the consequence of his reformed Logick, he could have done more if he would, and yet we must blame his <hi>weaknesse</hi> not his <hi>will.</hi>

               <p>The first part of his undertaking, I shall not stand much upon, because the good man ha's hinted at some others worthy of more consideration, the good man (for I feare I offend when I call him Master <hi>Webster,</hi> because of <hi>pag.</hi> 11.) is offended that knowledge should be divided into Speculative and Practicall: <hi>Naturall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy hath for its object, Corpus Naturale mobile, and the end is not Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so its practicall. Mathematicks hath taught men to build houses, &amp;c. therefore that is Practicall, and the Schooles would have them Speculative.</hi> A sad thing, and worthy the Animadversion of this great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former.</p>
               <p>Now if the Schooles should answer, that the end of these Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may be practised, and yet they may be speculative, I know not what he would reply. I am much given to observe the course of his ratiocination, which alwaies ends in Mystery. See then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50857:9"/>
how he proceeds for Naturall Philosophy: This cannot be Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, for the end of it is more sublime then to rest in Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Well, whats the end? to behold <hi>the eternall power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> that's, <hi>speculation</hi>: but farther, to be drawne to worship him, thats indeed practise; But lastly, to worship him, that we may come to the vision of him, that's Speculation; the end therefore of it may be Speculation, and so the Schooles escape a whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
               <p>For what he saies concerning the Mathematicks, as you know S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> it cannot choose but move mee, they have bin so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etime accounted my Mistresse, and Jealousy must work when I find another courting her, and that so passionately that he falls into an Extasy: (<hi>O sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, transcendent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>beautifull, and most Noble Mistresse</hi> (quoth he) <hi>who would not be enamoured on thy Seraphick pulchritude &amp;c.</hi>) But making my approach to him, I find him at his distance, praying (like some moping Friar to the Lady of <hi>Lauretto,</hi> or like) the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of the Queene of Faery, and uttering a speech to her, made by <hi>Iohn Dee</hi> in his Preface, enough to satisfy mee, that she is yet pure and untouched by him, and hath not entertained him into any familiarity.</p>
               <p>Seriously Sir, had he read the Book as well as the Preface, nay had he understood but the two first Propositions, he would have perceived, how Theorems doe serve in order to Problemes, and practise may be the end of contemplation, and so againe the Schooles might have escaped him.</p>
               <p>Well! but see <hi>him</hi> divide now the Arts and Sciences, behold him coming to it with his cleaver, or rather with his Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culean beetle endeavouring to split them in three peeces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The first are those that though they seeme to conferre some knowledge, yet they doe it in order to a farther end, and so are instrumentall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this part, according to this Author, ought to comprehend all Arts and Sciences, and so the block of Sciences, hath escaped the wedge, though it hath felt the Beetle-head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Those which conferre knowledge of themselves, and are not instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to others, as Naturall Philosophy, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Beetle rebounds, and gives himselfe a blow, for <hi>can the science of Naturall things, whose subject is Corpus Naturale mobile,</hi> p. 18. <hi>chuse but be subordinate and instrumentall to the discovery of God, and the preservation of health?</hi> p. 18.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The third sort are those, which though they conferre some knowledge, and have some peculiar uses, so they seeme necessary as ornamentall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50857:10"/>We see the blow the Beetle gave him, hath wholly bereft him of his sence, a sad example upon a man, that not contented with the old, would set himselfe to make amongst us new divisions.</p>
               <p>Well may he loose his senses, but he will never loose his met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he no sooner awakes out of his trance, but biting his tongue by chance, upon that occasion he falls upon the thought of Tongues and Languages. Wherefore woe be to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Knowledge of tongues beareth a great noise in the world</hi> (and is it not strange that tongues should keep such a noise?) <hi>and yet there is not much profit by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The profit that is by tongues is only</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>To understand one another.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>To make forreigne negotiations and to traffick</hi>

                  <hi>and therefore 'tis not worth the while to learne them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Argument is somewhat mysticall, I shall endeavour a little to unfold the mystery; All good things relate only to the body or mind, and the lives of men are divided into these foure kinds

               <p>Riches or pleasure carry the greatest sway, and those are carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in the world by Negotiations and Traffick, these administer to every Nation whatever is the peculiar advantage of any one, &amp; furnishes them all with Gold &amp; Silver, &amp;c. which men have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to make the common measure of riches, and with all things conducing to health and pleasure. Now there is no <hi>traffick</hi> without the use of Languages, <hi>therefore there is not much profit in them.</hi> Well these are commonly counted good things, but our <hi>Zeletique</hi> or <hi>Sceptick</hi> may be in that a <hi>Stoick,</hi> these are <hi>commoda</hi> not <hi>bona,</hi> things that are good and profitable are the goods of the mind, and those are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by making use of the Discourse and writings of men of all Ages and Nations, and that is not to be done without skill in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, <hi>So that againe there is but little profit by them.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>But if Languages were worth the while to learne, yet the way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them</hi> (by Grammar &amp;c.) <hi>is not the best.</hi> Either the way must be by Grammar, or by Exercise in Colloquy, if the latter it must

               <p>First for the Learned languages, Latin, Greeke, Hebrew and the rest of that ranke, whether shall a man travell to converse with such as will speake to him in those tongues: as for other tongues, as French, Italian, Spanish &amp;c. his advice will be to travell into those Nations. But if any man make it his businesse to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them all, he must either hire men of all sorts to be with him as Conversers, or must apply himselfe to all, (travelling till he meet with them) so that the result will be that instead of some daies in his study, a man spends many years in travell or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and all for saving the expence of time and charges.</p>
               <p>The way of Conversation, makes men <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>confident,</hi> but that alone will never make them <hi>accurate,</hi> an instance whereof we have, in that none that have no skill in Grammar, can ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us (though they speake excellently) attaine the true wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our English Tongue, and though many have come to be knowing men, as to the substance, and vastly read, yet I never knew an accurate man, fit to write or speake in any learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, who neglected the Grammar of it.</p>
               <p>This I thought proper enough for an Academicall man to take notice of: as for his exceptions to the Grammar, as being void of <hi>Evidentiall perspicuity,</hi> and not coapted to the tender capacities of young years &amp;c. I leave them to the Schooles of the lower forme to answer. The man supposes that Universities, like to the <hi>Scholae Illustres</hi> of the Jesuites, teach the Latine Grammar, and to goe through even the lowest elements of learning: but you know Sir, that it is neither usuall nor lawfull to teach the Latine Grammar in the Universities.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stat. Cant.</hi>
                  </note> If this man have ever seene any Universities, they have been the Romish Schooles and Academies, to whose ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the Learning which he discovers, and the reformation he proposes, are (to use his excellent phrase) <hi>coapted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in truth I am extreamly ravished at the defects he finds in Grammar, and his proposalls for its advancement, how sweetly and congruously hath he drawn in to the reliefe and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grammar and Language, those things which mortall men intended to set in opposition to them. It is reported of Friar <hi>Bacon,</hi> that <hi>time was</hi> when by the strength of Alchymy he made a Brazen head to speake <hi>Time is</hi> &amp;c. but how farre hath our Friar exceeded him, who taking of <hi>Hieroglyphicks, Emblemes, Symbols,</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50857:11"/>
                  <hi>Cryptography,</hi> and according to his capacity, hath extracted out of silence, an advance of Eloquence, and from dumb signes a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. Sir, I doe not deny that the consideration of these things may very well accompany the consideration of Grammar, and the defects in these kinds may be spoken of very methodically, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th the defects of Grammar, they being all conversant (though in waies as absolutely different as the eare is from the ey) about signification, and generally referring to it: but to make them all one, or parts of each other, amounts to no lesse then a great want of consideration.</p>
               <p>It is a thing to be acknowledged by all considering men, that knowledge is conveighed by signification of our notions to one another, that signes may be made (by institution of men) in any way which doth admit of a sufficient variety, and that knowledge may be communicated, as well by the eye as by the eare, but to say that by introducing that way, either Grammar or Languages should be advanced, it were as mysticall as to affirme, that the day light is advanced by the coming of the night, or that he would kill a man for his preservation.</p>
               <p>To discourse concerning <hi>Hieroglyphicall</hi> (or <hi>Emblematicall</hi>) and <hi>Cryptographicall</hi> Learning, is as <hi>needlesse,</hi> to men that know any thing, as <hi>uselesse</hi> to M <hi>Webster,</hi> who out of the abundance of his ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, confesses the <hi>Cryptographicall</hi> Bookes of <hi>Porta, Agrippa, Trit<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Hierogliphicks</hi> and <hi>Cryptography,</hi> were invented for <hi>concealement</hi> of things, and used either in mysteries of Religion which were <hi>infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> or in the exigences af Warre, or in occa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ions of the deepest secresy, (such as those of Love, which is not to be owned, or of the great Elix<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, and the like) and Grammar is one of those Arts and Language one of those helps, which serve for <hi>explication</hi> of our minds and notions: How incongruous then is it, that the Art of <hi>Concealement,</hi> should not be made a part of the Art of <hi>Illustration</hi>; surely it would make much to the advancement of Children while they are learning the Elements of Grammar, to be put upon the

               </p>
               <p>But he hath extreamely disobliged whosoever have been Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Symbolicall way, either in Mathematicks, Philosophy, or Oratory, to bring them under the <hi>ferula,</hi> and make those who have exempted themselves from the encombrances of words to be brought <hi>post liminio,</hi> into the Grammar Schoole, it was little thought by <hi>Vieta,</hi> M. <hi>Oughtred,</hi> or <hi>Herrigon,</hi> that their designation of quantities by Species, or of the severall waies of managing them by <hi>Symbols</hi> (whereby we are enabled to behold, as it were, with our eyes, that long continued series of mixt and intricate <hi>Ratiocination,</hi> which would confound the strongest fancy to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine it, and are with ease let in to the Abstruseft, and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed depths, wherein the contemplation of quantity is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) should ever have met so slight a considerer of them, as should bring them under Grammar. It is very well known to the youth of the University, that the avoiding of confusion or perturbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fancy made by words, or preventing the los of sight of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reason of things, by the disguise of particular nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, having passed through severall formes of operation, was the end and motive of inventing Mathematicall Symbols, so that it was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe perfectly intended against Language and its servant Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and that carried on so farre, as to oppose the use of <hi>numbers</hi> themselves, which by the Learned, are stiled <hi>Lingua Mathematicorum,</hi> with whom <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and <hi>numero inexplicabile</hi> are equipollent: But Mr W. makes me wild to follow him in his mysteries.</p>
               <p>The use of Symbols is not confined to the Mathematicks only; but hath been applied to the <hi>nature of things,</hi> by the Pythagorean Philosophers, and diverse of the Cabalists, and to the <hi>Art of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> by diverse both Jewes and others: and this Symbolicall art is that <hi>Ars Combinatoria,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which <hi>Picus Mirandula</hi> &amp; others, make such large undertakings. The Pythagoreans did make Symbols of numbers, designing <hi>(ex Arbitrio)</hi> the parts of nature (as the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme mind, the first matter &amp;c.) by them, an instance whereof is <hi>Platos, Timeus</hi>; the Combinatorian Jews (<hi>viz.</hi> the Author of <hi>Iezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> and others) and from them <hi>I. Picus: Schalichius Lully,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have made Symbols of the Letters of the Alphabet, so that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>For this effect is that which is pretended to by the <hi>Vniversall Character,</hi> about which he smatters so deliciously <hi>viz.</hi> To take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from every Nation the necessity of Learning any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side their mother tongue (which no Nation is taught by the rules of Grammar) by designing all <hi>things</hi> &amp; <hi>notions</hi> by certaine common signes which may be intelligible by all alike though diversly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible (as our numerall notes, the notes of the 12 Signes &amp;c.) You see Sir how methodicall the man is by bringing this under Grammar, however I shall take this hint to speake a little freely concerning this Argument.</p>
               <p>Sir when I first fell from that verbose way of tradition of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> used by the Ancients, and of late by almost all (such as <hi>Clavius</hi> and the like) who have written huge Volumes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular subjects; into the Symbolicall way, invented by <hi>Vieta,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by <hi>Harriot,</hi> perfected by Mr <hi>Oughtred,</hi> and <hi>Des Cartes</hi>: I was presently extreamly taken with it, finding by this meanes, that not only the substance of those vast Volumes might be brought into the compasse of a sheet or two, but that the things thus reduced were more comprehensible and mannageable; the labour of the braine much taken off, and a way layd open (by the various com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons and applications of quantities) for invention and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of infinite propositions with more ease then before we could vnderstand those which others had invented for us. And I was put upon an eranest desire, that the same course might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in other things (the affections of quantity, the object of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50857:12"/>
                  <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> seeming to be an Argument too slender to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse this benefit.) My first proposall was to find whether other things might not as well be designed by Symbols, and herein I was presently resolved that Symboles might be found for every <hi>thing</hi> and <hi>notion,</hi> (I having found the variety of many millons of signes in a square of a quarter of an Inch.) So that an Universall Character might easily be made wherein all Nations might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate together, just as they do in numbers and in species. And to effect this, is indeed the designe of such as hitherto have done any thing concerning an Universall Character. And the thing thus proposed is feasible, but the number of severall Characters will be almost infinite (at left as great as the number of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive words in the most copious tongues and the learning of them either impossible or very difficult. Of this kind I have seen severall <hi>Essayes,</hi> one in Print, another in Manuscript shewed to K. <hi>Charles</hi> (containing the first Book of <hi>Homers Iliads</hi> done into Characters,) but in truth such as would never be received, or if they should, would give us no other benefit, besides a communication without language (which is that which is spoken of the <hi>China</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.)</p>
               <p>So that the tradition of Learning, or faciliation of it would be but little advanced by this meanes. But it did pesently occurre to me, that by the helpe of Logick and Mathematiticks this might soone receive a mighty advantage, for all Discourses being resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in sentences, those into words, words signifying either simple notions or being resolvible into simple notions, it is manifest, that if all the sorts of simple notions be found out, and have Symboles assigned to them, those will be extreamly few in respect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (which are indeed Characters of words, such as <hi>Tullius Tiro's</hi>) the reason of their composition easily known, and the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ones at once will be comprehended, and yet will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the very eye all the elements of their composition, &amp; so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the natures of things: and exact discources may be made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively without any other paines then is used in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of specious Analytics.</p>
               <p>And to such a character as this, there is but one thing more desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which is to make it effable, because it is a dul thing to discourse by pointing &amp; indication: and as to this there is thus much obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that if the first &amp; most simple things &amp; notions are so few as is the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of consonants, &amp; the modall variations so few as may be expressed by Vowels and Diphthongs, this also may be done with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50857:13"/>
great ease and clearenesse, otherwise not without admitting Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monymies and Synonimies into that language. And here also, a successe hath been found much beyond expectation, <hi>viz.</hi> that the characters before described may be utterable, and the names be made up of the definitions of things, or a complexion of all those notions, whereof a Complexe is compounded, every simple noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being expressed by one syllable, and the most complexe notion, consisting of as many syllables, as it doth of simple elementall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This designe if perfected, would be of very great concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the advancement of Learning, and I know one in this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity, who hath attempted some thing this way, &amp; undertaks as farre as the tradition of <hi>reall Learning,</hi> by which I understand the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>Naturall Philosophy,</hi> and the grounds of <hi>Physick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However M. <hi>Webster</hi> will be brought by this, to acknowledge that these things are considered in the Universities, and that they only are not dry, whilest he and his friends are madid.</p>
               <p>Such a Language as this (where every word were a definition and contain'd the nature of the thing) might not unjustly be termed a naturall Language, and would afford that which the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balists</hi> and <hi>Rosycrucians</hi> have vainely sought for in the Hebrew, And in the names of things assigned by <hi>Adam,</hi> which M. <hi>Webster,</hi> passing the bounds of sence and reason, would bring under the Laws and regulation of <hi>Donatus,</hi> although as he <hi>concludes</hi> most Grammatically, <hi>C. ult.</hi> it be not <hi>Acquisitive</hi> but <hi>Dative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, familiarity with M. <hi>Webster</hi> makes me bold with him, and that hath encouraged me, to deny that ever there was any such Language of Nature, and to offer him this Demonstration.</p>
               <p>The Paradisicall Protoplast, being Characteristically bound to the Ideal Matrix of Magicall contrition, by the Symphoniacall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaking of <hi>Aleph tenebrosum,</hi> and limited by <hi>Shem hamphorash</hi> to the centrall Idees, in-blowne by the ten numerations of <hi>Belimah,</hi> which are ten and not nine, ten and not eleaven; and consequently being altogether absorpt in decyphering the signatures of <hi>Ensoph,</hi> beyond the sagacity of either a Peritrochiall, or an Isoperime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall expansion. The lynges of the faetiferous elocution, being disposed only to introversion, was destitute at that time of all Peristalticall effluxion, which silenced the Otacousticall tone of of the outflying word, and suppressed it in singultient irructations. But where the formes are thus enveloped in a reluctancy to <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoniacall</hi> Symbols, and the <hi>Phantasmaticall</hi> effluviums checked by the tergiversation of the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> from its due subserviency to that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50857:13"/>
concord and harmony which ought to have been betwixt lapsed man and his fellow strings, each diatesseron being failed of its diapente necessary to make up a Diapason no perfect tone could follow. And consequently this Language of nature must needs be impossible.</p>
               <p>I am apt to suspect that this demonstration may to some seeme somewhat obscure, but I am very sure that if Mr <hi>Webster</hi> doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what he hath transcribed upon this subject it must have to him (to use his own phrase) <hi>an evidentiall perspicuity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having demonstrated what I undertooke, I make an end of this Chapter, and proceed to comment upon your text, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that which followes.</p>

If the man had intended to speak to our Capacityes, he should have first examined what Logick is usually taught in Universities &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted against it; now he hath roved at all and some interchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, accordingly as the fortune of his Collectors hath enabled him, speaking first against the Boyes, for hissing, then against Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, then against Definition, then against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> then against Definition &amp;c. And after that against <hi>Aristotle</hi> and Syllogizing: you see Sir the generosity of this man he will not make use of Logick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it selfe, and you will think me ridiculous in answering to his Allegation (the University being wholy inconcerned,) but ile be exceeding briefe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Systeme of rules directing us to the knowledge of the truth begets no intestine warre no humming, hissing, nor <hi>obfusca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50857:14"/>2. The use of Induction is taught in the University as well as the use of Syllogisme; Logick is universally subservient to the enquiry of all truths; Induction is ridiculously applyed to Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall truths, and Syllogisme is to be applyed to Physicks; it was a misfortune to the world, that my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> was not skilled in Mathematicks, which made him jealous of their Assistance in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Enquiries; when the operations of nature shall be followed up to their Staticall (and Mechanicall) causes, the use of Induction will cease, and Sylogisme succeed in the place of it, in the interim we are to desire that men have patience not to lay aside Induction before they have reason.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Logick doth teach certaine rules of Abstracting notions <hi>viz</hi> by examining the Agreements and disagreements (which they call the Genus and Difference) of things, and if our notions of things have been rashly abstracted, the fault hath been either in the obscurity of nature, or in the dullnesse or impatience of Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers &amp; not in the Logick of the Academies. The notions of things being rightly abstracted they are rightly assigned to words by Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The questions concerning the entity of Logicall notions, and other Physicall and Metaphysicall things, are not (to my Knowledge) mingled with the tradition of Logick, (otherwise then to afford examples to the Rules of it) so that this complaint may concerne others, but not our Universities.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Aristotles Organon</hi> is not read to the youth of this Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (how justly I contend not) neither was it ever understood, or ever will be by M. <hi>Webster,</hi> then why should we fall out about it?</p>
               <p n="6">6. 1. It is a prodigious Ignorance in <hi>Helmont</hi> (from whom M. <hi>Webster</hi> without regard to common honesty, hath taken what ensues) to think there are no other, or scarce any differences known, beside Rationall and Irrationall: This is frequently met withall in the vulgar Systems of Logick as an example, and he thought no more was knowne: without regard to all demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mathematicall knowledge: but he could not speake of things he understood not; why then should the blind lead the blind?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Something he would have spoken against Division, but he had it not about him; so we can only thanke him for his good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in that particular.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Exceptions against <hi>Syllogizing</hi> (I meane his new supply out of <hi>Helmont</hi> are these.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Conclusions doe not necessarily compell Assent. <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50857:15"/>
M. <hi>Webster</hi> is one who can grant the premises in a true Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, and yet deny the conclusion. I Answere this is by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall gift.</p>
               <p n="2">2 His Second exception, I say, that the eduction of a third Proposition, or truth from two that were known before, is a teaching of what we knew not, otherwise no man living need to study for any Demonstrative Knowledge: tis possible M. <hi>Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> may know that <hi>totum est majus sua parte,</hi> and the other Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms in <hi>Euclid,</hi> yet I dare say, he understands not, that in a Rectangled Triangle, the square of the Hypothenuse, is equall to the conjoyned squares of the other sides, much lesse any of the Propositions concerning the Regular Bodies, or Conic Sections.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And whereas he saies, that Syllogisticall conclusions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>but bare opination</hi>; we ought to pardon him, <hi>Helmont</hi> told him so, and he knew not that there was such a thing as <hi>Syllogismus Demonstrativus,</hi> and what would you have of a Cat? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But though he have despised these waies, he will give an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent account of the Art of <hi>Lully,</hi> and indeed his description ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues him a man of profound search into the things he deales with: it is he saith, <hi>An Alphabeticall way for Syllogizing</hi>: a description sunke many fathoms beyond the profundity of truth or sence, and if there be any sence assigneable to this description, it will amount to such a Definition of Geometry as this, <hi>It is an Art of Knowing something by the helpe of Letters, Syllables, Words, and Figures</hi>: a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of grievous skil and judgement to discover Sir I need not own my conversation in that Art of <hi>Lully</hi>: yet I meet with few that have considered much more of it then my selfe, and this I undertake to be accountable for to M. <hi>Webster,</hi> that neither that, nor Logick are unusefull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet that Logick conduces more to the invention, and search, and strict examination of Truth, and that other more to the invention of Arguments for discourse: the one more appropriate to <hi>Logicall,</hi> (as 'tis called) the other to <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> or <hi>Poeticall</hi> invention; the one is a very good way for begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the other extreamely usefull to men that have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the knowledge of things, to fetch the notions of things with ease and celerity in their view; and fit men for secure and ready speaking. I have now done with his Chapter of <hi>Logick</hi> and come to that concerning <hi>Mathematicks.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What then doth this man meane, to say the Schooles (as he termes them) have not advanced these sciences; dos he expect that the Colledge buildings, or S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Thomas Bodlyes</hi> frame should do it? Indeed they will do it as soone as he. But I forget my selfe, the summe of his complaints is this.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That Arithmetick and Geometry are neglected, the Schooles content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with verball disputes of magnitude, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>That the Astronomy Schooles teach according to the Ptolemaick System,
which they maintaine with Rigour.</hi> And against this his spirit runs out
in very many Arguments.</item>
                  <item>5. <hi>They are ignorant of the other parts, as Geography, Hydrography,
Chorography, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. <hi>They doe not professe the divine Art or Science of Astrology.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. Somewhat he would say of <hi>Staticks, Architecture, Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matithmy,

               </list>
               <p>Concerning these, I shall speake as briefely as is possible.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi> are sincerely &amp; profoundly taught, Analyticall Algebra, the Solution and Application of Aequati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, containing the whole mystery of both those sciences, being faithfully expounded in the Schooles by the professor of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, and in many severall Colledges by particular Tutors, and were he an Idoneous Auditor, I undertake he should receive full satisfaction here in that particular, however I will be bound he shall be wrought upon (as he expresses it else-where) even to <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>amazement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His next complaint is, that the <hi>Opticks</hi> are neglected, (I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

say what they are generally, but this I know, that there have
been lately given by some persons here instances of more solid knowledge of all sorts of radiation or vision, then ever were here, or indeed elsewhere before, and that such things are ordinary now amongst us (done by some amongst our selves) as heretofore were counted Magicall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Theory of <hi>Musick</hi> is not neglected, indeed the Musick meeting, by the Statutes of this University, appointed to be once a weeke, hath not of late been observed, our Instruments having been lately out of tune, and our harpes hanged up, but if such men as he should please to come among us, and put us to an examen, without doubt we should then have a fit of Mirth &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But of all things the <hi>Astronomy</hi> Schooles he is most offended at, as maintaining with Rigour the <hi>Ptolemaick System</hi>: And against this he disputes with Arguments able to turne a <hi>Copernican</hi> into a <hi>Ptolemaick:</hi> the thing, as to our University, you know to be most false; I believe there is not one man here, who is so farre Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall, as to be able to calculate an Eclipse, who hath not received the <hi>Copernican System,</hi> (as it was left by him, or as improved by <hi>Kepler, Bullialdus,</hi> our own Professor, and others of the <hi>Ellipticall</hi> way) either as an opinion, or at leastwise, as the most intelligible, and most convenient Hypothesis. For my selfe, you know well my principles of Phylosophy and Astronomy, and how little this whole Pamphlet concernes me, yet in defence of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> this may be said with justice, that there is no Astronomicall Book in the World, which may not be better spared then his <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50857:17"/>The Method here observed in our Schooles is, first to exhibit the
<hi>Phenomena,</hi> and shew the way of their observation, then to give an
account of the various Hypotheses, how those Phenomena have been salved, or may be (where the Aequipollency or defects of the severall Hyppotheses are shewn.) And lastly to shew how the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall Hypotheses are resolvible into tables, serving for calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Ephemerides, which are of quotidian use, and if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Webster</hi> have any thing to amend in this method, and will afford it our
Professor, I will undertake he will be thankfull for it.</p>
               <p>The puerility of his Arguments your selfe have noted, they are sacred I will not name them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is not faire to say we are ignorant of <hi>Cosmography,</hi> unlesse he had tried us, indeed, if we be so, I know some must answer for it, Sir <hi>Henry Savile</hi> hath laid it upon one of his Professors to Read publickly after the body of Astronomy, these Arts he mentions, and if he be ignorant of them, let M. <hi>Webster</hi> informe against him, and take his Profession, winne it and weare it. You will give me leave Sir, to publish in our vindication, what your selfe and I know to be true. These Arts he mentions, are not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and taught here, but have lately received reall and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable advances (I meane since the Universities came into those hands wherein now it is) particularly Arithmetick, and Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in the promotion of the Doctrine of <hi>Indivisibilia,</hi> and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the naturall rise and mannagement of Conic Sections and other solid places. Opticks and Perspective, by various inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and applications on Gnomonicks and picture Astronomy in polishing, and indeed perfecting the Ellipticall hypothesis, and
rendring it Geometricall; and surely if we may still enjoy the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of the Higher Powers, we may hope in a little time, to give a good account of our selves, as to these particulars.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the mischiefe is, we are not given to <hi>Astrology,</hi> a sad thing, that men will not forsake the study of Arts and Languages, and give themselves up to this high and Noble Art or Science, he knowes not what to call it: Nay call it that ridiculous cheat, made up of nonsence and contradictions, founded only upon the dishonesty of Impostors, and the frivolous curiosity of silly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so as none but one initiated in the Academy of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> would require of us, that we should be Philosophers and Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and yet not to have outgrowne this gullery. I speake not to him (for he understands as much of Astrology as of other things) but to those he so highly adores (for one of whom <hi>viz.</hi> Mr <hi>Ashmole,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:50857:17"/>
I have a very good respect) I make this proffer, that if they can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert either upon the grounds of reason, or constant experiment, any one rule of Judiciall Astrology, nay if they can maintaine, that the very foundations of them, are not frivolously and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously laid and retained, I shall joyne with Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in desiring that the <hi>Thundering Pulpit men,</hi> may submit to the Blundering Hell-pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and that <hi>Divinity</hi> (he will let me use that word rather then loose a Conunrim) may give way to <hi>Divination.</hi> The pretence of Astrology is to divine by the Syzyges of the Planets. The Planets are considered, as they respect either (1) the 12 houses, or (2) the signes of the Zodiac, or (3) one another, or (4) according to their site and native powers.</p>
               <p>Against them I assert, that their Houses have no foundation, for whereas there are three waies of assigning them, either by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Ecliptick, the first verticall or the Aequinoctiall into 12 equall parts, they have forsaken the two former, and called the last the rationall way (as condemning the two former of irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality) yet this rationall way serves but for some parts of the sphere, and those that live under a right or parallel sphere (if any doe) must be deprived of the benefit of Astrology, because in a right sphere they are confounded, and in a parallel there are no houses.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In relation to the signes of the Zodiac, the Planets are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have their Exaltations or Diminutions, and here they discover a most profound stupidity: about the time when this folly took place, the Apogees and Perigees of the severall Planets being by Astronomers determined to be in certaine places of the Zodiac: this exaltation or depression, in respect of distance, they Coxcomically have understood in respect to their virtue, and though their Apogees be changed, they still retaine in those very places their Exaltations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their number of Aspects is Arbitrary, and there may as well be made 600 as 6. and granting there were any reason or ground for their good or bad signification, they must signify to one another, not to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, the vertues of the Planets themselves, that they are hot and cold, male and female &amp;c. is ridiculously founded; who ever felt the heat of <hi>Mars,</hi> or cold of <hi>Saturne?</hi> The whole Theory is formed with respect to the Peripateticall System, the conceit of the foure Elements, and if they should be granted, conduce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the fortune-telling which they professe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:50857:18"/>I have but touched these things, yet so as I have strook at the
root of their whole imposture, and if they can satisfy in these things, I will be their Proselite.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Seeing Mr <hi>Webster</hi> had nothing to say of <hi>Staticks, Architecture, Pnemaththmy,</hi> &amp;c. I only shall say that all or most, have received some improvement in this place, as we shall make appeare when he makes his visitation.</p>

               <head>CAP. VI.
Of Scholastick Phylosophy.</head>
               <p>THis Chapter of his consists of two parts, an affirmative and a Negative; the first concernes the way of Phylosophy, which he saith is professed in the Schooles <hi>viz.</hi> The Aristotelicall way: in the other he would exhibit the <hi>Desiderata,</hi> those things whereof the Universities are ignorant.</p>
               <p>He disputes against the Aristotelicall Philolophy in more then twenty whole pages of this Chapter, but his dispute is interrupted by the <hi>Desiderata:</hi> for from <hi>pag.</hi> 53. to 67. <hi>inclusivè,</hi> he is Ant-Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoticall; thence to the 78. <hi>p.</hi> come in his other exceptions, and from the 78. <hi>page</hi> to 83.

               <p>You know Sir, how little either I my selfe, or our Universities, are concerned to interesse our selves in this quarrell, considering the liberty that is here allowed and taken, this Discourse may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps concern <hi>Collegium Conimbricense</hi> or some forraign Universities, and let them Answer it.</p>
               <p>Yet I must confesse I wondered at this chap. both at the learning, the Inequality, and the method of it; I presently found some things in it to exceed the Genius of our Reformer, and some things well becomming him both in respect of his Learning, Method, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity.</p>
               <p>Concerning his <hi>Desiderata</hi> I shall speake briefely by themselves, after I have given an account first of his Antaristotelicall matter, then of his Method.</p>
               <p>I have formerly intimated how good he is at taking hints, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to give notice in the last Chapter of that faculty of his; Now I will not see him wronged, my Proposition is, That there is not one Argument against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which he hath not taken entirely out of

               <p>You may think Sir I love the man, otherwise <hi>I</hi> should not take this paines with him; this concernes his Learning, that which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his ingenuity is, that in the transcription of all these 18 whole Pages out of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> he never quotes him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only for a line or two by the by, <hi>pag.</hi> 66<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he names him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To all these I shall make a very briefe reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is surely a wonderfull thing, that naturall Magick should not only be <hi>prosecuted with fire and sword,</hi> but that it should be <hi>execrable</hi> also. Yet notwithstanding this lamentable persecution, <hi>I</hi> dare adventure my life, That M. <hi>W.</hi> may passe safely with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen, carrying it either in his <hi>pocket,</hi> or in his hand, or in his mouth through both the Universities of this Nation, the severall Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Eaton, Winchester &amp;c. the College of Physitians at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and all the rest, (provided he have a care how he passes by the College at Bethlem) without any danger of Bell, Booke, or Candle, Fire, Sword or Execration. As for those Authors who have treated of that Argument such as <hi>Agrippa, Porta, Wecker,</hi> &amp; the rest, you know Sir how oft they have deluded us how very slender a proportion of truth is conteined in their volumes, that they are not respected here because of the name Magick, much less for any conjuring they teach, but for the cheat and imposture which they put upon us, eluding credulous men with the pretence of specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vertues, and occult celestiall Signatures and taking them off from observation &amp; experiment (the only way to the knowledge of nature) The discoveries of the Symphonies of nature, and the rules of applying agent and materiall causes to produce effects, is the true naturall Magick, and the generall humane ends of all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50857:19"/>
Pylosophycall enquiries; but M. <hi>Webster</hi> knew not this, 'tis plaine therefore he is no Witch, and is therefore free from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chymistry you know is not neglected here (there being a conjunction of both the Purses and endeavours of severall persons towards discoveries of that kind, such as may serve either to the discovery of light or profit, either to Naturall Philosophy or Physick. But Mr <hi>Webster</hi> expects we should tell him, that we have found the Elixar, (surely we are wiser then to say so) yet we can recommend him to one of his faith, who hath been threescore years in the pursuance of it, and two years since believed he was very neare it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By what Chymicall operation <hi>Physick</hi> should be turned into <hi>flattery,</hi> in truth I cannot fancy. The practice of Physick hath been bottomed upon experience and observation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And that is the reason, that the discoveries of the Circulation of the blood, of the <hi>venae lacteae,</hi> both Mesentericall and Thoraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, of the <hi>vas breve,</hi> and severall new <hi>ductus, vasa lymphatica</hi> &amp;c. have not made an alteration in the practice of Physick, answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the advantage they have given to the Theory; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and confirmation they have brought to the former waies of practice.</p>
               <p>As for his <hi>Postulatum</hi> of discovering the signatures of the Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Archeus</hi> by Anatomy, it is one of his <hi>Rosycrucian Rodomantados</hi>; would he have us by diffection surprize the <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> &amp; shew him the impressions of a thing invisible? Yet the Schematismes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in matters of sensible bulke, have been observed amongst us, and collections made of them in our inquiries, and when the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope shall be brought to the highest (whether it is apace ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving) we shall be able either to give the seminall figures of things, which regulates them in their production and growth, or evince them to lye in quantities insensible, and so to be in truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If neither Physick nor Surgery should be defective, he ought to believe, that man should be Immortall, or at least, be as long lived as the <hi>Rosycrucians</hi> tell him. Yet Surgery as well as Physick, hath even in our time been extremely advanced, this place hath given late instances of both; (particularly in recovering the Wench after she had been hanged at least halfe an hower, and others which I could mention) And the Colledge of Physitians at London is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50857:20"/>
the glory of this Nation, and indeed of Europe, for their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and felicity, in the cures of desperate Ulcers and diseases, even of the Cancer, and those he (ignorantly) mentions, which have been diverse times performed, by D. <hi>Harvey</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>As to the Ignorance he charges upon us, I Answer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the destiny of proud and ignorant men, such as having nothing of science, have yet the unjust desire to be reputed Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, and the Impudence to attempt to be Reformers, that being diverted from the reall and solid wayes of knowledge, they dwindle after the windy impostures of Magick and Astrology<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of signatures and physiognomy, and the like, and if we follow them not madding in these pursuits, we pray that we may be excused.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have formerly given some intimation of our Chymicall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, so that I hope it will be charitably concluded, that we are not ignorant of those hypostaticall principles: yet how they should come to ravish the soule of M. <hi>Webster,</hi> I cannot tell, unlesse it should be in contemplation of the benefits he hath received from them, <hi>viz.</hi> of Salt at Dinner, of Sulphur in the Mange, and of Mercury in Salivation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Magneticall Philosophy is not neglected here, your selfe Sir, are conscious of some Instruments that are prepared for those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments (as Loadstones rough and polished, armed and naked, a Terrella and diverse others) and how it is a reall designe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, wanting only some assistance for execution, to erect a Magneticall, Mechanicall, and Optick Schoole, furnished with the best Instruments, and Adapted for the most usefull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all those faculties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How happy are you and I Sir, and our ingenious acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (whose studies are toward Physick or Philosophy) in this place, who are all employed to salve Mechanically, and statically the Phenomena of nature, and have in some parts advanced the Philosophy of those he mentions? How will it comfort us that we do, and have done in many things, what he would have us?

               <head>CAP. VII. Of Metaphysicks, Ethicks, Politicks, Oeconomicks, Poesy and Oratory.</head>
               <p>YOu see Sir, how thick they come together, and yet the Chap. consists but of three leaves, and part of them is taken up with the repetition of that learned Proverbe, <hi>Hercules is knowne by his foot, and the Lyon by his pawe.</hi> Do not you think Sir, that this man lookes like <hi>Hercules</hi>? He thinks so, and he knowes how he lookes; even like <hi>Hercules Furens,</hi> and thence is the inequallity of his Ravings. You had him in the former Chap. in his combate with <hi>strong men to take from them their steely armes of demonstration</hi>; But no Mortall wight, no <hi>Hero</hi> is able to persist to perpetuity: we see here the great <hi>Alcides</hi> or <hi>Goliah</hi> fainting, not able to weild his Weavers beame, or <hi>Fustilogge,</hi> letting it fall at all adventures, himselfe forlorne of friends, his strength and reason fled away.</p>
               <p>But though the storme be past therere may be danger from these after drops, <hi>Alcides</hi> may stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, &amp; oppresse the Sciences with his fall and a man may be wounded with the convulsive graspe of a dying Lyon. Let us observe, therefore and either decline or repell these last attempts against the Learning of the Academies.</p>
               <p>Against <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> his exceptions are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It brings no better instrument for the discovery of truth, then the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Intellect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why! hath Mr <hi>W.</hi> any better instrument then this? Is it sense, or is it revelation? What is his instrument or toole, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres before the Intellect of man? The man is mad why doe I trouble him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It containes no certaine principles, the principle of mens Cogitans, is more certaine, and undeniable then that of the Schooles, Impossibile est idem simul esse &amp; non esse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seemes he is in a case to swallow Contradictions, and can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that a thing can <hi>simul esse &amp; non esse</hi> (I warrant this man doth believe transubstantiation) how is his throat widened since he was so streight as not to admit the inference of a conclusion in a true Syllogisme? but then was then, and now is now, <hi>omnium rerum est vicissitudo.</hi> Yet <hi>Des Cartes</hi> will give him little thankes for acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his Principle, <hi>Cogito ergo sum,</hi> if a thing may <hi>simul esse &amp; non esse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:50857:21"/>3. The summe of the remainder is this, (though by a speciall gift he hath multiplyed it into three arguments) <hi>That Metaphysicks is of no Profit but to obscure the truth, hath produced none but weake frivolous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions concerning God &amp;c. and the poisonous Cocatrice egs of Altercation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer Sir that I have no inclination to grapple with the wind, or deale with wild universalityes, I am of opinion, that there is much to be considered of, &amp; amended in the Metaphysicks; but that upon this occasion, he hath only discovered an art he hath which might have saved him the labour of all particulars, by saying at once both to the Schooles and Sciences that they are evill and not good, yea even wicked frivolous and abominable.</p>
               <p>His next touch is at Ethicks, and his Exceptions are</p>
               <p n="1">1. Against <hi>Aristotle, who was a Heathen, and did not acknowledge God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you say Sir, Mr <hi>Webster</hi> is a Friar, yet <hi>Aristotle</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a First Mover &amp; if that be not God what is it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He placed the summum bonum in the exercise of virtue, but the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum is not attaineable in this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he was disputing what was the <hi>summum bonum</hi> in this Life, and if virtue be the way to Life Eternall, it is certainely that <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They have taught nothing practicable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are sorry that Mr <hi>Webster</hi> finds Justice, Prudence, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Modesty &amp;c. unpracticable, but so it seemes it is with him, and yet he will be our Reformer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Aristotle takes the preheminence of that which is deduced from the Principles of Christianity, and is unjustly preferred before Socrates, Plato, Zeno, Seneca, Epictetus, who containe more precious Treasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where is it O thou roaring Lyon, (seeking whom thou maist devour) or rather thou Essex-Lyon, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> is preferred before Christ? Is it at Oxford or at Cambridge? Are not the Christian Ethicks of <hi>Daneus, Scultetus, Amesius, Aquinas,</hi> others, beside all those Authors you have mentioned, read &amp; studye,d and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before him in the Universities? What shall be done unto thee O thou leasing toungue?</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Politicks.</head>
                  <p>His exception against the Politicks read in the Universities is very faint and thinne being only this, <hi>That Plato, Bodin, Machavell, are as good as Aristotle</hi> (<hi>though he have many things of singular use,</hi> which is the first good word he hath given him) <hi>and that our Country man, M. Hobbs, is more profound, and yet we read Aristotle in the Vniversities.</hi>

                  <head>Rhetorick.</head>
                  <p>And the same is his Exception against Rhetorick. <hi>We read Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, and spend too much time upon ornamentall Oratory and Poetry, which are gifts of nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Had this man found any one that had written whole Bookes against these Arts of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> so as <hi>Gassendus, Helmont, &amp;c.</hi> against his <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Naturall Phylosophy,</hi> and a Translator ready to assist him, these Arts and Sciences had not thus escaped him, now he can only clatter at <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and clamour against the Schooles for reading him. <hi>Plato, Bodin, Macchiavel, are as good as Aristotle</hi>: well, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> as good as them; what then? But Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> is more profound &amp;c. 'Tis true our Theologues say he is bottomed in the great Abysse. Againe, <hi>Aristotle in his Rhetorick must give way to Plato</hi>; I will not repeat what I have said, and you Sir before me, concerning the Liberty and variety amongst us, But I affirme, that supposing those <hi>Morall</hi> Authours which even now he mentioned, <hi>Zeno, Seneca, Epictetus,</hi> or these <hi>Politick</hi> writers or <hi>Rhetoritians,</hi> did conteine things better in their kind then <hi>Aristotle,</hi> yet they are not so fit to be read in Universities by way of Institution, as he. They have written diffusedly <hi>stilo oratorio,</hi> or use by way of Dialogues, but have not given a briefe Methodicall body of the things they handle. The businesse of such as have the institution of youth, is to give them, first a briefe and generall comprehension of the kinds and natures of those things, about which their studyes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are to be employed, and so to excite &amp; stirre them up to a deeper &amp; more thorough consideration of them, to set them into a way of study and knowledge, but no man is made perfect in any kind by the meere endeavours of a Tutor, but for that they must have recourse to their industry, their ingenuity, and their inclination. Now the chiefe reason as I conceive, why <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath been universally received as <hi>Magister Legitimus</hi> in <hi>Schooles</hi> hath been; The universallity of his Enquiries; the brevity and Method of them; fitting them for Institutions, and not the truth or infallibillity of his Workes: Ignorance or want of consideration of that end, mixt with pride and Arrogance and an Ambition to be a reformer, hath produced this glorious worke of Mr <hi>Webster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath now done with the Learning of the Universityes, indeed he had done with it long agoe, and will have a fling at their Customes and Method.</p>

               <head>CAP. VIII. Of their Customes and Method.</head>
               <p>WHat <hi>Erasmus</hi> said concerning the Popes Crowne, and Monkes bellyes, is more fit for a Fryar to speak, then for us who live upon College Commons. To come therefore briefely to his Exceptions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His first is, <hi>That all our severall Colleges are tyed to one Method, carried on in one way, bound to the same Authors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The charge is utterly untrue, yet were it so, it were no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
(unlesse he could demonstrate an errour in our Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that those who are to engage in the same Scholastick exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, should be trained up in the same Authors and Method.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>But our Exercises are slothfully performed, our Publick Acts being kept but foure times in the yeare, that is in the Termes, which, if one should tell them in plaine termes, are but usually idle termes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would not some man as knowing as himself imagine our Terms to last some four dayes or thereabouts? But you know Sir, they take up the greatest part of all the yeare, and that in the vacations our Schollars are not exempt from exercise, either in the College-Halls, or in their Tutors Chambers.</p>
               <p>As for his quibling about termes, (it being the only wit that he hath offered at) I will upon no termes spoile his Conundrum, yet I must confesse some grudging I have, that he should set up in two trades at once, Quibling and Reforming.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The custome is Injurious which ties men to a set time of yeares and Acts, before they can receive their laureation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all men living I know no reason why such as he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of this: alas! why should such men be left behind their over nimble fellowes? Me thinks he should be comforted, in being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Leird it in a crowd of better company. But seriously Sir, I use to admire in this the prudence of our Ancestors; to stay a while for a degree (which yet this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would not have us so proud and arrogant as to conferre) it is no prejudice to mens worth or Learning; those Colledges have not been least renowned where the locall statutes oblige them to stay the longest; we are not destitute of other equivalent encouragements, in case of an egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proficiency: and if upon such pretences, time and exercises should be dispensed with, the overweening of men, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allities

of friends, would prove very prejudiciall to the true and sincere interest of worth and Learning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His next scandall is, <hi>At the Humming and Hissing of Boyes, rather like Geese then Bees &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed Sir, the Boyes are to be chidden, yet I must needs tell M. <hi>Webster,</hi> that all are not Bees that buzze, and it appeares their hissing hath been his great vexation; but that he was never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with their humming.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He complaines, <hi>That their Disputations are about Notions and paper-Idols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was there ever, or can there be a Disputation about any thing else but Notions? Would he have them bring forth Bread and Cheese &amp; Dispute <hi>de gustibus?</hi> Or would he have the Consecrated Host brought in, and paper-Idols converted into Wafer-Idols of more savour?</p>
               <p n="6">6. And in earnest, it is a heavy thing, that they make use still of the Latine Tongue in all their exercises.</p>
               <p>Indeed Sir, this is a sad and grievous complaint, and hath not fallen from him without reason. His reason I discovered in his Chapter about <hi>Philosophy:</hi> let others admire his wit, I am for his judgement: you say Sir, he is a Friar (whether black or gray, of the Family of the Creepers, or the Skippers it matters not) now Sir, if he could reforme out of the Universities, our studied Arts and Languages, so farre as to banish from us the use of even the Latine Tongue, and put us into a course of studying Magicall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures, Astrology, and <hi>Iacob Behmen</hi>; his modesty might admit of demanding a Canonization, and this great Mathematician, might justly conclude his account to his holinesse, with an <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>O <hi>Aristotle,</hi> are you there! I wondered where he was all this while, when M. <hi>Webster</hi> was in distresse for want of him: but he is a Peripatetick, and will never leave these courses, till M. <hi>Webster</hi> turne him out from among the Academies; however for us, let M. <hi>W.</hi> answer for our affectation of novelty and singularity, and we shall well enough evade the charges of these Paragraphs.</p>
               <p>10. His last complaint is, that we doe not read the <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed we doe not so much and earely as is fitting, yet this I

he that hath hurt the Universities will heale them. You know it is the custome of those generous soules, who for the health and safety of the generality of men, doe use to ascend the banke or publick stage, to give poyson to some that are about them, to wound or scald them, not that they delight in torturing the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (that were cruelty) but by the smart of some few, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the unbelieving multitude of the celestiall energy of their Balsames; they only wound, that they may cure the wounded. And now for Application in short, that's the designe of this noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: yet least any man should think the remedies worse then the diseases, I am resolved here to joyne with him, and with stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arguments, to confound his gainsayers.</p>

                  <head>For Theology.</head>
                  <p>1. His first remedy is, that men should lay aside the <hi>suffering of themselves,</hi> to be stiled by the <hi>Blasphemous</hi> title of <hi>Divines,</hi> and that the people should call them <hi>Theologues, as they doe in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                     </gap>, I am perswaded without any intention to Blaspheme. In the last place, I must pray you not to mistake him, as a favourer of the

Scottish interest, for it is well known he is a Leveller, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence an adversary to the High-lands.</p>
                  <p>2. His next remedy is, that the Scriptures be wholly laid aside in Scholastick exercises.</p>
                  <p>The truth is Sir, he hath spoken so excellently in his remedies, that all the service I can doe him, is only to unfold his meaning. I say then that his meaning is not, that the Scripture should be laid aside in morall exercises, (for he would have <hi>them</hi> deduced from the principles of Christianity <hi>p.</hi> 87.) nor yet in Physicall exercises, (for he would have <hi>some Physicall Learning introduced into the Schooles, which is grounded upon Scripture Principles p.</hi> 105.) but his meaning is only, that the Scriptures should be laid aside in Theologicall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, and who does not see what a remedy to Theology that would prove?</p>
                  <p>3. That the discoveries of God by reason, may be a part of Naturall Philosophy.</p>

may be followed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Comenius</hi> I know, and that his way is usefull, Mr <hi>Brinsley</hi> I have not the happinesse to know, any otherwise then by M. <hi>Websters</hi> commendation, being one of his favorites I should be glad to serve him: I conceive by M. <hi>W.</hi> his designe is, <hi>that Children should be well instructed in the Accedence before they learne their Grammar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. In his fift remedy he discovers a maine secret, that <hi>Irregulars</hi> should be learned <hi>without rule,</hi> and that the Irregulars being learned, the rule also of the Regular <hi>Nounes</hi> and <hi>Verbes</hi> would be facile and briefe, as being but one rule for all.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Children ought to cry <hi>gratias,</hi> for if for one play-day, and that a broken one, they use to doe it, how many play-daies

hath he procured them? besides the present sport he makes them.</p>
                  <p>After all this he feares it may be imagined, that he should prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer at advancing <hi>Symbolicall</hi> and <hi>Cryptographicall</hi> Learning, the universall Character, and Language of Nature.</p>
                  <p>I testify they doe him wrong that thus imagine, and never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood well what formerly he delivered in that Argument: I had him presently in the wind, (such was my felicity) and durst then have sworne (if need had been) that it was even just as now I find it: that concerning <hi>Cryptography, Symbols,</hi> the <hi>Vniversall Character,</hi> he knew nothing; and that his discourse of the Language of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did signify only this, that wanting the use of other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, even of the Latine, he had obtained a gift as usefull, <hi>viz.</hi> a Canting Language.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>1. His first remedy is, that we find out what reason is in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseck nature and operation. And examine wherein mans reason exceeds the reason of other Animants; and here he saith it will be found, there is no specificall but a gradual dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Webster</hi> having discovered that betwixt his reason, and his horses, there is only a graduall difference, hath given much light in the present enquiry; only he hath concealed from us, which of them hath the advantage of degrees, and whether those Degrees are divided by minutes, seconds, and thirds, and whether in the sexagesimall or decimall way. When he shall have holpen us in these scruples, I pray Sir, let us make the best we can of this remedy.</p>
                  <p>2. That the principles of Syllogisme be cleared and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
                  <p>Because 'tis very hard for him to understand, that <hi>Quae eidem sunt aequalia, vel inaequalia; sunt inter se aequalia vel inaequalia.</hi> Or <hi>Quae conveniunt in uno tertio vel non conveniunt; inter se conveniunt etiam vel non conveniunt,</hi> his reason differing but gradually from the reason of other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants.</p>
                  <p>3. That some prevalent way be found out, for discovering and rectifying the fallacies of the sences, for Abstracting adequate notions, and giving apposite denominations to them.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, what say you to M. <hi>Webster?</hi> Had he had the luck to have added the Quadrature of the Circle, with its Appendices
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50857:24"/>
in <hi>Geometry,</hi> and the Phylosophers Stone in <hi>Chymystry,</hi> what could more judiciously and comprehensively have been required?</p>
                  <p>4. That induction may be improved, and to that end Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments frugiferous and luciferous may be made.</p>
                  <p>The thing that is here proposed I do exceedingly like, and seeing it is an Amphibious argument, belonging to <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Logick</hi> both, I will not be so unreasonable as to quarrell with him about his Method or disposition.</p>

               <p>The first in truth is decided (in my opinion) not without some judgement, how ever it comes to passe.</p>
               <p>There are many things in him good (in truth very many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, all his Historicall parts of nature are excellent, and so is his Rhetorick, and all his other workes) only his Physicks is to be eliminated, it being founded upon either false, or not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principles, referring all things to that System, and modell of the World, which time and observation have manifested to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true: the Astronomy depending thereon (upon that System of foure elements, and a Quintessentiall solid Heaven) falls necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon the removall of his Physicks, or rather the Physicall part of that Astronomy.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>You see Sir, how loath I am to vary from M. <hi>W.</hi> my opinion concerning <hi>Aristotle</hi> being even coincident with his: yet I think
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50857:25"/>
                     <hi>Aristotles</hi> Bookes, the best of any Philosophick writings, &amp; that when these things are laid aside, that which remaines deserves for him the honour that ought to be given to one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test wits, and most usefull that ever the World enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>Farther, I must enforme M. <hi>Webster,</hi> that the thing he doth desire, is already performed in our Academies, there being no man, any thing deeply seene in Naturall Philosophy, who goes about to salve things upon the principles, of matter, forme, and privation, or the first and second qualities. So that I feare his <hi>molimina</hi> against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> will by some witts, be accounted disingenious, and his reflections upon our Universities, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and impertinent.</p>
               </q>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>But to come to his Remedies.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1. His first is,</hi> that my L. Bacons way may be embraced. That Axioms be evidently proved by observations, and no other be admitted. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I am wholly of his judgement, yet I have an itching desire to know what <hi>Lilly,</hi> and <hi>Booker, Behmen,</hi> and all the families of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Soothsayers, Canters, and Rosycrucians, have done to vexe him, since he was writing of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>Scholastick Philosophy,</hi> that having cherished them then, and put them in hopes of his blessing, he should now of a sudden cast them off, betaking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to their deadly enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2. The second Remedy is,</hi> That some Physicall Learning may be brought into the Schooles, that is grounded upon sensible, Rationall, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall, and Scripture Principles, and such an Author is <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fludd;</hi> then which for all the particulars, the World never had a more perfect piece</p>
                  <p>How little trust there is in villainous man! he that even now was for the way of strict and accurate induction, is fallen into the mysticall way of the <hi>Cabala,</hi> and numbers formall: there are not two waies in the whole World more opposite, then those of the L. <hi>Verulam</hi> and D. <hi>Fludd,</hi> the one founded upon experiment, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon mysticall Ideal reasons; even now he was for him, now he is for this, and all this in the twinkling of an eye, O the celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the change and motion of the Wind.</p>
                  <p>3. His third remedy is, That the Philosophy of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> of <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Philolaus,</hi> of <hi>Hermes</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Gilbert,</hi> be brought into Examination and practise.</p>
                  <p>He meanes that these be examined by those that can understand them (himselfe being unprovided in that kind,) that we chuse the good, and refuse the evill. You will say, if <hi>De Fluctibus</hi> be so perfect,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50857:25"/>
what need we go any farther? I warrant you Sir, he knows both why and wherefore, though I can see no reason for it.</p>
                  <p>4. That youth may put their hands to labour, and their fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Furnaces: that the Mysteries discovered by <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techny</hi>; and the wonders brought to light by <hi>Chymistry</hi> may be familiar to them.</p>
                  <p>All that I can do here is to explaine his meaning, least the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy should loose its operation [It is not his meaning, that the youth should put their fingers <hi>into</hi> the Furnaces, for that would make them dread the fire, nor yet <hi>unto</hi> the Furnaces, for that would smut them, but <hi>to,</hi> that is, towards the Furnace.] He hath likewise taken care that we should not confound in this Paragraph Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and Pyrotechny, the <hi>wonders</hi> of that, and the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of this. Chymistry is well knowne, Pyrotechny is the Method of <hi>fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes,</hi> the Mystery of making <hi>Squibs</hi> and <hi>Crackers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The last remedy is, That Galenicall Physick may not be the prison that all men must be enchained in.</p>
                  <p>See Sir how one may live and learne! I ever thought that Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenicall Physick had served to make men loose, and not to be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to them. I can but thank Mr <hi>Webster</hi> for this discovery, <hi>Ingratum si dixeris, omnia dixeris.</hi>

               <head>CAP. XI. Some Expedients concerning their Custome and Method.</head>
               <p>WHosoever shall consider the Errours charged upon the Universities in his eight Chapter, and the Expedients here proposed, if he do not acknowledge the Remedies here applyed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50857:26"/>
to be the very genuine &amp; naturall ones hinted by the Indication of the Diseases: I say he labours in his Judgment, and is a <hi>Dis-Idoneous</hi> Auditor of Mr <hi>Webster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For If the Disease be, that the body of the University is bound, (bound to one Method) can there be a surer remedy, then to use a solutive Medicine, to give them a purge and set them loose? If it labour of Idlenesse or a consumption of time, can any remedy be more naturall, then that time should not hence forth be trifled away? These are his <hi>Recipes,</hi> carried on thus to the last, against which the tongue of envy, cannot say but they are proper to their Maladyes.</p>
               <p>Yet I must speake to them in severall.</p>
               <p>1. That there be a liberty in the way and Method of Study.</p>
               <p>I have formerly hinted to him, that our Universities are pretty well furnished with this medicine, so that he shall doe well to vent it upon those forraigne ones from whence he is come.</p>
               <p>2. That time be not mispent in the Universities.</p>
               <p>Some captious ones have asked, why then he would not take care, to keep his Workes from coming hither to be read? to whom I answer, that he never did intend they should come hither, he meant them to a party in the City, and takes no pleasure I dare say, that I should spend this time about him; well this is not the only thing wherein it is my happinesse to agree with M. <hi>Webster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That there be not a set time for degrees, but that merit, not years should take place, and be rewarded.</p>
               <p>How fitting this is, I have endeavoured to shew p. 40.</p>
               <p>4. That in their Exercises, it be tried what they can doe, that (nature having given them two hands) they may learne to worke &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The reasons of this may be many, I shall name only two. First, because he hath been used to weed the Garden, and to other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his Covent: then why should not we? Secondly, because if his reformation shall take place, we must be put shortly to work for our livings, therefore tis good before hand, for each man to be provided of a Trade.</p>
               <p>5. That Exercises may be in English.</p>
               <p>His reason is, <hi>least we</hi> forget the English Tongue, which would be very sad if it should fall out: <hi>Mine</hi> is, that M. <hi>Webster</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his measure, be not deprived of the benefit of them.</p>
               <p>6. That neither Antiquity nor Novelty take place of Verity, nor the Authority of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any other, should enchaine us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:50857:26"/>What? againe at <hi>Aristotle</hi>! nay verily now he is to blame: This
remedy had been a pure one, if he could have let <hi>Aristotle</hi> alone: the fetching him in here, I feare, may give occasion to some, to think he does it out of spight.</p>
               <p>7. Lastly, the order he prescribes is this, that they be taught,
1. <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> 2. <hi>Tongues.</hi> 3. <hi>Physicks.</hi> 4. <hi>Logick.</hi> 5. <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks.
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that all men should be bound to the same Method, (as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove expressed) beside M. <hi>Webster</hi> studied all these together, which hath made him so equally skilled in all, that there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to chuse betwixt his skill in every one of them, no man being able to speake, whether he be a greater Mathematician, a Linguist, or a Philosopher.</p>
               <p>And now Sir, you judge that I have faithfully performed what I undertook, at the opening of his Remedies: I having stuck to him as close as needed to be, and to speake truth, as close as his sent would suffer mee.</p>
               <p>Sir, I have ran through this Pamphlet, and I think I have in some measure, made good the character you gave me of him in your Epistle; you know Sir, I am not of those who hate to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; it hath been my earnest desire, that men of Parts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience would meet together, and consult about the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of study, by the most convenient method, That would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce something worthy of our age of light; the raw and crude attempts of such men as these, are slight and very Ridiculous, no waies considerable, unlesse it shall be in their excitations of us, to reforme such Errours as we find, to assert and vindicate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of these places. A thing which would speedily and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be performed, if our designe of Printing Bookes, and setting up a forreigne correspondency were once accomplished. There is one thing which this sort of Pamphleteers insist on, which as it is pursued by my L. <hi>Verulam,</hi> so it carries weight with it, but is very impertinently applied, either as an exception against us, or as a generall rule to be imposed upon us in our Academicall instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is, that instead of verball Exercises, we should set upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and observations, that we should lay aside our Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Declamations, and Publick Lectures, and betake our selves, to Agriculture, Mechanicks, Chymistry, and the like.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied but this is the way, and the only way to perfect Naturall Philosophy and Medicine: so that whosoever intend to professe the one or the other, are to take that course,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50857:27"/>
and I have not neglected occasionally to tell the World, that this way is pursued amongst us. But our Academies are of a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and comprehensive institution, and as there is a provision here made, that whosoever will be excellent in any kind, in any Art, Science, or Language, may here receive assistance, and be led by the hand, till he come to be excellent; so is there a provision likewise, that men be not forced into particular waies, but may receive an institution, variously answerable to their genius and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
               <p>Of those very great numbers of youth, which come to our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, how few are there, whose designe is to be absolute in Naturall Philosophy? Which of the Nobility or Gentry, desire when they send their Sonnes hither, that they should be set to Chymistry, or Agriculture, or Mechanicks? Their removall is from hence commonly in two or three years, to the Innes of Court, and the desire of their friends is not, that they be engaged in those experimentall things, but that their reason, and fancy, and carriage, be improved by lighter Institutions and Exercises, that they may become Rationall and Gracefull speakers, and be of an acceptable behaviour in their Countries.</p>
               <p>I am perswaded, that of all those, who come hither for Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is not one of many hundreds, who if they may have their option, will give themselves to be accomplished Naturall Philosophers, (such as will, ought certainly to follow this course) the paines is great, the reward but slender, unlesse we reckon in the pleasure of contemplation; that indeed is great and high, but therefore to draw all men that way, by reason of the pleasure, were to present a Feast all of Custard or Tart, and not to consult the variety of Tasts, and tempers of our Guests: But I have been too much and long extravagant and idle: if out of all this you shall be pleased to raise a Contemplation of your power over mee, and shall from thence receive a complacence, it is the only aime and interest of, SIR,</p>

            <head>An Appendix Concerning what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hobbs</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dell</hi> have written touching the Universities.</head>
            <p>SIR, when I consider how I have spent that little time, which I have hitherto bestowed upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Websters Examen,</hi> and into what a temper of mind I have fallen upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, the satisfaction I receive from what I have done, is so small, that were I not held on by the power you have over mee, in truth I would excuse my selfe from any farther trouble. Now it seemes I must goe on, and being tired with idle play, I must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse my selfe for a much more considerable encounter. You know Sir, and have observed in your Letter to mee, how vast a difference there is, betwixt the Learning and Reputation of Mr <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and these two Gentlemen, and how scornefully he will take it to be ranked with a Friar and an Enthusiast: The Answer to this, if he complaine, will be, we found him <hi>inter Grues,</hi> and could not without prejudice let him escape: However I shall deale with him as respectfully as I can, giving him leave to heare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe speake at large, (a thing he is infinitely taken with) and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such replies, as Truth and Reason shall suggest in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernements. I intend only to consider what he hath spoken of the Universities in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> or rather what I have therein obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to that purpose, laying together such passages as may make him to be understood.</p>
            <p>That men may be able fully to comprehend the meaning of this Author, we must carefully by way of preparation, search for his
<list>
                  <item>1. End and Designe.</item>
                  <item>2. Judgement, concerning the meanes of attaining it.</item>
                  <item>3. Expectation as to successe in his Designe, and the consequences of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It appeares that the end he proposes to himselfe (in his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi>) is, that the World should be regulated exactly, by that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50857:28"/>
modell which he there exhibits, and that his reason should be the governing Reason of Mankind.</p>
            <p>This is (I conceive) so evident, that he will not denie it, and so frequently insinuated, that it's needlesse to be particular. The close of his second part, and 31 Chapter, is with an intimation of a desire, that <hi>by the exercise of entire Soveraignty, his truth of speculation may be converted into the utility of practise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The meanes he proposes to accomplish this end, is the <hi>publicke Teaching of his Leviathan</hi>: which he would <hi>have protected by the exercise of entire Soveraignty.</hi> ibid.</p>
            <p>Now this publick teaching may be either in the
<list>
                  <item>Pulpits.</item>
                  <item>Universities.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Divines and others who make shew of Learning, derive their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the Vniversities, and from the Schooles of Law, or from the Books which by men eminent in those Schooles and Vniversities have been published. It is therefore manifest, that the instruction of the People, dependeth wholly upon the right teaching of Youth in the Vniversities.</hi> p. 179, 180.</p>
            <p>So that the way he proposes to accomplish his great designe, is, the Publicke reading of his <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the Universities, (especially of England) and in order to this, he hath declared himselfe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Booke, the Universities, and himselfe. 1. Concerning his Booke in the review. <hi>p.</hi> 395. "That it may be profitably Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>and more profitably taught in the Vniversities.</hi> 2, and 3 Concerning the other two. <hi>p.</hi> 180. In answer to these two Questions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Are not the Vniversities of England learned enough already (to teach the People their duty?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Is it you</hi> (Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi>) <hi>will undertake to teach the Vniversities?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Where the answer to the first, is, <hi>That the Vniversities have not been able to plant the true Doctrine</hi> (which is his.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to the other, that any man which sees what he is doing, may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what he thinkes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His immediate desire and judgment is therefore, that his <hi>Leviathan</hi> be <hi>by entire soveragnity imposed upon the Vniversities,</hi> there to be read, and publickly taught.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will now concerne us to consider his expectation and hope, concerning the accomplishment of this (sober and modest) designe. Upon the prevailing or failing of which hope in his mind, the destiny of the Universities (as to his endeavours) shall depend. If he have hope that he shall be publickly taught in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities, it will be convenient for him only to endeavour this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50857:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
peice of Reformation, and to assert their usefulnesse being so ordered. If there be little hopes of obtaining this publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for this great <hi>Leviathan</hi>; To what end then serve the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities? Shall other things be taught there publickly, and this be looked upon as the writing of a private Author? It will then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him to fall downe right upon them, on every occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to blast them, and to proclaime them uselesse to the world.</p>
            <p>And here indeed we find him fluctuating betwixt despaire and hope, <hi>p.</hi> 193. sometimes,
<q>At the point of believing this his labour as
uselesse as the Commonwealth of Plato. At other times recovering hopes, that
one time or other this writing of his may fall into the hands of a Soveraigne,
who by the Exercise of entire Soveraignty, in protecting the publick teaching
of it, will convert this truth of Speculation into the Vtility of practise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How happy Sir had it been, if his hopes might have reigned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in his mind, that so the Universities might have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Patron of this great man, but he is well in yeares, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy and Spleen have prevailed over him, and in conclusion, he deales with us accordingly; indeed Sir, somewhat <hi>Puerilely,</hi> in insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over us without cause, <hi>Tetrically</hi> striking at us without any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, <hi>Vnreasonably,</hi> in charging us with some things we are not guilty of, and condemning us for other, without convincing us of any fault. This is that we shall demonstrate in our just defence, There are two passages by the by, and one entire Chapter which will concerne us to consider.</p>
            <p>His first passage is in the 1. <hi>Chapter p.</hi> 4. Where having determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Sence to be nothing else but a perception of a motion made upon the Organ,</hi> He adds, <hi>But the Phylosophy Schooles through all the Vniversities of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome grounded upon certaine texts of Aristotle, teach another Doctrine (viz. that sence is made by a Species &amp;c.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As for the thing here charged upon all the Schooles of Christendome, you know it Sir to be untrue.</p>
            <p>The other Theory of explaining sence upon the grounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was almost generally received here before his Booke came forth. Being sufficiently taught by <hi>Des Cartes, Gassendus,</hi> S. <hi>K. Digby,</hi> and others, before he had Published any thing in that kind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which he so much glories in, is not his owne invention, but is contained for substance (as I am certainely informed by one who hath seen it) in Mr <hi>Warners</hi> Papers, which Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> had long since in his hands, and is delivered in the very beginning of that tract of vision, which treats <hi>de penicillo optico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50857:29"/>3. If <hi>Mr</hi> 
               <hi>Hobbs</hi> had invented this, who hath not (so farre as I can learne) added any thing considerable to the inventions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men: It might have been needlesse, upon so slight an occasion, to insult over all the Schooles of Christendome; but his mind was intent upon his designe, and at this time his <hi>hope</hi> had possession there; <hi>He sayes not</hi> (therefore) <hi>that, as disapproving</hi> (yet) <hi>the use of Vniversities, but to let men see what would be amended in them. page</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>But that which followes after is indeed of worse consequence, and is (to speake the best and mildest of it) an evidence of a fuming spleene, and an instance of despondency in his designe.</p>
            <p>A touch he is thought to give us in his Kingdome of Darkenesse, where he makes a comparison of the Papacy with the Kingdome of Fayries. The words are (<hi>p.</hi> 386.) <hi>In what shop or operatory the Fayries make their Enchantments, the old Wives have not determined; but the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories of the Clergy, are well enough known to be the Vniversities, that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Discipline, from Authority Pontificiall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In truth Sir, I hardly know how to behave myselfe upon this occasion. First, I know not whether he intended this to concerne <hi>our</hi> Universities or not; if not, he might have done us the Justice, to have separated our case from that of Popish <hi>Vniversities</hi>; if he did intend to cast a contumely upon us, I am yet at a losse how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer him. This whole discourse is freakish and unbecoming the Archipoliticall gravity of a Master of the world, our Universities have bin Modelled by commission from the Civill Power. Seeing the old Women have found no operatory for the Fairyes; it was a needlesse Sollicitude in this Reverend old man, to seeke one for the Clergy. Well Sir, seeing he will have his frollick, I am resolved to answer this passage with a Crotchet of a Friend of mine, whose observation, is that however the <hi>Fayries</hi> are sayd to be harmelesse in their dancings, he is sure the Hobbe-goblins are spightfull and mischeivous in their Friskings.</p>
            <p>But hitherto we have been but girded at; his maine forces he hath gathered into the Chapter preceding this, <hi>viz.</hi> the .46. whose title is of <hi>Darkenesse from vaine Philosophy, &amp;c.</hi> but its designe is against Universities. And this Chapter containes,
<list>
                  <item>1. A discourse concerning, the beginning and progresse of Philosophy.</item>
                  <item>2. Concerning the originall, &amp; Progresse of Schooles.</item>
                  <item>3. The unprofitablenesse of Schooles.</item>
                  <item>4. Of Universities, and a generall charge against them.</item>

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:50857:29"/>5. Their particular errours.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The two first parts of this Chapter, seeme not to be of any spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall concernement to us, and I shall have that regard to him, and to my selfe, not to oppose him without necessity: were it requisite so to doe, it were easy to manifest, that his sentence concerning the beginnings and progresse of knowledge, is neither suitable to Reason nor History: the supposition laid as a lemma to that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is, that <hi>hearding of men like beasts</hi> together, their <hi>feeding upon Akornes,</hi> and drinking water, <hi>their wanting for some time the use of speech,</hi> &amp;c. things neither suitable to those Authentick Histories which ought to have authority amongst us, nor yet to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Reason, running back from the present state of the world, to the temper and state of earlier times. But to drive this home were to unravell the whole body of his Politicks, and to dissolve this goodly work, which is not to be done occasionally in such an Appendix; the time may be, when after M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hobbs</hi> shall have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his other Philosophicall Workes, from whence the rise of this Great one is fetched, some friend or other of ours may set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part some time, to weigh and examine all his Labours, and then to render him what shall be due to the Truth and Demonstration of his Assertions.</p>
            <p>You know how much may be said for that <hi>Origine</hi> &amp; <hi>derivation of knowledge,</hi> which the Bookes of Moses deliver to us; And for the <hi>Origine</hi> of Schooles, which is the second part of this discourse: as we cannot deny them to have been the productions of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>leasure,</hi> so I conceive it is an excessive instance of Spleen and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, prejudiciall even to the whole course of Life and Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of M.<hi>H.</hi> to call the Discourses and Contemplations of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Philosophers, by the name of <hi>Talke</hi> and <hi>Idlenesse,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Exercises of <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Zeno,</hi> and the Antient Worthies, (without some of whose endeavours, there had scarce at this time been either oportunity of knowing much, nor had the World per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps set so high a price on knowledge,) to the <hi>prating and loitering usually exercised in Pauls Church, and More-fields</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The world had then another esteeme of those Exercises, <hi>who publickly upon this occasion erected Schooles for Lectures, and Disputations, almost in every Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> And it is in the strength of the reputation of Philosophy gained that way, that M. <hi>Hobbs</hi> findes a regard amongst men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of knowledge, and not for the eminence of what he hath published, in any kind exceeding the productions of those men whom he despises. Thus much in generall concerning the two
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50857:30"/>
first parts of this Chapter. The Third is, <hi>the Inutility of the Antient Schooles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The distast he hath conceived against our Universities, hath not suffered him to containe his Rage within any bounds. <hi>What hath been the utility of those (Antient) Schooles? What Science is there at this day acquired by their Readings and Disputings.</hi> p. 369.</p>
            <p>The meaning is, there never was any profit by Publick Schooles. This concernes us, and we will examine it particularly.</p>
            <p>The substance of his reasoning is this, (ib.) <hi>Naturall Philosophy cannot be had, without having first attained great knowledge in Geometry</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we have of Geometry (which is the Mother of all naturall Science) we are not indebted for it to the Schooles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato forbad entrance to all that were not in some measure Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, here it is that I cannot but complaine of misguided Rage in M. <hi>Hobbs</hi>; against this passage I assert, that not onely Geometry was taught in the Antient Schooles, but that to those Schooles, we owe the Geometry which we have.</p>
            <p>Much we owe to the Schoole of <hi>Athens,</hi> and even to <hi>Plato's Schoole</hi> (the <hi>Academy</hi>) much more to that famous Schoole of <hi>Alexandria. Plato</hi> was He, who when the Oracle required the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Cubicall Altar, expounded it of the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the study of Geometry to them, shewed them that the particular solution of the Problem, must be by the invention of two meane proportionalls betwixt two lines given, propounded the Problem to his Scholers, who wrote severall things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proclus</hi> doth often referre the invention of Propositions in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides</hi> Collection, to the Schoole of <hi>Pythagoras. Theudius Magnes, Cyzicinus</hi> the Athenian, and others, are delivered to us by <hi>Proclus,</hi> in the Second Book of Commentaries upon the first Element of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide, in Academia simul vacasse quaestionibus Geometricis enucleandis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Schoole of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> hath been so renouned for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Mathematicks, that in truth I cannot but wonder at the assertion of M <hi>Hobbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was begun by <hi>Euclide</hi> there, not long after the building of that City, in the time of <hi>Ptolemaeus Lagi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was continued by the Disciples of <hi>Euclide,</hi> who left many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him as <hi>Pappus</hi> acknowledges in his Collections.</p>
            <p>To it we owe all the great Mathematicians, which ever were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Antients, such as <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> (who set up the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50857:30"/>
at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> by which men made the observations of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parchus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the foundation of all Astronomy) <hi>Archimedes, Apollonius</hi> (the great Geometrician) <hi>Ptolemy, Theon, Diophantus,</hi> and very many others.</p>
            <p>Nay, Sir <hi>H. Savile</hi> hath asserted, that from the time of <hi>Euclide</hi> to the <hi>Saracenicall</hi> times, there never was a great Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, who was not borne at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or had not studied some yeares there.</p>
            <p>I would gladly know, what is there in Geometry, or all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, which we are not indebted for to some of these, I speak not of Propositions, but of the way and method of mastering all kinds of Problemes. The Analyticks was their Art, the Exegeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part hath indeed been found out by <hi>Vieta,</hi> and the Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call effection of solid and lineary Problemes, by the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wit of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> but had it not been for those, we never had enjoyed the benefit of these.</p>
            <p>I have heard that M. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath given out, that he hath found the solution of some Problemes, amounting to no lesse then the Quadrature of the Circle, when we shall be made happy with the sight of those his labours, I shall fall in with those that speake loudest in his praise, in the meane time I cannot dissemble my feare, that his Geometricall designe (as to those high pieces) may prove answerable to a late Opticall designe of his, of casting Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call glasses in a mould, then which there could not be any thing attempted, lesse becoming such a man, as he doth apprehend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be.</p>
            <p>Briefely as to the case in hand, either M. <hi>Hobbs</hi> did know of these Schooles, or not; if he knew not of them, I dare undertake him not to be so great a Geometrician as he pretends to be, and that he is defective at his chiefe weapon.</p>
            <p>If he did know of them, where is his ingenuity in asserting the inutility of Schooles? and that we are not beholden to them for our Geometry?</p>
            <p>It is not in vaine Sir, that I have charged these things upon his spleene, which yet will more appeare by that which followes. <hi>pag.</hi> 370.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That which he there asserts concerning Universities is, that whereas an University is an Incorporation of many publick Schooles in one Towne.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Principall Schooles were ordained for</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>The Romane Religion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:50857:31"/>
                     <hi>The Romane Law.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>The Art of Medicine.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To this it is easily answered, that however the Ordination of them hath formerly been, the two Universities have since the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting off the Papall Yoke, been regulated by the Civill power, and been conformed to it, so that the Discourse of the Romish Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Law, with reflexion upon us, is disingenious, and nothing to this purpose.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For the study of Philosophy, it hath no otherwise place, then as a Handmaid to the Romish Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is in truth so Barbarous an Assertion, as nothing beside the Reverence to his Grey Haires, restraines me from speaking bluntly of him: what friends to the Romish Religion our Universities have brought forth, that party have felt. And it is said that Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> is no otherwise an enemy to it, save only, as it hath the name of a Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>And since the Authority of Aristotle is only current there, that study is not properly Phylosophy but Aristotelity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How farre the Authority of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is current amongst us, Sir both you and I have spoken.</p>
            <p>What his designe is concerning the publick reading of his <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> Himselfe hath told us.</p>
            <p>From whence it is manifest, that the only thing which paines him is the desire that Aristotelity may be changed into Hobbeity, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of the Stagyrite, the world may adore the great Malmesburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Phylosopher.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>For Geometry till of very late times it had no place at all. And if any man by the ingenuity of his nature had atteined to any degree of perfection in it, he was commonly thought a Magician, and his Art Diabolicall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Geometry hath now so much place in the Universities, that when Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> shall have published his Philosophicall and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall Peices, I assure my selfe, I am able to find a great number in the University, who will understand as much or more of them then he desires they should, indeed too much to keep up in them that Admiration of him which only will content him.</p>
            <p>And if in our times these studies have been advanced, we might have expected from a temperate man, rather the commendation for our Advance, then an exprobration with the ignorance of our Ancestors.</p>
            <p>The truth is Sir, about that time when Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> was conversant in Magdalen-Hall, the constitution and way of the University
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50857:31"/>
might (likely) be enclining to his Character of it, but now his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course seemes like that of the seaven sleepers, who after many yeares awaking, in vaine addressed themselves to act according to the state of things when they lay downe.</p>
            <p>I shall speake no more to this fourth head. And to the fift, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an enumeration of particular errours: They all or most are resolved into that Aristotelity he Charges us with, and require no Answer, save that we enjoy a liberty of Philosophizing, and that if he should do us the honour to come amongst us, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded he would hardly find any other fault with us, except that great unpardonable one, that the publick reading of his <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan,</hi> is not by a Sanction of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> imposed upon us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The particular errors which he would charge us with, are neere twenty in number, amongst which there is not one, either in Philosophy, Politicks, or Divinity, which he hath proved, or can prove, both to be an Error, and to be maintained by our Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities. I shall give a briefe account of them all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His first Error charged upon us, is the Doctrine of <hi>Abstracted Essences,</hi> and <hi>Immateriall Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning which, as I cannot but acknowledge his Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be good, as to the former part, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Vniversalls,</hi> and formall <hi>Entities</hi>: so I am willing to make good upon a just occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Being is a superiour notion to Body, that Immateriall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or separated Substances, is no contradiction, and that the Truths of Philosophy, are better salved upon that ground, then upon his imagination.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His next quarrell is at <hi>Nunc stans,</hi> the common definition of Eternity: This I affirme to be more intelligible then a successive Eternity, or a progresse <hi>in infinitum,</hi> which is the contrary posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Of all that which followes, I doe not know one thing which is held by any of us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As <hi>That one Body may be in many places, many in one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That Gravity is the cause of heavinesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That Quantity is put into Body already made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That the Soule of man is Poured into the body, meaning it literally and grossely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That the power of willing is the (totall) cause of Actuall willing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That Fortune or Ignorance, is an occult cause of things, although we may not professe to know the causes of all things.</hi>

            <p>As for the rest of them, he may better assert, that there are Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities in the <hi>Moone,</hi> and that they maintaine all those Positions, then impose them upon us. <hi>There</hi> it will be hard to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, We <hi>now</hi> challenge him to make proofe of what he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and Promise to give him satisfaction.</p>

What is the language of <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> or the Writers upon the Sentences, to the Universities of <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge</hi>?

            <p n="1">1. If Mr <hi>Dell</hi> be a graduate in the the University, he hath sworne to defend the priviledges of it, to do it all the Honour and right he can, If so how doth he encroach upon the Law of nature, Sacred amongst all not given over to Barbarisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Unlesse he can prove the matter of that Oath to be unlawfull which is yet retained in every Corporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) I do not know any thing which can here excuse him from unrighteousness. If he himselfe be no Graduate, he doth indeed discover no more, but a disingenuous envy and (considering his relations) an unworthy ingratitude.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But particularly, first, that which he calls the Monopolizing of Learning by those two places, it is not to be charged upon them (neither is it f<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rther chargeable then upon any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of men whatsoever) but it reflects upon the Soveraigne Magistracy of our Nation by whose ordination, the priviledges &amp; statutes of both the Universityes have been alwayes regulated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His second charge is generall, unproved, and no wayes concernes us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am sure that this University cannot now be Justly taxed with any such Licentiousnesse or profanenesse: indeed the care and prudence and successe of our Immediate Governors, as to the Advancement of Religion and Learning is such as Mr <hi>Dell</hi> may envy but he will never equall it, I should be very loath to injure him, yet common fame hath brought his name hither with a Character upon it of one whose studyed designe is (by letting fall

all Discipline) to let in Licence with all its usuall traine, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cays Colledge,</hi> and that other University: an I that the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of what he hath done hitherto hath been such as tends manifestly rather to the ruine then Reformation of that place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His third assertion containes in the Parenthesis an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy reflexion upon those who have the mannage of the supream power, and is in it selfe such as he cannot prove; were his designe put in execution, it would tend undoubtedly to the disadvantage of Learning; there is nothing in the world more conducing to the enlarging of the minds of men and the compleating of their Knowledge, then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>versation with men eminent in all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of Learning, and the honest emulation of those that doe excell. This is to be had only where there are great numbers of Students and <hi>Professors,</hi> and the cause of the advance in Learning encreases alwayes with the variety and eminency of mens wits and learning who converse together. To spare more words in a Theore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall discourse of this nature, we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare together the Learning of the Universities, and Religious Houses of foreigne parts, where it is evident, the difference in Learning is vast; those are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pursed according to great townes, and remaine pittifully ignorant, these are one or two in a Nation, flourishing with the profession of all ingenious Learning.</p>
            <p>Now that which he alleadges as a convenience in his way, <hi>That People may maintaine their Children at home while they learne in the Schooles,</hi> hath not been observed to tend to an advance in learning but to the contrary.</p>
            <p>We have not <hi>Generally</hi> observed that Towns-mens Children prove the greatest Schollars and those who would have their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren excellently learned rather choose to send them abroad to Schoole, or to travell, then keepe them at home. Having briefely examined this proposall, I shall need only to mention his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; which is,</p>
