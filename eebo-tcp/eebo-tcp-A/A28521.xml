         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is no Booke or Treatiſe
which this Author hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but the footſteps and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of <hi>Divine</hi> Light, and
<hi>knowledge</hi> are therein Imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and diſcerned, and may be
of ſpeciall uſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Chriſtian, impartiall, Reader; ſo
likewiſe theſe his Epiſtles, written at ſundry
times, and occaſions to ſeverall Friends; and
thus gathered and compact together, may of
right be reckoned as one Booke, not of the
ſmalleſt benefit and direction to the Reader,
Lover, and Practitioner of that Divine light,
and knowledge, which his Writings doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and hold forth:<note place="margin">☜</note> Indeed, the bare <hi>Letter</hi>
of any Mans Writings, though written from a
Divine Gift, and reall manifeſtation of light in
and to themſelves, cannot <hi>breath the ſpirit of
wiſedome</hi> into us: for the ſound of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is not to be Characterized, or Painted on
Paper; no more then the Notes, and Characters
of Muſick can give the reall Sound, and Tune,
unto the Eare; but they are a direction how
the ſkilfull <hi>Muſician</hi> ſhall play on the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb facs="tcp:58072:3"/>
ſo alſo our minde is as an Organ, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument;
but it Sounds onely according to
the Tune, and Note, of that Spirit, that doth
poſſeſſe and act it: And we doe convert, and
aſſimulate all things according to that Spirit,
and will that is ruling, and predominant in us;
and therein the minde, thoughts, and ſences,
are enkindled, and enflamed; for if we have
a bare Aſtrall, Worldly, Carnall, Selfe-concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Contemning, Cavilling, Phariſaicall, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall
Spirit; accordingly we doe forme,
and frame our Notions, Judgement, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and <hi>pervert all things to a wrong ſenſe and
uſe;</hi> but if the Divine Spirit of Love, Light,
meekneſſe, humility, ſelfe-denyall, ſyncerity,
and <hi>holy deſires</hi> doe dwell, rule, and act in us;
then our underſtanding is accordingly <hi>holy,
Divine, and reall:</hi> for <hi>To the pure, all things are
pure; but to the impure, all things are impure; for
their very Mindes and Conſciences are defiled:</hi> As
this Author received not his Learning, Gifts,
and high Endowments, from the Schooles of
this World;<note place="margin">☞</note> but from the Schoole of Divine
wiſedome, the illumination of the holy Spirit;
ſo likewiſe the meaning and drift of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
will not be underſtood of thoſe who are
<hi>meerely</hi> trained up, and ſkilled in the litterall

according to the Canons, Rules, and Axioms
of their wiſe Phariſaicall Reaſon, who doe
contemne, judge, and raſhly cenſure, all that
ſpeake not their phraſe, ſtile, and Dialect: For

if we had all that ever the Prophets,<note place="margin">☜</note> Chriſt,

knowledge of all Divine, illuminate men, in

to have it innate, and eſſentiall <hi>in us,</hi> to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
expreſſion of Divine love and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
they would be but as dark and Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

our knowledge, which by our artificiall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
we ſhould build unto our ſelves upon that
foundation; would be but a vapouring No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a blind <hi>Pedanticall</hi> Luciferian oſtentation

but puffe up;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> from which ſelfe-conceited,
Verball, high-flowne, contrived knowledge,
which wiſe Letter-learned Reaſon, devoyd of
the illumination of the holy Spirit, hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in diverſe formes unto it ſelfe, by its
owne imaginary apprehenſions, and expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

many mentall Idolls, Opinions, Contentions,

they come, that in the ſeverall diſpenſations
of his Divine Gifts, and manifeſtations of light

            </p>
            <p>There are ſome that are ſo farre foreſtalled

            </p>
            <p>Others againe, the Myſterious Antichriſt in
Babel, by a ſelfiſh illumination, and blind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
hath ſo deeply captivated, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned;
yea, bewildred, and bewitched, in his
Myſtery of iniquity and hypocriſie, that they
doe not onely take upon them to contemne,

in Chriſt. From a member-like obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
(as one branch on the Tree is

the open well-ſpring of grace, which
God in Chriſt Jeſus hath manifeſted in
our humanity; ſo that it may richly
ſpring up in you, and the Divine Sun
may thereby caſt the influence of its
Love-beams into the ſoule; and alſo therewith ſtirre up, and open
the great Magnetick hunger of the ſoule (being the true Divine

            <p>2. Being I have often underſtood by your deare friend, <hi>D. K.</hi>
and alſo obſerved in my preſence with you, that you in the drawing
of the Father do bear a peculiar thirſt, and an earneſt ſincere long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after his life, which he, out of his higheſt Love hath manifeſted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58072:10"/>
in Chriſt Jeſus; therefore I would not (upon the deſire of Mr. <hi>D.</hi>
and alſo of your ſelfe) omit from a member-like, and mutuall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to viſit and ſalute you with a ſhort Epiſtle, and ſo to recreate,

that our Paradiſicall Corall flouriſheth, and bringeth forth
fruit in my fellow-members, to our eternall recreation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p>3. And hereupon Sir, I will declare unto you, out of my ſmall
gifts and knowledge: <hi>What a Chriſtian is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wherefore hee is called
a Chriſtian;</hi> Namely, that he onely is a Chriſtian, who is become ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of this high Title in himſelfe; and hath reſigned himſelfe with
his inward ground,<note place="margin">☞</note> minde, and will to the Free grace in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
and is in the will of his ſoule become as a young child, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
longeth after the Breaſts of the Mother, that ſincerely panteth
after the Mother, and ſucketh the breaſts of the Mother whereof
it liveth.</p>
            <p>4. Even thus alſo that man is onely a Chriſtian, whoſe ſoule and
minde entereth againe into the firſt Mother, whence the life of man
hath its riſe; <hi>Viz.</hi> into the Eternall Word, which hath manifeſted
it ſelfe with the true Milk of ſalvation in our humanity (being blind
in regard of God) and ſucketh this Milk of the Mother into his
hungry ſoule, whence the new ſpirituall man ariſeth; and thereby
the fiery [dark, and dry] ſoule, proceeding from the Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
doth reach and obtaine the place of Gods love, in which
place the Father begetteth his beloved Sonne; and therein onely
the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, which dwelleth in us, is found; and
therein alſo the ſpirituall mouth [or beleeving deſire] of the ſoul,
which eateth Chriſts fleſh, and drinketh his blood, is underſtood,
or experimentally and eſſentially enjoyed.</p>
            <p>5. For he onely is a Chriſtian, in whom Chriſt dwelleth, liveth,
and hath his Being, in whom Chriſt as to the internall ground of his
ſoule is ariſen,<note place="margin">☞</note> and made alive in the heavenly Eſſence, which did
diſappeare and depart in <hi>Adam;</hi> even he, I ſay, is onely a Chriſtian
that hath put on Chriſts Victory (that is to ſay, Chriſts Incarnation,
Humanity, Sufferings, death, and Reſurrection, againſt the anger
of God; and alſo Hell, Devill, Death, and Sinne) in his eternall
ground, where the Seed of the Woman, to wit, Chriſt in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
doth alſo conquer in him, and daily trampleth upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
head in the wicked carnall will, and killeth the ſinfull luſts of

ſtrange merit of grace [or application of promiſes] imputed

child-like regenerating, innate, in-dwelling member-like, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Grace: Where Chriſt the conquerour of death doth ariſe in Us
with his life Eſſence, and power from Our death, and hath his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
ruling influence and operation in us, as a branch on its Vine;
as the Writings of the Apoſtles doe throughout witneſſe.</p>
            <p>7. He is farre from a Chriſtian, who onely comforteth himſelfe
with the Paſſion,<note place="margin">☞</note> Death, and Satisfaction of Chriſt, and doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and impute it to himſelfe as a pardon or gift of favour, and yet
remaineth ſtill an unregenerated, wilde, [worldly, and ſenſuall]
Beaſt; ſuch a Chriſtian is every ungodly Man: For every one would
faine be ſaved through a gift of favour, the Devill alſo would very
willingly be an Angell againe by grace received and applyed from
without.</p>
            <p>8. But to turne, and become as a child, and be borne anew of
Gods grace-water of love, and the holy Ghoſt, that pleaſeth him
not. Even ſo it pleaſeth not the Titular Chriſtian, who will put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himſelfe the mantle of Chriſts grace [and apply his merits unto
himſelfe by an Hiſtoricall laying claime to a promiſe] and yet will
not enter into the Adoption and New birth; albeit Chriſt ſaith,
that he cannot otherwiſe ſee the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>9. For what is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and cannot inherit the
Kingdome of God, <hi>John 3. To be fleſhly minded is enmity againſt God,
but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace:</hi> And he onely heareth
Gods Word, that is borne of God, for onely the ſpirit of grace in
Chriſt heareth Gods Word.</p>
            <p>10. For,<note place="margin">☜</note> no man hath ever ſeen God; the Sonne alone who is
in the unmeaſurable boſome of the Father, declareth unto us the
Word and Will of God in our ſelves; ſo that we heare and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his will and good pleaſure within our ſelves, and are willing to
follow the ſame, yet we are often kept back by the outward ſinfull
fleſh; ſo that the operation or effecting of that ſame Divine power
[purpoſe, and godly reſolution in our mind] doth not alwayes
come into the outward Figure, yet it goeth into the inward Figure,
in the inward ſpirituall World; concerning which, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Our converſation is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. Of which alſo all the Saints of God, and eſpecially S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi>
hath complained, that they had an earneſt ſyncere will, and did
ſerve God with the minde of the internall Ground; but with the fleſh
the Law of ſinne; ſo that the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, which
luſt and evill concupiſcence is daily drowned, and mortified in the
death of Chriſt, by the inward ground [or the centre of light rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58072:11"/>
in the darke abyſſe of the ſoule] but this is in thoſe onely
in whom Chriſt is ariſen from death; and thus there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus; who walke not after the
fleſh, but after the ſpirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the beſtiall body belongeth to
the earth, but the ſpirituall body belongeth to God; but whoſoever
hath it not, he is dead while he liveth, and neither heareth, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
any thing, of the ſpirit of God; It is fooliſhneſſe to him as
the Scripture ſaith.</p>
            <p>12. Therefore this point is not ſufficiently underſtood and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by teaching and maintaining onely and alone an outward recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and application of grace and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of ſinne, and the receiving of us into filiall adoption and grace,
conſiſteth in the juſtifying blood,<note place="margin">☞</note> and death of Chriſt, when Chriſts
heavenly blood tinctured us; and with the higheſt love of the Deity
in the name Jeſu, did overcome the anger of God in our ſoule,
and inward divine ground, proceeding from the Eſſence of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and did turne it againe into the Divine humility, meekneſſe,
and obedience; whereby the rent, torne, and divided temperature
of our humane property [and ſpirit] of obedience and good will
entered again into the harmony and unity of the properties [<hi>Viz.</hi>
into Paradiſicall light, love, and life, that <hi>Reall Temperature,</hi> where
variety doth concenter and accord in unity.]</p>
            <p>13. And even then the wrath of the Father (which was awaked
in the properties of our life, and had ſet it ſelfe to be Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in ſoule and body, whereby we were dead to the Kingdome of
Heaven, and become children of wrath) was turned againe into the
unanimous love, likeneſſe, and unity of God; and our own humane
will, dyed in the death of Chriſt, from its ſelfneſſe, and ſelviſh willing;
and the firſt humane will (which God breathed from his ſpirit into
<hi>Adam</hi>) did ſpring forth afreſh through the conqueſt of Gods ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
[and love] in Chriſts heavenly blood;<note place="margin">☞</note> and then the Devill,
and Hell, which held men captive, were confounded, and made a
ſcorn: This the dry Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which budded in one night, and
bare ſweet Almonds, did typifie.</p>
            <p>14. Now as Sinne came from One, and paſſed from one upon
all, ſo alſo the ſweet grace and victory in Chriſt, paſſed, preſſed, and
pierced from one upon all: Now this death and the anger [of God]
was broken in pieces in that one <hi>Adamicall</hi> ſoul in Chriſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> and a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
to grace was opened through the diſcloſing of death, through
which diſcloſed gate, the will of the ſoule may re-enter into its firſt
Mother (whence it came in the beginning) that is into the filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
adoption, or regeneration of a new life, and will; and there
it may attaine the ſweet blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which in Chriſt did
diſcloſe or break open the gate of death, and changed the anger
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58072:11"/>
of God in our humanity in himſelfe into love, wherein the poore
captive ſoule drinketh out of Gods fountaine; and doth allay, and
ſweeten its fire-breath, whence the new Paradiſicall budd ſpringeth
forth, and there the hunger, and deſire of the ſoule is made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
and eſſentiall in the blood of Chriſt, after an Heavenly
manner.</p>
            <p>15. Now as the diſcloſing of death muſt be done in the perſon of
Chriſt himſelfe in our ſoule, and humanity; ſo that the eternity
in Chriſt (wherewith he was come from heaven, and was alſo in
heaven, <hi>John</hi> 3.) overcame the time (<hi>Viz.</hi> the life and will of the
time) and did change time with its will into the eternall will of the
Deity; and all this muſt be brought to paſſe in our received huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
So likewiſe the deſire of our ſoule muſt receive into it ſelfe
that ſame eternall will in Chriſt (wherein time and eternity ſtand
in equall agreement and harmony) and through the power of the
ſame, immerſe, or caſt it ſelfe into the adoption of free grace in
Chriſt; that the ſame inward Paradiſicall ground which dyed in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
might again ſpring forth in the will of the obedience of Chriſt,
through his heavenly, and from us aſſumed humane blood.</p>
            <p>16. The atonement and expiation muſt be made manifeſt, and
experimentall in our ſelves through that atonement which Chriſt

Chriſts fleſh and blood; for he is, and liveth in Chriſt, Chriſt is his

and if the hunger of my ſoules Faith doth comprehend him in his
promiſed Word, then I put him on in his whole proceſſe of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in my inward ground, and forthwith the mortification and
killing of the anger, Devill, Death, and Hell, beginneth and goeth
forward from the power of Chriſts death in me.</p>
            <p>23. For I can do nothing,<note place="margin">☜</note> I am dead to my ſelfe, but Chriſt doth
it in me; when he ariſeth in me, then I am dead to my ſelfe, in reſpect
of the true man, &amp; he is my life, and in that I live, I live to him &amp; not
to my ſelfehood; for grace mortifieth my own will, and ſetteth it ſelf
up for a Lord in the place of my ſelfeneſſe, that ſo I may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of God, who doth therewith what he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>24. And then I live in two Kingdomes, <hi>Viz.</hi> with my newborne
ſpirit of life, or ſpirituall man, in Paradiſe, in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58072:12"/>
in the inward ſpirituall World, and with the outward mortall
man, in the vanity of time, in the Kingdome of this World, in the
dominion of the Starres and Elements, in the contrariety, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
diſcord of the properties, wherein the yoake of ſinne yet
liveth; this Chriſt taketh upon himſelfe in the inward Kingdome of
the Divine World, and helpeth my ſoule to beare it.</p>
            <p>25. For the yoak of this World, is Chriſts burthen which he muſt
beare, untill he ſhall againe deliver up the Kingdome to his Father,
which he hath given him;<note place="margin">☞</note> for he ſayd, <hi>All power in Heaven and Earth,
is given to me of my Father;</hi> ſo alſo this burthen or charge is layd
upon him, that he ſhould beare Gods Anger, Hell, death, and all
Evill in us, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee tooke on him our diſeaſes, and carryed
our ſorrows;</hi> but we eſteemed him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and
afflicted.</p>
            <p>26. And hence it is that a Chriſtian muſt be a bearer of the croſſe,
for ſo ſoone as Chriſt is borne in him, the aſſaulting of Hell, and the
anger of God in the eternall nature beginneth, and then the Hell in
man is deſtroyed, and the Serpent is troden under foot; whence
great unquietneſſe,<note place="margin">☞</note> perſecution, and reproach from the Devill and
the corrupt World doth ariſe againſt the outward ſinfull man, and
even then the outward ſinfull man muſt ſuffer it ſelfe to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and judged to damnation by the children of Anger, and by
Gods ſevere juſtice in the anger; ſeeing that another man liveth in
him, which is not like and conformable to the outward mortall man;
and ſo Gods Juſtice executeth its judgement in the anger upon the
houſe of ſinne; and alſo all the Miniſters of Gods wrath, doe helpe
the execution thereof.</p>
            <p>27. And even then, Chriſt helpeth to beare the yoak, and man is
Sacrificed in Chriſts proceſſe, contempt, and ſcorne, in his ſuffering
and death, to the juſtice of God in the anger, and becomes confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to Chriſts Image.</p>
            <p>28. The holy Scripture witneſſeth in all places that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from ſinnes by Faith in Chriſt, and not by the workes of our
merit; but by the blood and death of Chriſt, which indeed is ſo
taught by many, but rightly underſtood of few that teach us ſo.</p>
            <p>29. We are taught indeed an imputed grace, but what faith is,
and how it is begotten, and what it is in its Eſſence, reall Being, and
Subſtance, and how it layeth hold on the merit of Chriſt with the
grace; herein the greateſt part are dumbe and blinde, and depend
on an Hiſtoricall Faith (<hi>James</hi> 2.) which is onely a bare knowledge
or literall conjecture, and therewith the man of ſinne doth tickle
and comfort himſelfe, and through an imagination, and blind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
doth flatter and ſooth up himſelfe, and calls himſelfe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
though he is not yet become either capable or worthy, of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58072:13"/>
this ſo high a title, but is onely a titular Nominall Chriſtian, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
cloathed with Chriſts <hi>Purpur-Mantle;</hi> of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>They draw neere to mee with their lips, but their
heart is farre from me:</hi> And Chriſt ſayd, <hi>Not all that ſay Lord, Lord,
ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven but they that doe the will of my
Father in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>30. Now Chriſt alone is the will of the Father in whom the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> grace and adoption confiſteth, and none can doe the
love will of the Father, ſave alone that onely throne of grace, Chriſt
himſelfe, as the holy Scripture declareth, no man can call God
Lord, without the holy ſpirit in him.</p>
            <p>31. For we know not, what and how to pray before God as wee
ought, but he, even the holy ſpirit in Chriſt, maketh interceſſion for
us, with unutterable ſighes before God in our ſelves, as it pleaſeth
God; we cannot attaine any thing by our willing, and knowing; he
is too deeply hidden from us, for it lyeth not in any mans knowing,
willing, running and ſearching, but in Gods Mercy.</p>
            <p>32. Now there is no mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but onely in Chriſt, and if I ſhall
reach that mercy,<note place="margin">☞</note> then I muſt reach Chriſt in me; are my ſinnes to
be deſtroyed in me? Then muſt Chriſt doe it in me with his blood
and death, with his victory over Hell: <hi>Am I to beleeve? then muſt
the ſpirit, deſire, and will of Chriſt, beleeve in my deſire, and will, for I
cannot beleeve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>33. But he receiveth my will being reſigned to him, and comprehends
it in his owne will and bringeth it through his victory into God, and there
he intercedeth for the will of my ſoule in his owne will before God; and ſo
I am received as a child of grace in his will of love.</p>
            <p>34. For the Father hath manifeſted his love in Chriſt, and Chriſt
manifeſteth that ſame love in my will being reſigned to him; Chriſt
draweth my will into himſelfe, and cloatheth it with his blood, and
death, and tinctureth it with the higheſt tincture of the Divine
power, and ſo it is changed into an Angelicall Image, and getteth
a Divine life.</p>
            <p>35. And forthwith that ſame life beginneth to hunger after its
body, which body is the degenerated fiery ſoule, into which the
will in Chriſt is entered, ſo that the new life in Chriſt doth now alſo
tincture the ſoule; whereby the ſoule in the ſpirit and property of
this [new] will obtaineth a right Divine hunger, and is made to
long after, and deſire the Divine grace, and begins to behold and
conſider in the ſpirit of his Divine will in Chriſt, what ſhee is, and
how ſhee in her propertyes, inclinations, and diſpoſitions is departed
from God, and lyeth captivate in the wrath of God; and then ſhee
acknowledgeth her abominations, and alſo her deformity in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Gods Angels, and findeth that ſhe hath nothing wherewith
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58072:13"/>
ſhee is able to protect her ſelfe, for ſhee ſees that ſhee ſtandeth in
the jawes of death, and hell; encompaſſed with evill ſpirits, which
continually ſhoot the ſtrong influence of their evill deſires into her,
to deſtroy and corrupt her.</p>
            <p>36. And then ſhe diveth into that ſame new-borne ſpirit of the
will, and wholy immerſeth her ſelfe into very humility it ſelfe; and
ſo the ſpirit of Chriſt taketh hold of her, and bringeth her into the
ſpirit of this new will, ſo that the ſoule eſſentially, and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
feeleth and findeth him, whereupon the Divine glymps, and
beame of joy ariſeth in the ſoule, being a new eye, in which the dark
fiery ſoule conceiveth the Ens and Eſſence of the Divine light in her
ſelfe, and thereupon hungreth and thirſteth after the grace of God,
and entreth into an effectuall repentance and ſorrow, and bewaileth
the evill which it hath committed.</p>
            <p>37. And in this hunger and thirſt it receiveth Chriſts fleſh and
blood, for the ſpirit of the New will (which in the beginning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the grace of Chriſt, and which Chriſt received into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe)
becommeth now ſubſtantiall and eſſentiall, by the magnetick
impreſſure, hunger, and deſire, of the ſoule.</p>
            <p>38. And this eſſentiality is called <hi>Sophia,</hi> being the eſſentiall
wiſedome, or the body of Chriſt; and in this the faith in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt doth conſiſt; <hi>Here Chriſt and the Soule, beleeve in one
Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>39. For true Faith doth not conſiſt in thoughts, or in meere aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting

               <hi>Viz.</hi> That a man impreſſeth [or imagineth

clingeth to his merits and righteouſneſſe, without the innate
righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and life of God eſſentially working in him,
and begetting him to a new creature] for Faith is a receiving of the
promiſed grace in Chriſt, it receiveth Chriſt into it ſelfe; it doth
impreſſe him into its hunger, with his heavenly fleſh and blood, with
the grace which God offereth in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>40. Chriſt feedeth the ſoule with the Eſſence of <hi>Sophia, Viz.</hi>
with his owne fleſh and blood, according to his ſaying, whoſoever
eateth not of the fleſh of the Sonne of Man, he hath no life in him,
but whoſoever eateth the ſame, he abideth in him.</p>
            <p>41. And herein the Teſtaments of Chriſt, and alſo the right

bring us poore men into Opinions, to contemne and reproach one
another (crying downe, and holding one another for Hereticks
and Fantaſticks that bindeth not his conſcience to our mentall Idoll
or Opinion) ſo that we ſtrive, and wrangle about the huske, and
in the meane time loſe love, and faith, and attaine not the new
birth.</p>
            <p>53. Our whole Religion is but a child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>like worke; namely, that
we wholly forſake,<note place="margin">☞</note> and diſclaime our owne knowing, willing, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
diſputing [and forged concluſions of blinde hypocriticall
Reaſon, which bewitcheth the naturall minde to the forme, and frame

ſelves to enter into, and perſevere in the way which bringeth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to our owne native Countrey which we loſt [in <hi>Adam</hi> when
he with his minde and full will went out of Paradiſe into the ſpirit
of this tranſitory World;] and ſo returne to our Mother, which in
the beginning did beget us, and bring us forth out of her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>54. Now if we will doe this, then we muſt not come to her in
our owne ſelfe will,<note place="margin">☞</note> and way, in Pride, and Oſtentation, in aplaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our ſelves, in contempt of her children, our fellow-Chriſtians,
and fellow-members; For we are the loſt Sonne, who is become a
Swineheard, and have ſhamefully miſ-ſpent our Patrimony with the
fatted Hogs of the Devill, and the World: We muſt enter into our
ſelves, and well conſider our ſelves, and our Fathers houſe; and we
muſt ſet before us the mirrour, or looking glaſſe of the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell;
and ſee how far we are departed from Gods righteouſneſſe, and
alſo from [unſeigned, impartiall]<note n="*" place="margin">Which loveth all our brethren through ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our heart whereto it is inclined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58072:15"/>
55. Now, when we doe this, wee ſhall finde in our ſelves many
hundred evill Beaſts, which we have ſet up in Gods ſtead, and doe
honour and love the ſame above God; and even then we ſhall ſee
what hideous horrible Beaſts were manifeſt in <hi>Adam</hi> by falſe luſt, or
imagination; and wherefore God ſayd to <hi>Adam, The Seede of the
Woman ſhall breake the Serpents head;</hi> to wit, the Monſtrous
Beaſts.</p>
            <p>56. As firſt, we ſhall ſee in our Deſire the proud Lucifer, who is
departed from Divine and brotherly humility, and contemneth the
members of his body, and hath ſet himſelfe to be a God and Lord
over them, in whom there is no Divine love, to love either God, or
his Brother.</p>
            <p>57. Secondly, we ſhall find a Beaſt in our propertyes, reſembling
the coveteous greedy Swine, which will take all to it ſelfe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
devour and poſſeſſe all, and deſireth more then it needeth;
wherewith the proud Lucifer might be able to vapour, brag, and
vaunt himſelfe, that he is a God over<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Every thing.</note> Subſtance, and that he can
domineer, having power and might over his fellow branches; and
we ſhall ſee how this proud Lucifer hath broken himſelfe off from
the Tree of life, and the mutuall growth and increaſe of love, and
would be a Tree of himſelfe; and therefore hee is a withered dry
branch in reſpect to God.</p>
            <p>58. Thirdly, we ſhall finde the poyſonfull envious Serpent in our
properties, which teareth, and rageth as a poyſon; I meane, Envy,
which wiſheth no man ſo well, as it ſelfe; which ſtingeth, rageth,
and rideth in other mens hearts, and ſlandereth them with words,
and onely applaudeth its owne haughty Lucyfer, and tearmeth its
falſehood [and cunning hypocriſie] an Angell of God.</p>
            <p>59. Fourthly, We ſhall finde in our properties, the fiery Dragon
ſitting in helliſh fire, I meane Anger, which (if covetouſneſſe and
envy cannot obtaine that which it would have) will lay violent hands
upon it, and take it by force, and is ſo raging madd, that it burſteth
its life for very malice and iniquity, and breakes in pieces in fiery
malice, and is a very dry branch on the Tree; and is onely fit for
the fire.</p>
            <p>60. Fifthly, We ſhall finde many hundred evill Beaſts in our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
which Pride loveth, and honoureth, more then God; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe
draweth them to it ſelfe for a Treaſure, wherewith Pride
vapoureth and vaunteth as if they were Gods; and thereby doth
withdraw ſuſtenance and comfort from his Brothers life; ſo that he
is forced to ſpend it in miſery, trouble, and perplexity, by reaſon of
<hi>his</hi> violence and extortion.</p>
            <p>61. Now when a man doth thus behold himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this mirror of
ſelfehood, and perceiveth theſe evill Beaſts; then let him rightly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58072:16"/>
imagine to himſelfe that he is deeply guilty of them, and thereby
conſider the greevous fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and thinke, that all theſe evill
deſires, and vaine imaginations doe wholly take their riſe and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
in him, from the Monſter of the Serpent, through the influence,
and inſinuation of the Devill into our firſt Parents.</p>
            <p>62. For all the properties of the deſires lay in one harmony and
ſtedfaſt unity in <hi>Adam;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> and the one loved the other, and were in
mutuall agreement, but ſuch falſe deſires are riſen in Man through
the envy of the Devill, who ſtirred up the falſe luſt and imagination
in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to prove the unequality [in the property and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the mixed World] and to taſte what good and evill was; to
feele heate and cold, and to try the multitude and variety of the
properties; ſo that now theſe deſires doe attract, long after, and
deſire that which is like to themſelves; and every deſire of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertyes,
is a ſeverall hunger of life in man, which hath broken it ſelfe
off from the harmonious unity; and oppoſeth the love, likeneſſe,
and mutuall ſociety of its fellow branches, or brethren, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly
deſireth to draw their life and maintenance to it ſelfe, and
to make it ſelfe a Lord over it, and will be a Selfeiſt.</p>
            <p>63. All which is contrary to the Divine will and ground, and is a
perjury againſt God; yea, it oppoſeth the courſe and order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as we ſee by the Trees and Plants of the Earth; how all ſtand,
and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow lovingly one by another, and rejoyce in one Mother; and
how one branch on the Tree doth impart its ſap and power to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and mutually ſerve each other.</p>
            <p>64. For in ſuch a lovely equality and harmony the life of Man
(<hi>John</hi> 1.) was inſpired out of the eternall Word into the humane
Image, being out of the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth: So that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertyes
of the life ſtood in an equall proportion in the temperature;
in <hi>one Love,</hi> and mutually loved each other.</p>
            <p>65. But when the Devill mixed his poyſon, and falſe deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
the propertyes of life were divided into many deſires: whence
ſtrife, diſcord, ſickneſſe, infirmityes, the cumberſome groſſeneſſe
and mortall frailty of the body is riſen through the falſe deſire, and
inſinuation of the Beſtiall propertyes; by reaſon whereof the Image
of God (which was from the heavenly Eſſence) diſappeared; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which God ſayd unto them, <hi>In that day that thou eateſt of the
Tree of the knowledge of good, and evill, thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi>
That is, thou ſhalt dye to the Kingdome of God, as it alſo came to
paſſe.</p>
            <p>66. And we muſt really<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Conſider with our ſelves.</note> imagine to our ſelves that this Beſtiall
falſe deſire in man, is the Monſter of the Serpent, and an enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, and the Kingdome of Heaven, and that we therein are
onely the children of Hell, and of the Anger of God, and cannot
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58072:16"/>
therein inherite, or poſſeſſe the Kingdome of God; neither is God
manifeſt in any ſuch deſire; but onely his anger and the property of
the darke, and earthly World; and we live therein onely to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of this World, and ſtand therewith onely upon the abyſſe of
the darke World and the anger of God: that is, of Hell, which
continually gapeth and hungereth after theſe propertyes, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
theſe propertyes its owne fruits, and children, which it ſhall
reape and take into its Barne; for they doe belong unto it by the
right of nature; for theſe deſires are all originally from it, and
have their roote in the ground of Hell and deſtruction, and indeed
no where elſe.</p>
            <p>67. Therefore ſayd Chriſt, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe a man be borne anew, hee ſhall
not ſee the Kingdome of God:</hi> All theſe falſe wills and deſires are
predeſtinated to damnation; if any will ſee God, he muſt bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and become as a child, and be new borne in the holy Ghoſt,
through the water of eternall life: <hi>Viz.</hi> through the heavenly <hi>Ens,</hi>
which God hath revealed in Chriſt; that the firſt right man, which
dyed in <hi>Adam</hi> (proceeding from the heavenly Worlds Eſſence)
might againe ſpring forth in Chriſt, and become living.</p>
            <p>68. All theſe evill Beaſts are condemned, and muſt dye in us, and
though their deſire doth ſomewhat cleave and ſtick unto us in the
fleſh, yet they muſt all be mortyfied during this [life] time in the
ſoule: <hi>Viz.</hi> In the inward ground, and the inward ground of the
ſoule muſt be Tinctured by the true Tincture in the blood of Chriſt;
that the propertyes of the internall Ground may againe live in
harmony and concord, for otherwiſe they cannot reach the Deity
in themſelves.</p>
            <p>69. Now when man knoweth this, he cannot better be rid of his
evill beaſtiall deſires,<note place="margin">☞</note> then that be preſently at the ſame inſtant bring
himſelfe with his whole ſtrength into ſuch a ſtrong will, and earneſt

beaſts of the Devill, ſeeing they are onely the Devils ſervants;
and that he will returne into his loſt countrey, into the adoption and
atonement, and eſteeme, and looke upon himſelfe no otherwiſe,
then as the loſt Swineheard [or the prodigall Sonne] for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
is the loſt Swineheard and no whit better, and forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
with the converſion of his ſoule, to the Father, in deepeſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
with acknowledgement of his unworthineſſe; in that he hath
ſo ſhamefully, and unworthily miſ-ſpent and miſ-improved the free
inheritance of Chriſts merits, and ſo enter into repentance.</p>
            <p>70. Let him with all his ſtrength give up his earneſt will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that he from this very time forward, will repent and amend,
and no longer love theſe evill Beaſts; but this muſt be in earneſt, in
reall ſincerity without delayes, and not to thinke of a day, weeke,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58072:17"/>
or yeare; but his minde muſt utterly and continually condemne
them to the damnation of death, and not will to love them any more,
but count them enemyes, and ſo reſolve to turne himſelfe to the
mercy and grace of God.</p>
            <p>71. When this is done (I ſpeake as I have highly knowne it in the
precious light of grace) that then he may turne himſelfe to earneſt
praying in humility, and beſeech God for grace; and though his
heart ſaith utterly, no; and the Devill ſayth, ſtay yet a while, it is
not now good and convenient, thou wilt have better opportunity
to morrow; and when to morrow commeth, then ſayth he, againe
to morrow, and ſuggeſteth to the fleſh, ſaying, Thou muſt firſt doe
this, or that; gather firſt a treaſure for thy ſelfe, that thou mayſt
not need the World, and then enter into ſuch a life; yet I ſay, the

in all his power, ability, and poſſeſſions, but as a ſervant and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

            <p>73. For ſo ſoone as he is able to maſter and overcome the proud

likewiſe a great deſire and hunger after them.</p>
            <p>3. Which on my part doth highly rejoyce me, that God doth

thus draw and lead his children; as tis written, Thoſe, who are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

            <p>5. But I will not conceale from you the ſimple child-like way,
which I walke in Chriſt Jeſus; for I can write nothing of my ſelfe,
but as of a childe, which neither knoweth or underſtandeth any
thing; neither hath ever been learned, but onely that which the
Lord vouchſafeth to know in me; according to the meaſure, as hee
manifeſts himſelfe in me.</p>
            <p>6. For I never deſired to know any thing of the Divine Myſtery,
much leſſe underſtood I the way how to ſeeke or finde it; I knew
nothing of it, as tis the condition of poore Lay men in their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
I ſought onely after the heart of Jeſus Chriſt, that I might
hide my ſelfe therein from the wrathfull anger of God, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
aſſaults of the Devill; and I beſought the Lord earneſtly for
his holy ſpirit, and his grace, that he would be pleaſed to bleſſe and
guide me in him; and take that away from me, which did turne me
away from him, and I reſigned my ſelfe wholy to him, that I might
not live to my owne will, but to his; and that hee onely might lead

very hardly apprehend the ſame in my externall Man, and expreſſe
it with the Pen; yet however I muſt begin to labour in theſe great
Myſteryes as a Childe that goeth to Schoole: I ſaw it (as in a great
Deep) in the internall, for I had a thorow view of the Univerſe,
as in a CHAOS, wherein all things are couched, and wrapt
up, but it was impoſſible for mee to explicate and unfold the
ſame.</p>
            <p>10. Yet it opened it ſelfe in me from time to time, as in a young
Plant; albeit the ſame was with me for the ſpace of twelve yeares,
and I was as it were<note n="†" place="margin">

            <p>11. However, afterward the Sun did ſhine on me a good while,
but not in a continuall conſtant manner; for when the ſame did hide
it ſelfe, I ſcarce knew, or well underſtood my owne labour [or

not his owne, or from himſelfe, but Gods, and from God; and
that God knoweth [or manifeſts the Ideas of his Wiſedome]

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58072:19"/>
according to the providence of the moſt High, that I entruſted a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
perſon with ſome of it; by meanes whereof, it was publiſhed,
and made knowne without my knowledge and conſent, and the firſt
Booke (called <hi>Aurora</hi>) was thereby<note n="*" place="margin">By Gregory Richter, Lord Primate of Gerlitz.</note> taken from me; and becauſe
many wonderfull things were revealed therein (which the mind of
man was not preſently capable to comprehend) I was faint to ſuffer
much, from <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. I ſaw this firſt Booke no more in three yeares; I ſuppoſed
that it was dead, and gone; till certaine learned men ſent me ſome
Copies of it, who exhorted me to proceed, and manifeſt my Talent;
to which, the <hi>outward Reaſon</hi> would by no meanes agree, becauſe it
had ſuffered ſo much already, for it; moreover, the ſpirit of <hi>Reaſon</hi>
was very weake, and timorous, for my High light was for a good
while alſo withdrawne from me; and it did glow in me as a hidden
fire:<note place="margin">☜</note> So that I felt nothing, but anguiſh and perplexity within me:
Outwardly I found contempt, and inwardly a fiery inſtigation; yet
I was not able to comprehend [that light] till the breath [or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration]
of the moſt High did helpe me to it againe, and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
new life in me, and then I obtained a better ſtyle in writing, alſo
deeper, and more grounded knowledge; I could bring every thing
better into the outward expreſſion: which the Book, treating of the
Threefold life<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to.</note> through the three Principles, doth demonſtrate;
and the godly Reader, whoſe heart is opened, ſhall ſee [that
it is ſo.]</p>
            <p>14, Thus now I have written, not from the inſtruction, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
received from men; not from the learning, or reading of
Bookes; but I have written out of my own Book which was opened
in me, being the Noble ſimilitude of God, the Booke of the Noble
and precious Image (underſtand Gods owne ſimilitude, or likeneſſe)
was beſtowed upon me, to Read; and therein I have ſtudied, as a
child in the houſe of its Mother, which beholdeth what the Father
doth, and in his child-like play, doth imitate his Father; I have no
need of any other Booke.</p>
            <p>15.<note place="margin">☞</note> My Booke hath onely three leaves,<note place="margin">Note, what man can finde in himſelfe.</note> the ſame are the three
Principles of Eternity, wherein I can finde all whatſoever <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and the Prophets; Chriſt, and his Apoſtles have taught, and ſpoken;
I can finde therein the foundation of the World, and all Myſteryes;
yet not I, but the ſpirit of God doth it according to the meaſure,
as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>16. For I have beſought, and begged of him many hundred times,
that if my knowledge did not make for his glory, and conduce to
the<note n="*" place="margin">Bettering or benefit.</note> amending, and inſtructing of my Brethren, he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to take it from me, and preſerve mee onely in his love; yet I
found, that by my praying, or earneſt deſiring, I did onely enkindle
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58072:20"/>
the fire more ſtrongly in me; and in ſuch inflamation, knowledge,
and manifeſtation, I made my Writings.</p>
            <p>17. Yet I did not intend to make my ſelfe knowne with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſuch Perſons, as now I ſee is come to paſſe; I ſtill thought
I wrote for my ſelfe onely; albeit the ſpirit of God, in the Myſtery
of God, in my ſpirit, did ſufficiently ſhew me to what end it was; yet
outward Reaſon was alwayes oppoſite, ſave onely ſometimes when
the morning Starre did ariſe, and even then Reaſon was alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
enkindled, and did dance along, as if it had comprehended [the
Pearl,] yet it was far from it.</p>
            <p>☞ 18. God dwelleth in the Noble Image, but not in the ſpirit of
the Stars, and Elements; he poſſeſſeth nothing, ſave himſelfe onely,
in his owne likeneſſe; and albeit he doth poſſeſſe ſomething (as
indeed he poſſeſſeth all things) yet nothing comprehends him, but
what doth Originally ariſe and ſpring from him; as namely, the
ſoule in the ſimilitude of God.</p>
            <p>19. Beſides, all my Writings are like unto a young Schollers, that
is going to Schoole; God hath according to his will brought my
ſoule into a wonderfull Schoole; and in truth I cannot aſcribe, or
arrogate any thing unto my ſelfe, as if my ſelfehood were, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
any thing.</p>
            <p>20 No man muſt conceive higher of me, then he ſeeth; for the
worke in my ſtudying,<note place="margin">☜</note> or Writing, is none of mine; I have it onely
according to the meaſure as the Lord is pleaſed to give it me; I am
nothing but his inſtrument, whereby he effecteth what he willeth:
This I relate unto you my beloved Friends, for an inſtruction, and

Inſtitutions of the Univerſities, and high Schooles; which I doe not

it is good and evill, is is like the winde, which is moved and driven
too and fro; it<note n="*" place="margin">Highly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</note> eſteemeth mans judgement; and according as
the high and great ones, who have the reſpect and authority of the
World doe judge and cenſure, juſt ſo it gives its credit, and verdict:
It knoweth not the mind of the Lord, becauſe the ſame is not in it;
its underſtanding is from the Starres, and tis nothing elſe but a
counterfeite ſhadow of phanſie, in compariſon of the Divine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>23. How can he judge of Divine matters, in whom the ſpirit of
the Lord is not?<note place="margin">☞</note> The ſpirit of the Lord doth alone try, prove, and
judge all things, for to him onely all things are known, and manifeſt;
but Reaſon judgeth outwardly, and one Reaſon doth alwayes ſquare
its judgement, and opinion, according to another; the Inferiour
judgeth and cenſureth as his grand Superiour; the Lay-man as the
Doctor; and yet none of them both apprehend the Senſe, Minde,
and truth of the Lord, without the Spirit of God, which judgeth in
Man; and reſpects no mans perſon: the Lay-man, and the Doctor
are both one to him.</p>
            <p>24. Now whereas the Children of God have diverſe and manifold
gifts in Writing,<note place="margin">☜</note> Speaking, and judging; and they have not all one
manner of expreſſion, phraſe, and ſtyle; whereupon ſelfe Reaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
doth by artificiall concluſions draw out of them, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
for its owne turne, and frameth a Babell to it ſelfe; whence
ſuch a multitude and weariſome heape of opinions are riſen; ſo that
men out of their Writings have forged, and invented diverſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
and wayes unto God; and men muſt be forced to goe in
thoſe wayes, whereby ſuch controverſies and unchriſtian contentions
are ariſen; that men for the preſent looke onely upon the ſtrife of
words, and diſputes, about the Letter, and thoſe which according
to their Reaſon and Principles doe overcome by Verball jangling,
and exchanging Scripture for Scripture, are applauded; but this is
nothing but Babel, a Mother of ſpirituall whoredome, where Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
entereth not in at the doore of Chriſt, through Chriſts ſpirit;
but preſſeth in of it ſelfe,<note place="margin">☜</note> and climeth up by its owne might, ſtrength,
and pride, being yet a ſtranger, or unregenerated; and would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
faine be the faireſt Child in the houſe; men muſt honour, and
adore it.</p>
            <p>25. The children of God have a diverſity of gifts, according to
the Rule of the Apoſtle;<note place="margin">☞</note> God giveth an expreſſion to every one as
he pleaſeth; the gifts and endowments of men fall out according to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58072:21"/>
the unſearchable will of God, and ſpring altogether out of one
Root; the which is the Mother of the Three Principles; and as the
ſpirit of every ſoule is Conſtellated in the eternall Mother, even ſo is
its revelation, apprehenſion, and knowledge.</p>
            <p>26. For God bringeth not a new, or ſtrange Spirit into us; but
he openeth with his ſpirit our ſpirit;<note place="margin">☞</note> namely, the Myſtery of Gods
Wiſedome, which lyeth in every man according to the meaſure, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and condition of his internall, hidden conſtellation: For Chriſt
ſayd, <hi>My Father worketh, and I alſo worke:</hi> Now the Father worketh
in the Eſſence of the ſoule, property: and the Son in the Eſſence
of Gods owne Image, that is in the Divine Similitude, or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>27. The property of the ſoule belongeth to the Father; For
Chriſt ſayd, <hi>Father, the men were thine, and thou haſt given them mee,
and I give unto them Eternall life:</hi> Seeing then, the property of the
ſoule is from Eternity, of, and from the Father; therefore he hath
wrought in it from Eternity, and ſtill worketh in that ſame Image
to Eternity, light, and darkneſſe, to either of which the <hi>Will</hi> of the
ſoules property doth incline, and give up it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>28. Seeing then, the Fathers property or wiſedome is unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and infinite; and that he being the wiſedome it ſelfe worketh,
and yet through his wiſedome all things doe ariſe; thereupon the
ſoules of men are diverſly Conſtellated; indeed they ariſe, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
proceed out of one onely Eſſence, yet the operation is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
and manifold; all according to Gods wiſedome: Now the
ſpirit of Chriſt openeth the property of every ſoule, ſo that each
ſpeaketh from its owne property, of the wonders in the wiſedome
of God.</p>
            <p>29. For the ſpirit of God maketh no new thing in man, or it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
no ſtrange ſpirit into him;<note place="margin">☞</note> but he ſpeaketh of the wonders in
the wiſedome of God through Man, and that not from the Eternall
Conſtellation onely, but likewiſe from the externall Conſtellation;
that is, through the ſpirit of the externall World, hee openeth in
Man the internall Conſtellation of the ſoule; that he muſt Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and foretell what the externall heaven worketh, and produceth;
alſo he is driven to ſpeak through the <hi>Turba Magna;</hi> as the Prophets
have many times ſpoken, and denounced unto the people their
puniſhment which by Gods permiſſion through the <hi>Turba Magna</hi>
ſhould come upon them for their violence and ſinfulneſſe; [and their
bitter imprecations, wicked contentions and wrathfull indignation
in their envious will one againſt another, doe awaken the Sword
of Anger in the <hi>Turba Magna.</hi>]</p>
            <p>30. Now the ſpirit of God ſpeaketh in his Children, diverſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of wayes;<note place="margin">☞</note> ſometimes in one it ſpeaketh, by the internall, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58072:21"/>
eternall Conſtellation of the ſoule, of eternall puniſhment, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
of Gods Curſe or Bleſſing: and in another, it telleth through
the externall Conſtellation, of the Fortune or Misfortune, of the
proſperity or adverſity of this World; alſo of the riſing and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Powers and Authorities; and then likewiſe of the ruine and
deſtruction of Countries, and Cities, and alſo of ſtrange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
alterations in the World.</p>
            <p>31. And though it hapneth oftentimes, that the ſpirit of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
World doth make its ſport with its repreſentations of phanſie
in Man, and from its owne Might and ſtrong influence doth infinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
it ſelfe into the ſpirit of man, and ſheweth diverſe ſtrange and
marvellous Figures; which onely findes place among thoſe, who
run on in their owne Reaſon onely,<note place="margin">☜</note> in proud ſelfe will; whence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
falſe Prophets ariſe; yet I ſay, that every one ſpeaketh from his
owne Conſtellation; the one through the manifeſtation of Gods
ſpirit, really and ſincerely; and the other through the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the externall <hi>Aſtrall</hi> ſpirit uncertainly by conjecture and
gueſſe; yet from the ſame Conſtellation, but he that ſpeaketh from
the mouth of another, and in like manner judgeth of the <hi>Myſtery,</hi>
without a peculiar knowledge; he is in <hi>Babel,</hi> and entangled in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
wilfully amuſing himſelfe in thoſe things which the heart
findes not experimentally whether they be true or no: [but he <hi>pins
his Faith</hi> upon the ſayings of other men.]</p>
            <p>32. And I ſay further, that all thoſe pretious men, who have been
illuminated of God (ſome of whoſe Writings you may have at hand)
have ſpoken from their manifeſtation, and revelation; each accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his apprehenſion or the Modell of his capacity; yet the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
is the ſoule, and the light is God; the revelation is wrought,
and brought to paſſe by the opening or manifeſtation of Gods ſpirit,
through the Conſtellation of the ſoule.</p>
            <p>33. All the Prophets from the beginning of the World, have
propheſied of Chriſt in different formes, one thus, and another ſo;
they have not all concurred in one ſtyle,<note place="margin">☞</note> phraſe, and forme; but
each according as the ſpirit of God hath revealed to him in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Conſtellation of the ſoule, yet they have all ſpoken out of
one Centre, and Ground: And even ſo it is now adayes, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God ſpeake all from the revelation of Chriſts ſpirit, which
is Gods; and every one according to his capacity, or that Idea of
wiſedome which is formed in his minde; and therefore I put you in

and commend the expreſſion to the <hi>Higheſt Tongue, Viz.</hi> To the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Gods wiſedome, which through the wiſedome, doth open and

pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>35. I judge none, and to condemne any is a falſe, and Idle arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,
and vaine prating; the ſpirit of God himſelfe judgeth all
things; if that be in us, what need we care for prating, I much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rejoyce at the gifts of my brethren; if they have had other
manner of gifts to hold forth, then I, ſhould I therefore judge
them?</p>
            <p>36. Doth any hearb, flower, or tree, ſay unto the other, thou
art ſowre, and darke; I will not ſtand by thee? Have they not all
one Mother whence they grow? Even ſo all ſoules proceed from
One, and all men from one; why then doe we boaſt, and glory to
be the children of God, notwithſtanding that we are more unwiſe
then the Flowers and Hearbs of the field; is it not ſo with us? Doth
not God impart, and reveale his wiſedome to us diverſly? As he
bringeth forth and manifeſteth the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the <hi>Myſtery</hi> in the
Earth, through the <hi>Earth</hi> with faire plants; even ſo <hi>in us Men;</hi> we
ſhould rather congratulate and heartily love one another, that God

            <p>37. The true Tryall of Gods Children is this, which we may
ſecurely,<note place="margin">☞</note> and ſafely follow; namely, an humble heart, that neither
ſeeketh nor honoureth it ſelfe; but continually ſeeketh the good of
his brother in Love; that ſeekes not after its owne profit, pleaſure,
and applauſe; but after righteouſneſſe, and the feare of God: The
plaine and ſingle way to come unto God, is this (ſo farre as is made
knowne to me) <hi>Viz.</hi> That man depart from his ſinfull courſes; and
make with himſelfe an earneſt conſtant purpoſe never to goe on any
more in thoſe ſinnes which he hath committed; and in his forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,

yet let the will onely in all ſimplicity and unfeigned ſincerity, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of the Mother, which willeth to doe onely that which is the will of

know,<note place="margin">☞</note> and how we will know, but we muſt meerly enter into the
Incarnation and birth of Jeſus Chriſt, and into his ſuffering and death,
and continually with all willingneſſe <hi>tread in his footſteps;</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, and think that we are here onely upon our Pilgrams path,
where we muſt walke through a dangerous way, and enter againe in
Chriſt on the narrow way into our native Countrey, whence <hi>Adam</hi>
hath led us aſtray; in this way onely lyeth the <hi>Pearle of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
magnum</hi> [or the Jewell of the great Myſtery] all ſtudying,
Book-reading, ſeeking, ſearching, and grounding [on our <hi>Received
Principles, or Orthodox apprehenſions</hi>] beſides, and without this way,
are but dead meanes, and obtaine not the <hi>Virgins Crowne [or the
Pearle of Sophia</hi>] but gather together heaps of thiſtles, and thornes,
which ſting, and gall the Children of God,</p>
            <p>42. Therefore deare Sir, ſeeing you have deſired my knowledge
and judgement, I have no better counſell and advice to impart unto
you,<note place="margin">☜</note> then to ſhew you the way, which I my ſelfe walke in; and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58072:23"/>
upon which way the <hi>Gate</hi> was opened to me, ſo that I am learned,
without learning aforehand; for all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> come from
God, he findeth all things [in, and for man.]</p>
            <p>43. I have no controverſie with the Children of God, by reaſon
of the variety,<note place="margin">☜</note> and diverſity of their gifts;<note n="*" place="margin">Note this carefully.</note> I can reconcile them all
in my ſelfe [I can make a good conſtruction, and underſtanding of
them to my ſelfe] I onely bring them to the Centre; and there I
have the proofe, and touchſtone of all things: Now then if you
will imitate and follow me, then you ſhall find it ſo by experience;
and afterward perhaps better underſtand what I have written.</p>
            <p>44. A reall true Chriſtian hath no controverſie or contention with
any body,<note place="margin">☞</note> for in the reſignation in Chriſt, he dyeth from all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
and ſtrife; he asketh no more after the way to God, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſurrenders himſelfe to the Mother; namely, unto the ſpirit of
Chriſt; and whatſoever it doth with him it is all one to him; be it
proſperity or adverſity in this World, life or death; it is all alike
unto him; no adverſity or calamity reacheth the <hi>new man,</hi> but onely
the old man of this World; with the ſame the World may doe what
it pleaſeth, it belongeth unto the World, but the new man belongeth
to God.</p>
            <p>45. This is my way, my deare friend, in which I walke, and in
which I muſt know without my fore knowledge: I doe not purpoſe,
premeditate,<note place="margin">☞</note> and muſe, aforehand, what I am to write or ſpeake, but
I ſubmit and reſigne my ſelfe to the knowledge of God, he may know
in me what he pleaſeth; and in ſuch a way as this, I have obtained
a Pearle, which I eſteeme of greater worth then the whole externall
World.</p>
            <p>46. And though it fall out many times, that the Children of God
are contrary one to another [or claſh together] in their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
yet it proceeds onely from the <hi>Turba</hi> of the externall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which is in all men;<note n="*" place="margin">No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and God permitteth it, that man might
be proved and exerciſed, and by praying and preſſing unto God, he
might more earneſtly and fervently enkindle his ſpirit; and then the
ſpirit of God ariſeth in the Myſtery of the <hi>Humanity,</hi> like a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſhining fire; and all muſt ſerve for the beſt to the Children
of God.</p>
            <p>47. But concerning ſome perſons of your <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> of whom
you make relation, which <hi>make money</hi> of all [they have] and run
to the <hi>Suppoſed Zion;</hi> I ſhould rather think it better adviſe for them
to ſtay at home, for <hi>Zion</hi> muſt be begotten and borne <hi>in us:</hi> when
they ſhall come to that Place; it will be with them as formerly; and
they muſt however live under the yoke of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>48. God is in Heaven, and the <hi>Heaven is in man;</hi> and if man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
to be in Heauen,<note place="margin">☞</note> then muſt Heaven be manifeſt, and revealed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58072:23"/>
in him, and this muſt be wrought, and brought to paſſe by <hi>Earneſt
ſerious Repentance, and hearty Reſignation, or unfeigned ſelfe-deniall;</hi> and
this they may doe as well at <hi>home</hi> in their owne places; that which
they thinke to run from, they are like to run into; it would be more
acceptable to God, to walke at home in a godly Divine way; that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
might take example by them.</p>
            <p>49. There be among them arrogant, proud, ſcornefull, deriding
<hi>People,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> which doe nothing but contemne and deſpiſe, and in many
of them it is onely a received <hi>Forme</hi> and Cuſtome; and a ſpirituall
pride, or ſelfiſh Phariſaicall Devotion, as I my ſelfe can ſpeake by
experience; for I in a Chriſtian, brotherly, and friendly manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
and admoniſhed one of them, by reaſon of a Book which he
put forth, wherein I found ſome points of great importance, againſt
God, and the ground of truth; and I hoped that he would become
ſeeing, but he anſwered in a proud contemptuous, and ſlanderous
manner, and gave forth ſuch an anſwer, wherein there was no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
or Prints of Gods ſpirit to be ſeen; their <hi>Confeſſion [of faith</hi>]
is rather an <hi>Opinion,</hi> then a true and ſincere Earneſtneſſe, for all of
them are not that which they boaſt and glory to be; there may be
many honeſt hearts among them; but many of them are onely Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall,
and <hi>Titular;</hi> and deſire onely to ſhew themſelves, and to be
<hi>applauded,</hi> as I my ſelfe had experience of one of the chiefeſt among
them; they may learne at home to deſpiſe other men [without their
running to an <hi>outward</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>Zion.</hi>]</p>
            <p>50. It is the way of the Children into Gods Kingdome, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
their way is<note n="*" place="margin">To Revoke, or Recall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> 
               <hi>Revoca;</hi> and this they themſelves make ſhew of,
but privately they are, as they were before; I would to God it were
in Earneſt with them,<note place="margin">☞</note> as they pretend and give forth, and then I
would commend the ſame alſo; but to ſlander, contemne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
others, is nothing elſe but <hi>Babel,</hi> the World is already full of
ſuch people, after ſuch I run not.</p>
            <p>51. Concerning<note n="*" place="margin">Hans Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauck.</note> 
               <hi>John Weyrack,</hi> ſo farre as I can ſee by theſe his
Writings, he may be one that walketh in the love of God; if this
his way be held in the reall ſincerity of the heart, but that he taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and diſpraiſeth others, by reaſon of the knowledge of the light
of nature, it ſheweth that he hath no knowledge therein, and his
gifts reach not thither; and becauſe he hath no ſuch gift, we muſt
paſſe it over; and yet for all this, eſteeme of him as a true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Brother; for God produceth his gifts not onely in ſimplicity,
but in many in a high ſtraine [or in a deep grounded underſtanding
or magicall meaning:] For he is onely high, and ordereth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
all his workes as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>52. In like manner, I anſwer to the reſt of the Authors which
you mention, ſome whereof were indued with high gifts, but they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58072:24"/>
were not ſufficiently capable to comprehend all; yet for <hi>their Time,</hi>
they have done <hi>enough,</hi> but becauſe this preſent time hath need of
another <hi>Medicine;</hi> therefore at this time alſo there are found other
skilfull, underſtanding knowers, and ſhewers of the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> and all
according to Gods loving providentiall care,<note place="margin">☞</note> who will not that any
ſhould <hi>periſh,</hi> but that all men ſhould be <hi>helped and cured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>53. If the ſame Authours were alive at this preſent, it may be
they might have written in ſome points more clearely, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orme; aloeit for their time they have done enough, and they
are in no wiſe to be deſpiſed and rejected, although ſome points
might be amended: But their Doctrine concerning the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the
Deity and Humanity is very cleare;</hi> and we may ſee how Gods ſpirit
hath been in them, but Reaſon turnes all things to the worſt; and
by its falſe expoſitions and Logicall gloſſes, wreſteth them to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
ſenſe.</p>
            <p>54.<note n="*" place="margin">Swenckfelt.</note> 
               <hi>Swenckfelt</hi> ſtumbleth at this point, in that hee holdeth
Chriſt to be no Creature; he hath not as yet comprehended the
Principles, and therefore it is impoſſible for him to diſtinguiſh, how
and in what he is no Creature; for in reſpect of the Deity he is no
Creature;<note place="margin">☞</note> but in reſpect of the Heavenly Eſſence (concerning
which he ſayd, <hi>That he was come from Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was alſo in Heaven</hi>)
he is in the Humanity creaturall, and without the Humanity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaturall.</p>
            <p>55. As we men live in the foure Elements, and we our ſelves are
the property of the foure Elements, and they are in Us creaturall;
and without us they are uncreaturall, and yet the unformed, uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized
Elements without us in whom we live, and the formed
creaturaliz'd Elements within us are but one thing; and ſo it is in
the Perſon of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>56. The whole Angelical World (which is the ſecond Principle) is
his bodily Being or perſonall Eſſence, and as to the heavenly eſſentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the Perſon of the Humanity it is creaturall, &amp; without the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
uncreaturall;<note place="margin">☞</note> for he is the <hi>Fathers Heart and Word,</hi> and the heart is
every where in the <hi>Father;</hi> ſo that where his heart is, there is alſo
Heaven, and the Divine eſſentiality environed with the compleate
fulneſſe of Wiſedome.</p>
            <p>57. Concerning his ſoule, which he commended into his Fathers
hands, and of the which he ſayd upon the Mount of Olives, <hi>That it
was afflicted and heavy, even unto death;</hi> the ſame is alſo of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of our ſoule; for it was for the ſoules ſake that God became
man, that he might bring the ſame againe into himſelfe, and draw
our will unto him againe out of the earthlineſſe; this ſame is a
Creature.</p>
            <p>58. And the third Principle (which is the externall Kingdome
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58072:24"/>
of this World, which God through his Wiſedome hath brought
forth out of Eternity) is alſo creaturall in him; for the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity

               <note place="margin">☜</note> That as God is
all in the ſpirit, ſo likewiſe he is all in this man: we men are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
even ſo, if we be borne againe of God; and this point (which
doth exerciſe, and trouble almoſt all others) may be eaſily amended
and rectified, if it were well conſidered, there would not be ſo much
condemning, and contending; the ſpirit of God careth not for any
controverſie; he judgeth all things in himſelfe.</p>

but that ſhee is an Eternall Virgin; and this indeed is true in reſpect

life</hi> is ſet forth at large</p>
            <p>60. Except this, <hi>Weigelius</hi> writeth alſo of the new birth, and of
the union of the humanity in Chriſt, very well with us; the which
to ſpeake of here I omit, becauſe I have written clearely and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
thereof; and I neither contemne nor deſpiſe his Writings,
nor thoſe that read them.</p>

            <p>64. I am at variance with none, but onely againſt the wicked, and
him the ſpirit rebuketh to his face; this I deſire to let you know,
and my intent is ſincere and upright towards you.</p>
            <p>65. As for my Bookes you may eaſily get them (I ſuppoſe) if
you have a minde to them; for <hi>Chriſtianus Bernard, Cuſtomer at Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>

if you make him acquainted with it, he will not deny you, but if not,

            <p>71. The ſixth Booke, or part of theſe Writings are <hi>the ſix Points,</hi>
treating of the greateſt depths and ſecrets: <hi>Viz.</hi> How the three
Principles doe mutually beget, bring forth, and beare each other;
ſo that in the Eternity there is no ſtrife [for contrary Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them] and yet each Principle is in it ſelfe as it is in its owne
property, as if it were onely one, and alone; and they ſhew whence
ſtrife and diſunity doe ariſe, and whence Good and Evill have their
Originall, wholly induced out of the ground: (that is, out of the
Nothing into the Something) and all in the ground [and centre]
of Nature; this ſixth Booke is ſuch a Myſtery (however in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſimplicity it is brought to light, that no Reaſon [or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
Aſtrall head-peece, though never ſo acute, and litterally

the ſignature of all things] and of the ſignification of the ſeverall
formes and ſhapes in the Creation; and it ſheweth what the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
ruine, and cure of every thing is; this entreth wholly into the
Eternall, and then into the Temporall, inchoative, and externall
Nature, and its forme.</p>
            <p>74. Theſe are my Bookes, beſides ſome ſmall Treatiſes which I

you the grace of God, and all health,
and happineſſe) being informed that
you beare a great delight, love, and
affection to my Writings, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
have beene unknowne to you;
I muſt anſwer you, that the ſame like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is a much greater delight, and
ſurpaſſing joy in my ſpirit; becauſe I
underſtand, that God doth drive and
carry on his worke in ſuch great and high perſons; which is not a
thing commonly to be found in the World, for the Temporall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and pleaſure of this life is an hinderance to it.</p>
            <p>2. But I can very well perceive in what manner Gods ſpirit hath
touched, and awaked your <hi>Noble</hi> heart, in token whereof you have
beſtowed ſo much paines and coſt upon this Work, which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by a very ſimple, and plaine hand, without any Art, or great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
[or large Capacity in litterall endowments] but onely
in the knowledge and manifeſtation of the gifts of God; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58072:27"/>
over it was not the intent of the Author, that it ſhould come into
the hands of ſo high Perſons; becauſe he wrote it onely for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall
to himſelfe, to ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e up himſelfe from the dark,
and drouſie ſleep in fleſh and blood, and not out of an intention to
make ſuch a Work.</p>
            <p>3. Indeed there was a fiery inſtigation, but without foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of this Worke, that lay hid in him as a Myſtery, which the
ſpirit of God did ſtirre up and awake; whereupon there aroſe a great
longing,<note place="margin">☞</note> and deſire to write; and yet in reſpect of the outward man
there was no deſire, capacity, fitneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and ability in the Authour
thereunto; for he ſought onely after the heart of God; to hide
himſelfe therein from the Storme and raging Tempeſt of the
Devill.</p>
            <p>4. And he conſidered the evill Nature, and its working influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and oftentimes the deceit of the Devill, and the anger of God,
and alſo the love and mercy of God; where indeed many a ſtorme
and ſtrong encounter, was held againſt Reaſon, and alſo againſt fleſh
and blood, and the Devill; and all in a powerfull driving, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the ſpirit, till at laſt a moſt precious <hi>Garland,</hi> or <hi>Diadem,</hi>
was ſet upon his head, which this hand cannot ſet downe in writing;
but I rather wiſh that the Reader of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> might finde it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and then he ſhould underſtand what the ſweetneſſe of God
is; and not ſo much marvell, why a Lay-man ſhould undertake to
meddle with ſuch things [or write of ſuch Myſteries.]</p>
            <p>5. Therefore I ſay now, that when the precious graine of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-Seed
was ſowne; this worke was brought forth to be written,
which was then beheld as in a Myſtery couched very deep, without
a ſufficient comprehenſion, yet with exceeding joy; as this Worke
(being the firſt Booke) ſheweth, where the great Myſteries, are
ſet downe very ſimply, without ſufficient explanation and expreſſion,
and in much abbreviation and defect, like a ſudden ſhower that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
by, whatſoever it lighteth upon, it hitteth; even ſo likewiſe the
ſpirit of the Wonders.</p>
            <p>6. For the Author was an illiterate man, and of a very ſmall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,<note place="margin">☞</note>
and ſhallow capacity in compariſon to the learned, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and expert; yea, as a meere Child in the Myſteries, who did
not ſo much as underſtand the way which it ſhould walke in, or what
might befall it, ſave what the ſpirit did intimate and declare unto
him, ashe hath alſo ſet downe in Writing, the perſecution, diſgrace,
and ignominy which ſhould fall upon himſelfe, before it was acted
and brought to paſſe that Reaſon felt it, or experimentally knew of
it; and that ſo clearely, as if it had beene really preſent, as is to be
ſeene in the Booke <hi>Aurora,</hi> being the firſt part of my Writings, which
was made before my perſecution; and now it is a comfort to me, in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58072:27"/>
that the ſpirit of God did ſhew, and foretell me ſo much <hi>aforehand;</hi>
ſo that I know what his Counſell is in his way; and therefore I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and patiently yeelded my ſelfe under the Croſſe, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my cauſe to God, and often entreated him, that if it came not
wholly from his owne Counſell, to take it from me; and not to
let me know and underſtand any thing in that kind, or to proceed
in that way.</p>
            <p>7. I purpoſed likewiſe (after the Perſecution) not to write any
more, but onely to keep my ſelfe ſtill in Obedience to my God, and
to let the Devill roare over me with his ſcorne, revilement, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion;<note place="margin">☞</note>
in which many a hard combate was fought againſt him, and
what I endured, I cannot well tell or declare; but it went with me
as with a grain that is ſowne into the Earth, which againſt all Reaſon
ſprings up afreſh in all ſtormes and tempeſts; whereas in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all ſeemes as dead, and reaſon ſaith, now all is gone: Thus the
precious graine of Muſtard-ſeed ſprung up againe under all diſpraiſe,
contempt, diſdaine, and deriſion, as a Lilly, and returned with an
hundred fold encreaſe, and alſo with deeper and more peculiar
knowledge, and came forth againe in a fiery inſtigation, or forcible
driving.</p>
            <p>8. But my externall man would write no more, it was ſomewhat
diſcouraged and timerous; till it came ſo farre, that the internall
man did captivate, and overpower the externall, and even then
<hi>the Great Myſtery did Appeare;</hi> and then I underſtood Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and caſt my ſelfe upon his will; alſo I would not invent, or
feigne any thing out of Reaſon; neither would I give way and place
any more unto Reaſon: but reſigned my will to Gods will, that ſo
my Reaſon might be as it were dead; that he (the ſpirit of God)
might doe and worke what, and how he pleaſed; I willed nothing
in Reaſon, that it might be alone his will and deed.</p>
            <p>9. And when this was done, then the internall man was armed,
and got a very faithfull guide, and to him I wholly yeelded my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and did not ſtudy and invent any thing, neither did I give
Reaſon leave to dictate what I ſhould write,<note place="margin">☞</note> ſave onely, that which
the ſpirit did ſhew me as in a great <hi>depth,</hi> and full <hi>Chaos</hi> in the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie;</hi>
yet without my ſufficient comprehenſion, for the Creature
is not as God that doth, and comprehendeth all things at <hi>Once</hi> in his
Wiſedome.</p>
            <p>10. And there was then a purpoſe in me againe to write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and in the space of nine monthes <hi>Three Bookes</hi> were made; the
one concerning the three Principles of the Divine Eſſence; that is,
of the Being of all Beings, wherein the great Myſtery hath ſomewhat
opened and revealed it ſelfe, and therein are many excellent things
contained much deeper then in this firſt worke [<hi>Viz.</hi> the <hi>Aurora</hi>]
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58072:28"/>
(which your Honour hath ſent hither for me to peruſe) and it hath
about an hundred ſheets of Paper.</p>
            <p>11. After this, there was one made containing ſixty ſheets;
which treateth of the threefold life of man, and alſo of the whole
Creation, a great open Gate of the Myſtery; and 'tis euen a wonder
that ſurpaſſeth, and goeth beyond the reach of all Reaſon: at the
which I my ſelfe in my Reaſon doe wonder, and marvell what God
intendeth to doe; that he uſeth ſuch a meane inſtrument to ſuch
weighty matters; for therein are revealed and laid forth the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
about which (ſince the heavie fall of <hi>Adam</hi>) the world hath
contended, and alwaiſe fought; yet there hath not beene ſuch a
Ground brought to light, which notwithſtanding ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of the World, but of the Children of God; as the ſame is
manifeſt and knowne.</p>
            <p>12. And then Thirdly, there were forty Queſtions ſent to me of a
Learned, and an underſtanding man who alſo is a lover of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
and a great Friend of the ſame: who exhorted me to anſwer
them according to theſe gifts; and ſpirit; which indeed are very high
queſtions; and they containe in them the great depths and ſecrets of
the Originall of the ſoule; and all the ſecrets, or Myſteries of the
Myſtery, wherupon there is ſuch an Anſwer brought forth, at which
the World might well rejoyce, if the anger, iniquity, and malice of
the Devill did not hinder it, yet the Counſell of God muſt ſtand.</p>
            <p>13. Now becauſe I perceive that your <hi>Noble</hi> minde, and heart,
hath a ſingular hunger, and thirſt after ſuch Myſteries, and regard
not the World which deſpiſeth ſuch Myſteries; therefore I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Counſell of God herein, and it is my bounden duty to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the ſame to you; for to the Children belongeth bread, they
are worthy of it,<note place="margin">☞</note> but the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

my ſpirit and minde ſheweth me ſufficiently, that your Honour
ſearcheth not after ſuch things out of Curioſity, but from the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and guidance of the ſpirit, which many times leadeth <hi>Peter

life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. And though I am a ſtranger, and very ſimple, yet your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
and will doth embolden me to write to your Honour, albeit
with a ſimple hand [in a plaine and courſe phraſe and ſtyle] (but
Gods gifts are not bound to any humane Arts) and I am the more
bold with you, becauſe I perceive, that your Noble heart appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſo low and humble, as to ſend to me, who am but a meane, and
abject perſon; but ſeeing tis thus, I doe likewiſe aſſuredly hope,
that the ſpirit of God ſhall open the doores, and gates of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for the ſoule; and grant a right underſtanding to apprehend, and
know his wonderfull gifts, the which I heartily wiſh to your Honour.</p>

15. My Writings will ſeeme ſomewhat ſtrange to you, for in
ſome places the ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the Antichriſt,</hi> who is knowne by God in his anger; [or
come up in wrath to remembrance] therefore I ſay that I could not,
nor durſt not write otherwiſe, then the ſame was given and indited
to me; I have continually wrote as the ſpirit did dictate it, and did
not give place to Reaſon [or to the wiſedome of the naturall,<note place="margin">☞</note> and
Aſtrall ſpirit] I alſo doe not acknowledge it for a worke of my
Reaſon, which was too weake; but it is the worke of the ſpirit,
who hath ſhewne what he meaneth to doe, and what ſhall come to
paſſe, and alſo what is already done; for he proceedeth forth out
of the Abyſſe into the Byſſe, and ſearcheth through all things; he
tryeth the heart and reyns, and proveth the thoughts of men; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
he doth hereby intimate, and declare <hi>the laſt Judgement;</hi> that
he will try and examine every <hi>Being</hi> through the fire; and I could
not, neither might I write at all (even in the fiery inſtigation) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
I did ſet it downe, as the ſpirit did repreſent it; therefore I
have made it for a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to my ſelfe, I have no further inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>16. But becauſe you are deſirous to read the ſame, I will ſend it,
and I pray you to returne it back againe, for I will <hi>keep</hi> it for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall,
and I am aſſured (that ſo farre as your Noble minde ſhall
give God the praiſe, and read it diligently, and take this way to heart
with a deſire to underſtand the ſame) that the Lord will open to
you the doore of his love in the Myſtery, and crowne you with the
Diadem of his wiſedome, which is more precious then the created
Heaven and this World;<note place="margin">☞</note> for the precious <hi>Philoſophers Stone, the

[or Garland of wiſedome] is beſet with this Stone; which
[Diadem and Crowne of light in the holy Ghoſt] the ſoule puts
on as a Garment; being a new body, in, and for, the Kingdome of
God; wherein it is the Child of God, and wherewith it is able to
ſtaud in the fire of Gods anger without any hurt, or griefe, and can
therein overcome the Devill, Death, and this World; and therein
alſo can rule over the Stars, the poyſonfull influences of the Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and this outward life, which otherwiſe is a thing impoſſible for
Reaſon; for it giveth that knowledge of things which no Art [or
litterall acrument from externall Reaſon] is able to ſearch out, or
dive into; it ſeeth through Heaven and Earth, and it reapeth where
it hath not ſowne; it asketh not the queſtion, Is it true or no? It
hath the ſigne of truth, and righteouſneſſe in it ſelfe; it hath all
vertues lying in hope; there is no feare of Gods anger in it, it affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a very joyfull hope, and ratifieth and aſſureth the ſame; and it
confirmeth the ſoule to be the Child of God.</p>
            <p>

a joy of the life, it comforteth and rejoyceth the minde in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
it goeth along with man into death, but it hath no death or

'tis the joy of the Angels; its taſte is more precious and pleaſant,

cannot be parrallel'd, but onely with the Deity, but it lyeth hid in
a darke Valley; the World knowteh it not, the Devill blowes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it as a ſtorme of winde, and doth often ſo cover and diſguiſe
it, that Reaſon doth not know it; but it ſpringeth forth in its time
as a faire Lilly with manifold fruits, it is ſowne in teares, it groweth
in tribulation, and affliction; but it is reaped with great joy; it is

            </p>
            <p>18. Such a Garland is ſet upon him that ſeeketh after it with

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Reaſon in fleſh and blood doth obtaine it, as my Writings doe
fully teſtifie; for what is therein written, the Author hath knowne
by experience; there is no ſtrange hand, or ſpirit foyſted in; I
write not this for my owne vaine glory (my boaſting is onely in
God) but for a rule and direction to the Children of God; and
that they may know what reward God giveth to thoſe who put their
truſt and confidence in him, and regard not the diſpraiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the World.</p>
            <p>19. I doe likewiſe wonder how you, and many more in <hi>Sileſia</hi>
have gotten my Writings; for I have no acquaintance with any of
them; and I am ſo cloſe in reſpect of publiſhing of them, that the
Citizens here about me know nothing of them, ſave onely of the
firſt part, which was <hi>Per-force</hi> taken from me; which by meanes of
a Perſon in the Myſterie of Babel (<hi>who perſecuted it out of envy)
was proclaimed among them for Hereſie;</hi> which notwithſtanding they
never read, neither was it examined ever as it was meet.</p>
            <p>20. Indeed I never asked any mans adviſe about it, or ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to the cenſure and judgement of man to this very houre;
but commended it to God; yet hereby I know and acknowledge the
way of God; and likewiſe I underſtand, that it is not knowne only
in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> but alſo in other Countries, without my fore-knowledge;
and I muſt even ſay, that he that hath ſo perſecuted it, he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
publiſhed it, for my intent was to keep it by me as long as I lived;
and I wrote it for my ſelfe onely.</p>
            <p>21. But what God purpoſed in his Counſell, is now manifeſt; and
it ſhall yet appeare more clearely, when the<note n="*" place="margin">The three Principles and the three fold Life.</note> two laſt Bookes ſhall
be read; at the which I my ſelfe in the externall man doe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58072:29"/>
wonder, and marvell what God intendeth, and will do; for I
acknowledg my ſelf to be altogether unworthy and ignorant, and yet
the greateſt and deepeſt Myſteries are revealed to the internall man,<note place="margin">☜</note>
which I give you and other lovers of God in humility to conſider of;
for in truth I cannot at all ſay, that it is the worke of my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or Reaſon: But I acknowledge it to be <hi>a Wonder,</hi> wherein
God will reveale great things, whereinto my reaſon doth ſpeculate,
and continually marvelleth at it.</p>
            <p>22. For I never in all my life ſtudied theſe Myſteries, and likewiſe
knew nothing of them; for I am a Lay-man; and yet I muſt bring
ſuch things forth to light, which all the high Schooles, or Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have not been able to doe; to whom notwithſtanding in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
I am but a Child, and have none of their Arts or wiſedome,
and I muſt write wholly from another Schoole; and which is yet
greater then all this, <hi>the Language of Nature is made knowne to me,</hi>
ſo that I can underſtand the greateſt Myſteries in my owne <hi>Mothers
Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. Though I cannot ſay that I have learned or comprehended
it, but as long as the hand of God ſtayeth upon me, I underſtand it;
but if it hides it ſelfe,<note place="margin">☞</note> then I know not my owne Labour, and am
made a ſtranger to the Worke of my owne hands; whereby I may
ſee, how altogether impoſſible a thing it is to ſearch out and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Myſteries of God, without Gods ſpirit; therefore I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe,
and attribute nothing to my ſelfe, it is not my Work, I deſire
not any humane applauſe and honour for it.</p>
            <p>24. I am onely a ſimple meane Inſtrument, God worketh and
maketh what he pleaſeth; what God willeth, that I will alſo; and
whatſoever he willeth not,<note place="margin">☞</note> that likewiſe I will not; if it be his will
for me to know any thing, then I will know it; but if he willeth it
not, then doe I ſo alſo: <hi>I will be nothing, and dead,</hi> that he may live
and worke in me, <hi>what he pleaſeth,</hi> I have caſt my ſelfe wholly into
him, that ſo I may be ſafe, and ſure from the Devill.</p>
            <p>25. And though I muſt leave my outward body and life to the
diſpoſall of the World, and ſuffer the Devill to roare againſt me;
yet I will not truſt neither the Devill, nor the World with my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man; neither will I doe (according to the inward man) what
the World will have me; and albeit my outward man is bound, and
obliged to the World,<note place="margin">☞</note> and in its obligation and allegiance muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Lawes and Ordinances of the World; and doe what the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Obligation</hi> requireth of me, yet my internall man ſhall onely
be obedient to God, and not to the World; for he is not in the
World, but hath made himſelfe dead thereto, that God might live
in him, and be both the will and the deed in him; and though I
cannot ſay, that it is poſſible to live ſo [in perfection] yet my will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58072:30"/>
is ſo directed and bent; and this neither the World, nor the Devill
ſhall breake, albeit my outward life ſhould faint and periſh, and
though Reaſon doth oftentimes flatly gainſay it, and temptation
appeareth by heapes, to the terrour and ſadneſſe of the externall
life (where the ſpirit alſo hides it ſelfe, as if all were dead, and
gone) yet it bringeth forth alwayes new fruits, and that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</p>
            <p>26. This I have related to you at large, that you may know and
acknowledge what manner of man I am, and what the beginning, and
cauſe of my writing is; and from what Art and ſpirit it was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
or generated; and alſo to what end; namely, to keepe it as a
Memoriall to my ſelfe; but becauſe I perceive honeſt religious
hearts to thirſt after it, therefore I will not conceale it from them,
[but impart] in a brotherly and Chriſtian way, and commend and
commit it to God, that he may worke, and doe what hee pleaſeth
in them; and this wee are bound, and obliged to doe one for
another.</p>
            <p>27. Laſtly, I intreat you to conceale my name among the Learned,
for I know that a meane Lay-man is accounted but ridiculous, and
contemptible with men <hi>Learned in Scholaſtique Art;</hi> and though
God hath his Children alſo among them, yet I care not for having
my Name put upon it, or authorized upon me; for the praiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to God,<note place="margin">☞</note> who is the giver; I doe not ſeeke to make my ſelfe
thereby a great and glorious Name; but Chriſt is my reward, my
Name and glory, and I hope to have the glory of it in the life to
come before Angels and Men, and to rejoyce therein with the Saints
in Chriſt; as my Writings ſufficiently teſtifie.</p>
            <p>28. Concerning the Book <hi>Aurora,</hi> which your Honour hath ſent
me to peruſe, I have read ſome of it over, and finde that it is my
Worke, and well copyed out; but ſome Syllables are left out, for
brevity ſake, and yet the ſenſe and meaning is not thereby diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
I am well contented for all that, ſeeing (ſo farre as I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed
in haſt) I have found no addition, but the great Myſteries are
couched therein very deep; they were underſtood and apprehended
by the Author, but it was not very feiſible for Reaſon to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it at the firſt time, although it was knowne in the depth well
enough, yet the Author was not accuſtomed to it; when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>joy</hi> met him, then he only followed the ſpirits guidance,<note place="margin">☞</note> but
the wilde nature is not preſently regenerated [or made a new
creature:] Indeed if a Kernell be ſowne, there groweth a Tree;
but if the vertue be great [if the power of the reſolution be ſtrong,
and the practice ſincere and conſtant] the Tree groweth up the
ſooner, and is the ſooner knowne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58072:30"/>
29. In the other three Bookes you ſhall finde the Myſteries more
clearely, and ſo throughout, the further the deeper; each Booke
from the firſt is grounded <hi>ten times deeper;</hi> ſo that the fourth is a
very cleare mirrour, wherein the great Myſtery is ſufficiently, and
viſibly ſeene and underſtood, yet onely of its Children: Reaſon
ſhall remaine blinde, for the ſpirit of God dwelleth not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Principle, but in the inward; and proceedeth forth from the
inward into the outward [principle of this World] yet the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
doth not comprehend him.</p>
            <p>30. But Sir, I muſt tell you, that the Booke <hi>Aurora</hi> was not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
for the Devill intended to make a Bone-fire of it, becauſe
he ſaw that the day would breake forth in it; but for all that, the
day hath even overtaken the <hi>Aurora</hi> [or morning] ſo that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
cleare day; there belong yet about thirty ſheets to it; but
becauſe the ſtorme did breake them off, it was not finiſhed; and in
the meane time it is growne day light, and the morning is extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;
and ſince that time the labour hath beene to bring forth the
day: Yet it ſhall remaine ſo for an eternall Remembrance, becauſe
the defect is reſtored, and ſupplyed in the<note n="*" place="margin">The Booke of the three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> Second; the fault and
blame of the defect is to be attributed to the Enemy.</p>
            <p>31. But I will lay the fault upon none, but onely the falſhood,
and iniquity of the Devill, who is an enemy to all good; he doth
even confound and entangle Kings; how ſhall then a poore meane
Man, being employed in ſuch a worke, be ſo ſoone acknowledged
and knowne;<note place="margin">☞</note> if it be ſurely affirmed that he is a Lay man, and alſo
unlearned; the very wiſe and skilfull in Arts, will be offended at
the plainneſſe and ſimplicity of ſuch a thing; when he heareth one
ſpeake of ſuch wonders and deep Myſteries in ſuch a meane and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
way [without Scholaſtique pomp of words and artificiall termes,
and phraſes of Logick and Rhetorick] then he thinketh it is a Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodie:
[or ſome confuſed heap of Notions packt together, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick,
phantaſtick hotch-potch of Whimſies, or a bundle of
Non-ſence] for he underſtands not the gifts of God, and alſo is not
able to ſee into the heart of another; therefore I will diſturbe no
man, and deſire none to trouble himſelfe about it; but I confeſſe
that it is Gods providence, elſe this Booke ſhould have yet lyen in
a Corner.</p>
            <p>32. But thus it was publiſhed without my knowledg, conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt, and
will, and that <hi>by the perſecutors themſelves,</hi> the which I acknowledge to
be from the providence, and appoyntment of God; for I had no
copy of it for my ſelfe; neither did I ever know thoſe that have it,
alſo I have it not my ſelfe, and yet it hath beene copyed out; and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58072:31"/>
brought to my fight and hands foure times already; ſo that I ſee that
others have publiſhed it: and I eſteem it a wonderfull work, that the
graine groweth againſt the will of the Enemie; but that which is
ſowne by God, none can let or hinder [from growing.]</p>
            <p>33. But that which you, and others alſo do miſconſtrue in my
Booke <hi>Aurora</hi> (which appeareth to be wrong in the apprehenſion,
and which alſo needeth ſome clearing, and expoſition) you ſhall
finde ſufficiently cleared at large in my third and fourth Booke;<note place="margin">☞</note>
wherein there is an open gate of the Myſteries of all Beings; and
there is even nothing in Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e but it might be fundamentally
ſearched out, and grounded upon this way; for it ſheweth, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>Stone of the wiſe men</hi> unto all the Secrets and Myſteries both
in the Divine and earthly Myſtery: by this knowledge, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
all the Mettalls of the Earth may be brought to the higheſt
degree or perfection; yet onely by the Children of the <hi>divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
who have the <hi>Revelation</hi> [or experimentall ſcience] of the
ſame.</p>
            <p>34. I ſee it well enough, but I have <hi>no manuall operation,</hi> inſtigation
or Art unto it; but I onely ſet forth an open Myſtery, whereunto
God ſhall ſtir up labourers of his owne; let no man ſeeke the
worke from me, or thinke to get the knowledge, and operation of
the Phyloſophers ſtone [or univerſall tincture from me] and
though it is knowne clearly and might be opened more clearly, yet
I have broken my will, and will write nothing; but as it is given to
me: that ſo it may not be my worke; leaſt I ſhould be <hi>impriſoned</hi> in
<hi>the Turba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>35. And if you will have any thing copyed out of theſe writings
now ſent to you, it is requiſite, that the Tranſcriber be a Learned
underſtanding man; for many ſyllables are not fully written, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have all Grammaticall autography; and in many words ſome
letters may be wanting; and ſometimes a Capitall Letter ſtands for
a whole word, for Art hath not written here, neither was there any
time to conſider how to ſet it downe punctually according to the
right underſtanding of the Letters, but all was ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">☜</note>
to the direction of the ſpirit which often went in haſt; ſo that
the pen-mans hand (by reaſon that he was not accuſtomed to it)
did often ſhake; and though I could have written in a more acurate
faire, and plaine manner; yet the reaſon was this, that the burning
fire did often force forward with <hi>ſpeed;</hi> and the hand and pen muſt
haſten directly after it; for it commeth and goeth as a ſudden ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whatſoever it lighteth upon, it hits; if it were poſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58072:31"/>
and write all [which my mind beholdeth in the <hi>Divine
CHAOS</hi>] it would then be three times more, and deeper
grounded.</p>
            <p>36. But it cannot be, and therefore there is more then one
Booke made; more then one Phyloſophicall diſcourſe, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deeper; ſo that what could not be conteined in the one might
be found in the other, and it were well that at laſt, out of <hi>all,</hi> onely
<hi>one,</hi> might be made and all the other done away [or laid aſide] for
the multiplicity and plurality cauſeth ſtrife, contrariety, averſeneſſe,
and wrong apprehenſions by reaſon of the ſudden catching conceits,
and conjectures of the <hi>Reader,</hi> which knoweth not to try, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the ſpirit, which uſeth ſuch wonderfull phraſe, where often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Reaſon ſuppoſeth, that it contradicts it ſelfe; and yet in the
depth it is not contrary at all.</p>
            <p>37 Out of which miſunderſtanding [or feigned gloſſes of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and litterall outward Art upon the Writings of holy Men]
<hi>the Great Babel</hi> upon earth hath beene brought forth;<note place="margin">☜</note> where men
contend for nothing, but about words; but let the ſpirit of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding

Limit; and there is no more any withholding and ſtaying [of the
wrath of God upon Babel] it cannot be quaſht by any power, <hi>or
force of Armes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>38. I ſpeake not of and from my ſelfe, but from that which the
ſpirit ſheweth, which no man can reſiſt; for it ſtands in its <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence,</hi>
and depends not on our weening and willing, as the

3. Which on my part doth likewiſe rejoyce me to ſee, that even
now the time is at hand,<note place="margin">☞</note> that the right Divine underſtanding, and
true knowledge of God doth againe ſpring forth in <hi>Zyon;</hi> and that
the ruinate <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall againe be built up,</hi> and that mans true I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
which diſappeared and went out in <hi>Adam,</hi> doth againe put
forth it ſelfe in <hi>Zyon</hi> with a right humane voyce, and that God doth
powre forth his ſpirit into us, that the precious Pearle in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and light of the holy Ghoſt is againe knowne, ſought, and
found.</p>
            <p>4. Whereby then we doe clearely ſee and underſtand in what
blindneſſe we for a long time have beene in <hi>Babel,</hi> going aſtray in
carnall, evill wayes; whereby we have forſaken the true <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
and ſhamefully miſpent our Patrimony, and lightly eſteemed our
Angelicall Trophee or Diadem (<hi>Viz.</hi> the faire Image) and wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the filth of the Devill; and under a ſhew of Divine obedience
have played with the Serpent, and walked on in meere erroneous
wayes: This the Divine light doth at preſent ſet before our eyes,
and exhorts us to returne with the loſt Sonne, and enter into the
true <hi>Zyon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Not with Hiſtoricall ſuppoſals, opinions, or blind perſwaſions;
as if we had apprehended and underſtood the ſame very well; this
is not <hi>Zyon,</hi> but <hi>Babel,</hi> which confeſſeth God with the mouth, and
maketh devout ſpeeches to him from the lipps, but in the heart
hangeth unto the <hi>Great Babylonicall Whore;</hi> unto the <hi>Dragon</hi> of ſelfe-love,
pride, covetouſneſſe, and pleaſure, and yet will ſet forth her
ſelfe as if ſhee were a Virgin; No, this is not the Virgin in <hi>Zyon;</hi> it
muſt be ſeriouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>6. We muſt be borne of God in <hi>Zyon,</hi> and know, and alſo doe his
will;<note place="margin">☞</note> Gods ſpirit muſt beare witneſſe to our ſpirit, that we are Gods
Children; not onely in the mouth with knowledge, and conjectures,
but in the heart in very deed; not in an holy ſeeming way without
power [in formall wayes of Word-worſhip, and rounds of Lip-labour,
wherein the captivated conſcience placeth the power of
godlineſſe] this the Devill mocks at, and cares not for; but wee
muſt put on the Helmet of righteouſneſſe and of love, alſo of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity
and purity, if we intend to wage Battell againſt the Prince of
this World; he careth not a whit for any outward ſhew [or for
the long and loud mouth cryes of blinde Devotion] it muſt bee
power that ſhall overcome him, and that power muſt ſhine forth in
<hi>goodneſſe, and holy fruits of Chriſtianity;</hi> and ſo we may ſight for the
noble Prize, or Crowne of life.</p>
            <p>7. For we have a powerfull Warrior againſt us,<note place="margin">☜</note> he ſets upon us
in body and ſoule, and ſoone caſts us downe, and there is no other
way to overcome him; but with power in humility; which alone is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58072:33"/>
able to quench his poyſonfull fire, wherewith he fighteth without us,
and within us, againſt our noble Image.</p>
            <p>8. Therefore beloved Sir, and brother in Chriſt, ſeeing, you doe
apply your ſelfe to the Divine wiſedome, and labour in the ſame; it
is right and requiſite that we exhort one another to be vigilant to
withſtand the Devill;<note place="margin">☜</note> and continually ſet before our eyes the way
which we ought to walke; and alſo go on in the ſame, elſe we effect
nothing; if we know that the World is blind in <hi>Babel,</hi> and goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray
then we muſt be the firſt that effectually <hi>go out of Babel,</hi> that the
World may ſee that we are in earneſt.</p>
            <p>9. It is not enough, that we lay open, and Manifeſt Babel, and
yet be found doing as Bibel doth; for if we doe ſo, we thereby
teſtify that God diſcovereth his light unto us,<note place="margin">☞</note> ſo that we ſee, but we
will doe nothing but the workes of darkneſſe; and that very light
which enlightneth our underſtanding ſhall witneſſe againſt us, that
the Lord hath called us and ſhewn us the way, but we would not
walke in the ſame.</p>
            <p>10. It is <hi>well</hi> that we lay open Babel; but we muſt <hi>take heed</hi> in
what ſpirit and minde, and in what kinde of knowledge the ſame is
done;<note place="margin">☜</note> it is <hi>good</hi> that we be zealous, but the heart muſt be <hi>upright</hi>
towards God, elſe we runne without being ſent; and in our courſe
we are not knowne or acknowledged of God; but ſo acting, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
mocks us, and leads us into by paths of Errour.</p>
            <p>11. Beſides the holy Scripture doth declare, that our workes and
words ſhall follow us; therefore we are ſeriouſly to conſider in what
ſpirit and knowledge we ſet upon the high Myſteries, for he that will
pull downe a thing that is evill, muſt ſet up a better in the roome,
otherwiſe hee is none of Gods Builders, alſo he laboureth not in
Chriſts Vineyard; for it is not good to pull downe, unleſſe a
man knowes how to make up the Building againe in a better frame
and forme.</p>
            <p>12. For God onely is the Maſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>builder of the World; we are
but ſervants, we muſt take great heed how we labour, if we will
receive reward; and alſo that we have learnt his work in his Schoole,
and not runne without being ſent, when as we are not yet capable
of his ſervice; elſe we ſhall be found to be unprofitable Servants;
this I ſpeake in good affection, and in all faithfulneſſe to inſtruct
and direct one another what we ought to doe, that ſo our labour
may be accepted of God.</p>
            <p>13. For the darke Myſteries are no other way at all to be knowne,<note place="margin">☜</note>
ſave onely in the holy Ghoſt, wee cannot make concluſions upon
hidden things, unleſſe we have the ſame in reall knowledge, and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally
finde in the illumination of God,</hi> that what we averre, is the
truth and will of God; and that <hi>it is alſo agreeable to his Word; and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58072:34"/>
grounded in the light of Nature; for without the light of Nature there is
no underſtanding of Divine Myſteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. The great Building of God is manifeſt in the light of Nature;
and therefore hee whom Gods light doth illuminate, may ſearch
out and know all things; albeit knowledge is not in one and the
ſame way and meaſure; for Gods wonders and works are boundleſſe,
infinite, and immenſe; and they are revealed to every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his gifts, and he to whom the light ſhineth hath meere joy
in Gods workes.</p>
            <p>15. And alſo that which is old and paſt above a thouſand yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,<note place="margin">☞</note>
is as nigh and as eaſily to be knowne in the light, as that which
is done to day; for a thouſand years before God are ſcarce ſo much
as a minute, or the twinckling of an eye is before us; therefore all
things are nigh and manifeſt to his ſpirit, both that which is paſt,
and that which is to come.</p>
            <p>16. And if we ſee in his light, then we muſt declare his wonders,
and manifeſt and praiſe his glorious Name, and <hi>not bury</hi> our Talent
in the Earth; for we muſt deliver it unto our Maſter with <hi>Increaſe;</hi>
he will require an account of us, how we have Traded with it; and
without knowledge, or certaine illumination from God, no man
muſt preſume to judge, or be a Doctor, or Maſter in the great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for it is not committed to, or commanded him, but he muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to attaine the true light, and then he goeth rightly to worke
in the Schoole of God.</p>
            <p>17. For there be many Maſters to be found,<note place="margin">☜</note> who preſume to
judge in the Myſtery, and yet they are not knowne or ſent by God;
and therefore their <hi>Schoole</hi> is called <hi>Babel,</hi> the Mother of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
upon Earth; they flatter on both ſides, they play the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
with God, and alſo ſerve the Devill; <hi>they call themſelves</hi> the
Shepheards and Paſtours of Jeſus Chriſt; they runne, and yet are
not ſent, much leſſe doth God owne them; and what they doe, they
doe for their honour, and<note n="*" place="margin">Their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</note> Belleys ſake, and they would not runne
neither, if they did not obtaine it in their <hi>Courſe</hi> of ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>18. They have turned the right and exceeding precious Myſtery
of God, to a Myſtery of their Whoredome and pleaſure; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſpirit calleth it <hi>Babel,</hi> a Confuſion; where men doe practice
an hypocriticall Service and worſhip of God; acknowledging him
with the tongue, but denying him in the power; where men doe
diſſemble and flatter God with the lipps, but in the heart they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and love the Dragon (in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>)</p>
            <p>19. Such as theſe we muſt not be,<note place="margin">☞</note> if we would obtaine the Divine
Myſtery, and be capable of the light; but wholly approve our way
to God, and reſigne our ſelves up to him, that Gods light may ſhine
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58072:34"/>
in us; that he may be our intelligence, knowing, willing, and alſo
doing; we muſt become his Children if we will ſpeake of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and walke, or labour in the ſame; for he commits not his work
unto a Stranger, who hath not learnt his Worke, or the Myſtery of
his <hi>Wonders in Nature, and Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. I have read over your Bookes, and therein have found your
great diligence with very much labour, in that you have gathered
together the Texts of the holy Scripture in great abundance;<note place="margin">☜</note> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

the ruine of <hi>Babel,</hi> and the new building in <hi>Zyon</hi> of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaketh in many places.</p>
            <p>21 Firſt, what concerneth <hi>Babel;</hi> how it hath growne up, and

and ſelviſh; the which ſhould at all times have beene rejected:
for where God ſhould have been honoured, and loved, and our

Gods ſtead, the abominable, and beſtiall coveteouſneſſe, deceit, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and wicked craft under an hypocriticall ſhew and pretence of
holineſſe and have minded and loved falſhood in the place of God;
and ſo have made of the Myſtery an abominable vicious Babel full of
reproachings,<note place="margin">☜</note> revilings, and contentions, where they have with ſweet
ſpeeches, and enticing words of mans wiſedome [with feigned gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and expoſitions of Scripture] blindfolding our eyes, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our conſciences have led us captive in a very deceitfull way to
the glory and Magnificence of the great Whore; ſo that ſhe hath
fatted her adulterous Brat; and domineered over our body, and
ſoule, goods, and eſtate.</p>
            <p>23. This Baſtard is now at odds with himſelfe about the great
prey, and ſpoyle, and doth it ſelfe diſcover its owne wickedneſſe and
great ſhame, ſo that we may ſee what good ever was in her; for the
great wickedneſſe which ſhee hath committed doth plague her; and
no ſtrange thing, whereby it may be ſeene, that her whoredome hath
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58072:35"/>
been manifold; and that the Devill had beſet and caught us in mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Nets; and that one whoredome [or Myſtery of hipocricy and
iniquity] runnes in oppoſition to another; and are malicious,
biting, devouring, deſtroying, and ſlaying each other in an hoſtile
manner.</p>
            <p>24. For the great Paine is come upon her,<note place="margin">☞</note> and ſhee ſhall now
bring forth the great iniquity, wherewith ſhee in become fully preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and therefore ſhee cryeth out, becauſe of her travell and woe,
which is fallen upon her; and ſhee ſpeaketh of the child which ſhee
ſhall bring forth; <hi>Viz.</hi> of Murther, Covetouſneſſe, and Tyranny, ſhe
uncovereth her faire feature, and ſheweth what ſhee is in the
heart, now he that will not know her, there is no remedy for
him.</p>
            <p>25. The <hi>Revelation</hi> ſaith, <hi>Goe out from her my people, that you may
not be partakers of her Plagues;</hi> for ſhee hath filled her Cup full with
the abominations of her Whoredome in the anger of God; the
ſame Shee ſhall drinke off, and bee forced to burſt Her ſelfe
thereby.</p>
            <p>26. And this is that which I ſay of <hi>Babel,</hi> that ſhee is a Whore,
and ſhall ſuddenly breake in pieces and be deſtroyed, and no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſhall doe it; the ſpirit of her owne mouth doth ſtrangle her, her
owne <hi>Turba</hi> deſtroyeth her; Shee cryeth for vengeance, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
upon Hereſie, and yet ſhee doth it not for Gods ſake; but for
her <hi>Adulterous Bratt, and Belley-God:</hi> For otherwiſe if it were for
God, ſhee would enter into his Command, and will of <hi>Love;</hi> where
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Love one another, for thereby men ſhall know that you are
my Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. The Kingdome of God doth not conſiſt in Warre and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,

            <p>28. Secondly, concerning <hi>Zyon,</hi> I ſpeake and declare according
to my knowledge, even as the ſpirit ſheweth it to me; that there
ſhall <hi>ſurely come an ending and removall of the Deceit</hi> [or Myſtery of
iniquity wherewith men are blinded] <hi>and Zyon ſhall be found onely
of the Children of Faith;</hi> not in generall, as if there ſhould be no
wicked man.</p>
            <p>29.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For the Oppreſſour ſhall be a cauſe that <hi>Zyon</hi> is borne: when
men ſhall ſee how <hi>Babel</hi> is an Whore; then many Children ſhall be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58072:35"/>
found in <hi>Zyon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> and ſeeke the Lord; but the Oppreſſour ſhall dog
them, and cry them downe for Hereticks; alſo perſecute and put to
death, and where one is killed, there ſhall ten, yea an hundred riſe
up in his roome.</p>
            <p>30. But the Generall <hi>Zyon</hi> appeareth firſt in greateſt Miſery;
when <hi>Babel</hi> commeth to ruine, then it ſhall ſtand deſolate and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
and the Children of <hi>Zyon</hi> ſhall then ſay, How hath the Lord
forſaken us? Come we beſeech you let us ſeek his face; let us ceaſe
from ſtrife and Warre; Have we not, alas! made our Country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate?
Is not all ſtore and <hi>Proviſion waſted and ſpent?</hi> Are we not
Brethren? <hi>Wherefore doe wee fight?</hi> We will now enter into Love
and Unity, and ſeeke the Lord, and no more fight, and deſtroy our
ſelves, we will be content; are we not here altogether Pilgrims and
Strangers, and ſeek our native Countrey?</p>
            <p>31. In this time a <hi>Zyon</hi> verily ſhall be found, and the Heaven
ſhall drop downe its dew, and the Earth yeeld her fatneſſe; yet not
ſo, as if wickedneſſe ſhould be wholly done away, for it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
unto the end,<note place="margin">☞</note> of which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thinkeſt thou that when the
Sonne of man ſhall come, that there will be Faith upon the Earth?</hi> And
though the Children of <hi>Zyon</hi> ſhall have a fiery deliverance, that they
ſhall remaine, Maugre the will of the Devill; inſomuch that God
will worke great things, <hi>as at the time of the Apoſtles,</hi> yet it endureth
not unto the end; for as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Arke, ſo ſhall the comming of the Son of man be, as it
is written.</p>
            <p>32. But that the holy Ghoſt ſhall be in the hearts of the faithfull
in <hi>Zyon,</hi> I acknowledge &amp; I know it; for <hi>Zyon</hi> ſhall not be from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
but in the new man; it is already borne, hee that would ſeeke
it, let him but ſeeke himſelfe, and depart from the old <hi>Adam,</hi>
into a new life; and hee ſhall finde whether Jeſus bee borne in
him.</p>
            <p>33. If he findes it not, let him enter into himſelfe;<note place="margin">☜</note> and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſider himſelfe; and ſo he ſhall finde Babel, and her workings
in him, theſe he muſt deſtroy and enter into Gods Covenant; and
then <hi>Zion</hi> will be revealed in him, and he ſhall be born with Chriſt in
<hi>Bethleem Jehuda</hi> in the darke Stable, <hi>not in Jeruſalem,</hi> as reaſon faine
would have it, that Chriſt ſhould be born in the old Aſſe; the old Aſſe
muſt become ſervant, and ſerve the new man in <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>34. But that in <hi>Foure hundred yeares</hi> there ſhall be a meer golden
Age; I know nothing of it, it is not revealed to mee; alſo the <hi>limit</hi>
of the Worlds End is <hi>not revealed to me:</hi> I cannot ſpeake of any <hi>four
hundred Yeares;</hi> for the Lord hath not commanded me to teach it,
I commend it to Gods might; and leave it for thoſe to whome God
would vouchſafe the knowledg of it; ſeeing therefore I have not as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58072:36"/>
yet apprehended it I reſt ſatisfyed in his gifts; yet I deſpiſe no man,
if he had a knowledge, and command ſo to teach.</p>
            <p>35. For the fourth Book of Eſdras is not ſufficient as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
to give a poſitive aſſurance to it; yet I wait for my Saviour
Jeſus Chriſt, and rejoyce that I may finde my Lord; when I have
him, then I hope after the death of my old Adam fully to recreate
my ſelfe in the Still reſt of Zion, and to wait in my God expecting
what he will doe with me in his, and my Zion; for if I have but
him,<note place="margin">☞</note> then I am in and with him in the Eternall Sabbath; where no
ſtrife or contention of the ungodly can any more reach me in my
<hi>New man,</hi> at this I doe in the meane time rejoyce in this miſerable
<hi>Vale of Tabernacles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>36. The firſt reſurrection of the dead to the thouſand yeares Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
(of which there is mention in the <hi>Revelation</hi>) is not <hi>ſufficiently</hi>
made knowne to me, how the ſame may be meant, ſeeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth not mention it elſewhere, and Chriſt alſo and his Apoſtles
give not an hint of it in other places, ſave only <hi>John</hi> in his, Revelation;
but whether they ſhall be a thouſand <hi>Solar</hi> yeares,<note place="margin">☜</note> or how it may be
referred, ſeeing I have not full aſſurance, I leave it to my God; and
to thoſe to whom God ſhall vouchſafe the right underſtanding of it;
till God is pleaſed to open my eyes concerning theſe Myſteries.</p>
            <p>37. For they be Secrets, and it belongeth not to man to make
concluſions about them, without the command and light of God;
but if any had knowledge and illumination of the ſame from God, I
ſhould be ready and willing to learne; If I could ſee the ground
thereof in the light of nature.</p>
            <p>38. But ſeeing it behooveth me not to hide my knowledge of it,
ſo farre as I apprehend it in the light of Nature; I will therefore
ſet downe ſome Suppoſitions, or conſiderable Opinions, which are
in my minde, not poſitively to affirme, but give it to conſideration;
for good and wholeſome inſtructions may be drawne forth thereby,
and tis alſo profitable for man <hi>ſo to ſearch;</hi> I will doe it in all ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
uprightneſſe, to ſee if we might attaine ſomewhat neerer the
matter, and perhaps there may be ſome to whom God ſhall beſtow
ſuch a gift, ſtirred up thereby to write more clearely.</p>
            <p>39. As firſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> whether or no it be certaine, that the World muſt
continue <hi>Seven thouſand yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and one thouſand of them ſhould be
a meere Sabbath; Seeing that God created all in ſix dayes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the reſt on the ſixt day towards evening, whence the Jewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
their Sabbath on Friday evening: and <hi>Elias</hi> alſo ſaith, that the
World ſhould ſtand but <hi>Six thouſand yeares;</hi> and Chriſt likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,
that the dayes of tribulation ſhall be ſhortned for the Elects
ſake, elſe no man ſhould be ſaved, which you apply to the fall of
<hi>Babel,</hi> and to the time of <hi>Zyon;</hi> but it ſeemes as <hi>if Chriſt</hi> ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58072:36"/>
the fall of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the end of the World, and foreſheweth
an evill End.</p>
            <p>40. Alſo Chriſt ſaith, that it ſhall be at the time of his comming
to judgement, as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> where men did Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and were given in Marriage; now we know very well (as the
Scripture teſtifieth) what manner of wicked World was in the days
of <hi>Noah,</hi> that the Deluge muſt come and deſtroy them: (This would
intimate, and denote a very <hi>meane Sabbath.</hi>)</p>
            <p>41. And though a man ſhould otherwiſe expound the words of
Chriſt concerning his comming, yet that would not be ſufficient to
prove it; being alſo that the Diſciples of Chriſt doe alwayes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the End to be nigh; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That the end ſhould come
after that <hi>Antichriſt is revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>42. But that the Reſurrection of the dead, and the laſt Judgement
ſhould be underſtood of both (namely that the righteous ſhall ariſe
to the thouſand yeares Sabbath, and among them ſome ungodly;
and that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> at the End of the thouſand yeares ſhould
fight againſt the Saints) it ſeemes to run quite contrary to the light
of Nature.</p>
            <p>43. For firſt I cannot apprehend how the firſt Reſurrection muſt
come to paſſe, ſeeing the Saints ſhall have their workes follow them,
according to the words of the ſpirit; beſides wee know very well,
that all our workes are ſowne into the great Myſtery; that they are
firſt brought forth into the foure Elements, and ſo paſſe into the
Myſtery,<note place="margin">☞</note> and are reſerved to the judgement of God, where all things
ſhall be tryed by fire, and that which is falſe ſhall conſume in the
fire; and the figures ſhall fall unto the Centre of Nature, <hi>Viz.</hi> the
darke Eternity.</p>
            <p>44. But if mens workes ſhall follow them in the firſt Reſurrection
as you affirme, then God muſt verily move the Myſtery (that is, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe)
which denotes <hi>the laſt Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>45. For God hath moved himſelf, but twice onely from Eternity;
once in the Creation of the World; and ſecondly in the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt according to his heart: the firſt motion belongeth to
the Father of all beings, and the ſecond to the Sonne according to
Gods heart; now the third motion of the holy Ghoſt is yet to be
accompliſhed both in love and anger,<note place="margin">☞</note> according to all the <hi>Three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi>
where all what ever hath beene corrupted ſhall againe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
in the motion of the holy Ghoſt, and each given unto its
owner.</p>
            <p>46. How can then the dead ariſe in their workes without the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy Spirit both in love and anger? When as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
of life doth onely conſiſt in him; moreover I doe not know
how the firſt reſurrection ſhould come to paſſe, whether it ſhould
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58072:37"/>
come to paſſe in the twofold man (which cannot otherwiſe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,)
that is, in good and evill; but what perfect Sabbath can
we hold therein, was not <hi>Adam</hi> unable ſo to ſtand?</p>
            <p>47. Now if the new man ſhould onely ariſe, then he would not
be in the foure Elements of this World; moreover the new body
in Chriſt need no reſurrection; it liveth eternally without any want,
neceſſity, or death, in Chriſt, and doth onely wait when God ſhall
move the Myſtery, where he ſhall <hi>then</hi> put on <hi>the Crowne</hi> of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and workes.</p>
            <p>48 <hi>The manner of the Reſurrection</hi> is thus;<note place="margin">☞</note> the Myſtery ſhall reſtore
what ever it hath ſwallowed up; mans workes ſhall be put upon
him, and therewith he ſhall Paſſe through the fire and it ſhall be
tryed what will endure the fire, or not.</p>
            <p>49. Now I <hi>cannot</hi> apprehend, how this ſhould agree with the
<hi>dwelling upon the Earth,</hi> for if it ſhould be after a Paradificall manner
that man ſhould ariſe with the wonders, then it could not be done
without the motion of the great Myſtery; for your writings ſay, that
alſo ſome wicked men ſhall ariſe; this ſheweth that the Myſtery
muſt be moved, and at the motion, the inflamation, [or laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of fire] muſt needs be; if now the Myſtery ſhould be moved
it would not onely move [awaken and raiſe up] ſome, and that
in one ſource onely; ſeeing that likewiſe ſome ungodly ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.</p>
            <p>50. Beſides you ſay, that they ſhal all dye at the end of the <hi>ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Yeares,</hi> then there muſt be a dwelling upon, or an inhabiting the
Earth, where the ungodly that ariſe ſhould again marry, and build;
of whom there ſhould not be onely ſome as according to your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but according to the Scripture <hi>they ſhall be as the Sand upon the
Sea ſhore;</hi> whence elſe ſhould Gog and Magog come,<note place="margin">☜</note> or how,
ſhould they fight againſt the Children of Paradiſe, for in the Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall
Children there is no ſtrife.</p>
            <p>51. Alſo it were not neceſſary,<note place="margin">☞</note> that they ſhould dye at the <hi>END</hi>
of the ſix thouſand yeares if they ſhould ariſe in the twofold body, as
we are now; but if they ſhould ariſe in the new body, then no ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man can eyther ſee, or touch them; like as we <hi>now</hi> doe <hi>not</hi> ſee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe;
even ſuch is the new body, no ungodly man can fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</p>
            <p>52. What ſhould they fight for? Are the Saints in Paradiſe?
Then they make no uſe of the externall Elements, but onely of the
internall Element, wherein all the foure are couched in unity; ſo
that they have nothing to ſtrive for, but they are ſeparate in the
Source.</p>
            <p>53. But ſhould the ungodly dye, and alſo ariſe againe in the ſoure
Elements; this ſeemeth much more ſtrange, but if they ſhould
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58072:37"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>iſe in the ſpirituall body, then the foure Elements could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it, but the <hi>Abyſſe;</hi> and ſtill they would be ſeparate as light, and
darkneſſe;<note place="margin">☞</note> what pleaſure or likeing ſhould God have to bring the
Saints againe into the combate and ſource of the foure Elements,
unto which they have beene ſo long dead? And yet ſhould they then
begin to fight with the wicked? Much more fit and agreeable were
it for thoſe who here have ſuffered nothing for Chriſts ſake; that is,
for thoſe who here upon the Earth have not loſt their lives for
Chriſts ſake.</p>
            <p>54. And though you would ſay, that they ſhould not fight, but
the Lord for them, what liking could God take to raiſe up the Saints
and to ſet them againe in the preſence of the ungodly; or ſhould
not the joy in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome be much greater then this in the
foure Elements; whence naturall ſtrife and contention doe ariſe;
but if they ſhould dwell in Paradiſe without the four Elements, then
no ſtrife, or ungodly man can reach them.</p>
            <p>55. Beſides, to what end ſhould the ungodly be upon the Earth,
if there ſhall be ſuch a <hi>Sabbath?</hi> Their ſource is not in the foure
Elements but in the Abyſſe, whither their ſoule goeth, when the
body dyeth.</p>
            <p>56. Beſides, ſhould none but thoſe dwell in the Sabbath who have
dyed for Chriſts ſake (of which verily there cannot be ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as is ſet downe in the <hi>Revelation</hi>) that they ſhould be ſufficient
to poſſeſſe the Earth; and ſhould the ungodly alſo dwell upon the
Earth, and hold their <hi>Helliſh Sabbath?</hi> This runs directly againſt
the light of Nature.</p>
            <p>57. Moreover Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That they ſhall marry, and bee given in
marriage, as in the dayes of Noah:</hi> Alſo two ſhall be grinding in one
Mill, and two ſleeping in one bed, and the one ſhall be taken, and
the other left; <hi>when the laſt day ſhall come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>58. Beſides,<note place="margin">☜</note> Chriſt ſaith alſo, That when he ſhall come to judge
the World, <hi>All generations and kindreds ſhall ſee him,</hi> and tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; and the wicked ſhall waile, and lament, and ſay to the
wiſe Virgins, give us of your oyle; all this denotes a <hi>Generall expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the laſt Judgement.</p>
            <p>59. For if at the laſt Trumpe, two ſhall bee lying in one bed,
(namely, one holy, the other ungodly) this ſhewes no difference,
and if the Saints be mixed with the ungodly, then verily there muſt
needs be a poore Sabbath.</p>
            <p>60. When we looke upon the words of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
they will not in the leaſt manner agree thereto; and though there
is mention made of a thouſand yeares in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> yet the
ſame is hidden from us;<note place="margin">☞</note> and wee know not <hi>when they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi>
or <hi>whether they are begun;</hi> if the firſt Reſurrection bee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radificall,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58072:38"/>
then it may be done without our knowledge.</p>
            <p>61. They ſhall not dwell among us, alſo they ſhall not Marry;
for we dye once from Male and Female, and we ſhall not ariſe Male
and Female, but we ſhall live in Paradiſe in the forme of Angels,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 22, 30.</p>
            <p>62. Beſides, the wicked ſhall in the appearance of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
entreat the wiſe for Oyle of Faith; and you write that the
fire of God (being the anger and helliſh ſource, ſhall be in them,
and that they ſhall be tormented (here upon the Earth in the foure
Elements) in the anger of God, whereas the anger of God is <hi>not
manifeſt</hi> in the foure Elements; for therein good and evill are mixt
together.</p>
            <p>63. But how ſhall he that is once dead to good, and cannot ſo
much as have one good thought, entreat the Saints for Faith and
comfort? It much rather declareth, that when Chriſt ſhall come to
judge the World,<note place="margin">☞</note> that they ſhall all yet dwell together in the fleſh,
in the foure Elements, where the one ſhall be received, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rejected; and the ſinnes of the wicked ſhall then come in his
ſight at the appearance of the ſevere countenance of God in the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
zeale of the firſt Principle, ſo that he ſhall be affrighted, and then
would faine begin to be honeſt.</p>
            <p>64. And though you mention that they ſhall onely awake, and
not ariſe, yet the uncorrupted are to be underſtood; now you ſay,
that they ſhall dwell upon the Earth in the foure Elements and the
Saints in Paradiſe; when this commeth to be, then there will be
no more any ſtrife or controverſie; but they are Eternally ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate.</p>
            <p>65. But ſhall the Saints dwell upon the Earth in Paradiſe, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
before the fall; and the ungodly be oppoſed to them, then they
are in danger as <hi>Adam</hi> was, that they ſhould againe eate of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit, whereof they ſhould yet once dye.</p>
            <p>66. But ſhall they be hidden from the ungodly a thouſand yeares
and alſo from the foure Elements,<note place="margin">☜</note> why ſhould they then firſt at the
end be manifeſt in the foure Elements, that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſhould
then enter Battell with the Children of Paradiſe? It doth <hi>neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with Scripture or Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>67. The firſt Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Chap.</hi> 15.
doth indeed teach of Chriſts, and alſo our Reſurrection, yet not of
a third: But firſt of Chriſts, and then of Ours; for he ſaith there,
<hi>That Chriſt is the firſt fruits;</hi> and then we who belong unto Chriſt;
this is the generall Reſurrection; and though he ſaith, <hi>That then
commeth the end,</hi> yet by the end hee ſignifieth no Reſurrection, but
the end is our Reſurrection; this is much rather to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
then that hee ſhould meane by the End, another Reſurrection,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58072:38"/>
or time; for juſt after our Reſurrection commeth the End of the
World.</p>
            <p>68. The dead ſhall firſt appeare before the judgement, ere that
the end of this World, and the foure Elements commeth; for the
End is the <hi>enkindling of the fire, and the Laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>69. Alſo the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and all Teachers from God have
alwayes repreſented the End as nigh at hand, for <hi>John</hi> himſelfe ſaith
in his Epiſtle, <hi>That we are in the End;</hi> he ſpeaketh indeed of the laſt
houre; but if the wicked were aſſured that he had yet four hundred
yeares unto the End, how would hee ſeeke after riches for his
Children.</p>
            <p>70. Beſides we are to looke unto the End, for this World is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
and determined in the beginning of the Creation; and then
into the End where the Creation ceaſed; all which, was finiſhed in
<hi>ſix dayes;</hi> and in ſuch a time the Myſtery of Gods Kingdome ſhall be
<hi>finiſhed,</hi> and a thouſand yeares are before him as one day.</p>
            <p>71. Concerning the Seventh day of Reſt, whether or no, the
World ſhall yet be in <hi>reſt a thouſand yeares;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> the ſame is hidden to
mankind; wee cannot certainely determine, wee muſt leave it unto
his might; I have no knowledge of it, ſeeing the Scripture doth not
give cleare evidence, when the thouſand yeares <hi>begin,</hi> or what <hi>yeares</hi>
they be, or to what they have relation; therefore I let it alone in
its owne worth, and will hinder none that hath a certaine knowledge
or command ſo to teach; this I give you to conſider of, meaning it
well unto you.</p>
            <p>72. What I might further anſwer concerning this matter, you
finde ſufficiently in my Writings; although I could ſet downe a
large Anſwer about it, yet I thought it not expedient, ſeeing <hi>this</hi>
knowledge is <hi>not</hi> given to me; thereupon I let it alone, for I know
that I muſt give an account of my Workes, and I ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d you by
the Bearer hereof your two Bookes againe, and give you thankes
for them.</p>
            <p>73. Concerning the End, or limit of <hi>Babels downefall (Viz.</hi>
that <hi>Babel</hi> ſhould be wholly deſtroyed about the yeare 1630<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your computation, and albeit many more bee of the
ſame minde) the ſame likewiſe is <hi>not ſufficiently</hi> manifeſt to me.</p>
            <p>74. To me indeed is given to know,<note place="margin">☜</note> that the time is <hi>nigh,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now at hand, but the yeare and day I know not; thereupon I
leave it to Gods Counſell, and to thoſe to whom God ſhall reveale
it; I cannot <hi>conclude</hi> any thing <hi>without certaine knowledge,</hi> otherwiſe
I ſhould be found a <hi>Lyar</hi> before God.</p>
            <p>75. But I waite for my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and will ſee what he
will doe; will he that I ſhall know it, then I will know it; if not,
then I will not know it; I have committed my will, knowledge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58072:39"/>
and deſire unto him; he ſhall be my knowing, willing,
and alſo doing; for without him there is meere danger, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty.</p>
            <p>76. Man doth hardly reach that which is before his eyes, much
leſſe that which is hidden and Myſticall, except God be his light;
this anſwer I give you out of good affection to conſider of; albeit I
I am a ſimple meane man, and borne of no Art in this World [or
not bred up in any <hi>Scholaſtique</hi> Learning.]</p>
            <p>77. But what I have, that is the gift of God, I have it not from any
Art,<note place="margin">☞</note> or Studying, but from the light of grace, which I onely ſought
for; and though my beginning was ſimple by reaſon of my Childiſh
underſtanding; yet God hath ſince that time in his light, wrought
ſomewhat in me, and opened my Childiſh eyes.</p>
            <p>78. As for the Booke <hi>Aurora</hi> (which is the firſt) it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be <hi>better explained</hi> in many places; for at that time the full
apprehenſion was not born in me, for like as a ſudden ſhower, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it lights upon, it hits; even ſo it went with the fiery inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>79. Although I had no purpoſe at all, that any ſhould read it;
I wrote onely the wonders of God which were ſhewne unto me, for
a memoriall to my ſelfe; and it went abroad without my conſent, and
it was taken from me per-force, and publiſhed without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
for I thought to keepe it by me as long as I lived; and had
no intent to be knowne with all, among ſuch high perſons as now is,
come to paſſe.</p>
            <p>80. But the moſt high (in whoſe hands and power all things are)
had another purpoſe therewith as is now manifeſt; and as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
it is knowne in many Cities, and Countries; at which I doe
wonder, and alſo not wonder; for the Lord doth effect his worke
marvellouſly, beyond and above all reaſon; although he ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
a Shepheard in the work: and albeit the Art, and outward Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
will give him no Roome, and place, yet however his purpoſe
muſt ſtand againſt all the Ragings of the Devill.</p>
            <p>81. And though I have not obteined many dayes of pleaſure
thereby; yet I muſt not therefore reſiſt his will; I have written
onely according to the forme as it was given to me; not according
to other Maſters or Writings.</p>
            <p>82. And beſides my intent was onely for my ſelfe, albeit the
ſpirit ſhewed me how it ſhould fall out; yet my heart willed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but committed the ſame to him to doe therewith what he
pleaſed.</p>
            <p>83. I have not run with it (<hi>not being called</hi>) and made my ſelfe
knowne to any; for I can ſay alſo with truth that my acquaintance
knew leaſt of it; but what I have ſhewne unto any, the ſame
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58072:39"/>
was done upon his entreaty and importunate deſire.</p>
            <p>84. And then further I give you to underſtand, ſeeing that you
have my writings in hand to read, that you would not looke upon
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as comming from a great <hi>Maſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> for Art is not to be ſeene, or
found therein; but great earneſtneſſe of a zealous minde, which
thirſteth after God; in which thirſt it hath received great things;
as the illuminate mind ſhall well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee, and without light, no man ſhall
rightly know, and apprehend them, as the <hi>Reader</hi> ſhall ſurely
finde.</p>
            <p>85. And yet it could not be written more clearely, and ready
for the underſtanding; although I conceive that the ſame is cleare,
and plaine enough in ſuch a depth; but yet if there were any thing
that ſhould ſeeme too obſcure, and difficult; I might repreſent it in
a more ſimple and plaine manner if <hi>it were mentioned to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>86. There are yet other Bookes beſides this, written concerning
the wiſedome of God, of a very deep ſence, and underſtanding;
treating of the great depths of the wonders of God, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
I have not at hand.</p>
            <p>87. But that I give you not a large anſwer of my judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Booke concerning the thouſand yeares Sabbath, and the
foure hundred yeares in <hi>Zyon</hi> (which you ſuppoſe to prove with
many places of holy Scripture) is, becauſe I doe not fundamentally
and certainely know whether thoſe <hi>Texts</hi> may be applyed to ſuch
a meaning.</p>
            <p>88. For there be many ſayings of Scripture which ſeeme to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
onely <hi>one Generall Reſurrection</hi> of the dead; and they are
cleare, eſpecially in the words of Chriſt in the ſoure Evangeliſts,
which I hold for the moſt certaine.</p>
            <p>89. In like manner the Cauſe ſtands with <hi>Zyon;</hi> that wickedneſſe
ſhall continue to the end, and though a <hi>Zyon</hi> ſhall be, yet it will not
be <hi>wholly</hi> Univerſall; <hi>Babel</hi> ſhall go to ruin, and get another forme;
yet they ſhall not all be Children of God, that are called Children
in <hi>Zyon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>90. Alſo I have no knowledge of the thouſand yeares Sabbath;
I know not ſufficiently to ground it with Scripture; for we finde
one place ſeeming to croſſe another; men may interpret the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as they are diſpoſed,<note place="margin">☜</note> but ſeeing I have <hi>no command</hi> from God
of it; I let it alone and leave every one to anſwer for his owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion:
This I tell you ſyncerely out of good affection, and am
however your faithfull Friend in the love of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>91. In your forty ſecond, and forty third Page, where you write
of the Myſtery of the <hi>Soules departed</hi> [or ſeparated] you bring
the opinion of <hi>Theophraſtus, and others into queſtion,</hi> and ſuſpition, as
if they had not written aright of the Myſtery; it were better, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58072:40"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
you ſay, and juſt ſo it ſeemes: you ſhall finde in my Booke of the
<hi>Forty Queſtions</hi> [about the thirtieth Queſtion] concerning the laſt
Judgement, and alſo in other Queſtions, ſufficient and large infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
if the ſame be read and rightly underſtood.</p>
            <p>92. There is no need of <hi>any</hi> further ſearching,<note place="margin">☜</note> it is <hi>there cleare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi>
what the Myſtery is, that comprizeth body and ſoule; and
alſo what condition the ſeparated ſoules are in, both with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the laſt Judgement; and alſo in the meane time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their habitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſource, life, and difference: I had thought
that it was ſo deeply and highly grounded, that the minde of man
ſhould be ſatisfied enough therewith; and if you neither have, nor
cannot ſet forth any thing more fundamentall; then it remaines of
right in its owne place, the thouſand yeares Sabbath, and the foure
hundred years in <hi>Zy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> will but finde fault with all, and bring it into
ſuſpition; and though many objections might be made, yet they
would be of no ſervice or eſteeme.</p>
            <p>93. Moreover the manifeſtation of the thouſand yeares Sabbath is
not of much importance, or concernement to the World, ſeeing we
have <hi>not ſufficient</hi> ground of the ſame, it ſhould of right reſt in the
Divine Omnipotence; for we have enough in the Sabbath of the
new birth; for that ſoule that obtaines this Sabbath [of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration]
will after the death of the earthly body,<note place="margin">☞</note> have Sabbath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in Paradiſe; we may very well leave, and commend the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unto the Divine Omnipotence, and waite on God what he will
doe with us, when we ſhall be in him and he in us.</p>
            <p>94. For I ſuppoſe there ſhould be a better Sabbath in God, then
in this World; and if man ſhould dwell upon the earth in Paradiſe,
then muſt God reſtore that which in his curſe entred into the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as is to be ſeen in the forty Queſtions.</p>
            <p>95. But that you ſuppoſe that the righteous ſhall <hi>not</hi> be brought
with their workes before the judgement, is <hi>contrary</hi> to the words
of Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>That all things ſhall bee proved through the
Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>96. I ſay <hi>not</hi> (that they ſhall come) <hi>into</hi> the judgement, for the
judgement is in the wicked underſtand the judgement of Anger, of
which the Scripture ſaith the righteous, or as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that
beleeveth on me commeth not unto judgement;</hi> hee underſtands hereby,
the ſource or paine of the judgement, his words doe hold forth,
that they ſhall all come together before the judgement, and every
one heare his ſentence; The ungodly depart hence, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
come hither, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>97. Alſo every one ſhall ſtand forth with his owne workes in the
Myſtery; and themſelves be judged according to their workes;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58072:40"/>
now you know very well that our workes in this World have beene
wrought in good and evill, and ſhall be proved and ſeparated in the
fire of God; how ſhall they then being unſeparated, follow the
Saints in the Reſurrection to the Sabbath, and <hi>they</hi> hold Sabbath
therein? But if they ſhall follow them,<note place="margin">☜</note> then they muſt be tryed and
ſeparated in the Fre; and then they ſhall have no more any need
to come before the judgement; but if they ſhould keep a Sabbath
without their workes, then they are not perfect.</p>
            <p>98. If we would ſpeake of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and apprehend the ſame,
then we muſt have cleare eyes to ſee into it; for the internall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radificall
World, and the externall World doe hang one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
we have onely turned our ſelves out of the internall into the
externall, and ſo we worke in two Worlds.</p>
            <p>99. Death cannot ſeparate our workes,<note place="margin">☞</note> the fire of God muſt doe
it; for they remaine in one Myſtery till the judgement of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one at the houre of the Reſurrection ſhall come forth in his
owne Myſtery, and he ſhall ſee his workes before him, and feele
them in him.</p>
            <p>100. It is not underſtood that they ſhall anſwer for their ſelves
with words, for the Kingdome of God conſiſts, and proceeds in
Power; and albeit the ungodly ſhall cry out, Woe upon his abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
and Seducers; yet every mans worke ſhall bee <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
in POWER,</hi> which ſhall either rejoyce, or torment
him.</p>
            <p>101. Now the old body of this World, is the Myſtery of this
World, and the new body is the Myſtery of the Divine light World,
and the ſoule is the Myſtery of God the Father, and the Earth with
the Elements hath alſo both Myſteries, which ſhal be moved through
the Principle of the Father.</p>
            <p>102. And then the doores of the Myſteries ſhall be ſet open, and
each ſhall give and ſet forth its <hi>Figures</hi> which it hath ſwallowed up,
for the Principle of the ſoule muſt ſtand before the judgement with
both the Myſteries.</p>
            <p>103. Happy are they which ſhall have the body of Chriſt in the
Myſtery of the wrath [or fire of Gods anger] they ſhall have the
ſoules fire,<note place="margin">☞</note> or the Principle of the Father ſurrounded with the light
World, and illuſtrate with the Majeſty, they ſhall feele no paine,
or hurt; and ſhall paſſe unſenſibly through the fire; and there
the outward, or third Principle ſhall be proved; and all earthlineſſe
or falſhood, ſhall remaine in the fire; but the workes ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated
in the fire, and freed from their earthly ſource, and ſoyle;
and then the <hi>earthly Myſtery</hi> remaineth in the fire, and is a <hi>food</hi> of
the fire; whence the light ariſeth, and the <hi>Righteous looſeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:58072:41"/>
104. For the works of love which were brought forth in the new
body,<note place="margin">☞</note> doe paſſe with the ſpirit of the ſoule through the fire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
in the Divine Image in the ſource of the light; and they of
the third Principle, that is, of this World, doe remaine in the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource
of the Soule.</p>
            <p>105. But that which hath been wrought and acted in an wholly
evill and malicious manner in the third Principle; and yet in this
World hath not been renewed by earneſt Repentance, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilment
toward his Brother; that falleth unto the <hi>centre of Nature;</hi>
that is, the root of the darke World.</p>
            <p>106. But the workes of the ungodly ſhall not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
in the fire; for the fire ſwalloweth them downe in it ſelfe to
the darke Centre <hi>Viz.</hi> the Originall of nature wherein the <hi>Devills
dwell;</hi> and thither also goeth there-ſoules fire being the Fathers
principle; for this fire of the ſoule ſhall have no matter to make it
burn aright; but it ſhall be as a quenched darke painfull ſourſe-fire;
onely as an anguiſh that would faine produce fire; this is called
<hi>Gods wrath</hi> (and not a principle) a death or a dying ſource.</p>
            <p>107. For the principle of the father, wherein the right, and
true ſoule conſiſts, is a flaming fire which giveth light, and in the
light is the pretious Image of God; for that light doth qualify, and
ſweeten the burning light with the eſſentialty of <hi>Love;</hi> ſo that it is a
pleaſing delight, and a cauſe of <hi>nature,</hi> and of life.</p>
            <p>108. Therefore I tell you, that you ſhould not thinke it ſtrange
or miſunderſtand it; when I or any other (let it be <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> or
who it will) write, that man, ſhall ſtand before the Judgment
<hi>with his body which he had here:</hi> I perceive very well, that you have
not as yet underſtood my Writings in the Book of <hi>the Threefold life,</hi>
and alſo in the Booke of <hi>the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (which treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of Chriſts ſuffering,<note place="margin">☞</note> dying, and riſing againe; and how we muſt
enter into his death, and ariſe out of his death) you ſhall finde it
cleare enough explained, and enlarged; but ſeeing you have them
not yet at hand, be pleaſed to have patience, you may very likely get
them to read; and then you will be <hi>freed</hi> from your perplexity;
and deepe ſearching in this manner.</p>
            <p>109. For they lay their ground much deeper then your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
is in this; doe but read them right, you ſhall verily find
what the Myſtery is, what the magicall <hi>Byſſe,</hi> and <hi>Abyſſe</hi> is, alſo what
the Being of all Beings is; there needs no conſulting with one, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
he that underſtands the great Myſtery whence all Beings
have proceeded, and doe ſtill proceed; he doth not encumber
himſelfe with ſuch large circumferences.</p>
            <p>110. You have undertaken a very hard labour which doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but perplex, eat up, and conſume your life? it is wholly need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58072:41"/>
he that findeth, and knoweth the great Myſtery, he findeth all
things therein; there need no literall demonſtration; God, Chriſt,
and the eternity with all wonders do lye therein; the <hi>Holy Ghoſt is the
Key to it;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> are you in the new birth as you ſay, then there is no need
of ſuch hard ſeeking, with ſuch hard labour; ſeek onely Chriſt in
the Manger, in the dark Stable, when you finde him, then you ſhall
indeed find where he fitteth at the righ, hand of God.</p>
            <p>111. Searching onely doth nothing; the <hi>Phyloſophers Stone</hi> is a
very dark diſeſteemed Stone, of a <hi>Gray</hi> colour, but therein lyeth the
higheſt Tincture; would you ſearch out the <hi>Myſterium Magnum,</hi>
then take before you onely the Earth with its Mettals, and ſo you
may well finde what the Magicall or Cabaliſticall ground is.</p>
            <p>112. The deep and Myſticall numbers,<note place="margin">☜</note> which otherwiſe no man
is able to fathom or finde out, lye all in the Myſtery; but hee that
findes it, ſearcheth not after the numbers, he taketh Gold for Earth;
and doth as one that hath a coſtly Treaſure lying in an obſcure place;
the Manger and ſwadling cloaths of Chriſt are more acceptable to him
then the whole World with its Figures [or externall pompe, and
glory] he hides the <hi>Numbers themſelves,</hi> for the outward Kingdome
muſt accompliſh its wonders.</p>
            <p>113. Wherefore ſhould the earthly Myſtery, be unvailed <hi>before
the time;</hi> enquire of the<note n="*" place="margin">Magi.</note> 
               <hi>Magiſts,</hi> who have underſtood the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and earthly <hi>Magia;</hi> wherefore they have kept the <hi>Tincture</hi>
ſecret, and not revealed it; there is no other cauſe at all, but that
the World is <hi>not</hi> worthy of it; ſo likewiſe it is <hi>not</hi> worthy of the
<hi>Numbers</hi> of the Myſtery.</p>
            <p>114. Therefore God hath hidden them from us,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> that the earthly
Myſtery might accompliſh and fulfill all its wonders on us; and that
all the Violls of Gods anger be poured forth on us; how can a man
undertake to reveale ſuch ſecret things <hi>without</hi> the <hi>conſent</hi> of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
indeed he tampereth about the outſide of the Myſtery, but
if he comes in he muſt have the will of the Myſtery.</p>
            <p>115. The outward inſtigation to manifeſt and reveale the Myſtery,
proceedeth from the <hi>Starres;</hi> for they would faine be freed from
vanity, and they drive mightily in the <hi>Magicall Children</hi> to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation;
therefore we muſt prove and examine the inſtigation,
whether it proceed from Gods light, from Gods ſpirit, or from the
Dominion or Government of the Stars.</p>
            <p>116. For Gods ſpirit ſpeaketh plainely of his Myſtery, he onely
declareth the <hi>Turba,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> and letteth the <hi>Numbers</hi> alone; he hath once
ſigned, and ſealed the Myſtery, with the might of the firſt Principle
in the <hi>Seven formes of Nature</hi> to the wonders of God; and againe
he hath ſigned it in the Love in the humanity of Chriſt, with the
<hi>Seven golden Candleſticks</hi> and lights; and therewith hee continues

untill the judgement; each number manifeſts it ſelfe <hi>in its owne Age;</hi>
no creature hath power to manifeſt the ſame, for he that hath it,
<hi>dares not;</hi> elſe he tranſgreſſeth the Magicall order, and becomes a
loathing to the Myſtery.</p>
            <p>117. And therefore the Prophets,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and alſo Chriſt himſelfe have

            <argument>
               <p>Concerning the way to true
Knowledge, and the Regeneration
in CHRIST:
Likewiſe concerning the thouſand yeares

            <opener>Our Salvation in Chriſt Jeſus.</opener>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ORTHY, and much reſpected
Sir, and in Chriſt beloved Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I have received your laſt
Letter, and therein I have once
more underſtood, and well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
your zealous inflamed minde,
in your intended labour, and hard
Study; and then your anxious
earneſt deſire after the light of
the true knowledge thereof; and
thirdly, the great thirſt after the
fountaine and well-ſpring of Chriſt, wherein the minde is refreſhed,
quickned, comforted, ſatisfied, and appeaſed; and conſidering that
I am a Servant to my Brethren, and no leſſe then a Debtor in the
Love of Chriſt to them; therefore I ſhall in the ſame Love, ſhew and
impart to you what I know, and what is given to me; ſeeing your
deſire alſo requireth it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58072:43"/>
2. Chriſt ſaid, I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in me,<note place="margin">☞</note> and I in him, ſhall bring forth much fruit; for without
me you can doe nothing; alſo he that abideth in me and [hath]
my wordes [abiding] in him, hee bringeth forth much fruit;
herein lyeth the whole ground, and it is the onely root or ſpring to
the Fountaine whence the <hi>Divine underſtanding</hi> floweth; there is <hi>no
other</hi> ground to the true and reall-knowledge in the wiſedome of
God, <hi>no other</hi> ſeeking, ſtudying, or ſearching doth availe, any
thing.</p>
            <p>3. For every ſpirit ſearcheth onely its owne depth; [or reacheth
no further then its owne naturall capacity or inſtinct] and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
that wherein it doth enkindle its ſelfe; and though it doth
ſearch in its owne enkindling, yet it findeth no more but a type or
repreſentation of things like a ſhadow, or dreame; it is not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Being it ſelfe; for if it would ſee the Being, then it muſt be
in the Being, and the Being in it; that ſo it may be capable of the
Being, and ſee really in the Being it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>4. Now then, ſeeing that we are dead in <hi>Adam</hi> to the Divine eſſence
and are become blind and eſtranged; we have no power in us <hi>as from
our ſelves,</hi> we know nothing of God in our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but onely the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
that there is a God, we doe neither feele his power, nor ſee his
light, unleſſe we returne, and become like unto Children, which
know nothing but are guided, and ruled; and as a Child lookes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its mother, and longeth after her; and ſhee alſo cheriſheth, and
bringeth it up; ſo muſt the externall reaſon be blinded, beaten
downe, and quite quaſht.</p>
            <p>5. And the deſire muſt reſigne, and caſt it ſelfe into the grace,
and Love of God, and not reguard the oppoſition, and contradiction
of the outward reaſon, which ſaith, it is nothing ſo; God is afar of;
you muſt ſearch, meditate, and repreſent him onely to your ſelfe by
your apprehenſion; you muſt ſeeke after his will, how he hath
<hi>revealed himſelfe;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">How he hath revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his Word.</note> ſo he will be knowne, and no otherwiſe; thus
the externall, hyſtoricall, Aſtrall reaſon doth judge; and it ruleth alſo
the whole World except a very ſmall number of Gods Children.</p>
            <p>6. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>you muſt abide in me, for without me you can doe
nothing;</hi> you can neither know nor ſearch out any thing really, and
fundamentally of God? <hi>for he that cometh to me; him I will in no wiſe
caſt out; in me you ſhall bring forth much fruit; now every branch grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
on its owne tree; and hath the ſap, power, influence, vertue, and
property of the tree; and beareth fruit according to the quality,
kinde, and property of the tree.</p>
            <p>7. Thus likewiſe he who deſireth to be taught of God, and to have
Divine knowledg,<note place="margin">☞</note> muſt ſtand in the tree whereinto God hath engraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us through, the <hi>Regeneration;</hi> he muſt have the ſap and vertue of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58072:43"/>
the tree, elſe he bringeth forth ſtrange, unſavory, wild fruit, which
hath not the taſt and reliſh of the good tree; we muſt become like
unto a Child which underſtands nothing; but onely knoweth its
mother, and longeth after her.</p>
            <p>8. We muſt drink of the new milk of Chriſts Incarnation; that
ſo we may be made partakers of his fleſh, and ſpirit; his vertue, and
ſap muſt be our vertue, and ſap; we muſt become Gods Children in
<hi>Divine Eating and Drinking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſaid; <hi>How can it be that a man ſhould be borne againe
in his old age?</hi> Yes good <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> and good externall earthly
Reaſon, how could it be that <hi>Adam</hi> who was a perfect Image of God,
did periſh in his perfection, and became earthly; did it not come to
paſſe by <hi>Imagination,</hi> becauſe he induced his deſire, longing, and luſt,
into the outward Aſtrall, Elementall, and earthly Kingdome [and
did ſet his minde upon the Dominion of this World] whereupon
he in his deſire, luſt, and imagination, was forthwith impregnated,
and became earthly; and thereby he fell into the ſleep of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<hi>Magia;</hi> and thus it is alſo with the <hi>New birth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Through <hi>Imagination, and an earneſt ſerious deſire,</hi> we become
againe impregnated of the Deity,<note place="margin">☞</note> and receive the New body in the
Old; the New doth not mix it ſelfe with the Old; like as Gold in
the groſſe and rough ſtone is quite another thing, and hath <hi>another
Tincture and ſpirit,</hi> then the rough matter in the ſtone; thus alſo is
the New man in the Old, the rough ſtone knoweth nothing of the
Gold; and ſo likewiſe the earthly <hi>Adam</hi> knoweth nothing of the
Divine heavenly <hi>Adam;</hi> and therefore there is ſtrife in Man, and
Man is contrary to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>11. The earthly <hi>Adam</hi> will ſee, feele, and taſte, but he receiveth
onely a ray, type, and twinckling reflex from the internall Man;
where he indeed at ſome times taſteth ſomewhat of the Divine Man,
but not eſſentially; but as the light of the Sunne doth diſperſe, or
ſwallow up the ſad darkneſſe, ſo that it appeareth as if there were
no darkneſſe more at all; and yet the darkneſſe is really hidden in
the light, which againe is manifeſt when the light of the Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth.</p>
            <p>12. Thus oftentimes the New man doth in the Divine Power,
ſwallow up the Old, that the Old man ſuppoſeth that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the Deity, whereas he is not capable of that eſſence, but
the ſpirit of God from the New man doth paſſe through the Old;
but when the ſame entreth againe into its Myſtery, then the Old
man knoweth not what hapned unto it;<note place="margin">☜</note> but it ſeeketh wayes to
come to God, and ſearcheth after the purpoſe and will of God; and
yet findeth nothing but invention, fiction, and opinion, and it is
very zealous in its opinions, and knoweth not what it doth, it find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58072:44"/>
not the root; for it is not capable or worthy of it; and this
ſheweth that it muſt dye and periſh.</p>
            <p>13. But the New man,<note place="margin">☞</note> which in an earneſt ſerious will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ariſeth through Imagination [or the effectuall operation of
true Faith] abideth ſtedfaſt in the reſt of Chriſt, even in the Tree
(which God the Father by his motion, when he moved himſelfe the
ſecond time according to his heart, did ingraft into the humane
ſoule) and it ſpringeth forth in the life of God, and doth grow and
flouriſh in the power, vertue, and ſap of the Divine Eſſentiality, in
Gods Love; this receiveth Divine knowledge and skill, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the meaſure of the externall will, what the externall man
will know and ſearch out, but according to the meaſure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Heaven; the internall Heaven doth enkindle [and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten]
the externall, ſo that the underſtanding or intellectuall faculty
of the ſoule doth comprehend, and underſtand the externall.</p>
            <p>14. For God who is a ſpirit, and alſo a Being, hath manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by the externall World in a ſimilitude, that the ſpirit might
ſee it ſelfe in the Being eſſentially, and not ſo onely, but that the
Creature likewiſe might contemplate and behold the being of God
in the Figure, and know it.</p>
            <p>15. For no Creature is able to ſee the Being of God without it
ſelfe; the ſpirit ſeeth God in the Eſſence and Luſtre of the Majeſty;
and the ſame likewiſe in its ſelfe, and its owne fellow creatures like
it ſelfe; for God is himſelfe the ſpirit of all Beings (underſtand of
heavenly Beings) ſo that when we ſee the Divine Creature, then we
ſee an Image or likeneſſe proceeded from Gods Being; and when
we ſee the will and working of that Creature, then we ſee the will
and working of God.</p>
            <p>16. Thus alſo is the New man borne of God; what it willeth and
doth, that is Gods will and worke, its knowing is Gods knowing, for
we know nothing of God without Gods ſpirit.</p>
            <p>17. The externall cannot ſee the internall, but if the internall
draweth the externall by a glimps [or influence of light in its owne
Idea or ſpeculation] into it ſelfe; then the externall apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the mirrour or reſemblance of the internall for an inſtruction
and direction, to ſhew that the externall World taketh its riſe and
originall from the internall, and that <hi>Our workes ſhall follow us in
the Myſtery;</hi> and that by the ſeparation of Gods judgement; by the
ſire of the Principle, they ſhall be ſet into the eternall World.</p>
            <p>18. To which end God hath created Angels, and Men, namely,
for his deeds of Wonders,<note place="margin">☞</note> that the wiſedome of the <hi>Divine Power</hi>
might appeare, and that God might behold himſelfe in the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
and Ideas of the Creatures, and have joy in himſelfe with the
Beings created out of his owne wiſedome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:58072:44"/>
19. Loving Brother, take it not ill, that I ſpeak roundly to you; you
complaine that you are not alwayes able to reach, comprehend, and
keepe the Divine Myſteries; and moreover you ſay that many times
you get a glimps of them; and that my Writings are <hi>hard</hi> and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be underſtood of you; I wil therfore ſhew unto you, according
to the power and ability that I have received from God, how the
being of your hidden Myſtery ſtandeth, which at preſent you are not
able to underſtand.</p>
            <p>20. Your meaning, and will is to keep [the light of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery]
in a continued ſtedfaſt comprehenſion; this is the will of
the <hi>externall World</hi> in you, it would faine be capable of the Deity,
and be freed from vanity; but the ſpirit of the externall World,
muſt ſtand in continuall travell,<note place="margin">☞</note> and earneſt <hi>Seeking;</hi> ſor by its ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it findeth the wonders of its owne <hi>Magia,</hi> namely, the Type and
reſemblance of the internall World.</p>
            <p>21. For God doth not alwayes move himſelfe, but the <hi>longing,</hi> and
earneſt travelling of the Creature <hi>moveth the Myſtery,</hi> that the Image,
or Idea of the Divine wiſedome may be ſought and found; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt commandeth us to <hi>Seeke, and knock;</hi> and withall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
to give us the Pearle or Jewell <hi>in the ſeeking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. The externall World likewiſe is of God, and from God, and
Man is to that end created into the externall World, that he might
bring the externall Figures into the internall; that he might bring
the end into the beginning.</p>
            <p>23. The more man longeth after God, and the more he panteth,
and runneth after him,<note place="margin">☞</note> the more he commeth out of the end into the
beginning; not onely to Gods wonder, but to his owne edification,
for the twig of the Tree continually thirſteth after the ſap and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Tree, it travelleth in deſire after the Tree, and draweth
its ſap and influence into it, and ſo thereby it groweth up to be a
great branch; thus the anxious hunger, and earneſt longing in the
<hi>Humane Myſtery</hi> draweth the Kingdome of God into it ſelfe; of which
Chriſt ſayd, <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent
take it by force to themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>24. A Being or Eſſence that is not attractive, cannot grow up,
or get a body to it ſelfe, but it ſtarveth and pineth away; as we ſee
the fire of the Candle draweth, or attracteth the fat into it ſelfe, and
devoureth it and yet it affordeth from its devouring, a ſhining light;
thus it is with Man, he is ſhut up, and encloſed (with his firſt Divine
Eſſence) in the darkneſſe of death; but God hath againe opened
the ſame to the ſoule in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>25. Now the poore captivated ſoule is this very hungry <hi>Magicall</hi>
fire, which doth aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne attract to it ſelfe out of the, <hi>Incarnation</hi> of
Chriſt the Divine diſcloſed Eſſence; and ſo it feedeth on Gods Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58072:45"/>
and taketh it into it ſelfe, and from this [ſpirituall and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall]
eating, conſuming, or digeſting, it giveth forth a body of light,
which is both like unto, and capable of the Deity; thus the poore
ſoule becomes cloathed with a body of light, as the fire in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and in this body of light it findeth reſt; but in the darkneſſe
of this World [in its earthly carkaſſe and cloathing of clay, wherein
the Curſe of God, and all evill inclinations and falſe deſires do ſtick]
it hath anguiſh, and trouble.</p>
            <p>26 But now ſeeing it is ſo, that it hath with <hi>Adam</hi> put upon it
ſelfe the earthly Image, it muſt therefore beare the ſame; as the
fire of the Candle muſt take its burning light from the darke lumpe
of fat; if it had with <hi>Adam</hi> abode in Gods being, and had not put
on the earthly Image, it needed not to have borne the ſame,<note place="margin">☜</note> but
now it is bound to beare it.</p>
            <p>27. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To whom you give your ſelves as Servants
in obedience, his ſervants you are; be it to ſinne, unto death, or to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of God, unto righteouſneſſe:</hi> Now ſeeing the ſoule hath put
on the earthly Image, which worketh nothing but fruit to death, and
hath yeelded and devoted it ſelfe a ſervant to Sin, it is therefore
now become the <hi>ſinfull ſervant</hi> of death.</p>
            <p>28. Wherefore is it fallen in love with a ſtrange Maſter that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineereth
over it? Had it but remained a childe, and had not luſted
after the Tree of knowledge of good and evill; it needed not then
to have beene in ſubjection to both Governments, but being it
would be as God in love, and anger, according to both the Principles
of Eternity, thereupon it muſt now beare the Image, and undergoe
the force and ſway of both,<note place="margin">☜</note> and ſo endure the fire-burning [the
curſe and anger of God enkindled in the divided properties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture]
till the day of Separation.</p>
            <p>29. Therefore its called a bearing of the Croſſe, for when the
Magicall fire ariſeth,<note place="margin">☞</note> it maketh a Croſſe-like-birth; and the one
forme of nature doth preſſe, and quite pierce through the other;
that is, the one is contrary to the other, as ſweet againſt ſoure, ſharp
againſt bitter, and the fire againſt them all.</p>
            <p>30. And if the ſoule had let the body of light be onely Lord and
Maſter, and had not imagined on the externall Kingdome of this
World (that is, on the ſpirit of the great World in the Starres, and
Elements) nor luſted after the earthly fruit; then the wrath [or
the working power of darkneſſe in the Curſe of God, which is the
departure of his love from a<note n="*" place="margin">O, <hi>Thing.</hi>
               </note> Being] had been as it were ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in it; [and would not have beene manifeſt or apparent]
there would not have been any ſenſe, perceivance, or feeling of
the ſame; but ſeeing it is departed from the meekneſſe of the light
and gone out of the love of God; <hi>therefore</hi> it ſeeleth now the wrath,
or burning anger of the eternall Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:58072:45"/>
31. And therefore it muſt worke, labour, and endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the light againe; whence it is that the life of man ſtandeth in
ſuch anguiſh, in painefull ſeeking, in continuall abſtinence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
it earneſtly deſireth the Divine Reſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> and yet is held back
by the wrath of Nature.</p>
            <p>32. The more the life deſireth to fly from the wrath [or fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Nature] the <hi>more ſtrong</hi> and vehement the ſtrife groweth
in the life, beſides that which the Devill by his poyſonfull Incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Magicall imaginations, repreſentations, and inſinuations,
doth ſtirre up, and bring into his <hi>Neſt</hi> [being the Centre of the
ſoule] he continually repreſenteth before the ſoule, the Magicall
Image of the poyſonfull Serpent, that the ſoule might ſtill imagine
upon it, and kindle or inflame it ſelfe in the poyſon of the ſame,
which daily commeth to paſſe; and thus the fire of the ſoule becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
an evill poyſonfull burning brimſtony-fire.</p>
            <p>33. Yet if the ſoule departeth from the Serpent-like Image of
the Devill and rejecteth the evill earthly Tree [whereon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
hath cunningly twin'd himſelfe] which <hi>Tree</hi> is Pride, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
Envy, Anger, and Falſhood; and longeth not after it,
but maketh it ſelfe as it were dead in this Figure, as if it knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it; and caſteth away the very concupiſcence and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it ſelfe; and deſireth onely the love of God ſubmitting it ſelfe
wholly to Gods will and working, that he may be onely its willing,
working, and doing; then the Divine light beginneth to ſhine in it,
and it obtaineth an eye of the right ſeeing, ſo that it is able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
its owne naturall forme and feature, whereby it ſteppeth into
plaine, downright, and meek humility.</p>
            <p>34. It willeth nothing, it alſo deſireth nothing, but reſigneth, and
caſteth it ſelfe into the boſome of its Mother;<note place="margin">☞</note> like a Childe that
deſireth nothing but its Mother, inclining it ſelfe to her, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely after her; it doth not much eſteeme any Art, ſubtill
Reaſon, or much knowledge; and though it knoweth much, yet it
is not puft up, or elevated in its owne conceit by its knowledge,
but leaveth, and reſigneth the knowing, willing, and working,
wholly to its Mothers ſpirit, that it might be both the will and
worke in it.</p>
            <p>35. I ſpeak according to my knowledg,<note place="margin">☜</note> that the Devill in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Gods anger doth continually ſhoot againſt, and oppoſe this
pretious ſprout of the ſoule [or noble twig of Divine light, and
love, ſpringing forth from the <hi>Tree of life, Chriſt, within us,</hi> and doth
caſt vaine infinuations, falſe deſires, and earthly imaginations] after
the root of nature, that is, after the formes of the fire-life in the firſt
principle [to enkindle them in their owne naturall working pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
which are ſelfe-pride, covetouſneſſe, envy, anger, falſhood,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58072:46"/>
hypocriſie, luſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] and would continually by all meanes quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the pretious ſprout [or noble twig of grace] He continually
ſhooteth his evill poyſonfull rayes into the ſoules Magicall fire with
evill luſts, concupiſcence, and thoughts; and miniſtreth ſtrange mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or fuell to the ſoules fire to burne or feed upon, ſo that it might
by no meanes attain to a ſhining light; he quencheth, ſuppreſſeth,
and hindreth it; that his Kingdome might not be knowne.</p>
            <p>36. But on the other ſide, the <hi>noble twig</hi> defendeth it ſelfe, and
will <hi>none</hi> of the fierce darke, and wrathfull ſource; it ariſeth, and
ſpringeth forth like a plant out of the wild earth, yet the Devill ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
contnually againſt it.</p>
            <p>37. Therefore my dearly beloved freind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is ſuch ſtrife, and
contention in man; and hence he ſeeth the Divine light as in a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and ſometimes he getteth a perfect glimps thereof,<note place="margin">☞</note> for as long
as the twig of the ſoule can defend it ſelfe againſt the poyſon of the

            <p>38. For when the Magicall fire of the ſoule receiveth the Divine
eſſence (that is the divine body, Chriſts fleſh) then the holy ſpirit
doth <hi>apparently</hi> ariſe, and glance forth in the ſoul as a triumph, as he
goeth forth from God the Father through the word or mouth of the
ſonne (that is, from the Heart of the ſacred Ternary) out of the
Divine eſſentiality; and thus he goeth or proceedeth forth out of the
being or eſſence of the noble lilly-twig, which ſpringeth forth and
groweth out of the fire of the ſoul; which (lilly-twig<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) is the <hi>true
Image</hi> of God, for it is the new-born or regenerated ſpirit of the ſoul,
the ſpirit of Gods will; the Triumphing Chariot of the holy ſpirit, in
which he rideth into the ſacred Ternary into the Angelicall World.</p>
            <p>39. And with this twig, or Image [of God renewed in us] as
is before mentioned; we are in Chriſt without this World, in the
Angelicall World, of which the old Adam hath no underſtanding,
or perceivance; alſo it knoweth it not, as the rough ſtone knoweth
not the Gold, which yet groweth in it.</p>

the three Worlds <hi>Viz.</hi> out of the innermoſt Nature-world, which is

41. And ſecondly he is out of the light, or Angelicall World, out
of the true Being of God; and then thirdly, he is out of this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
World of the Sunne, Stars, and Elements; an entire Image of
God, out of the Being of all Beings.</p>
               <p>42. His firſt Image ſtood in Paradiſe, in the Angelicall World;
but he luſted after the externall World (that is after the Aſtrall and
Elementall World) which hath ſwallowed up, and covered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Image of the internall Heaven, and ruleth now in the ſimilitude
as in its owne propriety.</p>
               <p>43. Therefore 'tis ſayd, <hi>You muſt be borne againe, or elſe you cannot
ſee the Kingdome of God:</hi> And therefore it is that the word or heart
of God entred into the humane Eſſence,<note place="margin">☞</note> that wee with our ſoule
might be able in the power of the word, or heart of God, to beget,
and bring forth againe out of our ſoule, a new Twig or Image, like
unto the firſt.</p>
               <p>44. Therefore the old Carcaſſe muſt rot, putrifie, and periſh; for
it is unfit for the Kingdome of God, it carryeth nothing but its owne
Myſtery into its firſt beginning; that is, its wonders and workes,
underſtand, in the Eſſence of the firſt Principle, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
and incorruptible; being the Magicall fire of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>45. And not this alone, but he muſt bring and unite the End
with the Beginning; for the externall World is generated out of
the internall, and created into a comprehenſible Being; the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
whereof belong unto the Beginning, and they were knowne
from Eternity in the wiſedome of God; that is, in the Divine <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia;</hi>
not in the Being or eſſentiality, but in the mirrour of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-like
wiſedome of God, whence the <hi>Eternall nature</hi> doth alwayes
ariſe [or take its Originall] from Eternity.</p>
               <p>46. And to this end, the poore ſoule ſtandeth in the priſon of the
Aſtrall and Elementall Kingdome, that it might be a <hi>Labourer,</hi> and
reunite the wonders of the externall Nature with the light World,
and bring them into the beginning; and though it muſt now be
bruiſed and preſſed, and endure much, yet it is the <hi>Servant</hi> in Gods
Vineyard, which prepareth the precious Wine that is drunk in the
Kingdome of God, it is the <hi>onely</hi> cauſe of the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> that the
deſire worketh in the Myſtery, and manifeſteth and bringeth forth to
light the hidden wonders of God, as we ſee plainely how man doth
ſearch out, and<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Or,</hi> Bring forth.</note> reveale the wonders of Nature.</p>
               <p>47. Therefore we muſt not be amazed, and ſtrangely perplexed,
when as many times the noble Image is hid,<note place="margin">☞</note> that we cannot receive
any refreſhment or comfort; but we muſt know, that then the poor
ſoule is put into the Vineyard, that it ſhould worke and bring the
fruit [to be ſet] upon Gods Table.</p>
               <p>48. It hath then a Twig or Branch of the wilde Vine given unto
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58072:47"/>
it, it muſt trim, and dreſſe that; and plant in into the Divine,
and Heavenly Myſtery, it muſt unite it with the Kingdome of God;
this is to be underſtood thus.</p>
               <p>49. As a plant, or grift that is ſet, doth worke ſo long till it
putteth forth its branches;<note place="margin">☞</note> and then its fruit; ſo muſt the twig
[grift, or ſcion] of the ſoule, which ſtandeth overſhadowed in a
darke valley, continually labour that it might come to bring forth
fruit, which is, the noble and precious knowledge of God, when
the ſame is growne in it, that the Soule <hi>knoweth God,</hi> then it yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

it leadeth to the Kingdome of God, it helpeth to plant, and build,
the Kingdome of God; and then it is a right labourer in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>50. And thus that of which I teach, write, and ſpeake, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but the ſame which hath beene wrought in me; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
I could know nothing of it, I have not ſcrap't it together out of
hiſtories, and ſo made opinions; as the Babilonicall School doth,
where men Eagerly contend about words and opinions; I have by
Gods grace obteined eyes of my owne, and am able in my ſelfe to
worke in Chriſts vineyard.</p>
               <p>51. I ſpeake plainly, and freely, that whatſoever is patcht toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from Conjecture, and opinion (wherein man himſelfe hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Divine knowledge whereupon he makes concluſions) that [I ſay]
is Babel, an whoredome; for conceit, or thinking muſt not doe it;
yea not any opinion, or conjecturall apprehenſion, but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>52. The Children of God <hi>have ſpoken, as they were driven by the
holy ſpirit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> they have planted many and divers Trees, but they all
ſtand upon one root, which is the internall Heaven, none can finde
the ſame unleſſe he likewiſe ſtand upon the ſame roote, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the externall Heaven cannot finde them out or explain them
by art.</p>
               <p>53. The <hi>words</hi> of the holy, Children of God remain as an hidden
Myſtery unto the Earthly man; and though he thinkes that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
them; yet he hath no more then a darkeſome [hyſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call]
glimps of them; as we ſee now adayes how men doe wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and contend about Chriſts doctrine, and worſhip, and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Gods will; how he muſt be ſerved, whereas he is not ſerved or
worſhipped with any opinion, but <hi>in the ſpirit</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>and in truth</hi>
men ſerve God.</p>
               <p>54. It depends not on what ceremonies, and manners we doe
uſe, every one laboureth in his worke, and gifts, from his owne <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation,
and property,</hi> but all are driven, and lead from one, and the
<hi>ſame ſpirit,</hi> otherwiſe God ſhould be <hi>finite,</hi> and meaſurable, if the gifts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58072:47"/>
were onely one; but he is a meere <hi>Wonder,</hi> whoſoever apprehends
him, he walketh in his Wonders.</p>
               <p>55. This I doe impart unto you in all ſyncerity, out of a true
Chriſtian zeale, from my Fountaine, Gifts, and knowledge; and I
doe exhort you to<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Or,</hi> Take.</note> underſtand it in a right ſenſe as it is meant; I
doe not extoll, or ſet up my ſelfe, but I ſpeake brotherly to your
minde, to ſtirre you up and to comfort you; that you ſhould not
thinke the yoak of Chriſt to be heavy, when oftentimes the externall
man doth cloud the internall, that the poore Soule mourneth for its
Image, which yet is purified, and truly begotten, and brought forth
under <hi>Tribulation</hi> [and the Croſſe of Chriſt] it is even ſo with me,
and other Chriſtians beſides, thinke not <hi>ſtrange</hi> at it.</p>
               <p>56. It is very good when the poore ſoule is in Combate, much
better then when it is impriſoned,<note place="margin">☞</note> and yet playeth the Hypocrite,
and maketh devout ſhewes; it is written, <hi>That all things ſhall ſerve for
the beſt to them that love God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>57. Now when the combate of the ſoule doth ariſe, and proceed,
that it would faine ſee God, and yet cannot at all times attaine the
ſame; then know, that it fighteth for the <hi>Noble Trophee,</hi> of which
the externall man knoweth nothing; yea the ſpirit of God fighteth
in the naturall ſoule, for that which is ſupernaturall, that ſo he may
lead the Creature into God; hee would alwayes faine Crowne the
ſoule with the precious Image, if the blinde Reaſon would but give
him roome, and ſuffer the underſtanding to Cooperate.</p>
               <p>58. We muſt labour and ſtrive againſt the externall Reaſon, and
alſo againſt fleſh and blood,<note place="margin">☞</note> and wholly oppoſe the aſſaults and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of the Devill, alwayes breaking them and caſting them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and reſiſt the <hi>evill thoughts, motions, and influences,</hi> and effectually
[with our whole ſoule] with prayer, ſupplication, or internall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation,
preſſe into Gods mercy.</p>
               <p>59. Thus the precious graine of Muſtard-ſeed is ſowne, which
if it be well preſerved; becommeth great like a Tree, upon which
Tree the fruits of Paradiſe doe afterwards grow, on which the ſoule
feedeth, when it will <hi>Propheſie, and ſpeake of the Kingdome of God;</hi>
when as it beholdeth the <hi>Divine Magia,</hi> even then it <hi>ſpeaketh of the
Wonders of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>60. For the Being of God is undivided, it needeth not any room
or place, but it ariſeth [moveth, and flyeth] in the <hi>ſpirit of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi>
as the ſplendor of the Sunne in the ayre; it ſhooteth, or
glanceth into the Image, like lightning, whereby the <hi>whole body is
oftentimes enkindled, and enlightned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>61. Moreover know that we in this life are labourers and not idle
perſons,<note place="margin">☞</note> for the birth of life is a continuall ſtrife and labour; the
more we labour in Gods Vineyard, the more fruit we ſhall obtaine
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58072:48"/>
and eternally enjoy; and it maketh for our owne edification, for
our labour remaineth in our owne Myſtery to Gods deeds of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and to our owne eternall <hi>Crowne and Glory</hi> before God; as in
my other Writings is ſet forth at large.</p>
               <p>62. Concerning the <hi>Sabbath in this World,</hi> of which you have
written, and ſtill continue in the ſame opinion, the knowledge and
underſtanding thereof is <hi>not</hi> given to me; alſo I doe not know how
there can be any perfect Being in the Torment-houſe of the Starres
and Elements; I cannot finde ſuch an underſtanding thereof in the
Myſtery, being the firſt man was not able to ſtand, when the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Governour did rule in him, but was overcome by the Kingdome
of the Starres and Elements; Might it not therefore be <hi>ſtill</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous?</p>
               <p>63. When we conſider the poſſibility and the impoſſibility there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the Myſtery, it doth then appeare, as if there would be no
Sabbath in the ſad and ſorrowfull Mirror of the Divine Being, for
the Devill is a Prince of this World, and though he ſhould be bound
for a thouſand yeares in the darke World, yet the fierce wrathfull
Starres, and alſo heat and cold, have their rule and predominance
in this World, and this World is nothing elſe but <hi>a Valley of
Miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>64. Now if the Dominion of the Starres ſhould not reach us, or
have any influence upon us, then we ſhould not be in this World,
but in Paradiſe, where no wicked man could oppoſe us, or ſee us,
for in Paradiſe we are ſwallowed, or ſhut up in God.</p>
               <p>65. As little as we with our earthly eyes ſee the Angels, ſo little
likewiſe ſhall a wicked man of this World ſee a new [regenerate]
man in Chriſt; when we attaine the new man in Chriſt, then we are
(as to that new man) <hi>already</hi> in the Sabbath, and doe onely waite
for the <hi>Redemption of the wicked earthly life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>66. For we are with Chriſt in God, we are together with him
planted into his death;<note place="margin">☞</note> we are buryed in him, and ariſe with the
new man out of the grave with him, and live eternally in our owne
Being or Eſſence, underſtand, in his corporiety; we are with and
in Chriſt, in God, and God in us; Where ſhould wee then keepe
Sabbath? Not in this World, but in the Angelicall World, in the
light World.</p>
               <p>67. And if the wicked ſhould be tormented for a thouſand years
in this World, then the place [of this World] muſt be <hi>tranſlated,</hi>
or withdrawne into the darke World; for in this Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> World there
is not <hi>yet</hi> any <hi>Helliſh Torment;</hi> but if the Sunne were taken away,
then it would be ſo indeed; and then the wicked would be yet far
ſeparated from the judgement; and there would be a Gulfe of a
Principle interpoſed and fixt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:58072:48"/>
68. Moreover God is not a God of evill, that deſireth revenge, or
Torment;<note place="margin">☞</note> that he ſhould out of his vengeance, Torment and plague
the Wicked a thouſand yeares before the Iudgment; the wicked
Tormenteth himſelfe in his owne Lifes birth; the one forme of life
is enemy to the other: And that ſhall be indeed his helliſh Torment;
and God hath no blame in it.</p>
               <p>69. He hath never deſired the fall of man; but the wrathfull
Nature gott the upper hand and the ſpirit of mans will (which is
free, as God himſelfe) did freely and willingly yeeld it ſelfe up into
the Combate, ſuppoſing to domineere, and rule.</p>
               <p>70. It was out of pride that the Devill ſell, and man alſo; if
they had ſtayed in humility, God would have continued in them; but
they themſelves departed both away from God; but God did ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
love mans Image, that he himſelfe out of love did <hi>re-enter</hi>
into the Image of man; why ſhould he then deſire his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>71. In God there is no Evill deſire, but <hi>his wrath</hi> which is the
dark World is a deſire of evill,<note place="margin">☞</note> and deſtruction which hath brought
the Devill, and alſo man to fall; the <hi>dark World</hi> cauſed the Devill to
fall; and the <hi>externall wrathfull Nature</hi> cauſed Man to fall; and
yet both theſe are tyed and bound one to another; which we
ſhould well ſee, and feel, if the ſun were taken out of this World.</p>
               <p>72. Therefore I yet ſay; that the righteous keepeth Sabbath in
Abrahams boſome, in Chriſts reſt; for Chriſt hath deſtroyed the
wrathfull death for us, that held us Captive; he hath opened life;
that we in a new man are able to ſpring forth, bloſſome, and reſt in
him.</p>
               <p>73. But the old man of the Stars, and Elements muſt abide in his
owne Region, in his houſe of Torment and miſery, <hi>till</hi> he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Earth; and then all paſſeth into its owne Myſtery
again; and the ſoule abideth in its principle <hi>till the Judgement</hi>
of God; where God ſhall again move, and enkindle the Myſtery; and
then every thing Severeth it ſelfe into its owne property; Each world
ſhall take in its owne harveſt, be it good, or bad; it ſhall part it ſelfe
as light, and darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>74. And therefore I doe entreat you wholly as a brother, and a
Chriſtian, that you would be pleaſed to have a care that you <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Sabbath in the Reſt of Chriſt;</hi> and be not ſo moved by the
enkindling of the ſpirit, [or ſervent inſtigation of your minde]
but ſearch whether you be able to ground the ſame in the light of
Nature; if you be able to ground, and reach it in the light of the
Eternall Nature, then indeed you may goe on; but ſhew it us

plainely that we may ſee it, elſe our minde will be <hi>unſatisfied,</hi> unleſſe

               <p>76. The <hi>Revelation</hi> is ſpirituall, and coucheth or ſticketh deepe

               </p>
               <p>81. Accordingly I would faine have you to prove your inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that you might know the <hi>Guide</hi> of the internall World, and
then alſo the <hi>Guide</hi> of the externall World, that ſo the Magicall

               </p>
               <p>82. The ſpirit muſt be capable of, and acceptable to the Myſtery,

conſiſts barely in a plaine <hi>Childlike minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>83. The externall Guide laboureth and ſpeculates onely in the

not able to doe, unleſſe Gods ſpirit guide it; therefore God makes

Brethren in Chriſt; when God
doth open to us by his Grace, the
<hi>right underſtanding,</hi> that we are able to
know, and underſtand aright the Image
of God (<hi>Viz, Man</hi>) what he is in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ſoule, and ſpirit, then we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that he is the viſible, and alſo
the inviſible ſpirituall World; namely,
An <hi>Extract of all the three Principles
of the Divine Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In whom the hidden God through the expreſſion and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58072:51"/>
of his various <hi>diſtinct Power,</hi> and eternall Wiſedom hath ſet
forth himſelfe in a viſible Image, through which hee doth Idea,
forme, and ſhape, in the ſame Being the wonders of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Word; in that the Word of his powers maketh it ſelfe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall.</p>
            <p>3. And ſo in or by man he hath repreſented, and ſet forth an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of his ſpeaking, and out ſpoken Eſſentiall word, in which the
<hi>Divine Science</hi> with the various diviſions of the <hi>Eternall ſpeaking</hi> is
couched.</p>
            <p>4. And hence he hath the underſtanding and knowledge of all
things, that he is able to underſtand the conjunction of Nature, and
alſo its disjunction; for no ſpirit hath any higher rule, or deeper
reach then in its owne Mother whence it taketh its Originall, and in
that ground it ſtandeth or abide h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in its <hi>Centre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. This we ſee in the Creatures of the Stars, and Elements, that
their underſtanding and knowledge is no higher then of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in whom they live; each leadeth its life after the nature and
condition of its Mother, wherein it is bounded in the diſtinct divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the expreſſed Word; and no Creature in the foure Elements
whoſe Originall is not out of the <hi>Eternall Science,</hi> is able to attaine
the knowledge of the hidden ſpirituall World of Power, ſave onely
and alone <hi>Man,</hi> who with his ſoule and underſtanding ſpirit is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the eternall Spiration [or generation] of the Divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and various diſtinct diviſion of the eternall Word of God.</p>
            <p>6. Therefore the humane Science receiveth in the Centre of its
underſtanding, good and evill, and doth Idea, and ſhape it ſelfe
both in good and evill, and maketh it ſelfe <hi>Eſſentiall</hi> therein; and
ſo with, and by the Science doth induce it ſelfe into will, deſire, and
eſſence.</p>
            <p>7. That ſo the Abyſſall will out of the eternall word of various
diſtinct diviſion, doth bring it ſelfe in the <hi>Creaturall Word (Viz.</hi> in
the Creaturall <hi>Science</hi> of the Soule) into an <hi>Ens</hi> and Being, in
manner and forme as the Spiration of God hath brought it ſelfe
through the various diviſion of the Eternall will, in the viſible world,
into diverſe properties; namely, into good and evill, into love and
enmity; that in ſuch a contrary, the Being might be diſtinct, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
formall, ſenſible, and perceivable; that each thing might in
ſuch a Contrary, finde and perceive it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>8. For in God,<note place="margin">☞</note> all Beings are but one Being, <hi>Viz.</hi> An eternall
<hi>One,</hi> or unity, the Eternall onely <hi>Good;</hi> which Eternall one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeveralty were not manifeſt to it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>9. Therefore the ſame hath breathed forth it ſelfe out of its ſelfe,
that a plurality and diſtinct variety might ariſe, which variety or
ſeveralty hath induced it ſelfe into a peculiar <hi>WILL</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58072:51"/>
the Properties into Deſires, and the Deſires into Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>10 Inſomuch that all things viſible (both Animals, Vegitables,
and Minerals) doe ariſe from the ſeveralty and comprehenſive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſure,
or formation of the expreſſed Word, out of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the great Myſtery; every thing from the <hi>Experience of the
Severalized Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. Every thing hath its owne ſeparation in it ſelfe; the Centre
of every thing is [a] Spirit from the Originall of the Word; the
ſeparation in a thing is a ſelfe peculiar will of its owne impreſſure,
<note place="margin">☜</note> or forming, where each ſpirit bringeth it ſelfe into Being, according
to its <hi>Eſſentiall Deſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. The forme and feature of bodies ariſe from the Experience
of the will, where the Centre of Every thing (being a particle or
ſpark from the expreſſed word) doth againe expreſſe or ſpeake it
ſelfe forth, and bringeth it ſelfe into a various diſtinct Particularity,
in manner and forme of the Divine Speaking; [or operation of the
Eternall word in its Generation, and Manifeſtation.]</p>
            <p>13. Now if there were no <hi>Free will</hi> in ſuch Speaking then the
Speaking ſhould have a law,<note place="margin">☞</note> and would ſtand Confined, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
and no <hi>deſire</hi> or free <hi>Imagination</hi> might ariſe and then the
ſpeaking would be Finite, and inchoative which is not.</p>
            <p>14. But it is a Spiration of the Abyſſe, and a diſtinct ſeveration of
the Eternall Stilneſſe [or immobility] an effuſion or diſtribution
of it ſelfe where the particularity doth againe ſtand in its owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
Severation in a peculiar <hi>ſelfe-will,</hi> and is againe an Expreſſing
of it ſelfe; whence Nature and the Creaturall life take their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and hence in every thing a ſelfe-will is ariſen.</p>
            <p>15. That every thing doth bring it ſelfe from its owne experience
into forme, feature, and ſhape, and likewiſe into life, and operation
as it ſtandeth in its Centre, in the <hi>Vniverſall experience;</hi> namely in
<hi>the Great Myſtery,</hi> in the Mother of all Beings.</p>
            <p>16. This we ſee in the Earth, which in the beginning of its
Materialls is riſen out of the Severation of the Divine Spiration in a
Spirituall manner; where the Severation of the word hath formed
it ſelfe by its owne proper will into an <hi>Ens</hi> and Being, and ſo by the
formation, or impreſſion it hath brought it ſelfe into the Perceivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Eſſence.</p>
            <p>17. In which Perceivancy or Senſibility the Magneticall Deſire is
ariſen, that the properties of the Severalized diſtinguiſhing, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
will, have brought themſelves through the Deſire, into bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
according to, and from the Nature of the three Principles of
the Divine Manifeſtation.</p>
            <p>18. From which Originall the Earth hath ſo many and divers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58072:52"/>
good and evill, as Earths, ſalts, ſtones, Metals, <hi>&amp;c.;</hi> and ſuch
bodies lye mixt in the Earth; for the three Principles are mutually
in one another as one Being.</p>
            <p>19. And they ſtand only in three differences or diſtinct degrees of
Centres (being the divine Manifeſtation) where each Centre doth
make and produce out of it ſelfe its owne Spiration [expreſſion]
Nature and being; and yet all doe ariſe Originally fron the <hi>Etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ONE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. The Firſt Centre is the breathing ſorth or Spiration of the
Abyſſe <hi>Viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> Gods <hi>Speaking</hi> the Comprehenſive impreſſure, and the
divine perceivance of it ſelfe, where God doth beare, and begett
himſelfe in Trinity, and ſpeaks forth himſelfe into Powers.</p>
            <p>21. The Second Centre, or Spiration is the <hi>Expreſſed Eſſence of
the Divine Power</hi> and it is called Gods <hi>Wiſdome;</hi> through this ſame
the Eternall word breaths forth it ſelfe into knowledge, namely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an infiniteneſſe of plurality, and brings the plurality of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
into Imagination, and the Imagination into deſire, and the
deſire into Nature and Strife till it comes to Fire.</p>
            <p>22, Therein the Strife in the painfull Agony doth dye in the
Conſumption of the fire, from its owne Naturall Right, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and yet no dying is to be underſtood; but ſo the Power doth
bring it ſelfe into Senſibility, and by the killing of the <hi>Selfe-deſire</hi> of
the properties through the dying or Mortification of its ſelfeneſſe
it brings it ſelfe through the Fire into the Light.</p>
            <p>23. Where, in the light, another Principle (being the Grand
Myſtery of the true divine manifeſtation) is underſtood; and in the
Fire the Firſt Principle being the Eternall Nature, is underſtood;
and they are two in one; as fire and light.</p>
            <p>24. The Fire giveth Soul, and the power of the light giveth
ſpirit; and in this Power of the light of the Divine Spiration
through the wiſedome, through the manifeſtation of the Fire (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Spirits-fire) the Mother of the Eternall ſpirits (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Angels, and the ſoules of men,) is underſtood; and ſo alſo
the ſpirituall Angelicall World, <hi>Viz.</hi> t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e hidden internall World of
<hi>Power,</hi> which is a Mother of the Heaven, ſtars, and Elements; that is,
of the Externall World.</p>
            <p>25. The third Centre is the <hi>Verbum Fiat (Viz.</hi> the Naturall
word of God) from the Power of the firſt, and ſecond Principles;
being a Separatour, or Creatour, and Maker of all Creatures in
the Internall, and Externall World, in each World according to its
property.</p>
            <p>26. This Seperator, or Spirator of the Severation of the Divine
Powers hath ſpoken it ſelfe forth from it ſelfe, out of the firſt and
ſecond Principle: <hi>Viz.</hi> out of the fiery and light World, and alſo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58072:52"/>
out of the <hi>impreſſion,</hi> and encloſure of the Adumbration; that is,
out of the darkneſſe; and with the ſeveration of the Spiration hath
modellized and formed it ſelfe, and made it ſelfe Materiall, moving,
and ſenſible.</p>
            <p>27. Hence the third Principle, that is, the viſible World with its
Being and Life is ariſen; and alſo the whole Creation of the viſible
World, whoſe life and Being is come out of <hi>Three</hi> into a Being and
Life; Namely, out of the eternall Nature, out of the great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
that is, out of the darkneſſe, fire, and light; to wit, out of
Love and Anger.</p>
            <p>28. The Fire is called Anger, being a paine and enmity, and the
light ſignifieth, or is called Love, being a ſweet yeelding and giving
of it ſelfe; and the darkneſſe is a ſeparation of the knowledge and
skill, that ſo it may be underſtood what Light and Life is, and alſo
what is evill and painefull.</p>
            <p>29. There is a <hi>twofold Fire,</hi> and alſo a <hi>twofold Light</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
<note place="margin">☞</note> Namely, according to the darke impreſſion a <hi>Cold</hi> fire, and
a falſe light ariſing through the Imagination of the harſh impreſſion,
which light hath its Originall onely in the Imagination, and hath no
true Ground.</p>
            <p>30. The ſecond Fire is an <hi>Hot</hi> fire, and it hath a fundamentall
true light ariſing from the Originall of the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> which doth
alſo bring it ſelfe forth in Nature through the fire into the light.</p>
            <p>31. In this twofold fire, and twofold light, two Principles,
and alſo a twofold will are underſtood.</p>
            <p>32. For the falſe light out of the Imagination, ariſeth out of the
ſelfe-will of Nature; namely, from the impreſſion of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
where the properties doe prove one another, whence ſelfe-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>33. Where this ſelfe will refuſeth to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

alſo it will not reſigne, and wholly give up it ſelfe unto him, and
be <hi>One</hi> will with him, but maketh its ſelfe to be its owne Seperator,

            <p>34. It draweth and maketh to its ſelfe a <hi>Science</hi> in it ſelfe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
it ſelfe from Gods will, as we may underſtand and ſee in the
Devill, and alſo in the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Wicked</note> falſe fallen Man; whereupon they were
caſt out of the Divine Separation, ſo that the Devill muſt remaine

the Word doth induce it ſelfe in nature, and painefulneſſe to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58072:53"/>
ſenſibility; namely, in the Originall of the fire-ſource, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
cannot <hi>reach</hi> or obtaine the <hi>true</hi> fire, wherein the will
of God induceth it ſelfe into the ſenſible life and nature; namely,
into a ſhining light.</p>
            <p>35. For the Separator of the naturall ſelfe hood hath no <hi>true-Ens,</hi>
wherein its light may remaine ſtedfaſt, for it draweth not with its
deſire, out of the eternall <hi>One;</hi> (namely, out of the meekneſſe of
God) but draweth it ſelfe into Eſſence, its light ariſeth onely in
the owne hood of <hi>Selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Therefore there is a difference betweene Gods light, and the
falſe light, for Gods light ariſeth [or takes its Originall] in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
One; namely, in the Eſſence of the Divine Generation, and
doth bring it ſelfe through the Will of God into Nature and Being;
it is formed and brought by the Divine Separator into an <hi>Ens,</hi> and
ſhineth in the ſame Nature in the darkneſſe, <hi>John</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>37. For the formed, or immodellized Science is (in reſpect of
the Impreſſion) a darkneſſe; but the Divine light illuſtrates it, ſo
that it becomes a fiery light, wherein the Spiration, or Speaking of
God is made manifeſt in Nature and Creature, and ſtandeth in a
ſenſible or percei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

1. <hi>The life of man was in him [Viz.</hi> in the Word] and CHRIST
ſaith, <hi>John 8. That hee is the light of the World, that giveth life to
the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>38. For without this Divine light proceeding from the Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Divine Try unity there is no Conſtant true light, but
onely a light of the Imagination of the Naturall Impreſſion of ſelfe-will.</p>
            <p>39. Therefore man (being the Image of God) muſt open and
lift up the Eyes of the underſtanding (wherein Gods light doth
<hi>encline</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> it ſelfe to him, and deſireth to ſhine in him) and
not be as a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which ſtandeth not with its Separatour in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
in the Eternity, but onely in an Externall Figure of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
word.</p>
            <p>40. Which hath onely a Tem porall life in a finite; and inchoative
Separator, in which the Eternall Separator doth repreſent it ſelfe as
in a Glaſſe [or mirror of Ideas] and bringeth the Divine Science
into formes, and Figures, like a Pattern or Imitation of the <hi>Grand
Myſtery</hi> of the Spirituall World, where the Eternall Principles doe
Cooperate and play in a Type or reſemblance; both according to
fire, and light.</p>
            <p>41. And yet man in reſpect of his externall comprehenſible or
finite body, ſtandeth onely in ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>litting figurative ſhadow, or

of the Divine property, in which God ſpeaketh and begetteth his Word,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58072:53"/>
and there the Divine Science doth diſtribute, import, impreſſe, form, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it ſelfe to an Image of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>42. In which Image God is manifeſt (in a Senſible and Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

man muſt break his owne will, and entirely ſubmit himſelfe to Gods

            <p>44. For God hath made all things in his Divine pley or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

things doe hold, or ſtand ſtill unto him; onely the falſe light cauſeth
the <hi>Saparator</hi> of the Creature to bring it ſelfe into a <hi>ſelfe will,</hi> that the

            <p>45. Which falſe light in man hath its foundation from the <hi>will of

            <p>46. Whereupon in the humane body (which was formed out of

which hath revealed or made manifeſt all the properties of

            <p>47. Which falſe Separator hath advanced it ſelfe to the height,
and got the Dominion, and attracted all the Principles unto it ſelfe,
and hath made a Monſter, out of Gods Order.</p>
            <p>48. Which monſtrous Image hath in or with its will, and deſire,

               </gap>y turned it ſelfe away from the will of God; from the <hi>Divine
light;</hi> whereby the <hi>Divine Ens</hi> from the being, or eſſence of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
World, did vaniſh or diſappeare in him; and he (<hi>Viz.</hi> man)
remained onely as a Monſter of Heaven; and was by his Separator
made <hi>a Beaſt of all Beaſts,</hi> which even now ruleth in, over, and with all
beaſts; in whom the Spirit of the World with the Stars, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
hath obtained the Rule and dominion.</p>
            <p>49. Therefore man now runneth, and Seeketh againe his firſt
right home,<note place="margin">☞</note> or <hi>Native Countrey;</hi> for in this Condition, or property
he ſtandeth in meer unquietneſſe; and ſometimes he is Seeking in
one thing, and by and by in another, and ſuppoſeth to bring himſelfe
to Reſt in this <hi>Monſter;</hi> and yet he runneth on in the falſe awakend
beſtiall will, which cannot reach the will of God.</p>
            <p>50. He runneth now onely in the falſe light of his ſelfehood,
which is borne in his Imagination with <hi>a Monſtrous Separator</hi> which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58072:54"/>
maketh him an Earthly Minde, wherein the Conſtellations have
their influence, and operations; and he hath the whole viſible
World for his Enemy.</p>
            <p>51. And he ſtandeth as a roſe in a buſh of thornes which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
rent, ſcracht, and torne by the thornes; and yet he could
not be ſaid to be a Roſe, if the Divine <hi>Grace</hi> had not come to aſſiſt
and reſtore him, and againe inſpired, and given in it ſelfe into his
<hi>internall Ground, wherein the Love of God to the new Regeneration is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>52. Therefore I ſay that it is moſt exceeding neceſſary for man
to learne to <hi>know himſelfe,</hi> what he is; before he runneth, and Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
for his Seeking elſe, will prove onely a Tormenting, whereby
he tormenteth, and perplexeth himſelfe in a falſe Separator, and
yet cannot obtaine the Reſt; and true <hi>Satiſfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>53. For all theſe Earthly wills [and wayes] wherein he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to bring himſelfe into reſt and quietneſſe, are onely an adverſe
will, ſtriving againſt God, <hi>Viz.</hi> the <hi>Eternall One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>54. For it lyeth not in any mans owne willing,<note place="margin">☞</note> going, running, as Saint
Paul ſaith, but in Gods Mercy, <hi>that is</hi> in the Grace which is inſpired into
him.</p>
            <p>55. For without Grace man is dead, and blind in reſpect to God,
and he is not able to attain any true life; unleſſe the Grace be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up, <hi>awakened and</hi> revealed in him.</p>
            <p>56. Moreover in theſe Earthly wills there can be no awakening;
for they cannot reach or obtain Grace, much leſſe awaken it; and
therefore the whole Man in ſoul, and minde, muſt onely immerſe it
ſelfe into the <hi>Grace</hi> and be willing to become a nothing to it ſelfe;
that deſireth nothing but the Grace, that Grace might be living and
working in him; and his owne will be Stupifyed, overcome, and
mortifyed,</p>
            <p>57. As the Sunne breaketh forth in the night [or darkneſſe]
and changeth the Night into day; the like is to be underſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>h Chriſt ſaith; unleſſe you turne, and become
like Children you ſhall not ſee the Kingdome of God, namely <hi>the
divine Separator,</hi> whence all things are riſen, and ſpring Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>58. For no knowledge is right or fundamentall unleſſe it comes
from the Divine Science, out of the ſeveration of the Divine Spira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from whence all things have their Originall.</p>
            <p>59. Now if ſuch a knowledge ſhall againe ariſe in man, then the
Divine Seperator muſt ſtand in an Eſſence of his likeneſſe; namely,
in a Divine <hi>Ens,</hi> wherein the Divine Word ſpeaketh, and the Divine
light ſhineth in that ſame Speaking, or Spiration.</p>
            <p>60. And even then the humane Science (which inchoatively is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58072:54"/>
ariſen from the Spiration of the Word) may in that ſame light ſee,
not onely it ſelfe, but likewiſe all other naturall things according
to the ſeveration of the Word; and after a Magicall manner worke
in and with all things in a Divine way, nature and property.</p>
            <p>61. For man is blind in all Gods workes,<note place="margin">☞</note> and hath no true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
unleſſe the Divine [breathing] ſpiration or ſpeaking be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in his internall ground, after the nature and property of the
Spiration, whence all Beings proceed Originally.</p>
            <p>62. All the ſearching and ſeeking of Man, whereby hee will
finde out the ground of a thing is blind, and is wrought onely in
the ſhell or outſide; wherewith the Eſſence of the Tree is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>63. If there ſhall be a true finding, then the humane Science muſt
<hi>enter into the property of the thing,</hi> and be able to behold the very
Separator.</p>
            <p>64. Therefore it is the greateſt and moſt toyleſome miſery of
mankinde, that they run, annd ſeeke altogether in blindneſſe, and
begin to ſeeke the ſhell in the bare letter, and its expreſſion [or
many formes of writings] whereas all things are outwardly ſigned,
as they are in their internall <hi>Ens</hi> and Eſſence, and the Separator of
all things hath ſhewn, and ſet forth himſelfe viſibly, and formally, ſo
that the <hi>Creator is known in and by the Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>65. For all Beings are but one onely Being, which hath breathed
forth it ſelfe out of it ſelfe, and hath ſeverized, and formized it ſelfe;
and yet it proceedeth out of that ſame impreſſure or formation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Centre pecullarly diſtinct; that is, with each impreſſure and
forming of the deſire.</p>
            <p>66. Where the ſeverized, parted, and divided will, doth impreſſe,
and forme it ſelfe into a peculiar particularity, where a Centre doth
ariſe, and in the <hi>Centre</hi> a <hi>Separator,</hi> or Creator of its owne <hi>Selfe</hi> [or
Being] namely, a former of the <hi>re-expreſſing,</hi> or re-ſpirating <hi>Will,</hi>
as we ſee the ſame in the Earth, where every Hearb, hath its owne
Separator in it ſelfe, which doth ſo make and ſeverize it into
forme.</p>
            <p>67. Now if Man (beings Gods Image, in whom the Divine
ſpeaking,<note place="margin">☞</note> according to the Divine Science is manifeſt) will ſearch
the Creatures, and get reall underſtanding, and knowledge in them;
be it either in Animals, vegitables, or Mettals, he muſt then againe
obtaine grace from God, that the Divine light may ſhine in his ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
whereby hee may bee able to goe through the Naturall
light, and then <hi>all things</hi> will be opened and revealed in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
            <p>68. Otherwiſe he runs on in his ſeeking as a blind Man that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of Colours, and doth neither ſee nor know any Colour; this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58072:55"/>
all States and Orders of the World are to conſider, that they all run
blindfolded without the Divine Light, onely in an Aſtrall Sydereall
imaginary fanſie, according as the Conſtellations of the Stars doe
forme and frame in and upon Reaſon.</p>
            <p>69. For <hi>Reaſon</hi> is nothing elſe but an <hi>humane Conſtellation;</hi> which
is a darke draught, or reſemblance of <hi>all the Principles;</hi> it ſtandeth
onely in an imaginary figure, and not in the Divine Science.</p>
            <p>70. But if the Divine light be manifeſt, and ſhineth therein, then
the Divine Word beginneth to ſpeake [or worke] therein out of
the Eternall knowledge [Science, or Wiſedome] and then Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is a true manſion or receptacle of Divine Knowledge and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and even then it may be rightly and truely uſed; but being
voyd of this it is no more then an <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of the viſible World.</p>
            <p>71. It is therefore declared to all lovers of Arts (whoſe Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
is an Artiſt of Great Subtility in them) that they <hi>firſt ſeek Gods
Love and Grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> and reſigne up their ſelves to, and become wholly
one with that; elſe all their Seeking is but a deluſion, or the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a ſhadow, and to no purpoſe; and nothing is found of any
fundamentall worth; unleſſe one doth entruſt another with Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.</p>
            <p>72. The which is forbidden to the Children of God, in whom the
grace is revealed, <hi>that they caſt not Pearl before Swine;</hi> upon paine
of Eternall Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>73. Onely it is freely granted them to declare the light, and to
<hi>ſhew the way</hi> of attaining the Pearl.</p>
            <p>74. But to give the Divine Separator into the beſtiall hand,
is prohibited; unleſſe a man knoweth the way, and will of that man
[that deſires it.]</p>
            <p>75. Thus my beloved brethren upon ſuch conſideration and
inſtruction, I will (through the permiſſion of divine grace and the
Cooperation of this preſent time) a little decipher, and repreſent
unto you the Divine Myſtery, how God through his word hath made
himſelfe Viſible, Senſible, Perceivable, moreover Creaturall, and
formall; be pleaſed to conſider further of it; yet let it be done as
is above mentioned; otherwiſe I ſhall be as one dumbe unto you,
and the blame thereof is not to be imputed to me.</p>
            <p>76. God (what he is in himſelfe) is neither nature nor creature,
neither this nor that, neither high nor deep; he is the Abyſſe, and
the Byſſe of all Beings, an eternall One; where there is no ground
or place; he is to the Creature in its ſtrength [or capacity] <hi>a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and yet is through all things</hi>
            </p>
            <p>77. Nature is <hi>his Something</hi> wherewith hee makes himſelfe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
ſenſible, and perceivable, both according to Eternity, and
time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:58072:55"/>
78. All things are ariſen through the Divine Imagination, and do
yet ſtand in ſuch a birth, ſtation, or Government.</p>
            <p>79. The foure Elements likewiſe have ſuch a ground [birth, or
Originall] from the <hi>Imagination</hi> of the <hi>Eternall One,</hi> concerning
which I will here ſet downe a Table, how the one doth unfold and
ſpirate or breath it ſelfe forth out of another.</p>
            <p>80. In which annexed Table, the ground of all the Myſteries of
the Divine Manifeſtation is pourtrayed; for a further conſideration
of the ſame; the underſtanding and capacity whereof, is not in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
owne ability without the light of God; but it is eaſily to be

            <p>2. Seeing I have obſerved, that you
are a lover of Divine Wiſedome, and
alſo a growing branch in the Life-Tree
of God in Chriſt, in whom all the Children of God are as Members,
and moreover perceived how the drawing of the Father hath brought
you into an hungry deſire after the true Sap, and Divine Power, and
likewiſe in ſome meaſure hath enriched you with the knowledge of
the ſame Tree of Life; thereupon I have taken occaſion (in a
Chriſtian and Member-like property and deſire after the ſame Life-Tree
of Chriſt) once more to ſalute you, and mutually to exhort
one another, as Labourers ſet in the Vineyard of Chriſt, and called
to this Worke.</p>
            <p>3. Eſpecially that we looke well to our ſelves in this valley of
darkneſſe, and lift up our eyes and heads, in that we ſee the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58072:56"/>
and the very workings thereof before our eyes; and put our
ſelves in minde, that Chriſt hath taught us, that <hi>Our Redemption
draweth neere;</hi> and indeed, <hi>Goe out from Babel,</hi> which hath a long
time held us captive, and impriſoned.</p>
            <p>4. And not regard the loud cry, and pratings, where they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

or regard <hi>Our owne Merits,</hi> or abilities.</p>
            <p>5. All which availe nothing before God; but a new Creature in
Chriſt, borne of God, availeth before God; for <hi>Chriſt is onely the
Grace,</hi> which availes with God.</p>
            <p>6. Now whoſoever is borne of Chriſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> and liveth and walketh in
him, and puts him on (according to his inner man) in his <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Death, and Reſurrection;</hi> he is a Member on his body, from
him onely flow the ſtreames of living Water, through the powerfull
Word of Chriſt, which as to the internall ground is become Man in
him,<note place="margin">In Spiritu Mundi.</note> and doth, ſpeake forth it ſelfe out of him through the Creature
in the <hi>Coſmick Spirit</hi> of the externall Man.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>For</hi> as God hath manifeſted the grand Myſtery (wherein the
whole Creation hath lyen in an Eſſentiall manner without formings)
out of the power of his Word, and through the grand Myſtery hath
expreſſed [the word of powers] into the Severation or variety of
ſpirituall formings; in which ſpirituall formes the Science of the
Powers, have ſtood in the Deſire; that is, in the Fiat; wherein
every Science in the Deſire to manifeſtation, hath brought it ſelfe
into a corporeall bodily Being; <hi>Even ſo</hi> likewiſe the ſame grand
Myſtery, <hi>Viz.</hi> The Eſſentiall Word of Gods power lyeth in Man
(the Image, and likeneſſe of God) both according to Eternity,
and time.</p>
            <p>8. By which Myſtery the living Word of God doth utter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
it ſelfe either in Love or Anger, or in fanſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e; according as

<hi>to Evillor Good;</hi> as it is written, <hi>With the holy thou art holy, and
with the perverſe thou art perverſe; alſo, ſuch as the people is, ſuch a God
they alſo have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. For in what property the Myſtery in Man is excited, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened;
ſuch a word uttereth it ſelfe from his powers, as wee
plainely ſee, that nothing elſe but Vanity is uttered by the
Wicked.</p>
            <p>10. Now how ſhould there be a good expreſſion and will, where
the Myſtery to the Speaking [and willing] is a falſe ground, and
poyſoned by the Devill in the wrath of nature; which falſe Myſtery
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58072:57"/>
can neither will, nor doe any good, that may be acceptable to God;
unleſſe it be firſt enkindled by God, that it obtain a Godly will and
deſire; whence a divine expreſſion, and operation of good follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>11. For Chriſt ſaid, <hi>An Evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit;</hi> How
then will he bring forth good fruit, where a falſe tree ſtandeth, under
a ſtrange ſhew [or glittering hypocriſie?] The purple-mantle of
Chriſt hath its fruits in it; but what is that to a falſe beaſt, that is full
of poyſon, and will cover himſelfe with that Mantle and take it for
his owne; and yet bringeth forth nothing but helliſh fruit? Or
what hath the Titular Chriſtian to doe to boaſt, and glory that he is a
Chriſtian; whereas he liveth, walketh, and is, without Chriſt?</p>
            <p>12. None is a Chriſtian, unleſſe he be <hi>Tinctured anew</hi> with the
ſpirit of Chriſt;<note place="margin">☞</note> and ſprung forth out of <hi>Gods love;</hi> that the grace of
God in Chriſt be manifeſt in the Myſtery of his life as to the ſoul;
and cooperateth and willeth in the humane life.</p>
            <p>13. Now if he will become ſuch a one, then he muſt turne from
his Imagining <hi>in the Coſmick Spirit</hi> wherewith the ſoule is covered and
diſguiſed,<note place="margin">In Spiritu Mundi.</note> and enters into Earthly workings, and [muſt] become
as a Child, that onely inclineth it ſelfe with its whol affection to the
Mother; and draweth into it ſelfe the Mothers <hi>Milke</hi> of grace,
whence a new <hi>Ens</hi> groweth, in which the life of grace ariſeth; that
is, the <hi>imputed grace</hi> muſt be borne, and become man in him, as to
the internall ground; without this, there is none <hi>a Chriſtian,</hi> let
him make never ſuch devout ſhewes; diſſemble, flatter, and doe
what he will, his ſins muſt be forgiven him onely through the <hi>Divine
Alloquy, or in Spiration in himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. Eor when Chriſt is Conceived in the inſpired [inſpoken]
word of grace, which the ſoule doth take and impreſſe into it ſelfe
from his Promiſe, then the foundation is layd in the corrupt, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
Myſtery to a Child of God; and then the divine<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Breeding or Hatching.</note> Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
beginneth and proceedeth, wherein the humanity of Chriſt
is conceived and borne; which onely is <hi>the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi>
and from this new birth, the fiery ſoule eateth Gods bread, which
commeth from Heaven; and without this, man hath no life in him,
<hi>John</hi> 6. which no Hypocrite under the Purple Mantle of Chriſt can
enjoy, but onely that man who is not borne of fleſh and blood,
nor of the will of man, but regenerate of God, in whom the Word
of God (whence the firſt man was created) ſpeaketh, ruleth, liveth,
and willeth.</p>
            <p>15. For the life of Man was in the beginning in the Word (<hi>John</hi>
1.) when the ſame was inſpired or breathed into the created Image;
but when it turned it ſelfe from the ſpeaking of the Word into a
peculiar ſelfe willing and ſpeaking in good and evill, that is, into
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58072:57"/>
its owne luſt and contrived Imagination, then the firſt good will in
the Creature to the re-expreſſing, did periſh; and now he muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
againe into the <hi>firſt Speaking</hi> Word and ſpeake with God, or he is
eternally <hi>without God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. Which this preſent World cannot nor will not underſtand,<note place="margin">☜</note>
for it hath wholly and fully turned it ſelfe into a ſelfiſh ſpeaking to
the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of the <hi>fleſh;</hi> and it ſpeaketh forth in ſelfe-will meere
Earthlineſſe, and tranſitory things, as Honour, might, Power, and
Authority; moreover, Pride, covetouſneſſe, Envy, and Malice; it
utters nothing elſe but the cunning crafty Serpent with its young,
and when theſe her young, cannot get, and uphold that which the
ſelfe-will willeth; then it ſpeaketh forth from the cunning miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Malice and I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the ſelfe-will that is departed from God, may be truely upheld,

and I ſhall yet doe it, when ever I come that way, if occaſion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt.</p>
            <p>4. I think alſo of the diſcourſe we had then at our <hi>Meeting,</hi>
where many things were put to the Queſtion which by reaſon of
the many objections then made (which cauſe much miſtaking, and
confuſion) could not be ſo well determined as they ought, being
I was alſo in haſt.</p>
            <p>5. Yet (upon the deſire of ſome high perſons, with whom I did
Converſe in the Chriſtmaſſe holy dayes when I departed from you,
where ſome <hi>very Learned men of Iaver,</hi> and of <hi>Strieg, together with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

for there the true ground is ſet downe at large before their eyes;
and every ones Opinion, is <hi>ſatiſfyed,</hi> and the two Contraries are as
it were united into one body; if any ſhall be able to ſee, know, and
underſtand the ſame againſt the poyſon of the Devill, by reaſon of
the Earthly Imagination; as I doubt not, but that the time is at
hand that ſtrife, and controverſie ſhall be changed into truth.</p>
            <p>7. Whereas yet among the true Chriſtians, and the Children of
God in all nations there hath not been any controverſy, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
for in Chriſt we are all but one Tree ſpread forth into many
branches, and twigs.</p>
            <p>8. And controverſie is hence ariſen, that the World is fallen into
its ſelviſh luſt and Imagination; whereby they have rent themſelves
of from Chriſt their Stem; in whom Chriſtians ſhould ſtand in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
but have turned themſelves unto Images [opinions mentall

            <p>9. Out of which queſtions ſuch controverſies, and contentions
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58072:59"/>
are ariſen; where the <hi>pride</hi> of the Devill hath been involved in the
queſtions, and hath ſo imprinted, and immodellized it ſelfe on the
Image of man; that they have <hi>fought</hi> for their Images and opinions,
and have therein extolled, and advanced themſelves; and <hi>Chriſts
Humility,</hi> wherein we ſhould dye in Chriſt from our evill nature, is
quite forgotten; ſo that for the preſent we are rather a Monſter of
an Image, then a living Chriſtendome, in ſpirit, and in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>10. For a Chriſtian muſt, and ought to ſtand in the Tree of
Chriſt with the Encreaſe and groweth of Chriſts life, and alſo live in
the ſpirit of Chriſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> and beare fruit; in whom Chriſt himſelfe (as to
the internall ground) liveth and is all in all in him; who continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
breaketh the head of the Serpents will in the fleſh; and bringeth
to naught the workes of the Devill; he muſt know, will, and do
from Chriſt; it muſt come to effectuall doing (that is, into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
working) for without this, <hi>none</hi> is a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>11. Chriſt muſt wholly receive and take poſſeſſion of the internall
ground of the ſoule; that the ſevere juſtice of God (which holdeth
us captive in the Anger) might be ſatisfied with Chriſts fulneſſe [and
effectuall merit] that Chriſt may fulfill the anger of God in us with
love, and mortifie the will of the Devill; and alſo the nature in the
wrath of God, and wholly annihilate it's will, that ſo he may dye in
the love of Chriſt, and bring forth a new will in the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our converſation is in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12 Lip-labour, and the Pratings of the mouth avail nothing;
the ſame make no Chriſtian; a Chriſtian muſt alwaies be borne (or
regenerated) of Chriſt; elſe he is no Chriſtian, no outward imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
righteouſneſſe, or grace helpeth at all.</p>
            <p>13. All the comforting, flattering, ſoothing, and diſſembling is
but in vaine; where the purple-mantle of Chriſt is put upon the
man of iniquity and malice, [or the Cain-like hypocrite,] who
from without will be an adopted Child of grace.</p>
            <p>14. For no Whore, or<note n="*" place="margin">One that is gotten with Childe.</note> one that is impregnated, can be a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
albeit ſhe puts on a maides Garland; yea no Prince, or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
can grace her with any Virginitie.</p>
            <p>15. Thus the flattering hypocriſie, and comforting [with Chriſts
Merits, and promiſes] is to be underſtood, unleſſe we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and become like Children which hang on the breaſts of their
Mother, and receive and conceive in us the <hi>Ens</hi> [or eſſentiall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er]
of Chriſt, which deſtroyeth the Harlot; that a new ſpirit may
be borne in us out of Chriſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> which hath in it Chriſts ſufferings, and
death; that we be borne out of his Reſurrection, and reſigne up our

he is growing on the tree, as to the internall ground.</p>

be <hi>no need</hi> of any further asking and ſearching.</p>
            <p>3 For the Booke in which all Myſteries lye, is Man himſelfe; he
himſelfe is the Booke of the Being of all Beings;<note place="margin">☜</note> ſeeing he is the

in and out of God; and no otherwiſe at all is he Gods childe and
heire, a child of Heaven and of Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>7. No imputed righteouſneſſe availeth (a ſtranger cannot inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite

out of the water and ſpirit of God, as Chriſt told us, that
<hi>We muſt become like unto Children,</hi> and be conceived in Gods Eſſence,
and like new children in God, we muſt ſpring forth, and be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new;
as a faire flower ſpringeth out of the wilde Earth, or as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Gold groweth in a rough ſtone, or droſſy Oare; otherwiſe we
cannot ſee, nor inherite the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>8. For whatſoever will poſſeſſe the internall ſpirituall World, muſt
be borne out of the ſame; the earthly fleſh from the foure Elements
cannot inherite the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>9. But the <hi>Quint-eſſence</hi> (which is the one Element; namely,
<hi>Paradiſe</hi>) whence the foure Elements have their riſe, birth, and
proceeding, that ſame muſt be predominant, and rule over the foure
Elements, in like manner as the light containeth the darkneſſe as it
were ſwallowed up, and yet the ſame is really in it; even ſo it muſt
be with Man.</p>
            <p>10. Onely it cannot be ſo with the outward man in this time of
the <hi>earthly life;</hi> for the outward World ruleth ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the outward
Man; ſeeing it was made manifeſt in Man, which is his fall.</p>
            <p>11. And therefore the externall man muſt periſh, as the externall
World periſheth and paſſeth away; and therefore Man in this time
cannot attaine <hi>perfection;</hi> but the true man muſt continue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and ſtrife againſt the earthly corrupt life, which is its owne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where eternity and time ſtrive one againſt another.</p>
            <p>12. For through ſtrife or the mutuall combate in Nature, the
great <hi>Arcanum</hi> is opened, and the eternall wonders in Gods wiſedome
are made manifeſt out of the ſoules Eſſence.</p>
            <p>13 As the eternall God hath manifeſted himſelfe through the
time,<note place="margin">☞</note> and bringeth his eternall Wonders through the time, into
combate and conteſt, that through the combate [or ſtrife] that
which is hidden [and lyeth in the <hi>Myſterious Nothing</hi>] might open
it selfe and be brought to light; even ſo in ſtrife and combate, the
great Myſtery muſt be revealed in Man, where Gods anger and love,
as fire and light are in combate and ſtrife.</p>
            <p>14. For in the ſoule (which ariſeth out of the Eternall fire out
of the Fathers property, that is out of the Eternall un-inchoative
Nature, out of the darkneſſe) that light (which did extinguiſh and
diſappeare in Adam) muſt be renued and borne againe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
of Chriſt, and then the Kingdome of Chriſt, and of God is
<hi>freely</hi> given him out of <hi>grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:58072:62"/>
15. For none can take the ſame unto himſelfe unleſſe the love of
God doth againe preſſe out of grace into the Centre of the ſoule;
and bringeth the divine will out of the fire of the ſoul as a new ſpro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>16. Therefore all whatſoever <hi>Babel</hi> teacheth of the externall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
righteouſneſſe, and the externall aſſumed Adoption, [and
particular Election and Rejection from eternity) is without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

ſee the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. The ſeeming holy flattering comfort with Chriſts death, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valleth
nothing, but to enter into Chriſts death; and to ſpring up
a new in him; and to ariſe in him and with him and become Chriſt,
[or an annointed child of God] in the new man.</p>
            <p>18. Like as Chriſt hath mortifyed, extinguiſhed and overcome the
World,<note place="margin">☞</note> and alſo the anger of his father, (being the centre of the
Eternall Nature) in the ſoules property, with his love, (that is,
with the new love fire introduced into the ſoules eſſence; into
which, the Devill before had brought in, and placed <hi>his Deſire;</hi>
even ſo muſt we in and with Chriſts ſpirit quell and quaſh the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Adam</hi> in Gods anger, and mortify it through Gods love, that the

            <p>19. The Kingdome of God muſt be inwardly innate, and borne
within us, elſe we cannot ſee with the eyes of eternity into the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall

            <p>20. All Imaginations, inventions and wayes; all reading, ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and teachings is to no purpoſe, [without this way of the new
birth] no art or reaſon can attain it: we muſt enter onely through
the gate which God hath opened to us in Chriſt; and ſpring forth
in Gods Kingdome and dye unto the earthly will, ſo that it neither
hindereth nor ſticketh on us and cloggeth us; <hi>the ſeed of the Woman
muſt continually, bruiſe the Serpents head in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. Selfe-reaſon cannot make a child of God; for <hi>it lyeth not in
our willing, running, and keeping a doe,</hi> as ſaint Paul ſaith; <hi>but on Gods
mercy and Compaſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. My ſelfehood cannot attain it; my ſelfehood muſt dye in
Chriſts death;<note place="margin">☜</note> and fall or reſigne unto the nothing; and then my
ſelfehood falleth into Gods Mercy; and is in the limit of the firſt
man, and ſtandeth againe in the <hi>word Fiat;</hi> where Gods mercy in
Chriſts entrance into our humanity doth make [or recreate] the
new man out of grace.</p>
            <p>23. And therefore the corrupt earthly will muſt dye in a reall
true, upright repentance, and enter into the Reſignation; that is,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58072:63"/>
into the nothing, and wholly ſurrender the will of reaſon unto death,
and neither will or know himſelfe any more, but enter into the
mercy and compaſſion of God.</p>
            <p>24. <hi>And then this ſaying hath its place and meaning, as God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the Prophet,</hi> My heart breaketh in me, that I muſt take pitty on
him, can a Mother forget her Childe, that ſhee ſhould not have compaſſion
on the Sonne of her wombe? And albeit ſhee ſhould forget, yet I will not
forget thee; Behold, I have noted thee in my hands.</p>
            <p>25. In this (namely, in Gods mercy) the new man doth ariſe,
and ſpringeth up in the Kingdome of Heaven and Paradiſe,<note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>though</hi>
the earthly body be in this World.</p>
            <p>26. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our Converſation is in Heaven:</hi> Thus the
new man walketh in Heaven, and the old man in this World, for the
Heaven in which God dwelleth is in the new man.</p>
            <p>27. Thus (beloved Sir, and Brother) and in no other way and
manner, have I found the Myſtery; I have not ſtudyed or learned
the ſame; but if you or any other doth thirſt after it, I am engaged
as a Brother in my affection and love, to ſhew him the way how I
met with it, as I have ſet downe at large in my Writings, chiefly in
the Booke of <hi>the Threefold life of Man,</hi> and in the Booke of <hi>the three
Principles of the Divine Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28. Indeed I did it for my ſelfe, as a ſpirituall exerciſe in Gods
knowledge, in the Myſtery of the great Wonders of God; which
notwithſtanding by Gods providence and guidance is come ſo farre
as to be publiſhed and read; and I would gladly that every one that
earneſtly deſires to underſtand the ſame, might have it; and I wiſh
from my heart, that it may be really manifeſt and made knowne to
the <hi>Reader of this Epiſtle,</hi> and to every one <hi>in himſelfe,</hi> and then there
would be no need of any further ſearching and ſeeking.</p>
            <p>29. But ſeeing God hath promiſed by the Prophets (eſpecially
in <hi>Joel</hi>) that he will powre forth his ſpirit in the laſt dayes upon
all fleſh, therefore the time is to be conſidered and taken notice
of.</p>
            <p>30. I ſay as I have knowne it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that whoſoever at preſent will dye
to himſelfe, him ſhall the ſpirit of the Lord according to <hi>Joels</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
apprehend, and manifeſt his Wonders by him; therefore if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be in earneſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> he ſhall finde it by experience.</p>
            <p>31. Yet let every one be faithfully warned, that if Gods light doth
ariſe in him, that he continue ſtedfaſt in great humility in reſignation,
namely in the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>32. (For the Heaven ſhall now at laſt powre forth its long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
<hi>Egeſtum</hi> of the <hi>Conſtellations</hi> which it hath wrought in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

               <hi>Metiſts,</hi> who came even unto the

               </gap> not [the new

ſpoyle the Gold; for his right will is dead to the earthly deſire, and
continually deſireth to kill and mortifie the luſt of the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
doth likewiſe kill it without intermiſſion, for here <hi>the Seed of the
Woman, Viz.</hi> the new Man borne in Chriſt, <hi>bruiſeth the head of the
Serpents will</hi> in the fleſh [which will] is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. And beloved Sir, I give you as a Chriſtian and Brother in all
faithfulneſſe, ſyncerity, and uprightneſſe to underſtand, that we in
our <hi>Suppoſed Religion</hi> (wherein men doe nothing but contend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute,
and revile one another about the Letter [and the different O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
thence contrived] are as yet in the midſt of <hi>Babel,</hi> and that
it was never <hi>Worſe</hi> then now; whereas yet men doe boaſt that they
are gone out from <hi>Babel,</hi> and have the true Religion, which I leave
in its worth [to be well conſidered.]</p>
            <p>14. But for ſo much as is knowne to me in the Lord my God, in
my exceeding precious <hi>Talent</hi> given to me of God, I ſay, that men
indeed have dipped Chriſts Mantle with its purple colour in the
blood of Chriſt, and taken it upon them for a covering; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they have onely covered the Antichriſtian childe of ſelfe will,
and ſo have painted over the Antichriſtian Baſtard with a ſtrange
colour.</p>
            <p>15. For men doe exceedingly flatter it, and cover it with Chriſts
ſuffering merit, and death, and comfort it, that Chriſt hath payd all
for it, ſaying, It ought onely to [apply or] comfort it ſelfe with
the merit of Chriſt, and receive it in faith as a ſatisfaction, and thus
they ſhew us an outward imputed righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>16. But it hath far another <hi>A. B. C.</hi> in the true underſtanding;
no comforting, ſelfe-willing, running, or keeping a round, availeth
any thing; the ſuffering, the death of Chriſt, will not be given to the
Antichriſtian Beaſt in <hi>Selfe,</hi> but to them that depart from, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
all the ownehood [and propriety] of the creatures,<note place="margin">☞</note> and
wholly reſigne up themſelves into the ſuffering and death of Chriſt
Jeſus; and dye to their owne will, in and with Chriſt, and are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with him, and alſo ariſe in him to a new will and obedience, and
hate ſinne; who put on Chriſt in his ſuffering reproach, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and take his Croſſe upon them, and follow him under his
<hi>Red Banner;</hi> to them I ſay, it will be given, theſe put on Chriſt
in his proceſſe, and become in the inward ſpirituall Man
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58072:66"/>
Chriſts members, and the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, who dwelleth <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> S.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. None hath right to comfort himſelfe with Chriſts merits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he deſireth wholly to put on Chriſt in himſelfe; and he is alſo
no Chriſtian before he hath put him on by true repentance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to him with an abſolute reſignation,<note place="margin">☞</note> and unfeigned ſelfe-denyall;
ſo that CHRIST eſpouſeth and betrotheth himſelfe
with him.</p>
            <p>18. The beginning of which comes to paſſe in the Covenant of
Baptiſme, where the childe promiſeth and ſweareth under Chriſts
<hi>Red Banner,</hi> that which afterwards muſt follow in very deed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
practice; or if one hath turned himſelfe away [from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of what he then promiſed] he muſt in ſuch a converſion of
his will turne himſelfe thereinto againe; and I ſay upon ſure ground
that to many an one the Mantle of Chriſt will turne to helliſh fire,
in that he covereth Antichriſt therewith, and yet remaineth but a
Beaſt.</p>
            <p>19. For a Chriſtian muſt be borne of Chriſt, and dye to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damicall
will; he muſt have Chriſt in him, and be a branch or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
on his fleſh and ſpirit, not according to the Animall Beaſt, but
according to the ſpirituall Man.</p>
            <p>20. For the ſpirit of God poſſeſſeth not the Beaſt [the outward
ſenſuall naturall or rationall Man] but indeed, the Temple of Chriſt,
<hi>Viz.</hi> Chriſts ſpirituall fleſh and blood in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> for Chriſt ſayd, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhall not eate the fleſh of the Sonne of Man, hee hath no life in
himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. Now there muſt be a mouth which indeed is proper and fit to
eate it, for it will not be given to the Beaſt, much leſſe to the <hi>Ens</hi> of
the Serpent; for every ſpirit eateth of its Mother, whence it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſen;
which I give to every underſtanding man to conſider of, and
here I onely mention what a Chriſtian ought to be, if he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
himſelfe a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>22. For a Beaſt is no Chriſtian, but he that is <hi>Baptized</hi> with
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> who hath put on Chriſt, and
liveth in Chriſts heavenly fleſh and blood; who hath <hi>taſted Chriſts
Supper,</hi> and ſitteth with Chriſt at Table; he is a Chriſtian that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in Chriſts footſteps, and continually mortyfieth the Antichriſtian
evill Beaſt in fleſh and blood (which ſtill adhereth to a Chriſtian)
binds it, and depriveth it of its ſtrength, and patiently reſigneth
himſelfe up in temptations, which <hi>many hundred</hi> wayes are offered
him, for his tryall and purification.</p>
            <p>23. A Chriſtian muſt learne the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> backwards, and account
the wiſedome of his Reaſon ſcoliſhneſſe, that Chriſt may gaine a
forme in him, and he be made <hi>capable</hi> of the heavenly Wiſedome.</p>
            <p>24. For the wiſedome of the outward World is blind in reſpect
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58072:66"/>
of God, and ſeeth him not; Albeit all things live and move in God,
and he himſelfe is through all things, and yet he poſſeſſeth nothing,
ſave that which dyeth from its owne will; that he muſt poſſeſſe, and
he poſſeſſeth it willingly, for it willeth nothing without him, and it
is in the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. Whereof I could further mention unto you, if occaſion here
did permit, the which I have in my Writings largely deſcribed and
declared out of the centre, and Originall of all Eſſences; and here
onely I have hinted in briefe, what a Chriſtians ſtate, being, and
condition is; if it ſhould pleaſe you further to conſider of it, and
to give up your ſelfe into this proceſſe, as I likewiſe hope that you
are already in it.</p>
            <p>26. But for a more brotherly recreation, I thought good to viſit
you with a ſhort <hi>Epiſtle;</hi> and to ſolace my ſelfe a little with you in
the hope and faith which worketh, and is in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> untill we be once
freed from this Cottage, and be afterwards refreſhed, and quickned
perfectly one with another in Divine and brotherly Union, and
<hi>Viſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. And this I have done upon the deſire of the Doctor above
mentioned, in all ſyncerity and uprightneſſe; and ſo I commend
you to the tender Love of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <head>THE
ELEVENTH EPISTLE:
Our Salvation is in the effectuall working
Love of Jeſus Chriſt in Us.</head>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EARE Brother in the life of Jeſus
Chriſt, I wiſh from my heart the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
working Love unto you, that your
noble Lilly-twig ſprung forth in Chriſt,
may in the power of Chriſt, grow great,
and bring forth much fruit in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe
of God, to the heavenly joy of
us all, and our eternall brotherly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip.</p>
            <p>2. I rejoyce in my ſoule, when I
perceive that a goodly, vertuous, faire <hi>Branch</hi> is ſprung up in our
Tree of life Chriſt; and I hope alſo to be a partaker of its good
fruit.</p>
            <p>3. As one branch on the Tree doth enjoy the ſap and power of
the other, and they all doe mutually grow, and beare fruit in one
onely <hi>Power;</hi> ſo likewiſe we are in the Tree of Chriſt all onely <hi>One,</hi>
which [Tree] is <hi>CHRIST in us ALL.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Seeing then that you freely and unfeignedly with all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of heart and mouth, doe approve your ſelfe to this Tree
of life; and on the contrary doe renounce, and gaineſay the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and deluſion of Satan; therefore I wiſh nothing more at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
then that I might be able in the power of this Tree which is
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> to impart and give the influence of my power received from
him unto you, that we might grow together as members in one
Power.</p>
            <p>5. And I make no doubt, but the moſt High hath begotten his
<hi>Lilly-twig</hi> in you, for without Divine Power we have <hi>no longing,</hi> or
<hi>hunger after God,</hi> and alſo we cannot know him without his ſpirit in
us; all that we underſtand and know of him fundamentally [or in
reality] commeth from his Revelation and Operation.</p>
            <p>6. For albeit the World prateth and talketh much of God, yet it
doth it onely from <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> and receiveth its knowledge from the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58072:67"/>
Hyſtory of the literall word [by the habituall faculties of its naturall
reaſon] and yet it is void of true knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For</hi> none knoweth the Father but the Sonne and he to whom the ſon will
reveal him.</p>
            <p>7. And therefore we have no true knowledge of God, unleſſe it
be given us of the ſon,<note place="margin">☞</note> who liveth in us, if we be [living] branches
on the vine.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>For Chriſt ſaid,</hi> whoſoever is of God he heareth Gods word; <hi>and
to the Reaſon-learned who were onely ſkillfull and taught in the</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>he ſaid,</hi> therefore you doe not heare, becauſe you are not of God; <hi>alſo</hi>
you are not my ſheep; you are ravening wolves, and hirelings.</p>
            <p>9. Therefore I ſay, that if we will ſpeake aright of God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
his will, then his words muſt abide in us, in a quicke and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
working; for Chriſt ſaid <hi>without me you can doe nothing;</hi> alſo <hi>none
can call God Lord without the holy ſpirit in him;</hi> for his calling Lord
muſt be borne of God, and flow from the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Nothing is pleaſing to God,<note place="margin">☜</note> and alſo nothing is accepted of
God, but that which he himſelfe doth and worketh in and through
the ſpirit of man; therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>all the plants which my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father hath not planted ſhall be rooted out and burnt with fire,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. Therefore my beloved brother, you doe well to hold and keep
your ſelfe to the <hi>Originall of life;</hi> and deſire power and ſtrength
from it; you ſhall be well quickned refreſhed and ſtrengthened, you
are an acceptable gueſt to God and the members of Chriſt, in [this]
your purpoſe.</p>
            <p>12. And if you perſevere ſtedfaſtly and reſiſt the devill, the
World, and the Earthly fleſh and blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fight like a true Noble Champion, for Conqueſt againſt <hi>all theſe;</hi> and
overcome in you the Potent, and open Enemy <hi>ſelfe-love;</hi> and come
aright into our Generall <hi>LOVE;</hi> then you ſhall certainly know,
and ſinde by experience that the noble and exceeding worthy Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phee,

of death and Hell ſhall be ſet upon you, with the Heavenly
Kingdome of joy.</p>
            <p>13. And then all the Children of Chriſt together with the holy
Angels, ſhall exceedingly rejoyce more with you, then for 99 righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ones, who have allready obtained it.</p>
            <p>14. And the fair and noble <hi>Sophia</hi> ſhall be given for a ſpouſe unto

            <p>

15. And then you ſhall <hi>ſee great wonders,</hi> and at the hour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
the joyfull nuptialls or marriage of the Lambe ſhall be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Heaven in you; and then the<note n="*" place="margin">Shepheards Crooke.</note> 
               <hi>Shepheards ſtaffe</hi> ſhall be given
by Chriſt, into the hand of your ſoule.</p>
            <p>16. But be ſure, remember to keep truly and faithfully unto the
end, what you have promiſed unto this chaſt <hi>Sophia;</hi> it muſt be in
right earneſt and not to looke back again into <hi>Sodom,</hi> as <hi>Lots Wife;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note>
who was turned into a <hi>pillar of Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. But you muſt goe out of <hi>Sodom</hi> with <hi>Lot</hi> according to Gods
command, and enter into the footſteps of Chriſt, not at all regarding
the ſcoffings, reproaches, and opprobrious ſpeeches of the World;
but love the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Marke.</note> Brand of Chriſt more, then the friendſhip, honour,
and goods of the whole World, and then you may walke along with
us, upon the Pilgrims path of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>18. But if you doe not reliſh this, but minde and deſire rather
the pleaſure and honour of the World, then you are not as yet ready
and prepared for the Marriage, and to come to your Spouſe, our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and deare <hi>Sophia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. Therefore conſider well your ſelfe, behold and examine well
your whole heart, if you finde a longing deſire and drawing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
(as I in part perceive and take notice of) then doe not delay
or put it off an houre, but goe forward, and enter with a right ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe
[or fixed minde] into repentance, and yeeld up your
will wholly and fully, to enter inſtantly thereinto, and never to goe
out from it againe; albeit you ſhould therefore <hi>forſake body, LIFE,
Honour, and Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. And if you doe thus then you are rightly prepared, and the
true <hi>Pioneer</hi> will come unto your ſoule, and doe that in you which
you cannot doe without him.</p>
            <p>21. And although afterwards [vaine] inclinations, and great
ſtrife and oppoſition in the fleſh might ſtick and cleave unto you;
and your reaſon call you a Foole; yea though Gods anger ſhould
cover and cloud you in ſoule and body, yet all this will not hurt you;
you ſhall ſpring forth under ſuch thornes with a new minde, and
walke with the ſpirit in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. And albeit the earthly body muſt be converſant with the
creatures, yet it ſhall be with it, as with a rough ſtone, in which fine
Gold groweth.</p>
            <p>23. Be not at all offended at my tribulation, and perſecution;
neither be afraid; for it is the marck of Chriſt; Looke but back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Scripture, and ſee how it went with the children of God; how
were they continually perſecuted and killed by <hi>thoſe</hi> who ſhould have
taught <hi>the wayes of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>24. For I am entruſted with a precious Pearle, which God doth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58072:68"/>
ſo cover, that the unworthy ſee it not, but are blind therein, and
are offended at the ſimplicity of the perſon; that ſo they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
blind to themſelves in the wiſedome of their owne Reaſon;
this they ſee, and yet doe not underſtand it, ſeeing they ſcorne and
deſpiſe the ſimplicity of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>25. But the time is very <hi>nigh</hi> at hand when they ſhall give an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<hi>account</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>26. But that God hath given you to underſtand what it is, and
from whence it commeth; be thankfull to him for it, it is befallen
you out of grace; for you have humbled your ſelfe before him, and
there may yet greater grace happen unto you, if you perſevere ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
in <hi>humility,</hi> and <hi>earneſt Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. I will willingly impart unto you my Love, as a member of
Chriſt, with praying and cooperating; for it is meer joy in my heart
ſo to doe; albeit I muſt therefore ſuffer bodily trouble and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
yet I rejoyce to ſee what God the Lord hath done by me poore
Man hitherto.</p>
            <p>28. Satan cannot hinder the wayes of God, and though it ſeemes
as if he hindered them by his murtherous cryes, yet they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the more divulged and made knowne, ſo that the Children of God
doe enquire after the true ground.</p>
            <p>29. But the wicked crew is thereby hardned and hindred; but
others are thereby called, and this you ſhall <hi>ſee before a yeare come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;</hi>
and though they <hi>kill</hi> me, yet it muſt goe forward; for it is
from the Lord.</p>
            <p>30. And I commit you to the tender effectuall working Love of
Jeſus Chriſt; and commend my ſelfe unto your brotherly love, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,

In TEMPTATION, and trouble
of Minde, ſhewing whence
it ariſeth.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>Our Salvation is in the life of Jeſus Chriſt in US.</opener>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EARE Sir, my <hi>Fellow-member,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> and
Brother in Chriſt our Saviour; my
cordiall wiſh and cooperating deſire
of the Divine Love and Grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed:<note place="margin">☜</note>
I deſire to let you know in
Chriſtian Love, that I have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
your condition in a Chriſtian
Sympathy and fellow-feeling; and
have brought it before the gracious
compaſſion of the moſt high,<note place="margin">☜</note> to ſee
what hee would be pleaſed to let
me know therein.</p>
            <p>2. Whereupon Sir, I muſt tell you, that I in the ſame gracious
compaſſion obtained ſuch an inſight and <hi>Viſion</hi> of your condition
and Temptation, that the ground and cauſe of it is made knowne
to me; and I will ſet it downe in briefe for a <hi>Memorandum,</hi> that you
may conſider and ponder it ſeriouſly by your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>firſt</hi> cauſe of ſuch ſtrong working temptation, is the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
ſuper-abundant and unſpeakable love of God; (that is, the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58072:71"/>
Divine good will,<note place="margin">☞</note> and then the creaturall will of man ſtrugling one
againſt another) that the humane will refuſeth fully to reſigne and
give it ſelfe up with totall confidence unto ſuch great grace of God;
which is tendred unto it out of pure love; but ſeeketh it ſelfe and
its <hi>owne love</hi> of tranſitory things; and loveth it ſelfe, and the<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Things.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of this World more then God.</p>
            <p>4. Therefore mans own nature (which in its owne centre without
the love of God, ſtandeth in meer anguiſh, ſtrife, enmity, and unquiet
contrariety) tempteth him; into which alſo the Devill ſnooteth
his falſe deſire, to lead man aſtray from ſuch high grace, and love
of God.</p>
            <p>5. This temptation is the greateſt; and it is even the combate
which Chriſt maintaineth with his love (ſhed forth into the nature
of man) againſt ſuch <hi>ſelfeneſſe,</hi> alſo againſt Gods anger, ſin, death,
Devill, and hell, in which combate the humane Dragon muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouted
by the love of Chriſt, and changed into an angelicall I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
            <p>6. And if the love of God in Chriſt <hi>had not its influence in you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> you
ſhould have none of this combate, but the Dragon (<hi>Viz.</hi> The
falſe develiſh will) would maintaine his naturall right [and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
without <hi>any ſuch conflict</hi> or diſturbance.]</p>
            <p>7. Now therefore this perplexing, and diſtreſſing temptation is
wrought very ſenſibly in nature by the Dragon, who is in travelling
anguiſh with his owne nature, when ſuch great love of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
into him and would change his naturall right into <hi>a divine</hi>
[ſelfe denying] <hi>will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. For here Chriſt [the Serpent-ſtroyer] ſtandeth in man, in
hell, and ſtormeth, or aſſaulteth the ſtrong prey-fort of the Devill,
whence ariſeth ſuch ſtrife; where Chriſt and Lucifer fight for the
ſoule, as God hath given you to ſee, and know experimentally in the
firſt Temptation.</p>
            <p>9. Thus <hi>Chriſt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt in the heel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> and the poore ſoule ſtandeth in the middeſt in great
trembling and ſadneſſes, and can doe nothing, but onely ſtand ſtill
in <hi>hope;</hi> it is not able alſo to lift up its face before God; and powre
forth its effectuall prayers; for the Dragon turneth its face towards
the vanity of this World, and ſhewes it the beauty, and glory of this
World; and mocketh it, becauſe it will become another creature;
and repreſents unto it the Kingdome in which it liveth and its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ground.</p>
            <p>10. And here the ſoule ſtandeth with Chriſt in the Wilderneſſe, in
the <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> will.</p>
            <p>11. The <hi>Second</hi> Temptation of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and the ſelfiſh Dragon of
nature,<note place="margin">☞</note> is this, that when the ſoule hath taſted the Divine love, and
hath beene once illuminated, then the ſoule will have that ſame
light for its owne propriety,<note place="margin">☞</note> and worke therein in its owne Power
and ability as in its owne peculiar poſſeſſion; underſtand, the nature
of the ſoule, which being without Gods light is a Dragon as <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
that I ſay will have it for its owne propriety; but this Dragon will
not reſigne up his naturall right; he will be a maker and diſpoſer of
the Divine power, and live therein in great joy in his fiery [ſelfiſh]
nature; and this cannot be.</p>
            <p>12. This Dragon (<hi>Viz.</hi> the fiery nature) muſt be changed with
its owne will into a Love-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>re and forgoe his naturall right; but he
is unwilling to doe it; but he in ſuch a charge or tranſmutation
looketh for an <hi>owne ſelfe power,</hi> and yet findeth none, and therefore
he beginneth to doubt of grace, becauſe he ſeeth that in ſuch work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he muſt forſake his naturall deſire and will; and hence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
is afrayd, and will not <hi>dye</hi> in the Divine light <hi>from his owne
naturall Right,</hi> but alwayes <hi>thinketh</hi> that the light of <hi>Grace</hi> (which
worketh without ſuch ſharpneſſe and fiery might) is a <hi>falſe</hi> light.</p>
            <p>13. Whence it commeth,<note place="margin">☞</note> that the outward Reaſon (which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is blind [and ſeeth nothing aright of it ſelfe]) continually
thinketh: O! who knoweth how it is with thee, whether it be true
or no, that God hath illuminated thee, that he is in thee? I may
likely proceed from ſuch a <hi>Fanſie;</hi> thou ſeeſt not the like in other
people, and yet they thinke to be ſaved as well as thou, thou makeſt
thy ſelfe thereby onely the foole of the World, and ſtandeſt in feare
and trembling at Gods anger, more then thoſe who comfort

            <p>14. Thus it commeth to paſſe, that then the internall ground
doth ſigh and pant after the inflammation and motion of the light,
and faine would have it; but the nature is able to doe nothing; it
is as if it were wholly rejected of God, which is alſo true, as to the
Selfe-will; for <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>planted</hi> a new will <hi>into it,</hi> it muſt dye to its
owne will, and be changed into Gods will.</p>
            <p>15. And becauſe the will of nature muſt here dye and reſigne up

            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>OURTEOUS Sir, and good Friend; I
cannot but rejoyce with you, in that you
have given up your life to [be] a plant
of God; and ſo it ſpringeth and bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſorth in the body of Jeſus Chriſt
the Sonne of God, who hath begotten
us againe to a living creature <hi>in himſelfe,</hi>
and hath ſet us before his Father as a
lovely plant in his pleaſant Paradiſicall
Garden, to his joy and deeds of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>2. And I finde (if I conſider aright) that you are not onely a
Plant of God for your ſelfe, but as a pleaſant Hearb, and Flower
doth not hold its ſtrength and vertue within its <hi>Selfe,</hi> but doth caſt
forth and diffuſe its vertue for a ſweet relliſh unto all living<note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Things.</hi>

and freely preſents it ſelfe unto all creatures, what ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of it, and ſo it doth not ſpare it ſelfe, but continually produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
its power and ſmell,</p>
            <p>3. And thus I finde it to be with the ſoule of man, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
groweth and freely yeeldeth its power or vertue for <hi>him to taſt
that deſireth it, and is capable of receiving its power;</hi> be it either to love,
or anger, to the life of God in Chriſt, or to the life of pride, leading
into the utmoſt drift of miſery, which in the end befalls thoſe that
are not growne in God.</p>

gone, but for all that it hath its root in the Earth, and ſpringeth up;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58072:74"/>
thus likewiſe the ſoule of the <hi>Saints</hi> is <hi>engrafted</hi> into the <hi>holy</hi> life of
Jeſus Chriſt, and ſtandeth in God his Father, and ſpringeth forth
againe through <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 At which (ſeeing we have knowne the ſame effectually) we
doe rejoyce; and therefore we eſteeme the life of this World, which
confiſteth in the ſource of the Stars and Elements, as <hi>the leaſt,</hi> and
doe rejoyce that we are the Children of God.</p>
            <p>6. Seeing we know that God is <hi>really in us,</hi> and yet he is hidden
to our earthly life, therefore we know that our ſoule is in God, and
ſpringeth up in God, and the body is in the Dominion of the Stars
and Elements, according to the ſource of this World.</p>
            <p>7 Thus we are Gods Image and likeneſſe, who himſelfe is all;
Should we not therfore rejoyce? <hi>Who will ſeparate us from God,</hi> if the
ſoule be in God, where no death or deſtruction is?</p>
            <p>8. Therefore my deare faithfull Friend, and Brother in Chriſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> I
eſteeme it great joy unto me, that I<note place="margin">☞</note> have found a precious plant of
God of you, of which my ſoule ſmelt, and thereby was ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when the Oppreſſour would have torne it out of the Land of the
living; when it lay under the Oppreſſours; and the <hi>Thorny Plant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of
Antichriſt</hi> intended to devoure us.</p>
            <p>9 But as God commeth to helpe the branches which ſtand in him
with his power that they might not periſh; albeit Devill and Death
doe ſtorme againſt them; ſo they muſt ſpring forth againe through
death, and the wrath or fierceneſſe of the anger and <hi>Sting of death;</hi>
and though God beſtow the moſt noble and precious hearbe of his
Garden upon it, yet his will muſt ſtand; what is ſowne in him, that
muſt grow in him.</p>
            <p>10. This we know, in that he hath given his heart (<hi>Viz.</hi> the moſt
precious plant in himſelfe) to become Man for us to a ſtrong ſweet
ſavour of regeneration in him; that when we were in death, we
might be able to ſpring forth, with, and through him out of death,
in God his Father; and bring forth the fruits of Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>11. Being then we know that we are the Plants [Fruits or <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie</hi>]
of God, let us not feare any thing, but continually grow in
<hi>the life of God,</hi> and bring forth fruit to Gods honour, and deeds of
Wonder, we ſhall enjoy them <hi>eternally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. And being we know,<note place="margin">☞</note> that our pretious life ſtandeth in great
danger (betweene the Kingdome of Heaven, and the Kingdome of
Hell; lying <hi>Captivall</hi> to both, in this time of life) therefore we
muſt walke warily, and circumſpectly; that our Pearl may not be
broken; we muſt not let the <hi>Savour of</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Sin, iniquity</note> 
               <hi>wrath</hi> into us, for to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and ſpoil us; whereby the pretious fruit is hindred in the
growth and God ſhould complain of us; <hi>that he is like a vine-dreſſer
that gleaneth; and would faine enjoy the pretious grapes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:58072:75"/>
13. Therefore let us be watchfull to fight againſt the Prince of
wrath; that the pretious Grapes, and fruites of God may growe <hi>in
us;</hi> in which God may have a good ſmell and taſt; that we may be
a Pleaſant ſweet ſavour to him in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>14. We ſhall well enjoy it, when we are rid from the vanity of
this life; and then we ſhall live and ſpring up in God, and eate of
the pure life of God without defect; and he will be our food, and
we his that ſo there may be a pleaſant mutuall Paradiſicall growth
in one another, we in God, and God in us; in the eternall ſource
of the holy life in Gods Nurſery; wherein is meere perfection in
pure love.</p>
            <p>15. For which cauſe we labor ſo earneſtly, and ſuffer the ſcorne and
contempt of the World, that while our earthly life ſpringeth in
death, our heavenly life may ſpring forth through death, that ſo the
earthly life may appeare before the heavenly as a ſcorne; which
indeed is <hi>not worthy</hi> to be called a life, comparing it with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.</p>
            <p>16. And therefore we ſuffer patiently in the earthly life,<note place="margin">☞</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
in the heavenly, in hope that we ſhall be <hi>freed from vanity;</hi>
and then we ſhall be well refreſhed with conſolation; what we have
beene faine here to ſow in tribulation and trouble, we ſhall reape
in great joy.</p>
            <p>17. Wherefore my very deare Brother in the life of God, in
which you ſtand, you are more acceptable to me, that you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked

my meaning reſteth in truth, not <hi>barely</hi> in the Latine tongue; but
much rather in the <hi>Language of Nature.</hi>

            <p>27. For it is opened unto me in ſome meaſure to ſound out the

            <p>28. For I have beene ſo buſied with travelling up and downe, and

that <hi>they had my knowledge,</hi> and then they would <hi>leave</hi> their jeering.</p>
            <p>35. Concerning the Tranſcribing of my Writings which I am to

cannot hold his peace, and I often heare vaine ſcoffing men ſpeake of

            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Oble, Honoured, and much reſpected Sir,
The ſalutation and kind wiſh of Divine
love, and fulneſſe of joy in Our <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
in his wonderfull ſweet power,
together with all temporall proſperity
of body premiſed; I deſire to let you
know, that I am certified how you are
a Well-wiſher to the<note n="*" place="margin">Text. Fons Sapientiae.</note> Fountaine of
wiſedome, and doe make uſe of ſome
of my Writings, and alſo that you bear
a great deſire after the well-ſpring of Chriſt, and the <hi>Noble Wiſedome,</hi>
which hath moved me to write unto you ſeeing you have peruſed
<hi>ſome</hi> of my Writings.</p>
            <p>2. But there are ſome found, who out of envy, miſapprehenſion,
and miſunderſtanding of them doe prate and ſtorme againſt them, as
may be ſeen by the annexed Pamphlet, how the poore, proud, ſilly,
man, vapoureth, and ſtormeth, and yet hath not the leaſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whence my writings flow.</p>
            <p>3. Yea he puts a falſe and moſt ſtrange ſence and meaning upon
them that he might thereby onely confirme his miſerable <hi>opinion,</hi>
for he hath ſpread abroad ſome writings concerning <hi>Gods Election</hi> of
us, and thereby thinketh to entangle and ſnarl us in <hi>deſpaire,</hi> and ſo
to open a gate of all lewdneſſe, and wantonneſſe.</p>
            <p>4. And therefore he liketh not the taſt of the open fountaine of
Chriſt in my writings; whereupon I have made ſhort a declaration
upon his annexed pamphlet, and have given it onely in breife to the
conſideration of him that reads my Book, ſeeing the ground is elſe
where ſufficiently and ſatiſfactorily to be found in my writings; that
men may ſee how this Carping Pamphletter thinketh to beguil, and
bereave us of the cheifeſt treaſure, on which our Eternall Salvation
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58072:77"/>
and happineſſe dependeth, and that with Cunning words by alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and <hi>quoting of the Scripture;</hi> as a Toad that ſucketh poyſon out of
honey; even ſo he<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Text.</hi> Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it about by the haire: (puls it by the eares.)</note> 
               <hi>Perverteth</hi> the Scripture; as is to be ſeen in
his deſcription of the <hi>Virgine Mary</hi> and the <hi>promiſed ſeed of the Woman;</hi>
how he therein falſifiyeth, and imbittereth the Scripture whereupon
he buildeth the <hi>Election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. At the which I am much grieved in my heart, that the man is
ſo burthened; and poſſeſſed with ſuch an opinion, which burthen is
very heavy, and he cannot get rid of it, unleſſe he learne to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the <hi>Centre of all Beings;</hi> whence good and evill ariſe; what
Gods love and anger is, and learne to underſtand the <hi>Three Principles,</hi>
elſe he will not be freed from ſuch Opinions.</p>
            <p>6. Albeit I wonder not, that my Writings ſeeme ſtrange unto
him; for there is ſomewhat New that ſurpaſſeth the reach of reaſon,
they have another ſenſe, another underſtanding then his; another
root whence they ſpring; for I have not gathered them together
from the Letter, neither learned I them from other mens Writings;
I was an ignorant childe in that reſpect, as Lay men uſually are; I
knew nothing of ſuch things; I ſought it not alſo in ſuch a way; I
ſought onely the heart and open well-ſpring of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to hide
my ſelfe from the Tempeſt of Gods anger, and from the oppoſition
of the Devill, that ſo I might get a guid and leader that might rule
and direct me in my life.</p>
            <p>7. But when this did preſſe ſo hard upon me, and my minde
forced ſo ſtrongly into the Combate againſt ſinne, and death;
and towards the mercy of God; that I was <hi>reſolved</hi> rather to
part with my life then to give in, or deſiſt; ſuch a <hi>Garland</hi> was
then ſet upon me, which I hope to enjoy, and rejoyce in it for ever;
and I have no Pen ſufficient to deſcribe it; much leſſe can I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
it with my mouth; and from thence my knowledge came,
and alſo the <hi>deſire</hi> to ſet it down, onely for my owne memoriall, and
I was intended to keepe it by me till the laſt of my dayes, and how
it came to paſſe [that it was publiſhed] you know Sir, very well,
by Mr. <hi>N.</hi> But Gods providence and permiſſion herein was ſuch,
that you and your Brother were called as <hi>Firſtlings</hi> unto it, by whoſe
meanes it was propagated.</p>
            <p>8. Therefore I exhort and entreat you for the eternall ſalvation
ſake,<note place="margin">☞</note> to heed and minde well, the <hi>Pearle</hi> that God favoureth us with;
for there will come a time, that it ſhall be ſought after, and greatly
accepted of; let no ſtormy guſts drive you to and fro; but looke
upon it aright, and pray God the moſt High, that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to open the doore of knowledge, without which no man will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
my Writings, for they ſurpaſſe and tranſcend the Aſtrall
Reaſon; they apprehend and comprehend the <hi>Divine birth;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58072:78"/>
there muſt alſo be the very <hi>like ſpirit,</hi> to underſtand them aright;
no ſpeculation [or acute apprehenſion or notion of reaſon] reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them, unleſſe the minde be <hi>illuminated</hi> from God, to the finding
of which, the way is faithfully ſhewn unto the <hi>ſeeking Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. I ſpeake in good truth and ſyncerity, before God and Man, and
appeale alſo therewith before the judgement of God, and declare;
that there is no good at all in any <hi>Diſputing,</hi> without Gods light, and
ſpirit, alſo nothing that is permanent, conſtant, undoubtedly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or well-pleaſing to God, may ariſe from <hi>thence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Therefore he that will learne to underſtand the right and true
way to God fundamentally, let him depart and forſake his owne
Reaſon, and enter into a penitent, humble, and to God reſigned
childlike, or filiall life, and ſo he ſhall <hi>obtaine</hi> heavenly power and
skill, and ſhall put on Chriſts filiall ſpirit, <hi>that ſhall lead him into all
truth;</hi> elſe there is no true way to God, but this onely.</p>
            <p>11. If it come ſo farre that the<note n="*" place="margin">The Pearle of Sophia. The Divine il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination.</note> Virgins Garland be ſet upon
him, he ſhall not need ſay any more, <hi>Teach me, &amp;c.</hi> For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>They ſhall all be taught of God;</hi> otherwiſe I have no knowledge
skill or underſtanding; I have been in my Writings as a young ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
that goeth to ſchoole; or as a ſhower that paſſeth by, what it
lighteth upon, it hits; thus hath my apprehenſion beene, even to
this day.</p>
            <p>12. The Booke <hi>Aurora</hi> was my firſt childiſh beginning, I wrote
alſo contrary to Reaſons conceit, onely according to the appearance
of light; in a magicall [cabaliſticall or parabolicall manner] I
underſtood it very well, but it was not ſufficiently explained; it
needed a more large deſcription and expoſition; for I intended to
have kept it by me, but it was taken from me againſt my will, and
<hi>Publiſhed,</hi> as you Sir, know; and I commend me into your favor, and
us all into the <hi>meeke love</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

love and fulneſſe of joy in Our
<hi>IMMAN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>EL,</hi> in his wondrous
ſweet power, with all bodily and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
welfare premiſed: I give you
friendly to underſtand, that I have
entirely conſidered of the conference
lately held; and being I perceive you
to be a <hi>zealous lover of the truth, and
Divine Myſteries,</hi> I would not omit to
viſit you with this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> ſeeing opportunity hath beene given me to
anſwer ſomewhat, upon the Article of a Perſon, who oppoſed me
in the Article of <hi>Gods Free-grace</hi> [of] <hi>Election;</hi> and I have ſent
this my Anſwer for you to read over.</p>
            <p>2. But ſo far forth as the minde cannot reſt ſatisfyed with this
little; I am ready, and willing, if it be deſired, to write ſuch a Book,
and to enlarge, and unfold it ſo, out of the <hi>Centre,</hi> that the heart
might reſt <hi>ſatisfyed</hi> thereupon; albeit I ſhould ſuppoſe that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
might finde ſo much in this little that he might be ſatiſfyed in
reference to this, and other Articles.</p>
            <p>3. But ſeing nevertheleſſe that this Article hath perplexed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men,<note place="margin">☞</note> and thereupon ſuch opinions are ſtated and concluded,
which doe ſet open a gate for all iniquity, unto the World, I am
therefore greived at it; being it is given me to know from the moſt
high, that this article hath <hi>not as yet</hi> been underſtood from the very
ground, and I wiſh from my heart, that it might be <hi>underſtood;</hi> that
we might not looke <hi>ſo ſtrangely</hi> one upon another as Men Devills,
but as loving bretheren; and the innate, dearely purchaſed children
of Chriſt, that we might walk in a right <hi>true love</hi> one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which in ſuch a <hi>conceit and conjecture, that God chuſeth one and not
another, can never be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. But if I looke upon my brother as my [owne] fleſh and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58072:79"/>
ſpirit, then it may be truely effected; which the Scripture and alſo
the Original of mankind do powerfully teſtify and <hi>convince</hi> us of; and
yet much more my Conſcience in the ſpirit of the Lord convinceth
me that I ought to love my brother as my owne life, or as my God;
what would God command me to love [one that is] a damned
<hi>Devill? no,</hi> but [one that is] the <hi>member</hi> of my [owne] body.</p>
            <p>5. Therefore for this cauſe I have taken an occaſion to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you and chriſtianly to entreat and admoniſh you, better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
this article, and in that conſideration, not to ſuffer any thing at

<hi>Name of Jeſus,</hi> who is come into this world and manifeſted himſelfe

            </p>
            <p>6. I write not this, to be a maſter over you, but in a brotherly
manner, for a mutuall <hi>Search,</hi> and recreation with you, that our
ſaith, and confidence towards God, may be ſtrengthened in the Lord
for we are on all ſides but men, and ſhould of right behave our

            <p>8. I doe <hi>not</hi> ſpeake this to boaſt of my ſelfe; who am as <hi>nothing,</hi>

that he might alſo ſeeke and <hi>obtain;</hi> albeit I ſought it not in that
manner, alſo underſtood not, yea knew nothing of it; I onely ſought
the pleaſant love heart of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to hide my ſelfe therein, from
the wrathfull Anger of God, and the enemy, the Devill; but then
more was revealed to me then I underſtood, and ſought for; and
thence I have written, not thinking to be known withall among ſuch
<hi>High People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:58072:79"/>
9. For I thought that I wrote onely for my ſelfe, and intended to
have kept it by me, even to my end; yet now it is manifeſt, and
come into many mens hands without my knowledge and endeavour;
thereupon I am urged to entreat you and others, and to put you in
minde not to looke upon the ſimplicity or meanneſſe of the Author,<note place="margin">☞</note>
or to be offended at the Perſon; for it pleaſeth the moſt High to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
his counſell by <hi>fooliſh</hi> people, which before the World are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
nothing, that it may be knowne and acknowledged that it
comes from his hand.</p>
            <p>10. Therefore if my Writings come into your hands, I would that
you ſhould looke upon them as of a <hi>Childes,</hi> in whom the Higheſt
hath driven his worke; for there is that coached therein, which no
Reaſon may underſtand or apprehend; but it is childlike, plaine, and
very eaſie to the <hi>illuminate;</hi> it will not be apprehended of Reaſon,
unleſſe Reaſon be enkindled with Gods light; without that, there is
no finding; and this I deſire to minde you of, and all tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that
read them.</p>
            <p>11. Chriſt ſayd, <hi>Seeke and you ſhall finde, knock and it ſhall be opened
unto you:</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>my Father will give the holy Spirit to them that aske him for it:</hi>
Herein lyeth the Pearle hidden, he that will have it muſt thus obtaine
it, elſe there is no finding, ſave onely an halfe [lame] blind know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
like a deluſive ſhadow of fanſie [or a painted ſound] in the
Pearle there is a living knowledge, where a man need never aske, is
it true? For it is written, <hi>They ſhall be taught of God:</hi> Alſo, <hi>We will
come unto you, and make our abode in you:</hi> Alſo, <hi>Hee that hath not the
ſpirit of Chriſt is none of his:</hi> And therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Seeke firſt
the Kingdome of God and the Righteouſneſſe thereof; and then all other
things ſhall be added unto you:</hi> He biddeth us to endeavour and <hi>ſeeke</hi>
after it; not to fit ſtill, and wait upon <hi>Election;</hi> but <hi>To come to him,
Matth. 10. and to labour in his Vineyard;</hi> and not wait and expect dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
but to <hi>come</hi> willingly.</p>
            <p>12. Seeing then I have found a <hi>wiſe heart</hi> in you, I am the more
emboldened to write unto you, hoping that you will judge wiſely;
now if any thing in my Writings ſhould ſeeme darke and obſcure,
and difficult to be underſtood; I pray ſet it downe and ſend it me as
occaſion ſerveth; I will make it more childlike, plaine, and cleare:
And I commend you and yours, and my ſelfe with them, in brotherly
union, into the meek tender love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

his truth; who deſire to ſearch with
earneſtneſſe the Myſtery, and ground of all Beings, and to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the light; thereupon I would not omit to write unto you, and
put you all in minde thereof; and withall give further <hi>advantage</hi> to
ſuch <hi>zealous ſeeking,</hi> and declare how the Pearle is to be ſought and
found.</p>
            <p>2. For I am alſo among the <hi>Seekers,</hi> and it lyeth me moſt chiefly
in hand, not to hide, or bury that which God hath <hi>entruſted</hi> me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
but to ſet it forth, that Gods will might be knowne in us, and
his Kingdome might come and be manifeſt in our <hi>Seeking and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;</hi>
and we might be found as Children of the moſt High, one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another, and acknowledge one another as <hi>Members</hi> and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and <hi>not</hi> as ſtrangers and <hi>Outcaſts;</hi> or as Devill Men one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another, as the Article of <hi>Election</hi> (as it hath of <hi>ſome</hi> beene
hitherto <hi>handled</hi>) doth give forth and import little leſſe.</p>
            <p>3. And albeit we are apprehended and captivated in the heavy
fall of <hi>Adam</hi> in the Anger, that his Anger hath indeed <hi>choſen</hi> us to
be Children of <hi>Damnation;</hi> yet God hath beſtowed his beloved
heart, <hi>Viz. The Centre of the Deity,</hi> thereupon; and hath manifeſted
it in the humanity; that he might againe <hi>regenerate</hi> us in him, and
manifeſt the <hi>life</hi> againe <hi>in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And as the heavy <hi>fall</hi> came from one upon all,<note place="margin">☞</note> and paſſed [or<note place="margin">☞</note>
preſſed] upon all; ſo likewiſe the <hi>grace</hi> came from one and paſſed
upon all; and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58072:80"/>
to ſeeke, and ſave that which is loſt;</hi> that is, the poore, loſt, damned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
apprehended in the wrath of God, and choſen to damnation;
and not the righteous, and who with <hi>Abel, Seth, Henoch, Noah, Sem,
Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> are comprehended in the <hi>Love;</hi> but the
poor ſinfull man captivated of Gods anger; as <hi>Cain, Iſmael, Eſau,
and the like;</hi> [he came] to ſeek and call <hi>theſe,</hi> to returne, and be
<hi>converted;</hi> as God ſaid to <hi>Cain, rule over the ſin let it not have its power;</hi>
if Cain could not have done this, God would not have commanded
it him; alſo if it had not been poſſible for <hi>Adam</hi> to have ſtood; then
he had never forbid him the tree.</p>
            <p>5. But being man cannot thus abſolutely conclude, demonſtrate,
and give ſatiſfaction to the minde; for it <hi>ſearcheth further</hi> after Gods
Omnipotence, thereupon there is another <hi>Study</hi> requiſite; that a
man learne really to know the <hi>centre of all eſſences,</hi> to love, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
what the eternall love of God, and what the eternall anger of
God is, which doth harden, and devour man, and maketh him to be
a child of eternall death; and how man may and <hi>is able</hi> in <hi>the time
of this life</hi> to be freed out of his priſon and captivity [of Gods
anger.]</p>
            <p>6. But Seeing that I have ſo declared, and ſet it forth at large in
my Bookes, that I thought the minde ſhould be ſatisfied; eſpecially
in the Booke of the <hi>Threefold life,</hi> and in the <hi>Three Bookes of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and yet further and <hi>deeper</hi> in the Book of <hi>the
Six points</hi> concerning the <hi>Grand Myſtery;</hi> the eternall birth of the
deity; and of the three principles of the three Worlds, ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they
ſtand mutually in each other as one, and how there is an eternall
peace and agreement towards each other; and how one doth beget
the other, and deſire each other, alſo that one without the other
were a Nothing; I ſuppoſed that the minde would therein finde
ſatisfaction, ſeeing the ſame can be demonſtrated in <hi>every</hi> Being,
and <hi>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. But ſeeing Maſter <hi>N.</hi> hath part of theſe Writings in his hands,
though not all, be pleaſed to enquire after them; if they have a
minde to them, they ſhall not onely finde the ground of this Article
concerning <hi>Election,</hi> but of <hi>all Articles;</hi> and even of <hi>all whatſoever
the minde of man turneth it ſelfe unto;</hi> if the <hi>ground</hi> be followed and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<hi>which is there opened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. My Noble heart, I pray take not in jeſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> what God manifeſteth
unto us out of his Love, looke not upon the ſimplicity of the men
by whom he doth this; it is his good pleaſure to manifeſt his might
in the weake and <hi>ſilly,</hi> as the World accounts them; it is done for
inſtruction to the World; ſeeing all live in contention and ſtrife,
and will not ſuffer his ſpirit to <hi>draw them,</hi> that they might know
and acknowledge Gods Kingdome to be <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S;</hi> therefore the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58072:81"/>
Centre of his Being, and of all Beings is manifeſted unto them;
this is done all out of his love towards us, that we might yet depart
from the miſerable ſtrife, contentions, and wranglings, and ſtep into
a brotherly and <hi>child-like Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Sir, ſeeing I have found a longing minde in you, I would not
conceale from you; that it will be a time of ſerious earneſtneſſe;
and I ſay, bleſſed and happy are thoſe that are comprehended under
the <hi>Sound of the Trumpet,</hi> that hath <hi>already ſounded;</hi> for there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

together with all Pride, Ambition, Falſhood, and unrighteouſneſſe,
ſhall drinke an earneſt draught, and even that which ſhee hath filled;
I entreat you for Eternall Salvation ſake, further to conſider of it;
it is knowne.</p>
            <p>10. I am ready, ſo farre as the minde might not finde ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in my Writings, for its reſt and ſatisfaction (if the ſame
were <hi>noted downe</hi> and ſent me) ſo to explaine, and enlarge it, out
of the Centre of all Beings, that I hope the minde ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
although it lyeth not in Searching, for no ſearching ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
or reacheth the <hi>Pearle</hi> without Gods light; a penitent hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
minde is required thereunto,<note place="margin">☞</note> that wholly reſigneth it ſelfe into
the grace of God; and that doth not ſearch, or will any thing, ſave
Gods Love and Mercy, in that ariſeth at laſt the <hi>bright morning Star,</hi>

and when this is found, then there need no further ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a Pearle as this <hi>the ſound of the ſeventh Trumpet doth open in the hearts
of many;</hi> who with earneſtneſſe ſhall ſeek it in a humble, and unto
God reſigned will.</p>
            <p>11. Therefore my Noble heart, I would not conceale this from
you; much diſputing, and grubling in <hi>Selfe-Reaſon,</hi> findeth not
the Pearle; but an earneſt fixed penitent will, findeth the ſame,
which is more precious and coſtly then the World; and hee that

for it affordeth him Temporall and Eternall joy, that he is able to
rejoyce, and be merry in the midſt of the Dungeon of darkneſſe,
and he accounteth the goods of this World as <hi>dirt</hi> and <hi>dung</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of it: Chriſt ſayd, <hi>Seeke, and you ſhall finde, knock and it
ſhall be opened unto you:</hi> Alſo, <hi>My Father will give the holy Spirit
to them that aske him for it: HEREIN LYETH THE
GRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ND.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. Let no man ſay, My heart is ſhut up I cannot pray; and if
my heart ſay flatly no, yet I will caſt my ſelfe into the ſuffering and

death of Chriſt; let him caſt me into Heaven or Hell, yet I will be
in his death, he is made an <hi>Eternall life</hi> to me; and <hi>then,</hi> it is ſayd,
<hi>None can pluck my Sheep out of my hands.</hi>

            <p>1 <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OBLE, Worthy, and honoured Sir: All
ſincere wiſhes (through the Love of Chriſt
wherewith he loveth us in himſelfe by his
<hi>Incarnation in us</hi>) of an happy, and in God
joyfull new yeare, and all bodily welfare
premiſed.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">☞</note> I am glad of your bodily health,
and yet much more glad am I, that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
how the <hi>drawing of the Father</hi> in the
ſpirit of Chriſt doth continually ſtirre up and worke in you a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
hunger after the precious Pearle of the Divine knowledge,
which (being it hapneth in the tree and growth, wherein I alſo
ſpring up and grow) doth bring to me (as from a fellow-branch
in our Angelicall <hi>Paradificall Corall</hi>) meer deſire, and acceptable
Love will; and it rejoyceth me in my meditation, that the ſpirit of
Chriſt hath yet his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> in the midſt of the thornes, as
it now appeares; and I wiſh from my heart with panting deſires,
that it might flouriſh and grow yet ſtronger; that <hi>Babel,</hi> and the
Kingdome of contention and ſtrife might thereby be aboliſhed and
taken away, that we might converſe and walke together in love and
union as the Children of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. I ſhould be glad withall my heart, ſeeing you read ſome of my
Writings, that they might be <hi>underſtood</hi> according to <hi>my</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
and minde not for a temporall praiſe, and glory to me,
which is in Chriſt onely, and <hi>not mine;</hi> but for our eternall fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and fraternity ſake, which we ſhall have in Generall <hi>one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi>
after this life.</p>
            <p>4. And I would very heartily impart to my loving bretheren my
<hi>Pearl</hi> which God hath given me, that they alſo with me might in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
knowledge and love bring in their fruits upon the table of God,
which worke and labour is more acceptable to me then all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
praiſe, honour, and goods of the World.</p>
            <p>5. And though I am in compariſon to you as a child void of
underſtanding, yet my Saviour hath beene pleaſed out of his love
and grace to beſtow <hi>his</hi> ſence, minde, and <hi>underſtanding</hi> upon me and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58072:82"/>
to open it through <hi>himſelfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> that I effectually know him and his
will.</p>
            <p>6. Which [albeit it ſeemeth fooliſhneſſe unto reaſon] is as
cleare as the ſun-ſhine <hi>unto me,</hi> and it affordeth me joy, and deſire,
that I in all temptations and afflictions from the Devill, and his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates</hi>
am able boldy and confidently to hide my ſelfe therein; and
my hope is therein ſtirred up and enkindled with Gods love-fire;
and I have as it were a fair <hi>Garden of roſes</hi> therein, which I doe not
onely beteem unto my bretheren to partake of; but I alſo deſire,
and wiſh from my heart, that the <hi>golden roſes</hi> might alſo <hi>bloſſom</hi> in
them.</p>
            <p>7. I have underſtood how that you are yet ſolicitous and troubled
in the <hi>Article</hi> about the will of God and his <hi>Election</hi> of mankinde, and
are yet in a deep conceit in reference to the <hi>Decree</hi> concerning man,
as if God choſe ſome according to his purpoſe, and ſome again he
choſe not out of his decree and purpoſe, and therefore he draweth
them not in the ſpirit of Chriſt to the Father; or that the father
draweth them not in Chriſt; which for my part hath very often
perplexed me, and I wiſh unfeighnedly that it might be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">☜</note>
how the <hi>ground</hi> is in its owne property.</p>
            <p>8. For the words of the <hi>Scripture</hi> are right, and true about <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but they are not <hi>underſtood aright;</hi> and thence commeth the
great Evill and Miſcheife with contending, and eager conteſts;
when I goe into the centre, then I finde the whole ground; there is
nothing ſo ſubtile, or profound, there is nothing that <hi>can be aſked</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the will of God but it is manifeſt therein as clear as <hi>the
ſun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. For I finde the whole underſtanding both of good and evill;<note place="margin">☞</note>
of Gods love, and anger; both deſires [<hi>Viz.</hi> of the darkneſſe and
of the light] theſe I ſet into the humanity of Chriſt, how God is
become man; and I conſider how the formes of the humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
in the humanity of Chriſt, were wholly and univerſally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
particularity <hi>tinctured</hi> with the love of God in Chriſt, with the
eternall word or voice of the deity (that is with the <hi>Divine mercury</hi>)
with Divine eſſentiality (namely in the blood of Chriſt,) and the
wrath which was manifeſt with <hi>Adam</hi> in the humane property was
wholly drowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhut up in eternall death; of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
now declareth; <hi>Hell where is thy Victory? Death where is thy
ſting?</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note>
            </p>
            <p>10. As the Artiſt, or Philoſopher doth change <hi>Saturne,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi>
in the <hi>Mercurie,</hi> (which in <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in their owne fierce
wrathfull<note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Strength.</hi>
               </note> might, is an evill poyſonfull ſource or quality) into a
<hi>Panacéa,</hi> that is into a Paradificall ſource and property, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Saturne, Mars,</hi> or <hi>Mercurie</hi> are perceived in their wrathfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58072:83"/>
but out of their fierce wrathfull Malignant property there,<note place="margin">☞</note>
is an <hi>aſcenſion of love and great joy;</hi> thus it is now alſo with the evill
man, when he departeth out of his wrathfull, malicious will, and in
reſignation wholly giveth himſelfe in the death of Chriſt into the
<hi>Panacéa</hi> (Chriſt.)</p>
            <p>11. And as the ſun in the Firmament ſhineth upon the good and
evill, ſo likewiſe the deſire of the <hi>Panacéa</hi> Chriſt (being the Divine
ſun that ſhineth therein) preſents it ſelfe to <hi>all men;</hi> if they would
but open their will, and depart from their <hi>ſelfehood,</hi> and ſet there
deſire into that, <hi>Chriſt would be borne therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. For the ſoul (as it is purely in it ſelfe) was ſpoken or
breathed into the humane body out of the eternall <hi>ſpeaking</hi> word of
the Father out of the fire and light World, as out of Gods <hi>owne Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and it hath both wills <hi>Free;</hi> out of the fire (that is, out of the
Fathers anger, which is the eternall nature, in which ſhee is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in the ſpirituall <hi>Sulpher, Mercurie,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi>) and out of the
light of the Divine power in the Divine ſound, in which the ſoule is
an Angel, and an Image of God.</p>
            <p>13. And though it hath loſt the light with <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> yet Chriſt hath
regained the ſame; and hath again moved or awakened the <hi>centre of
love,</hi> that the life of the light (if it ſtirreth up its deſire) may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the humanity of Chriſt (which paſſeth from one upon all, as
the anger paſſeth from one upon all) enkindle it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>14. And though it might be ſaid, that he enkindleth whom he
pleaſeth; yet I declare it as a precious truth worthy of acceptation,
that the Divine light is not ingreſſive [or a light comming into a
man from without] but it is hidden even in the <hi>wicked</hi> man in the
<hi>Centre;</hi> as God is hidden in the time,<note place="margin">☜</note> but it is Ariſive [that is a
light ſpringing up or opening it ſelfe from within] as the light of
the Candle ariſeth out of the Candle.</p>
            <p>15. Man is not ſo altogether corrupt [forlorne, or decayed]
that there ſhould not be any poſſibility at all left in him; and though
he be corrupt, and ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yled; yet God (when he received and took
pity on man) againe ſtirred up, and awakened the Centre of his
<hi>Love</hi> (being the true Deity which hidd it ſelfe [or diſappea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red]
in the Sinne [or fall of <hi>Adam</hi>]) in the humane Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
            <p>16. And as the Sinne and Wrath of <hi>Adam</hi> (being yet but <hi>One</hi>)
preſſed upon and into all;<note place="margin">☞</note> ſo likewiſe paſſed and preſſed the motion
[or affection] of Gods love in Chriſt humanity, and out of Chriſts
humanity <hi>through the whole humanity of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. Chriſt is againe become the heart in the <hi>Humane Tree;</hi> the
Divine Sound [voyce, or word] which hath revealed it ſelfe in
Chriſts humanity effectually, that ſoundeth through Chriſts humanity
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58072:83"/>
in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall humane Tree;</hi> and there is nothing wanting, or in
the way, but that the twig which is on the Tree will not draw the
Sap of the Tree into it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>18. It hapneth oftentimes, that the property is too much in love
with <hi>Mars,</hi> and draweth it into it ſelfe, and ſtirreth up the heat,
whereby the twigg withereth; and ſo the <hi>Mars</hi> of the ſoule draweth
wrath and falſhood into it ſelfe; whereby its <hi>Mercurie</hi> becomes poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonfull,
and then <hi>Saturne</hi> (which is the impreſſion of the lifes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty)
groweth altogether obſcure and darke; and as long as the
<hi>Mercurie</hi> of the life, liveth in ſuch a property, he <hi>may not</hi> be drawne
of the love of God, but of the anger of God, and is choſen to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
ſo long as he liveth, or continueth in that <hi>Free evill</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. The love of God offers it ſelfe unto him, but he refuſeth to
accept of it; God is deſirous of him; but the wrath holdeth dim:
As Chriſt ſayd, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem! How often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
thy Children, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, but
you would not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. The unwillingneſſe lyeth in the way; that man in his life let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
himſelfe be kept or held of Gods anger, being the wrath in the
out-ſpoken [or expreſſed] <hi>Mercury,</hi> according to the fiery Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the Father.</p>
            <p>21. Deare Brother, here lyeth the wicked Childe; learne but
to know what God Almighty is in Love and Anger; and how Man
is even that ſame Being, and an Image, out of the Eternall
Spirit.</p>
            <p>22. Doe not ſay, God willeth the evill; he cannot will or deſire
any thing that is evill; according to the property, in which he is
<hi>called God;</hi> but if I ſhould call this property [<hi>Viz.</hi> of Anger]
God; then I call <hi>Hell, Heaven;</hi> darkneſſe, light; and the Devill
an Angell.</p>
            <p>23. True, all belong unto God [or all is Gods] yet God is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtood in the Source [or working property] of the love of
the light; the Anger is in his light a cauſe of the love-deſire, and of
the Kingdome of joy.</p>
            <p>24. When the ſoule bringeth its fire deſire out of its owne ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
into the Love-deſire of God; and goeth out of its owne ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
aud ſinketh into the mercy and compaſſion of God, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it ſelfe into the death of Chriſt; and willeth no longer the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource,
but deſireth in its fire life to be dead in the death of Chriſt;
then the poyſon of the <hi>Mercuriall</hi> life dyeth in the will of iniquity,
and there ariſeth a new twigge, and budding of love-deſire.</p>
            <p>25. Loving Sir, and Brother, know, that I write not as one blind
or dumbe, without knowledge; I have my ſelfe found it by <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:58072:84"/>
I have beene as deepe in your opinion as your ſelfe: yet my
Saviour hath opened my eyes, that I ſee: I doe not ſee in my owne
ability or power but in <hi>his;</hi> as he knoweth me in himſelfe, and he will

would willingly impart my heart and love to you for a propriety,
and looke through this glaſſe out of you.</p>
            <p>26. But I perceive that I am as yet dumbe unto you, and that I
am not as yet knowne to you, in my knowledge which is given me;
and I wiſh from my heart, that it may yet [once] be.</p>
            <p>27. I intreat and exhort you as a Chriſtian, in all humility that
you would but gather your <hi>Objections</hi> together, and ſend them to me
in <hi>Writing;</hi> I will deale according to my gifts, as a Chriſtian ought,
and I will declare and explaine them in ſuch a manner, that I hope
you ſhall acknowledge me as a Brother in it.<note place="margin">☜</note>
            </p>
            <p>28 Not that I preſume to doe it from my ſelfe,<note place="margin">☞</note> but my deſire
which burnes in me like fire, requires it of you; and I (as I am I)
hope to God that we ſhall both ſo proſper in it, that God will unite
us in his love-deſire and knowledge; and it ſhall not prejudice you
at all, with ſcorne or diſgrace; for I have a heart that can conceale
Secreſie.</p>
            <p>29. I exhort you in love to a filiall humility in the true <hi>Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt;</hi> therein you may be able onely to obtaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it; otherwiſe my well-wiſhing, good intent, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is to no purpoſe; for I can give you nothing but my good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and charitable will; if you will accept of it, <hi>'tis well!</hi>
If not, I proteſt, and teſtifie before you, and the face of GOD
that I have begun my chriſtian devoir aright towards you, and
in you; I have done my part; as I am bound in <hi>Conſcience</hi> to
doe.</p>
            <p>30. I may come to ſee you my ſelfe, if my affaires will permit;
provided that it may conduce to Gods Honour and mans Salvation;
for I know many thirſty ſoules thereabouts, with whom I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
my ſelfe, and they in me.</p>
            <p>31. I have at preſent found a very pretious <hi>Jewell,</hi> which might
be <hi>profitable</hi> not onely for the ſoule but for the <hi>body,</hi> and good for
your <hi>Patients.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>32. If men would labour in Chriſts vineyard, God might even
now give us ſuch a <hi>ſunſhine,</hi> which might warme the Apothecaries
<hi>ſhop,</hi> of which many honeſt People have beene a long time deſirous;
which ſun-ſhine would boldly diſpell the ſmoak in <hi>Babel</hi> and be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
to the Children of Chriſt in their Oppreſſion, Miſery, and
Tribulation.</p>
            <p>33. But in truth <hi>becauſe</hi> men will be ſo Wicked and Godleſſe,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58072:84"/>
there ſhall be an horrible <hi>ſtorme</hi> of hail, and rain, at which the Earth
ſhall quake, and <hi>many thouſand ſoules</hi> be drowned in the water.</p>
            <p>34. I would gladly heere mention ſomewhat unto you, but at
this time it cannot be; be pleaſed to take notice of the ſtorme to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> that towards the <hi>North,</hi> is not far from it; in the
<hi>South,</hi> there is a great ſmoak, that cauſeth the eyes of thoſe in the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> to ſmart.</p>
            <p>35, Let no man ſay, when the ſtorme paſſeth by, that this man,
or that man is righteous before God; it ſhall goe well with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his <hi>Religion?</hi> the anger of God is enkindled in <hi>all,</hi> and they
are <hi>all</hi> alike unto him for all their <hi>Religion,</hi> as long as the one liveth
like the other.</p>
            <p>36. The moſt High ſweepeth out one beſom with another;<note place="margin">☞</note> but
there ſpringeth up a <hi>Lilly unto all nations;</hi> happy are thoſe, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the ſame.</p>
            <p>37. The thirſty ſoul muſt not ſay; the Lord hath forſaken mee,
he hath forgotten me; as little [can God forget] as a Mother
can forget her child, and albeit ſhee ſhould forget; yet the Lord
hath not forgotten his poor exceeding diſtreſſed and afflicted <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endome,</hi>
he hath noted her in his wounds peirced with nailes, <hi>his light
ſhall ſhine from the Eaſt to the Weſt for a Teſtimony unto all People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>38. From the South there ariſeth a Lilly towards the North;<note place="margin">Note</note> he
that getteth it for a propriety [or for his owne] ſhall ſing the ſong
of Gods mercy; and at that time the Word of the Lord flouriſheth
as graſſe upon the Earth and the Nations ſing the Song of <hi>Babel</hi> in
one Tune; for the beginning hath found the end.</p>
            <p>39. Thinke upon my darke ſayings, for at this time I might not
be more plaine; ſeeing men have onely ſought after Pride,<note place="margin">☜</note> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteouſneſſe,
and deſpiſed the mirror of Anger; and have <hi>not repented,</hi>
but have wrought iniquity with iniquity, untill iniquity devoures it
ſelfe, and the wrath of God is well ſatiated.</p>
            <p>40. <hi>Humane Reaſon</hi> ſhall here hinder little with its <hi>Conſultations;</hi>
but blow up the fire, and give further occaſion.</p>
            <p>41. God was good before diſtreſſe; but ſeeing men forſake God,
thereupon followeth ſcorne and miſery.</p>
            <p>42. Let every one have a care of himſelfe;<note place="margin">☞</note> but he that doth <hi>not</hi>

Divine light in effectuall Divine work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power, in the fountaine of Love,
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and all temporall proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
premiſed: I thought good to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
you with an Epiſtle, and to put you
in minde, out of a Chriſtian faithfull
intent and affection, of the <hi>Conference</hi>
between <hi>H. N.</hi> and <hi>D. S.</hi> about the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
purpoſe,</hi> and will, concerning Man.</p>
            <p>2, And <hi>D. S.</hi> was not ſufficiently anſwered at that time, upon his
queſtion; being I was not exerciſed in their <hi>Scholaſtick</hi> way, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to this Article in the contemplation of the internall ground,
through the outward ground; and alſo becauſe ſuch <hi>meetings</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the <hi>Drink</hi> (to which I am unaccuſtomed) do darken,<note place="margin">☞</note> and
cloud the ſubtile, and <hi>pure underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Alſo by reaſon of their Latine tongue [or Scholaſtique ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions]
I was hindered to comprehend the ſame in his ground;
in ſo much that he began to tryumph with his received Opinion;
yet without ſufficient underſtanding of the alleadged ſayings of
Scripture, and alſo without ſufficient ground of <hi>Logicall</hi> concluſions
in <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in which verily he is excellently well exerciſed, in their
Scholaſtique way.</p>
            <p>4. With which diſcourſe afterward I turned my ſelfe in Divine
<hi>grace</hi> to the internall ground of Divine <hi>Viſion,</hi> to prove the ſame;
and <hi>prayed</hi> unto the Lord that he would open the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of the
whole ground thereof unto me, that I might know the ſame in its
proper and peculiar <hi>Species.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Whereupon it appeared ſo unto me, that I (by a Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
into the wonderfull workes of God) have ſufficient cauſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58072:85"/>
and ground therein; whereby alſo it came upon me with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
to ſet downe this <hi>Ground</hi> of the Divine will and eternall purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and to bring it into a Booke; the which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
being it was deſired of Mr. <hi>B. T.</hi> and others, I tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to doe.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Not</hi> to the intent to deſpiſe any body in his Opinion, or to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to prejudice him with any unchriſtian diſgrace, or girding
taunts; but out of a faithfull reall Chriſtian affection, and brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imparting of my <hi>Talent,</hi> lent me of God.</p>
            <p>7. Which worke is ſo deeply and profoundly grounded,<note place="margin">Note. What is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Booke of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> that not
onely the ground of this Queſtion concerning Gods will may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
but likewiſe the hidden God may be knowne in his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
in all viſible things, with a very cleare explanation how the
ground of the Grand Myſtery (which is the eternall expreſſed word
of God, wherein the wiſedome hath wrought from Eternity, and
wherein all things have beene ſeene in a Magicall manner or Idea,
without any creaturall being) is to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>8. And alſo how the ſame Grand Myſtery hath brought it ſelfe
through the expreſſion or outſpeaking of the divine Science,<note place="margin">☜</note> through
the Word of God (in the place of this World) into a ſeveration
and comprehenſibility to the Creation; and how the originall of
good and evill in the Severation of the Divine Science in the Grand
Myſtery, in the Eternall Principles, to the Divine manifeſtation,
and working, is to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>9. In which the hidden God, may not onely be underſtood in his
Being and will, but likewiſe the whole ground of his manifeſtation
through his expreſſed Word, out of the eternall Powers of the Grand
Myſtery, being the Eſſence of Eternity; and how the ſame is come
into a viſible, comprehenſible, creaturall, externall Being; and what
likewiſe <hi>the ground of all Myſteries is?</hi> And how the ſame is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made knowne and manifeſt.</p>
            <p>10. Alſo therein is a large expoſitive ground of the<note n="*" place="margin">Spiritus Mundi.</note> 
               <hi>Coſmick
Spirit,</hi> wherein the Creation of this World liveth; and withall, a
very cleare ground of the internall, ſpirituall, Angelicall, and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
life; alſo of the riſe, fall, and reſtitution of man; and alſo of
the Typifications of the Scripture in the Old and New Teſtament,
concerning the Kingdome of Nature and the Kingdome of Grace;
what Gods righteouſneſſe, and his Election, or purpoſe is; how the
ſame is to be underſtood?</p>
            <p>11. Alſo a cleare demonſtration of the Line in the Kingdome of
Nature, from <hi>Adam</hi> upon his Children; and of the Kingdome of
the manifeſtation of grace in the inſpired Grace voyce of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporized
Divine Science, in the <hi>Word of Love,</hi> in the wombe of
Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:58072:86"/>
12. And then a cleare explanation of the places of Scripture;
eſpecially of <hi>The 9. 10. 11. Chapters of the Epiſtle of Paul to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
On which, reason props up it ſelfe, where a full<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Senſible, or perceptible.</note> Senſall
ground is demonſtrated by the quotation and examination of the
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>13. Yet not in a Logicall way, as 'tis treated on in the Schooles;
where they make onely Objections and Contradictions one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
contriving knotty Arguments, and Dilemma's; and the one
will not prove and examine the ground and meaning of the other in
a Senſall way in the underſtanding; whereupon they bang, urge,
judge, condemne for a Heretick, and revile one another; which
indeed is nothing elſe but <hi>Babel,</hi> a Mother of proud, haughty, grand
Whoredome, of errours and confuſion; where the Name of God
is blaſphemed, and the holy ſpirit is reviled and judged by <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
in the <hi>literall</hi> Word.</p>
            <p>14. Which I wholly diſliked of to follow in my Talent; for not
one jot or tittle of the <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſhall periſh till all be
fullfilled; and the ſayings of the Scripture together with there
types muſt remaine <hi>true,</hi> and be not contrary, as reaſon ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>15. And thereupon I have taken thoſe ſayings of Scripture which
<hi>ſeem contrary</hi> one unto another (as, it is written; <hi>God will that all
men ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and then again <hi>God hardneth their hearts, that they
underſtand not albeit they ſee it</hi>) and ſo cleared and reconciled them
together; that I hope to God, and his Children; that they will ſee
the Divine manifeſtation of <hi>grace,</hi> and underſtand it, and depart
from ſuch ſtrife and controverſy about the will of God, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Chriſt, and ſee the Juſtification of a poor ſinner before God;
and learne to underſtand it.</p>
            <p>16. which I have faithfully and diligently done towards every
one according to my gifts, out of a chriſtian brotherly heart; with
a further <hi>Offer,</hi> that if any ſhould yet ſtick in ſuch a conceit and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and were not ſatiſfyed in his thoughts; that he would in a
Chriſtian and friendly way ſet down his opinion with his concluſions
thereupon in writing, and ſend them to me; and hee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſuch an anſwer upon his Queſtions and objections, that <hi>he
ſhall ſee,</hi> that I meant chriſtianly, and that it came from a <hi>Divine
gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. Seeing Sir, that you together with your Brother Mr. <hi>H. S</hi>
and likewiſe the deepe learned Doctors <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. D. K.</hi> are my
very much reſpected Friends, and in the Life-Tree of Chriſt my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
fellow-members and Brethren in Chriſt; and I as a fellow-member
(from a religious heart) doe rejoyce alſo with them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God hath adorned and endowed them with underſtanding, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58072:86"/>
wiſedome, and other Chriſtian Vertues; whom likewiſe I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
alwayes as my favourable, charitable, and gracious <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</hi>
thereupon I have taken order that they ſhould get a copy of
this Treatiſe among them, deſiring and entreating them to deale one
with another, in a Chriſtian brotherly way, and communicate it to
each other for the tranſcribing of it, by reaſon of greater imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of my Talent, and that would be an hindrance to me; elſe I
would have ſent to each a copy of it.</p>
            <p>18. Yet if this Treatiſe ſhould be intercepted and not come unto
their hands, then I will ſend them my owne <hi>Manuſcript;</hi> and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
them that they would be pleaſed to read it over and conſider it
without <hi>prejudice</hi> or irkſomneſſe; they ſhall finde ſuch rich ſenſe and
meaning therein, that it will be profitable to them in many things,
but eſpecially in the Chriſtian exerciſe of the <hi>New birth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. And wherein I can be further ſerviceable to them in my ſmall
gifts, I ſhall be mindfull alwayes faithfully to performe the ſame, as
an obliged Chriſtian, in thankfull <hi>gratefulneſſe</hi> of their good affections,
uprightneſſe, candor, and favours towards me.</p>
            <p>20. And albeit I am a man of no repute, in reſpect of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or highneſſe, and alſo in reſpect of <hi>D. D.</hi> yet let them but for
a while a <hi>little</hi> ſhut up <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and think that it pleaſeth the moſt
High to manifeſt his wonders by ſimple people; and [ſuch as are]
accounted fooliſh in the Worlds eye; as it hath come to paſſe from
the beginning of the World hitherto, <hi>when Alterations have beene
to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. Sirs, know for certaine, that I will <hi>not be wanting</hi> in giving
an anſwer unto any mans high or profound queſtions, if they be <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,</hi>
apt, and Chriſtian; for the ſame is committed to me in truſt
from the moſt High,<note place="margin">☜</note> and given as a free gift of grace.</p>
            <p>22. The which I mention in a Chriſtian intent and affection, that
if any had yet <hi>any ſcruple</hi> in that opinion [to ſee] whether I in
love could helpe him to quit himſelfe of it, and bring him into the
<hi>Temperature</hi> of the minde; I ſhould not thinke any paines too much
to impart my gifts and <hi>underſtanding</hi> to him: And ſo I commend you
and yours into the Love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and my ſelfe into their
favour.</p>

EPISTLE. TO
FREDERICK CRAUSSEN,<note place="margin">☜</note>
DOCTOR
OF PHYSICK.</head>
            <opener>Our Salvation in the life of Jeſus Chriſt in US.</opener>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAREST Sir, Chriſtian,
and faithfull Friend, I wiſh
unto you and yours, and all
thoſe who Deſire and Love
<hi>Jeſus</hi> (in all faithfull reall
Cooperating Love-deſire,)
the light, and effectuall
working power of God in
our <hi>Life-Tree Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>
together with all bodily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
            <p>2. Upon the deſire of your
ſelfe, and Mr. <hi>N.</hi> I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
thoſe ſayings of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which Mr. <hi>N.</hi> ſet downe in his Letter, which you delivered to
me; wherein I was exhorted to expound the ſame in Chriſtian love,
according to my gifts and underſtanding; but <hi>eſpecially the ninth and
eleventh Chapter of the Epiſtle of Paul to the Romans; at which</hi> Reaſon
<hi>ſtumbleth;</hi> which I have not onely done willingly, and readily in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58072:88"/>
Chriſtian obligation and good affection with expounding thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
Texts; but I have alſo ſet downe and deſcribed <hi>the true
GRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ND</hi> of the Divine Manifeſtation in ſuch a manner, that I
hope, men will ſee the truth.</p>
            <p>3. But if there be a minde divinely bent, and addicted that can
give the honour unto God; I hope it will be underſtood, and taken
according to my meaning, and apprehenſion; and not otherwiſe
interpreted, as was done formerly; which I paſſe over, and rather
prefer chriſtian love, as we are <hi>bound</hi> in Chriſt to <hi>inſtruct</hi> one another
<hi>friendly</hi> in our <hi>ſeverall gifts</hi> and therein give God the honour, and
deſpiſe none in his Divine gifts, for he that doth ſo, he <hi>blaſphemeth
the holy ſpirit;</hi> and againſt ſuch a one the Scripture pronounceth an
hard <hi>ſentence</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Now although this Treatiſe be ſomewhat large, yet let not the
Reader account it tedious and irkſome; for I thought it of little
importance for me to goe about to prove and cleare ſuch a writing
without ſufficient ground; and therefore I have ſet the alleadged
places of Scripture upon the inner moſt ground; and ſhewne how
they <hi>Originally</hi> ariſe out of <hi>their centre;</hi> and what their ſence and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi>
is.</p>
            <p>5. For it is not enough,<note place="margin">☞</note> that I ſhould gather together a great
heap of ſcripture places for to oppoſe and contradict the alleadged;
no, no; this avariſeth nothing before God, and the truth; for <hi>the
leaſt tittle,</hi> or letter <hi>of this Law ſhall not paſſe away till all be fulfilled</hi>
ſaith Chriſt; the ſayings of the ſcripture muſt remaine true, and not
claſh one againſt another; and though they ſeem to be contrary,
and gainſay one another; yet it is onely to thoſe, to whom the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of them is not given; and are not gifted, or made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to explain and interpret them.</p>
            <p>6. But he that will undertake clearely to interpret them aright,
he muſt have the underſtanding of the <hi>Accordance;</hi> that he may
know how to reconcile thoſe places which unto reaſon <hi>ſeem</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory;
and not transfer or place them upon a <hi>conjecture,</hi> or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whether it be ſo or no; if he will teach fundamentally and
aſſuredly thereof; for from opinion and conjecture ariſeth onely
ſtrife and controverſy; upon which great <hi>Babylon</hi> is erected, <hi>Viz.</hi> the
ſpirituall pride, and Whoredome; where one will be <hi>an Apoſtle;</hi> and
yet is not ſent or acknowledged of God; but he runneth in opinion
and in the driving [or inſtigation] of the<note n="*" place="margin">Spiritus Mundi.</note> 
               <hi>Coſmick Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. And albeit many runne in the <hi>Drawing of the Father;</hi> yet if
the true light of the eternall life in the word of the Divine eſſence
(being an expreſſing or ſpiration of the holy, and alſo of the natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
word in its ſeveration, whence the creation is ariſen, and whence
good and evill have their Originall,) doth not appeare unto, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58072:89"/>
illuminate him; he will be far from being able to unite the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
contraries of the Scripture-ſayings, and to ſpeake from <hi>ONE</hi>
centre ſo, that not the leaſt tittle be diminiſhed in the Accordance
[or reconcilement of them.]</p>
            <p>8. The which I ſet downe, not to diſpleaſe <hi>N.</hi> or any other; but
onely by reaſon of the long continued oppoſite diſagreement of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
in which the World <hi>runneth aſtray,</hi> and truth lyeth Vailed; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men in this article about <hi>the will of God</hi> doe ſo judge, and run on in
reaſon and its reaſonings <hi>without ground:</hi> but where Chriſt is borne
in man, there ſtrife ceaſeth, and God the Father ſpeaketh his Word
in Chriſt through the ſoule of man; to ſuch concluſions [and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings]
there muſt be an inward divine light, which affordeth <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;</hi>
elſe there is no grounding upon the reaſon.</p>
            <p>9. You may get this Treatiſe of Mr <hi>Michael of Ender,</hi> who hath
now received it, which containeth in my <hi>owne hand Writing</hi> about 42,
ſheets; and if you are pleaſed to communicate the ſame to <hi>N,</hi> as
your good friend and Kinſman, I am content; provided, that you
tell him that he would not underſtand it ſo, as if I had written any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therein paſſionately againſt him,<note place="margin">☞</note> or any other; for ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
or affections lye not ſo near <hi>in my ſoule,</hi> without Vrgent and
great cauſe; albeit I am <hi>not</hi> without <hi>failings,</hi> and declinings, yet my
Saviour Chriſt in me hath ſhewne me ſuch <hi>grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> that all invectives
and oppoſite objections againſt me, (by one word which proceeds
out of Divine love towards n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, where I perceive a divine earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
doe fall away and are rejected as a weed, which I would not

               </gap>gly
plant in my Garden; for from thence groweth nothing but
a naughty weed again.</p>
            <p>10. Further it is againe deſired of <hi>N,</hi> out of chriſtian love, that
ſeeing upon his deſire I have expounded his alleadged <hi>places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
according to my ſmall gifts, which are knowne unto God; he
would be <hi>pleaſed</hi> (if this my expoſition did diſlike him, and were
not in his opinion ſufficiently grounded and fundamentall) to doe
me ſo much <hi>favour</hi> as to <hi>expound</hi> the alleadged texts. <hi>eſpecially the</hi> 9.
<hi>and 10. Ch. of the Epiſtle of</hi> S. <hi>Paul to the Romans and even thoſe very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which I have explained;</hi> together with the whole ground of the
Divine will to good and evill; how its originall is in man, or out of
man; and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old and declare them in a ſenſall manner,</p>
            <p>11. And then I deſire that he would declare and <hi>expound</hi> unto me,
the <hi>inſpired</hi> word of grace, <hi>in the ſeed of the Woman</hi> in Paradiſe; and
then the two lines; <hi>Viz.</hi> Of the Kingdome of the Corrupt humane
nature, and of the Kingdome of grace in the in-ſpoken voice of
grace.</p>
            <p>12. Or if my expoſition in respect of <hi>Abraham, Iſhmael, Iſaac,</hi> and
alſo of <hi>Jacob, and Eſav,</hi> did not like him; that he out of chriſtian love
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58072:89"/>
would ſhew <hi>his gifts,</hi> and expound the ground of them, that I might
finde his gifts, and <hi>underſtanding</hi> in thoſe places; and then if I can ſee
that God hath gifted <hi>him</hi> with a larger meaſure of underſtanding in
theſe high Myſteries then me I will accept it with great gladneſſe
and will love him in his gifts and give thankes unto our God therein,<note place="margin">☞</note>
and I will rejoyce with <hi>him,</hi> as a member, in our gifts, in the ſpirit of
Chriſt all which would conduce more to the profit, and benefit of
our brethren, and chriſtian fellow-members; and would be more
Godly, commendable and praiſe-worthy, then a raw contradiction,
out off affections, for mans <hi>willfull ſelfe</hi> ſake.</p>
            <p>13. But I pray unto my God in Chriſt, that he would be pleaſed
to open his heart that his ſoule may <hi>ſee</hi> into the ground of my gifts;
for truely I am a <hi>ſimple</hi> man; and I never either ſtudyed or learned
this high Myſtery; neither ſought I after it in ſuch a way, or knew
any thing of it; I ſought onely the heart of love in Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">☜</note> but
when I had obteined that, with exceeding great joy of my ſoule, then
this <hi>Treaſure</hi> of divine and naturall knowledge was opened, and given
unto me; wherewith I have not hitherto vaunted, but heartily deſired
and begged of God whether the time were yet come that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>might</hi> be <hi>revealed</hi> in the hearts of many, concerning which I
obteined my <hi>effectuall</hi> anſwer; ſo that I know very well what I have
hinted, and made mention of [in my writings.]</p>
            <p>14. And though I am therefore hated by many in the World; yet
men will <hi>ſhortly ſee;</hi> wherefore God hath opened and revealed unto a
lay, meane [abject] man the <hi>grand Myſtery; Viz.</hi> The <hi>ground</hi> of all
ſecrets and Myſteries; and yet I <hi>may not</hi> reveale all that is made
knowne unto me; but notwithſtanding it might be done unto wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
People, if I found that it were Gods will, and profitable to men,
as a while ſince a very pretious <hi>Pearl</hi> was revealed to me, which hath
its time for effectuall practicall <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>benefit;</hi> but it is alwaies a
benefit very profitable in my ſoule; and doe not ſo much wonder
and marvell at the ſimplicity of what God doth; for the time of the
proud is come to the <hi>end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. Further I deſire and entreat Mr <hi>N,</hi> to deale chriſtianly and
candidly, in love, with his gifts; and not as formerly to taunt and
<hi>ſcandalize</hi> my name; whereby the gifts of <hi>the holy Ghoſt</hi> are evill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of; and then he ſhall be anſwered in like modeſty, mildneſſe, and
<hi>reſpect;</hi> but if it ſhall fall out contrary to my good inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d hope
that I be <hi>further</hi> ſcandalized by People, or with writings, let him know
(that if I either ſee or hear the ſame with certain ground,) that he
ſhall not want an anſwere to purpoſe, in a <hi>Divine gift;</hi> and he ſhall
have no advantage or praiſe thereof.</p>
            <p>16. And I mean ſyncerely; and I doe exhort him out of chriſtian
love and obligation to anſwer; if he will not declare and explaine
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58072:90"/>
thoſe places in a ſenſall large anſwer; then let him reconcile the
contraries which <hi>ſeem</hi> to be one againſt another; and ſo we ſhall
mutually <hi>exchange our gifts,</hi> and bring them into one ground, to the
love and profit of our bretheren.<note place="margin">☜</note>

deſire the child <hi>Jeſus</hi> into the effectuall working love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
[deſiring] that he may be <hi>conceived incarnate, and borne in all,</hi> and

EPISTLE.</head>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>UCH reſpected Sir,<note place="margin">☞</note> and loving Doctor,
be pleaſed to give Mr. <hi>N.</hi> my Letter
to read over, but <hi>not</hi> this Note; and
exhort him to Chriſtian humility; to
try if peradventure the eyes of his
ſoule might be opened, which I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and freely wiſh unto him, it will
be no diſgrace unto him to love, and
imbrace the <hi>truth;</hi> for I perceive
very well what lyeth in the way, and
holds him off; nothing elſe but <hi>ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,</hi>
in that he hath hitherto layd open and divulged his <hi>ground</hi> ſo far;
and obtained great repute and reſpect among many, and this my
ground doth not wholly agree with him; thereupon ſelfe love dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
him to the contrary; whereas he hath not as yet apprehended
my Ground, and is as yet an Infant thereunto.</p>
            <p>2. But if the Honour of God and member like love,<note place="margin">☞</note> doe take place
in his affections, he hath in truth nothing againſt me, and my Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
yea they might yet better and chriſtianly improve him, but
without an <hi>affectionate will,</hi> he will remain blind in them; for <hi>no</hi>
reaſon underſtands this ground <hi>without</hi> the eternall love of God;
<hi>wherein all the treaſures of wiſdome are couched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But what his opinion is, I pray ſend me word back again, in a
Letter; <hi>his</hi> hidden ground is hereby opened; I hope that he alſo
will become ſeeing, being he hath otherwiſe a ſharp reaſon, and
hath well ſtudyed the <hi>Logick;</hi> peradventure he will ſearch further,
but if he will not, his opinion doth not abrogate the gifts of God;
he cannot overthrow this my ground, eſpecially the Expoſition
of thoſe Texts, with any <hi>Scripture;</hi> I meane ſyncerely towards
him.</p>
            <p>4. Moreover I would entreat you to ſhew me this friendſhip, as
to ſend the <hi>Treatiſe of Election</hi> to Mr. <hi>N.</hi> to read over, ſeeing he is
a curteous Gentleman, and alſo the Diſputation of this Article, came
off ſo with him, that it is not ſo to be looked upon, as if man were
<hi>ſtruck dead</hi> in ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:58072:91"/>
5. But if need require, I ſhall ſo explaine my ſelfe, that they ſhall
ſee from what ground I write; let them give me what <hi>Queſtions</hi> they
pleaſe; let them be in Nature, or out of Nature, in the Time, or
in the Eternity, I will not at all be lacking therein, in Divine Grace,
but give a <hi>ſufficient anſwer;</hi> provided that it be done in a Chriſtian
way, and not out of affections, paſſion, cavilling, or reviling; I ſhall
in like manner deale with them.</p>
            <p>6. In our late meeting I was ill diſpoſed to ſuch a Diſputation, for

               <note place="margin">☜</note> and <hi>ſumptuous</hi> fare doe <hi>hide the Pearl's ground,</hi> eſpecially becauſe
I am not accuſtomed thereunto, and at home I fare very meanly and
ſoberly; and Mr. <hi>N.</hi> was not ſufficiently anſwered; but I offer to
anſwer <hi>him, and all other</hi> that mean Chriſtianly; let them but give me
their Queſtions in writing, and explaine their opinion therein, that
I may ſee what they <hi>conclude;</hi> I will give them a fundamentall large
expoſitive anſwer, and not defend my ſelfe with any Sect or Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Name, or Patronize my ſelfe therewith, in the ground of
truth, not a <hi>Flaccinian</hi> as <hi>N.</hi> ſuppoſeth, but I ſhall ſtand in the
ground.</p>
            <p>7. For I teach <hi>no Selfe ability without Chriſt,</hi> to atteine the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as <hi>N.</hi> thinketh, onely I am not ſatisfied with his opinion, much
leſſe with Mr. <hi>N. N<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which wholly claſheth againſt the <hi>Scripture;</hi>
for I am dead to all opinions in me, and have nothing but what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

what it is; that I as a Lay, Illiterate, unexercized man have to doe

thus the time doth bring it forth, and thus <hi>HEE,</hi> who ruleth all

            <p>8. Concerning our <hi>ſecret</hi> diſcourſe (as you know) you muſt yet
be patient to goe on in that knowne pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this beginning no other will be admitted; it may well, in the ſeventh
yeare, be accompliſhed in this proceſſe; for it muſt bee opened
through all the ſix Properties of the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Ground; albeit it is
already opened through the <hi>Sunne,</hi> yet the <hi>Key</hi> is ſcarce come into
the firſt or ſecond degree of the Centre of nature; for each proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
among the ſix formes of the ſpirituall life hath a ſundry or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<hi>Sunne</hi> in it, from the ſtrength, influence, and originall of the
light of nature; that is, of the <hi>Eſſentiall Sunne,</hi> and are to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in order, as their birth and originall is.</p>
            <p>9. Firſt, <hi>Saturnes</hi> Sunne is opened through the Key of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Sunne; that the Severation of nature is diſcerned. Secondly,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58072:91"/>
               <hi>Jupiters</hi> Sun is opened, and then the powers are diſcerned,<note place="margin">☜</note> as a bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming
Tree, and hither to you are come.</p>
            <p>10. Thirdly; <hi>Mars, Viz.</hi> the fire-ſoule is opened, and then Virgin
<hi>Venus</hi> appeareth in her white robes, and playeth with the ſoule to
ſee if it might move the ſame to the deſire of Love; it goeth out
and in, up and downe with the ſoule; and lovingly accolates with
it, to ſee whether it would introduce the fugitive properties of <hi>ſelfe-will</hi>
(where the ſoule departed out of the temperature into the
fugitive life, of the divided properties of the body) againe into
her; that Virgin <hi>Venus</hi> might be againe animated [or Soulized]
and re-obtaine the Fires <hi>Tincture,</hi> wherein its joy, and its life
conſiſteth.</p>
            <p>11. For Virgin <hi>Venus</hi> is the ſplendor of the white in the <hi>Sunne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note>
underſtood in this place; but the ability to the ſhining is not its
owne; the ſpirituall water is its owne propriety, which water ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
out of the fire, where the ſeparation beginneth in the <hi>Salniter</hi>
in <hi>Mars</hi> his <hi>Sun,</hi> then Virgin <hi>Venus</hi> ſeparates it ſelfe in it ſelfe, and
covereth her ſelfe with a Copper Veſture; for <hi>Mars</hi> would have her
for a propriety; but he deſiles her exceedingly in his malignity;
and ſpatters <hi>in</hi> earth and ruſt; for he cannot have her as his eſpouſed,
unleſſe he gives her his owne fire will for a propriety; and that hee
willeth not; and therefore they ſtrive a long time, they are marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ones, but they are faithleſſe to each other.</p>
            <p>12. And even then comes the <hi>Sun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> and openeth the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
which is the fourth Key, where you ſhall ſee great wonders;
<hi>how</hi> God hath created the Heaven and the Earth; and moreover the
<hi>ground</hi> of the foure Elements; and if you then rightly obſerve, you
ſhall ſee your owne proper <hi>Genius</hi> unfolded before you, and ſee <hi>how</hi>
the Word <hi>is become Man, Viz.</hi> the expreſſed Word in the re-expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
[or ſpeaking it ſelfe forth] into the ſeveration of the Powers,
you will ſee how <hi>Virgin Venus</hi> is ſevered, and how the formes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doe take her into them, and goe about in a pitifull eſtate with
her; and take her into their owne Domination, and change them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in her, into a purple colour; they would murther, but ſhee is
<hi>their Baptiſme to the new life,</hi> in this place.</p>
            <p>13. The fifth Key is Virgin <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelfe,<note place="margin">☞</note> wherewith ſhee open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her<note n="*" place="margin">Aliter, God.</note> Gold, <hi>Viz.</hi> the <hi>Sunne,</hi> that ſhee giveth her will and faire
Garland to the murtherers; ſo that ſhee ſtandeth as one impregnate
[or humbled] then ſuppoſeth the Artiſt that he hath the new child,
but he is far enough from it, till the <hi>birth</hi> thereof:</p>
            <p>14. The ſixth Key is <hi>Luna,</hi> when the Sun openeth this, then <hi>Mars,
Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturne,</hi> muſt all forſake their owne will, and let their
fugitive aſpiring <hi>Pompe</hi> fall; for the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Luna</hi> taketh them into
the <hi>Incarnation;</hi> then the Artiſt beginneth to be ſad, and thinketh
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58072:92"/>
he hath loſt, but his hope ſhall not be aſhamed; for the <hi>Moone</hi> in

CHRISTIANUS STEENBERGER
DOCTOR
OF PHYSICK.</head>
            <opener>Our Salvation is in the life of Jeſus Chriſt in U S.</opener>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ORTHY, Learned, Chriſtian deare
Friend; all hearty wiſhes of Divine
Love and Grace premiſed: Deſiring,
that the Fountain of Divine love might
be opened through the Sun of life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, whence the <hi>Divine water</hi> ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
as I doubt not but the Bridegroom
hath called his Bride, <hi>Viz. Your ſoule,</hi> to
this well-ſpring; ſeeing I underſtand
that God hath placed you under the
Croſſe, and Tribulation.</p>
            <p>2. This is the firſt marke and ſigne of the Noble <hi>Sophia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſhee ſigneth her Children; for ſhee uſeth to manifeſt her ſelfe
through the thornes of Gods anger, as a faire Roſe on the thorny
Buſh; ſo farre forth as the ſoule keepeth it vow and fidelity, for
there muſt be a faithfull and firme Bond and Covenant between the
ſoule, and this fire burning Love of God.</p>
            <p>3. Man muſt ſet upon ſuch a purpoſe,<note place="margin">☞</note> that he will enter into
Chriſts bitter paſſion, and death, and dye therein dayly to his ſins,
and evill vanities, and pray earneſtly unto God for the <hi>renewing of
his minde,</hi> and underſtanding: He muſt be anointed and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58072:93"/>
of the holy ſpirit: and put on Chriſt, with his ſuffering death
and reſurrection, that he may be a true branch on the vine of Chriſt;
in whom Chriſt himſelfe worketh and ruleth, according to the
internall ground of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>4. Which Myſtery is comprehended in faith, where the deity and
humanity are then conjoined according to that ſame internal ground,
in manner as the fire doth<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Make the Iron red hot.</note> through heare the Iron, and yet the
Iron retaines its ſubſtance; but ſo long as the fire burneth therein,
it is changed into a meer fire.</p>
            <p>5. Not that the creature apprehends it in its <hi>owne might;</hi> but it
is apprehended; when the will doth wholly reſigne it ſelfe up to
God; and the ſpirit of God ruleth in this reſigned will; and the
<hi>will</hi> is the true <hi>Temple of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> wherein Chriſt dwelleth
<hi>eſſentially;</hi> not in an Imaginary thought-like creaturely manner,
but as the fire in the Iron; or as the Sun in an hearb, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluentiall
power of the ſun doth forme and make it ſelfe <hi>eſſentiall</hi> in
[and with] the <hi>tincture</hi> of the hearb.<note place="margin">☜</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. Thus it is to be underſtood likewiſe in the ſpirit of man, when
the holy power of God doth ſorme and Image it ſelfe in mans ſpirit
and faith; and becomes a ſpirituall being [or eſſence] which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſoules mouth of faith, doth lay hold on; and not the earthly
man in fleſh and bloud, which is mortall; it is an <hi>Immortall Being,</hi>
wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwelleth in man; it is the Heaven of God enſtamped
on the little World; and it is a Revelation of the place [Throne or
ſeat] of God, where the paradiſe doth again ſpring forth, and beare
fruit.</p>
            <p>7. Therefore the <hi>Dragon</hi> muſt be firſt ſlain, and albeit he yet hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unto the earthly fleſh, as the rind and barke on the tree; yet the
ſpirit liveth in God, as Saint Paul ſaith; our converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and as Chriſt alſo ſaid, <hi>he that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud
he abideth in me, and I in him,</hi> alſo <hi>without me you can doe nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Therefore I ſay, if any one be a true Chriſtian; he is ſo, in
<hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> he is begotten and innate in the life and ſpirit of Chriſt; and
puts on the Reſurrection of Chriſt, for thus the ſatiſfaction of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
is imparted <hi>to him;</hi> and thus alſo Chriſt doth overcome ſin, death,
Devill, and Hell in him; and thus he is reconciled and united with
God, in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>9. For the <hi>new birth</hi> is not a grace imputed from without; that
we need onely comfort our ſelves with Chriſts Merits, and continue
in the Hypocriſie of ſin; no it is a childlike inna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e grace; that
God hath put Chriſt with the Juſtification, on the <hi>convert;</hi> that
Chriſt alſo doth redeem him in himſelfe, with the power of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
from Gods anger; elſe, he is no Chriſtian, let him flatter,
and make devout ſhewes in hipocriſie, as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:58072:94"/>
10. Concerning the interpretation of ſome words (and alſo of
that which you deſire of me,) which are ſpecifyed in my Book called
<hi>Aurora</hi> (which have very hidden Meanings, the knowledge whereof
was <hi>given</hi> me of the moſt High;) I give you to underſtand that at
preſent it is not convenient to write at large and <hi>Expreſſly</hi> thereof in
<hi>Letters</hi> ſeeing the time is dangerous, and the Enemy of Chriſt doth
horribly rage and rave; till a little time be paſt, yet I will give you
a ſhort hint, further to conſider of it.</p>
            <p>11. As firſt, there is a twofold meaning of the <hi>Northern Crowne;</hi>
The firſt poynteth at <hi>the Crowne of life; Viz.</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt,
which ſhall be manifeſt in the mid'ſt of the great darkneſſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> In
the contrition [or diſtreſſe] of the ſenſible nature of the <hi>Conſcience;</hi>
where a peculiar motion is preſent; then commeth the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome;
<hi>Viz.</hi> The power of Chriſt in the mid'ſt of ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>12. The other ſignification is a <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>outward Kingdome;</hi>
where the great confuſions,<note place="margin">☞</note> entanglements and contentions, ſhall be
when as the Nations ſhall ſtand in controverſie; There alſo is the
<hi>figure, Viz.</hi> the <hi>Victory</hi> intimated; as it ſtands in the Spirituall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
how it ſhall goe, <hi>and what People ſhall at laſt Conquer,</hi> and how
in the mean while, in ſuch lamentable time of Tribulation <hi>Chriſt ſhall</hi>
be made manifeſt and knowne; and that after, and in that miſerable
time <hi>the great myſteries ſhall be revealed,</hi> that men ſhall be able to
know even in <hi>Nature</hi> the hidden God in Trinity, in which knowledge
the <hi>ſtrange Nations</hi> ſhall be converted and turn Chriſtians; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is ſignifyed how the Sectarian contentions in Religion ſhall be
deſtroyed in ſuch Manifeſtation, for all gates will be ſet open, and
then ſhall all unprofitable Praters which at preſent lye as ſo many
<hi>Bars</hi> before the <hi>Truth,</hi> be done away; and all ſhall acknowledge, and
know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which Manifeſtation ſhall be the laſt, then the Sun of
life ſhall ſhine upon all Nations; and even then the <hi>Beaſt</hi> of inquity
with the <hi>Whore,</hi> end their dayes, which is ſignifyed under the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<hi>Ra. Ra. Ra. P. in R. P.</hi> As is to be ſeen in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. We dare not at preſent make this large Interpretation more
cleare, all will ſhew it ſelfe; and then men ſhall ſee what it was, for
there is yet <hi>clean</hi> another time.</p>
            <p>14. Concerning <hi>the language of nature,</hi> I certifie you; that it is ſo;
but what I underſtand in it, I cannot teach or give another; indeed
I can give a ſignification thereof, how it is to be underſtood; but
it requireth much roome; and there muſt be a <hi>Perſonall Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
and intercourſe in it, it is <hi>not</hi> to be ſet downe <hi>in writing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. Alſo concerning the Phyloſophicall worke of the <hi>Tincture,</hi> its
progreſſe is not ſo bluntly and plainely to be deſcribed; albeit I
have it not in the Praxis, the Seale of God lyeth before it to <hi>conceale</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:58072:94"/>
the true <hi>ground</hi> of the ſame,<note place="margin">☞</note> upon paine of eternall puniſhment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

himſelfe which he ſeeketh therein; no skill or Art availeth, unleſſe
one give the Tincture into the hands of another, he cannot prepare
it unleſſe he be certainely in the new birth.</p>
            <p>16. There belong <hi>two Centrall fires</hi> unto it, wherein the might of
all things conſiſt; which may eaſily be attained, if man be rightly
fitted: Therefore Sir, doe not trouble and toyle your ſelfe in that
manner and way which you mention, with any Gold or Minerals,

World, wherein the Elementall as well as the Sydereall Dominion
doth <hi>not</hi> lye; but in one thing it is more moveable, active, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
then in another; and we cannot ſay neither, but that the
foure Elements, together with the Starres, have their <hi>daily operation</hi>
in all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:58072:95"/>
4. But being this is a <hi>hard Stone,</hi> therefore the <hi>Miracle</hi> is above
the wonted and ordinary <hi>courſe</hi> of Nature;<note place="margin">☜</note> whereupon we can in no
wiſe ſay, that it hath a naturall cauſe in the Stone; as if the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Stone ſhould move and put forth this; but it is a <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
motion from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whoſe <hi>Image</hi> is hewen out and pourtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Stone.</p>
            <p>5. For a Stone conſiſteth in three things, and ſo all Beings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of theſe three things, but incloſed in a twofold property: <hi>Viz.</hi>
in a ſpirituall and in a corporall; and thoſe three, wherein all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is in this World conſiſt, are <hi>Sulphur, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> in
two propertyes; the one Heavenly, the other Earthly; as God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in the Time, and the Time in God, and yet the Time is not God
but out of God, as a pourtrayed Image of Eternity.</p>
            <p>6. So Man likewiſe is out of the Time, and alſo out of the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and conſiſteth of three things, <hi>Viz.</hi> of <hi>Sulphur, Mercury,</hi> and
<hi>Salt,</hi> in two parts; the one being out of the time <hi>Viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the outward
body, and the other ſtandeth in the Eternity, <hi>Viz.</hi> the ſoule; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then, that Man, and the Time, as well as the Eternity ſtand in
one Dominion, in Man; thence wee are to conſider of the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. For man is a<note n="*" place="margin">Microcoſmus ex Macrocoſmo.</note> little World out of the great World, and hath the
property of the whole great World in him, for God ſayd unto him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fall; <hi>thou art Earth and unto Earth thou ſhalt turne;</hi> that is,
<hi>Sulphur, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> therein ſtand all things in this World be it
Spirituall, or Corporall, ſave the <hi>ſoule</hi> which ſtandeth in ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
according to the right of <hi>the eternall nature,</hi> as I have ſufficiently
demonſtrated in my Writings.</p>
            <p>8. Now when man dyeth,<note place="margin">☞</note> then the outward light in the outward
<hi>Sulphur</hi> doth extinguiſh and goe out with its outward fire wherein
the life hath burned,<note place="margin">☜</note> and then the body falleth to duſt, and entreth
again into that, whence it is come; but the ſoule which is brought
forth out of the eternall nature, and infuſed into Adam by the ſpirit
of God; that can not dye, for it is not out of the time, but out of the
Eternall Generation.</p>
            <p>9. Now if the ſoule hath<note n="†" place="margin">

thing, and therewith hath imprinted it ſelfe; [or ſtrongly ſet its I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination

that thing into its deſire, and <hi>holdeth it magically, as if it had it bodily;</hi>
indeed it cannot hold the body, underſtand the elementall, but
it holdeth the ſydereall body untill the <hi>Stars</hi> alſo conſume it, and it
often hapneth that People doe appeare after there death in Houſes
with there owne body, but the body is cold, dead, and num, and the

TO
<note n="*" place="margin">Carel von Endern.</note> CHARLES OF ENDERN.</head>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OBLE, Right Honourable Sir, I wiſh
and deſire unto you (from the moſt
holy omnipreſent God, who is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of all things, and the power of
all Beings) a happy joyfull new yeare,
and all proſperous <hi>welfare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Albeit I being a ſimple man, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in all my life intended to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
and converſe with ſuch <hi>high
Perſons,</hi> with my Gift, which God hath
beſtowed upon me, out of his mercy and love, or thereby to be
knowne and acquainted with them; but when the <hi>high light</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled
in me, and the <hi>fiery inſtigation</hi> fell upon me, then my will
was onely to write what <hi>I ſaw</hi> man an effectuall peculiar manner,
and knew in the Spirit; and I intended to keepe my Writings to
my Selfe.</p>
            <p>3. I ſaw well enough what would come to paſſe, but that I ſhould
eſteeme my ſelfe, as to have my Writings knowne; never as yet
came into my minde; for I eſteemed my ſelfe too ſimple; I intended
to write downe the <hi>Pearle-like Garland</hi> onely for my ſelfe; and to
imprint it on my heart.</p>
            <p>4. But ſeeing that I (as a very ſimple man) did not underſtand
or take notice of this;<note place="margin">☞</note> and yet I now ſee plainely, that Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
was farre otherwiſe then ever came into my minde; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> firſt this conſideration, <hi>That there is no reſpect of Perſons
with God; but he that dependeth on him, is accepted and beloved of him;</hi>
and he driveth his worke in him; for he is onely high, and is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58072:97"/>
to manifeſt himſelfe in the weak, that it may be knowne, <hi>That the
Kingdome and the Power is his alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. And alſo that it lyeth not in humane Searchings and Reaſon, or
depends on the Heavens and their powers; for they doe not compre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hend
him, but that he is well pleaſed to reveale himſelfe in the low
and <hi>humble;</hi> that he may be knowne in all things; for the Powers of
the Heavens doe alſo worke themſelves forth continually in ſhapes,
formes, plant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and colours, to manifeſt and reveale the holy God,
that he may be knowne in all things.</p>
            <p>6. Much more high and cleare can the manifeſtation of God be
made in man; being he is not onely an Eſſence [or Being] out
of the created World; but his power, matter, and peculiar Being,
which he himſelfe is; ſtandeth, and aſſimulateth with all the three
Principles of the Divine Being.</p>
            <p>7. And there is <hi>nothing diminiſhed</hi> from the Being of the divine
creature, in its fall, but onely the divine light, wherein it ſhould live,
walke, and be in God, in perfect love, humility, meekneſſe and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and ſo eat the [<hi>Manna</hi>] or Heavenly bread of the word,
and divine power, and live in perfection like the Angels.</p>
            <p>8. This light,<note place="margin">☞</note> which in the ſecond Principle ſhineth eternally in
God, (which is the onely cauſe of joy, love, humility, meekneſſe,
and mercy,) is withdrawne, and hidden from man in his fall; in
that the firſt man (when he was formed in his Mother of the great
World) did ſet his <hi>Imagination,</hi> luſt, and longing, upon the Mother
of nature, and deſired the food of the firſt Principle; (wherein the
Originall and birth of nature; the ſource of Anger, and the moſt
Anxious birth (whence all the comprehenſible things of this World
are made); doe conſiſt,) whereupon he is become capable of the
ſame; being, he ſtood upon the <hi>ſame root.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Thus he is according to the body, and alſo according to the
ſpirit, become a Child of this created World, which ruleth, acteth,
and leadeth him; and alſo giveth him his meat, and drink, and hath
conceiveth in him the <hi>corruptibility, and painfulneſſe,</hi> and hath gotten
<hi>a Beſtiall body,</hi> which muſt again <hi>Corrupt</hi> in its Mother.</p>
            <p>10. For he ſhould not have the Monſtrous form; the conſtellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the great World ſhould not domineer over him; but he had
his owne <hi>Conſtellation</hi> in himſelfe, which did aſſimulate with the <hi>holy</hi>
Heaven of the <hi>Second</hi> Principle of the Divine Being; that is, with
the <hi>riſing</hi> and birth of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. Now man is not ſo farre broken and decayed, as if he were
not any more the firſt man, whom God created; onely he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the monſtrous forme, which is corruptible, and hath its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
onely and meerly from the moſt outward and third Principle,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58072:98"/>
and hath awakned and opened in him the Gate of the firſt Principle
(being the ſevere, earneſt Source) which however burneth in the
great created World, and is <hi>wholly</hi> enkindled in the <hi>damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. But the right man, which God created; which onely is the
true right man, is yet hidden in this <hi>Corrupt</hi> man, and if he <hi>denyeth
himſelfe in his beaſtiall forme,</hi> and liveth not according to the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
driving, and will of the ſame; <hi>but ſurrenders himſelfe to God with
his whole minde, thoughts, and ſenſes; then this man liveth in God, and
God worketh in him</hi> the will and the deed, <hi>for all is in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. The right holy and heavenly man, which is hidden in the
monſtrous,<note place="margin">☞</note> is as well in Heaven as God; and the Heaven is in him,
and the <hi>heart,</hi> or light of God is begotten and borne in him; that is,
God in him, and he in God; God is <hi>nearer</hi> to him, then the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall</hi>
body.</p>
            <p>14. The Beſtiall body is not his owne native Countrey, where
he is at home; but he is therewith <hi>without Paradiſe;</hi> but the right
man regenerate and borne anew in Chriſt, is not in this World,
but <hi>in the Paradiſe of God;</hi> and albeit he is in the body, yet he is
in God.</p>
            <p>15. And though the Beſtiall body dyeth, yet nothing is done to
the new man, but it then commeth forth right out of the contrary
Will and Torment houſe, into its native Countrey; there need
not any farre removing or diſtance of place, whither hee ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to goe, that it might be better with him; but God is manifeſt
<hi>in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. The ſoule of man is out of the firſt Principle of God, but in
that, it is <hi>no holy Being;</hi> but in the Second Principle it is manifeſt
in God, and <hi>is a Divine Creature,</hi> for even there the Divine light is
borne; therefore if the Divine light be not borne [begotten or
brought forth in it [<hi>Viz.</hi> the Soule] then God is not in it, but
it liveth in the moſt originall, earneſt Source, where there is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
contrariety [enmity, or contrary will] in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>17. But if the light be borne, then there is joy, love, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
delight in the Creature, and the new Man, which is the Soule,
is in God; How ſhould <hi>not there be knowledge</hi> where God is in the
Creature?</p>
            <p>18. Now it lyeth not in the willing,<note place="margin">☞</note> running, and toiling of the
Creature, to know the depths of the deity; for the ſoule knoweth
not the divine Centre, how the divine eſſence is generated; but it
depends on Gods will, how he will manifeſt it.</p>
            <p>19. Now then, if God doth manifeſt himſelfe in the ſoul; what
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58072:98"/>
hath the ſoule done towards it? nothing? it hath onely the <hi>Longing</hi>
or travelling to the birth; and looketh to God, in whom it liveth;
whence the divine light commeth apparent, and ſhining in it: and
the firſt fierce [earneſt] Principle, whence mobility doth origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ariſe is changed into Triumphing joy.</p>
            <p>20. Therefore it is a very unjuſt thing, that the World doth ſo
rage, and rave; ſo Tyranize, reproach, contemne, and revile, when
the <hi>gifts</hi> of God doe ſhew themſelves <hi>differently</hi> in man, and all have
<hi>not</hi> one, and <hi>the ſame knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. What can a man take unto himſelfe; if it be not borne in
him? which notwithſtanding ſtandeth not in mans choiſe, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
or liketh of it, but as his Heaven is in him, ſo likewiſe is God
manifeſt in him.</p>
            <p>22. For God,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> is not a God of Deſtruction in the birth, [or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Generation] but an illuminator, enkindler, and nouriſher,
and each Creature hath its owne Centre in it ſelfe, let it live eyther
in the holyneſſe of God, or in the anger of God; <hi>God will however</hi> be
manifeſt <hi>in all Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. If the World were not ſo blind, it might know the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Being of God in all Creatures, but now that it doth ſo rage and
rave, it doth it wholly againſt <hi>it ſelf</hi> and againſt the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> of God,
at whoſe light, they ſhall once be <hi>aſtoniſhed;</hi> they ſhall not hinder
the Sonne which the Travelling Mother bringeth forth in her old
Age, for this the Heaven declareth.</p>
            <p>24. God ſhall enlighten him againſt all the raging and raving of
the Devill; and his light [ſplendor or glory] ſhall reach from
the <hi>Eaſt</hi> unto the <hi>Weſt;</hi> I write <hi>not of my ſelfe,</hi> but I onely foreſhew
that this is at hand, and ſhall come.</p>
            <p>25. I would gladly have pleaſured you at preſent with what I
promiſed, wherein all that is herein touched and hinted at, might be
clearly explained, and alſo what that good, and known<note n="*" place="margin">Doctor Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſar Walter. Forty Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>

            <p>26. For the gifts which were once given mee of God are not

deeds of wonder; and cauſe the faire

            <p>2. Noble, Right Honourable Sir, my

            <p>3, Being Noble Sir, you are ſo <hi>humble,</hi> and doe not looke upon,
and regard what the World doth; and alſo you doe not value the
ſubtilty [or pert prudency] of the high; but you ſeek and labour
after that which the Lord of Heaven buildeth; albeit it appeare
fooliſhneſſe in this World; but it ſeemeth good in his ſight to drive
on his worke in meane, low, plaine, and <hi>Childlike</hi> people, that he
onely might be exalted; and no man might have wherewithall to
boaſt; and you likewiſe may <hi>ſurely hope for the ſame knowledge;</hi>
which is more beautifull and excellent then all pompe and riches
of the World;<note place="margin">☞</note> for all whatſoever is temporall doth leave and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
Man, but the honourable Garland [or Trophy] of Chriſt doth
not forſake man in death; but it bringeth him to the heavenly
tryumphing <hi>Hoaſt of Angels,</hi> into his right eternall native Countrey
[or home.]</p>
            <p>4. Now ſeeing we know, and exceedingly well underſtand that we
are onely Pilgrims in this World, in a ſtrange lodging, in very great
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58072:100"/>
danger, lying captive in a ſore and hard priſon, and muſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
feare, and expect death; therefore <hi>Noble Sir,</hi> you doe very
well, and deale more wiſely then the prudent of the World, in that
you looke about you, and endeavour after your <hi>Eternall native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi>
and not after the Pompe, Power, and Riches of this World, as
generally the high and great Ones doe.</p>
            <p>5. I make no doubt, but that you herein ſhall obtaine a very faire
Garland from the <hi>Virgin</hi> of the eternall wiſedome of God; which
if it come to paſſe, will be of more value and acceptance with you,
then all temporall riches, and this whole World with all its Being
and Splendor; of which [Crowne or Trophy of <hi>Sophia</hi>] if I had
no effectual knowledge, <hi>I would not write;</hi> for of the wiſe of this
World (who onely out of ſelfe pride without Gods ſpirit doe arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
and attribute all knowledge and underſtanding to themſelves)
I have not onely poore thankes, but alſo nothing elſe but deriſion,
and ſcorne; at the which I doe rejoyce, the rather in that I beare
reproach for the <hi>Name</hi> and knowledge-ſake <hi>of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. For if my knowledge had beene gotten in <hi>their Schoole,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> then
they would imbrace and love their owne; but that it is from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Schoole, therefore they know it not; and moreover they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
it, as they have done unto all the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi>
this ſhall not trouble or turne me aſide; but as I have begun,
I will depend on my God and Creatour, with the greater earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and fixed reſolution; I will commit my ſelfe unto him, let him
doe with me what he pleaſe.</p>
            <p>7. I attribute no wiſedome unto my ſelfe, moreover I rely not
upon any purpoſe or intention of reaſon; for I ſee moſt plainly,
and finde it as cleare as the Sun, that God goeth <hi>clean another</hi> way to
worke.</p>
            <p>8. Therefore if we deal in a childlike manner; and not in our
reaſon (but onely depend one him with true deſire and right ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe;
and put all our confidence in him) then we obtain <hi>ſooner</hi>
the noble Virgin of his wiſedome; then in our ſharp inventions,
and acute reaſonings; for when ſhee cometh ſhee bringeth true
Wiſedome, and Heavenly underſtanding along with her and without
the ſame I know nothing.</p>
            <p>9. But ſeeing you have a great delight to read ſuch Writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the higheſt being, (and as I hope it is Gods providence,)
therefore I will not withhold from you what the cheifeſt good <hi>hath
put me in truſt withall;</hi> but ſhortly I will ſend you ſomething that is
<hi>more full;</hi> for there is a very wonderfull and excellent Booke begun
concerning <hi>the life of man;</hi> which if the Lord pleaſe to continue his
hand over me, ſhall <hi>clearely open</hi> what man is? and what he hath to

10. For it goeth very clearly through the three Principles;<note place="margin">☞</note> and
ſheweth the whole ground, <hi>ſo that a man</hi> (unleſſe he will willfully of
himſelfe be blind) <hi>may know God, and the Kingdome of Heaven and alſo
himſelfe;</hi> likewiſe our lamentable fall, and alſo the reſtauration in the
life of Jeſus Chriſt; and it ſhall <hi>eſpecially</hi> treat of the fair <hi>Lillies,</hi>
which God will beſtow upon the <hi>laſt World;</hi> which will be very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to be read.</p>
            <p>11. And though I know not ſufficiently the full and whole ground
what it ſhall be; yet I <hi>ſee it</hi> in a great depth; and I hope if God
grant ſo much grace, not to give over, till it be finiſhed; and alſo for
the future finiſh the promiſed writings which are now <hi>kept back</hi> by the
Oppreſſour; as alſo [my Expoſition] upon Moſes; where the
great wonders of God ſhall be <hi>clearely</hi> manifeſt to the light of the
Day; the which God will <hi>freely</hi> beſtow and afford unto the laſt
World.</p>
            <p>12. However <hi>at present</hi> all is in Babel, and there ſhall a great rent
be made;<note place="margin">☞</note> yet let none deſpaire; for as God helped the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> with Conſolation in the Babilonicall Captivity, and ſent them
<hi>Prophets;</hi> even ſo ſhall now alſo <hi>Lillies</hi> grow up in the midſt of
Thornes, and this is wonderfull.</p>
            <p>13. Alſo none need thinke, that even <hi>now</hi> the whole Deſtruction
of the City <hi>Babel</hi> ſhall come to paſſe; there ſhall verily be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great <hi>Rent,</hi> ſuch a one as men <hi>now</hi> doe not beleeve; for the
Antichriſt is not <hi>wholly</hi> revealed, though verily in part.</p>
            <p>14. Men ſhall <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that they have wholly rooted him out, and
after ſome ſorrow, great joy ſhall follow, and they ſhall make Laws
and Covenants, together with ſevere, ſharpe Articles of Religion;
yet for the <hi>moſt part,</hi> for the advancement of their Honour and
Might; and men ſhall <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that the holy ſpirit of Heaven ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
and now there is a <hi>golden World;</hi> yet it ſticketh full of Gods
Anger, and is ſtill in <hi>Babel,</hi> and the true Eſſence of the right life in
<hi>Chriſt is not yet</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>15. Alſo the Rider on the <hi>Pale Horſe</hi> ſhall come after, and
cut off <hi>many</hi> with the Sickle, yet in the meane time the <hi>Lilly</hi> ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the wonders, againſt which the <hi>laſt Antichriſt</hi> ſhall raiſe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution;</hi>
even then commeth <hi>his End;</hi> for the <hi>appearance of the Lord</hi>
terrifieth him.</p>
            <p>16. And then <hi>Babel</hi> burneth up in the zeale and Anger of God,
and the ſame is wonderfull, of which I have no<note n="*" place="margin">Authority, or leave.</note> power to write
more plainely; yet at that time my Writings ſhall be <hi>very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi>
for there commeth a time from the <hi>LORD</hi> which is <hi>not</hi>
from the <hi>Starry</hi> Heaven.</p>
            <p>17. Bleſſed is he that ſeekes the Lord with full earneſtneſſe, for
he ſhall not be found in the Hiſtory, but in true affiance, and in the

right reſignation into the life, and into the Doctrine of Chriſt:<note place="margin">☜</note>
               <hi>Therein the holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhall appeare <hi>with wonders, and powers,</hi> which
<hi>Babel</hi> at preſent in her inventions [forged hypocriſies] doth not
beleeve; yet however it certainely commeth; and is <hi>already</hi> on foot,
yet <hi>hidden</hi> from the World.</p>
            <p>18. I have ſent you by Mr. <hi>Fabian,</hi> the whole worke of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>

<note n="*" place="margin">Carel von Endern.</note> CHARLES of ENDERN.</head>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OBLE, Right Honourable Sir, my
humble, ready, and willing Service,
with all Cordiall wiſhes of Gods love
and grace, to your new creature, in
the New man, in the body of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt;</hi> as alſo all temporall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
and bleſſing for the earthly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
premiſed.</p>
            <p>2. I have conſidered your Noble
heart,<note place="margin">☜</note> and minde, which is enkindled
and enflamed not onely towards God,
but likewiſe towards his Children, in love; which hath exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejoyced me in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and I muſt in a ſpeciall manner conſider
of the true earneſtneſſe and zeale, which I know and acknowledge;
for you have endeavoured much about my few Writings of the <hi>firſt</hi>
part, and not regarded the murthering [or confounding cryes] of
the Oppreſſour, but ſought after it your ſelfe <hi>to read it,</hi> and to <hi>copy it
out</hi> with your owne hand.</p>
            <p>3. Which give mee perſwaſion, that God hath opened a little
gate [of his wiſedome] unto you, which was faſt ſhut to the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor;
being he ſought for it in <hi>Art, and Pride;</hi> therefore it was
concealed to him; for he was offended at the hand of the Writer,
and did not minde what is written <hi>in the holy Scripture; My power is
mighty in the weake;</hi> and how <hi>Chriſt thanked his Father, that he had hid
it from the prudent and wiſe, and revealed it unto Babes;</hi> And ſayd
further, <hi>Yea further! For ſo it hath pleaſed thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Alſo I am verily perſwaded and convinced in my ſpirit, that
you have <hi>not</hi> done it out of any <hi>Curioſity,</hi> but as it becommeth the
Children of God, which <hi>ſeeke the precious Pearle,</hi> and are deſirous
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58072:102"/>
of it; which if it be found, is the moſt precious <hi>Jewell,</hi> which man
loveth <hi>farre</hi> beyond his earthly life,<note place="margin">☞</note> for it is greater then the World,
and more faire, beautifull, and excellent, then the Sun; it rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
Man in tribulation, and begets him out of darkneſſe to the
light, it giveth him a <hi>certaine</hi> ſpirit of hope in God, and leadeth
him upon the <hi>right path,</hi> and goeth along with him <hi>into death,</hi> and
brings him forth to life out of death; it <hi>quelleth</hi> the anguiſh of Hell,
and it is very where <hi>his light;</hi> it is Gods friend in his love; it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth
him <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion</hi> to governe his <hi>earthly body;</hi> it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
him from the falſe and evill way; and whoſoever doth obtaine,
and keep it, him it <hi>Crowneth</hi> with its Garland.</p>
            <p>5. Therefore, noble Sir, I have no other cauſe to write unto you,
but from a deſire of unſeighned love towards the Children of God;
that I might but refreſh, and recreate my ſelfe, with them; I doe it
not for temporall goods or gifts (albeit you have tendred your kind
and loving favours to me (though a <hi>ſtranger</hi>) in a curteous and
friendly manner) but for the hope of <hi>Jſrael,</hi> that I may highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
with the Children of God, <hi>in the life to come;</hi> and my <hi>labour</hi>
which here I undergoe in love towards them; ſhall <hi>then</hi> be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed;
when I ſhall ſo rejoyce with my Brethren, and <hi>every
ones work</hi> ſhall follow him.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Therefore I am in right earneſt, being that a</hi> Sparkle <hi>of the
pretious Pearl is</hi> given <hi>to me, and</hi> Chriſt <hi>faithfully warneth us</hi> not to
put it under the table,<note place="margin">☞</note> or to bury it in <hi>the Earth; and thereupon</hi> we
ought not ſo much to feare man, that can kill the body onely and then is able
to doe no more, but we ought to feare him that can deſtroy body and ſoule;
and caſt them into Hell.</p>
            <p>7. And though in my time I ſhall receive but <hi>little thankes</hi> from
ſome, who love their <hi>Belly</hi> more then the Kingdome of Heaven, yet
my Writings have their <hi>gifts,</hi> and ſtand for their time; for they
have a very pretious worthy earneſt Birth and deſcent; and when
I conſider my ſelfe in my poor, low, unlearned, and <hi>ſimple</hi> perſon, I
doe then wonder <hi>more</hi> then my very adverſary.</p>
            <p>8. But ſeeing I know Experimentally in <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> that it is
a meer gift of God, who alſo giveth me a driving will thereunto, that
I muſt write <hi>what I know and ſee;</hi> therefore I will obey God rather
then man; leaſt my Office and Stewardſhip be taken <hi>away</hi> from me
againe, and given unto another; which would <hi>Eternally grieve
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. But ſeeing Sir, that you have obtained a longing and delight to
<hi>read</hi> the ſame, and that (as I verily hope) from the providence
and appointment of God, therefore I ſhall <hi>not conceale</hi> it from you,
ſeeing that God the moſt High hath called you, through his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Counſell, to publiſh the <hi>firſt</hi> Worke; when I thought the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58072:102"/>
Oppreſſour <hi>had devoured it;</hi> but even then it ſprung forth as a green
Twig, <hi>wholly</hi> unknowne to me.</p>
            <p>10. And though I know nothing of my <hi>Selfe,</hi> what God is about
to doe; and his Counſell and way alſo, which he will goe, is <hi>hidden</hi>
from me, and I can ſay nothing of my ſelfe; alſo the Oppreſſour
might impute it to me, for a <hi>Pedentick Pride,</hi> that I would thus onely
arrogantly vaunt with my ſmall gifts (which were <hi>of grace</hi> given to
me) and thereby ſet forth the thoughts and imaginations of my
heart for my owne vaine glory, and boaſting.</p>
            <p>11. Yet I declare in the preſence of God,<note place="margin">☞</note> and teſtifie it before
his judgement (where all things ſhall appeare, and every one ſhall
give an account of his doings) that I my ſelfe <hi>know not</hi> what is
hapned to me, or how it goeth with me, ſave onely that I have a
driving will.</p>
            <p>12. Alſo I know not what I ſhall write, for when I write, <hi>the
Spirit doth Dictate the ſame</hi> to me in great <hi>wonderfull knowledge,</hi> ſo
that I often <hi>cannot tell</hi> whether I (as to my Spirit) <hi>am in this World
or no,</hi> and thereat I doe exceedingly rejoyce; and therein ſure and
certaine knowledge is imparted to me.</p>
            <p>13. And the more I ſeeke the more I finde, and alwayes deeper,
that I many times account my ſinfull perſon too weake, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
to ſet upon ſuch <hi>high Myſteries,</hi> where then the ſpirit ſets up
my Banner, and ſayth, <hi>Ariſe! thou ſhalt live therein Eternally, and be
Crowned therewith; Why art thou amazed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. Therefore Noble Sir, I give you to underſtand in few words,
the ground, and cauſe, both of the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>Search</hi> of my Writings,
if you have a minde to reade any thing therein, I leave it to your
choyce; I ſend you now what was made formerly, when I was with
you; namely, from the beginning of the two and twentieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the End, where in very deed, the noble Corall is opened,
and my minde ſheweth me that you ſhall take likement and delight
therein; and herein alſo you ſhall obtaine <hi>a little Pearle,</hi> if your
minde be approved and directed to God.</p>
            <p>15. The reſt (which are about ſome thirty Sheets) our known and
good friend hath them, he ſhall give them to you; there are very
high, and deepe things contained in the ſame; and are very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of <hi>Preſervation;</hi> you ſhall likewiſe have them, if you pleaſe
to read them.</p>
            <p>16. And albeit I ſet my ſelfe to keepe the ſame <hi>ſomewhat ſtill and
ſecret,</hi> yet it is manifeſt, for I hear that haughty People doe deſire it;
by whom the Enemy (being a deſtroyer) might make it away;
for I know well what manner of Enemy the <hi>Devill</hi> is that doth gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
and oppoſe me; therefore I entreat you to deal wiſely and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
I ſhall ſpedily (if need require) call for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:58072:103"/>
17. And ſhortly, if God permit, more, and deeper things ſhall be
made upon <hi>Moſes, and the Prophets;</hi> and then at laſt upon <hi>the whole
Tree of the life, in the Being of all Beings;</hi> ſhewing how all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
and end, and to what being, each thing appeareth and cometh to
light, in this World.</p>
            <p>18. That I hope the fair and excellent lilly promiſed of God,
ſhall ſpring forth in the <hi>Corall</hi> in his owne spirit in the Children of
Gods love in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for we finde a very pretious pearl yet <hi>ſpringing,</hi>
not now knowne to me in the body, but blooming in the minde;
and ſo I commend you to the pleaſant love of God.<note place="margin">☜</note>

faithfull Cordiall and ſyncere deſires of

have written for many yeares; for I obtained therein ſo much grace
as to ſee and know <hi>my owne Booke</hi> which I my ſelfe am, <hi>Viz.</hi> the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God; and moreover to behold and really to contemplate
the <hi>Centre</hi> of all Beings; and to underſtand the <hi>Formed</hi> Word of

            <p>8. Albeit I, as an earthly weake inſtrument, according to the

I intended not to make it knowne unto any man; but I wrote it
for my memoriall of the very wonderfull knowledge contemplation,
and ſeeling illumination; and though the ſpirit ſignified to what
end it ſhould be; yet Reaſon, <hi>Viz.</hi> the externall man, <hi>could not</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it, but it ſaw its unworthineſſe, and lowlineſſe; and I kept
theſe Writings (<hi>Viz.</hi> the <hi>Aurora</hi>) by me, till at laſt I ſpoke of it
unto one, by whoſe meanes it came before the <hi>Learned,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58072:107"/>
ſtudyed and indeavoured, that it might be <hi>taken from me;</hi>
where then Satan thought to make a <hi>Bon-fire</hi> of it, and thereby to
ſcandalize and caſt an Odium upon my perſon; wherefore I have
ſuffered much for <hi>Chriſt</hi> my Lord his ſake, that ſo I might follow him
aright in his proceſſe.</p>
            <p>9. But as it hapned to the Devill about <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo alſo it hapned
to him about my Writing;<note place="margin">☜</note> for he that deſired, and intended to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute</hi>
them, he <hi>publiſhed</hi> them, and brought me into a <hi>greater</hi> ſtronger
and more ſerious exerciſe; whereby I was more exerciſed in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and ſtood the ſtronger in oppoſing the Devill and his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
aſſaults in the Serpentine <hi>Ens</hi> of the <hi>Earthly Adam;</hi> and did
more and more diſcloſe and breake open <hi>the Gates of the deep;</hi> [or
hidden depths of Eternity] and am come unto the <hi>cleare light;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that my Writings are both far and near read with oelight,
and copyed out by many <hi>very Learned Doctors,</hi> and other perſons both
of high noble and of low deſcent, and that wholly without my incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            <p>10. I would have very willingly imparted ſom of them now unto you,
but I have them not at hand, and cannot get them ſo ſoone at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
and it is true, that ſome Treatiſes are written; ſo that I hope

you the higheſt Peace with the hearty
Love of a fellow-member of Chriſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            </p>
            <p>2. Your Letter dated the 24. of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
I received 14. dayes after Eaſter;
rejoycing to ſee in it, that you are a thirſty, fervent, and deſirous,
<hi>Searcher,</hi> and Lover of the true ground [of the knowledge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Myſteries] which I perceive you have ſought, and ſearched for
with diligence.</p>
            <p>3. But that my writings are come to your hands and please you,
is certainly cauſed by the appointment of God; who bringeth lovers
to [that which they love,] and often uſeth <hi>ſtrange</hi> means whereby
he ſatiſfyeth the <hi>deſire</hi> of them that <hi>love a thing;</hi> and feedeth them
with his gifts, [and graces] and putteth an<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Living Sparke.</note> 
               <hi>Ens</hi> of the true fire

if you continue your conſtancy in love to <hi>truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> that it will open <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale</hi>
and manifeſt it ſelfe to you in its flameing love; and make it
ſelfe <hi>certainly knowne;</hi> but the ſearching of it muſt be begun aright;
for we attain not the true ground of Divine knowledge by the ſharpe
ſearching, and ſpeculation of our reaſon from without; but the
ſearching moſt begin <hi>from within</hi> in the hunger of the ſoule, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
penetrateth no further then its owne<note n="†" place="margin">Or, Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> 
               <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of the outward
World, from whence reaſon hath its Originall.</p>
            <p>4. But the ſoule ſearcheth its owne <hi>Aſtrum, Viz.</hi> In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58072:109"/>
ſpirituall World from whence this viſible World hath its riſe
efflux, and production, and wherein its ground [and foundation]
ſtandeth.</p>
            <p>5. But if the ſoule would ſearch its own <hi>Aſtrum</hi> [or <hi>Spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation</hi>]
Viz. the<note n="*" place="margin">Myſterium Magnum.</note> grand Myſtery [or the eternal divine nature] it
muſt firſt wholly yeild up all its power, and its will to the divine love
and grace;<note place="margin">☞</note> and become as a child, and turne it ſelfe to its <hi>Centre;
by repentance,</hi> and deſire to doe nothing but that onely which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God is pleaſed to ſearch by it, [or employ it about.]</p>
            <p>6. And when it hath thus yeelded, and reſigned up it ſelfe, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but God, and its owne Salvation; and alſo how it may
ſerve, and love its neighbour; and doth then finde in it ſelfe a deſire
to have Divine, and alſo naturall knowledge; it may aſſure it ſelfe,
that it is then <hi>drawn</hi> [and inclined] <hi>to it by God;</hi> and then
it may well ſearch and finde the deepe ground that is mentioned in
my Writings.</p>
            <p>7. For the ſpirit of God ſearcheth by that ſoule; and bringeth
it at length <hi>into the depths of the deity,</hi> as Saint Paul ſaith, <hi>the Spirit
ſearcheth all things, yea the deep thinge of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Loving Sir,<note place="margin">☞</note> it is a ſimple <hi>childlike way</hi> that leadeth to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

in remote places or <hi>Travaile</hi> into ſtrange Countries for it; ſhe
ſtandeth at the doore of your ſoule and knocketh; and if ſhee ſhall
but finde an empty reſigned free place in the ſoule, ſhee will there
reveal her ſelfe indeed; and rejoyce therein more then the Sun in
the Elements; if the ſoule yeeld it ſelfe up to wiſedome for a full
poſſeſſion; then ſhee penetrates it with her flaming fire of love and
unlocketh <hi>all Myſteries</hi> to the ſoule.</p>
            <p>9. Sir you may perhaps wonder, how a plain lay man could come
to underſtand ſuch high Myſteries, having never read them, nor
heard them from any man; but loving Sir I tell you, that which
you have ſeen in my Writings, is <hi>but a glimps</hi> of the Myſteries, for a
man cannot write them; if God ſhould account you worthy to have
the light enkindled in your ſoul, you would ſee, taſt, ſmel, feel, and
heare, unſpeakable words of God, concerning this knowledge; and
there is the true <hi>Theoſophicall School of Pentecoſt</hi> where the ſoule is
taught<note n="†" place="margin">From, or by.</note> of God.</p>
            <p>10. After this there is no more any need of ſearching, and painful
toiling [about it] for all gates ſtand open; a very ſimple mean
man may attaine it, if he hinders not himſelfe by his owne willing
[Imaginations] and running; for it lyeth in man <hi>before hand,</hi> and
needeth onely to be awakened [ſtirred up or quickned] <hi>by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>UCH reſpected, and beloved Sir; all
cordiall wiſhes of the ſtedfaſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in
<hi>Soule, Spirit, aad Body,</hi> premiſed: I
have received both your Letters, and
have obſerved your Chriſtian heart,
ſyncerely inclined in a fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlike
Love, towards mee and the
pure truth; and I deſire that God
would ratifie, ſtrengthen, and preſerve
you <hi>in ſuch a purpoſe,</hi> that you may
grow in <hi>the Tree of life, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and bring forth abundance of
good fruit.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Your owne reaſon</hi> will give you to know, that the hand of the
Lord according to his will, hath guided me hitherto and brought me
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58072:111"/>
to ſuch knowledge; wherewith I have again willingly and readily
ſerved many, ſeeing I have not learned my knowledge in the Schools
or Bookes; but<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Out of.</note> from the <hi>great Booke of all Beings;</hi> which the hand
of the Lord hath <hi>opened</hi> in me.</p>
            <p>3. Seeing then that there is in that Booke <hi>a Croſſe</hi> of the true
underſtanding; therefore <hi>God ſigneth</hi> his Children (to whom he
giveth this Booke to read) with that ſame Croſſe, <hi>on which Croſſe the
humane death is ſlain, and eternall life reſtored.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I give you (as a brother) to know, that the ſame mark is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamped
on my forehead with a Tryumphing Trophy, on which the
Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is imprinted.</p>
            <p>5. Which mark is dearer unto me then all the honour and goods
of the World,<note place="margin">☞</note> that God hath ſo highly eſteemed me unworthy man,
as to mark me with the <hi>Conquering ſigne</hi> of his beloved ſon <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. At which ſigne of conqueſt the Devill is terrifyed, that he muſt
even burſt for very anger, and thereupon hath raiſed up a great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
out of <hi>his Sea of death</hi> againſt me, and hath caſt his horrible
floods upon me; thinking thereby to overwhelme and drowne
me.</p>
            <p>7. But his violent ſtreames have hitherto beene <hi>altogether</hi> unef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall;
for the conquering Trophy of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath defended
me, and ſmitten his poyſonfull darting rayes unto the earth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Sathans phariſaicall murthering poyſon, hath been <hi>revualed</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred men, who <hi>ſince</hi> that time have turned themſelves to the
marke of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo that I <hi>ſee with joy</hi> that all things muſt turne to
the beſt to them that love God.</p>
            <p>8. The report or outcry which came unto you, was nothing elſe
but a phariſaicall revilement and ſcorne by meanes of a ſcandalous
reproachfull lying <hi>Pamphlet</hi> of one ſheet of paper <hi>in the Latin tongue,</hi>
wherein Sathan hath plainly ſet forth and laid open the phariſaicall
heart; which by Gods permiſſion is ſo come about, that the People
might learne to know and flye from the <hi>Poyſon</hi> of this phariſaicall
heart.</p>
            <p>9. And I confidently beleeve that the groſſeſt Devill did dictate
that Pamphlet, for his clawes are manifeſtly and plainely therein
diſcovered; that it may be clearly ſeen that he is a lyer, and a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer;
and it ſhall be as a <hi>warning</hi> unto many that they have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
care unto their ſoules; as this Pamphlet with us is almoſt by all
the learned aſcribed unto Satan.</p>
            <p>10. The cauſe of this rage and fury, was by reaſon of the printed
Booke concerning <hi>repentance and the true reſignation;</hi> which Booke
hath been very profitable unto many.</p>
            <p>11. Which ſhrewdly vexed the phariſaicall ſpirit, that ſuch a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58072:111"/>
ground ſhould be manifeſted; thinking that ſuch a doctrine and
life ſhould be looked for and required of him alſo: which is not well

his appearance,</hi> which ſhall <hi>ſoon</hi> breake forth, and deſtroy the works of

            <p>15. <hi>I feare not the Devill; if God will uſe me any longer for his

when you are perſecuted for my name ſake; and when they ſpeak all manner

he that is juſt let him be juſt ſtill; and he that is wicked let him be wicked
ſtill; every one ſhall reap, what he hath ſowne.</p>
            <p>16. Seeing then my <hi>converſation</hi> is in Heaven and I as to my body
and ſoul run thither, where <hi>aforehand</hi> my ſpirit dwells in <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
what advantage then is temporall dignity and honour to me? I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

God be pleaſed according to his will
to eaſe and turne away your <hi>craſie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The ſtate of my body is yet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,

it is wholly beſmeared with the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall
dirt of <hi>Aſperſion,</hi> that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

            <p>3. So wholly and gtievouſly is Sathan enraged againſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and my

me with lyes, that I can ſcarce be knowne.</p>
            <p>4. Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> covereth his bride, and the pretious <hi>Pearl</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the unworthineſſe of men; for the anger is enkindled in them
and <hi>vengence</hi> is at hand.</p>
            <p>5. I pray for them and they curſe me, I bleſſe, and they revile

            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:58072:113"/>
6. Yet my ſoule is not diſmayed therein; but it accounts it for
the Triumphing <hi>Victorious</hi> ſigne of Chriſt;<note place="margin">☜</note> for ſo, muſt man be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et
aright into the proceſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he may be made like unto his
Image.</p>
            <p>7. For Chriſt muſt be continually perſecuted, reviled and ſhine;
he is a <hi>ſigne which is ſpoken againſt;</hi> but upon whomſoever he falles,
him he bruiſeth; and deſtroyeth the inbred malice and iniquity of
the Serpent.</p>
            <p>8. Have I taught others this way? (I muſt teach it,) where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore
ſhould it be greivous and irkſome to me to walke in the ſame?
it hapneth no otherwiſe unto me, then I have told others <hi>that it
would goe;</hi> and it goeth very right; for this is the pilgrims path of
<hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. For true Chriſtians are here onely gueſt, and <hi>ſtrangers;</hi> and
they muſt travell through the <hi>Devils</hi> Kingdome to their owne home;
through the thiſtles and thornes of Gods curſe; here we muſt wreſtle
ſtedfaſtly and overcome, till we get through; <hi>and then we ſhall be well
rewarded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. For thoſe that doe now judge us, ſhall in the day of Gods
Judgement, be ſet before our eyes; where <hi>we with Chriſt ſhall paſſe
ſentence</hi> upon them; what will they then ſay unto us, will they not
be dumb, and judge themſelves, even as they judge us now; ah that
they could but conſider of it here, and <hi>now defiſt</hi> and returne from
it.</p>
            <p>11. I deſire that God would have mercy upon them, for they
know not what they doe;<note place="margin">☞</note> they are in <hi>greater</hi> miſery then thoſe
whom they perſecute; they are poore impriſoned <hi>Captives</hi> and ſlaves
<hi>of the Devill,</hi> who doth ſo infect, torment, and poyſon them, that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is their life.</p>
            <p>12. And therefore they rejoyce, that they bring forth the thornes
and thiſtles of the Devill; namely <hi>fruits in Gods anger,</hi> of which the
Children of Chriſt whom they perſecute and drive towards their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Countrey, ought well to conſider; that they pray unto God for
redemption, not onely for themſelves, but likewiſe for theſe, their
miſerable poore captivated, and impriſoned fellow-members; that
God would likewiſe <hi>illuminate them,</hi> and bring them home.</p>
            <p>13. Deare brother it is now a time of great earneſtneſſe, let us
not ſleep; for <hi>the Bridegrome paſſeth by and inviteth his Marriage gueſts,</hi>
he that <hi>heares it</hi> he goeth along with him to the Marriage.</p>
            <p>14. But he that refuſeth; and will ſleep onely in <hi>the luſt of the
fleſh;</hi> he ſhall be exceedingly ſorry and grieved, that he hath ſlept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<hi>ſuch a time of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. It ſeemeth ſtrange unto the <hi>World,</hi> that ſuch ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, whom the ſcribes [the learned Preiſts, and Phariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es]
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58072:113"/>
doe contemne and perſecute; and it looks not back to conſider
what the learned did unto the Prophetes; Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and
their Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>16. But the preſent Chriſtendome,<note place="margin">☞</note> is meerly Titular and verball
[formall and hyſtoricall onely ſticking to the lip-labour and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
hypocricy of the mouth] <hi>the heart is worſe</hi> then when they were
<hi>Heathens;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> let us ſeriouſly conſider of it, and not amuſe our ſelves
with them; that a <hi>ſeed</hi> may remaine upon the earth; and that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> may not alwaies be uſed onely as a covering [for the cunning
hypocricy of iniquity.]</p>
            <p>17. Let us <hi>exhort,</hi> and comfort one another, that we may hold out
in patience; (for there cometh yet a great ſtorme of affliction, and
Tribulation;) that we may perſevere and ſtand ſtedfaſt.</p>
            <p>18. For Chriſtianity conſiſts not onely in words and knowledge,
but in <hi>power;</hi> [what are the preſent contentions about, but onely
the conjecturall knowledge, [mentall Idolls, phantaſticall Images
and opinions of men] they wrangle and jangle in notions, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
[which they have blindly perſwaded their minde and
Conſcience to adore] <hi>but they deny the power</hi> [of Chriſtianity.]</p>
            <p>19. But there cometh a time of tryall, where it will be ſeen
what their<note n="*" place="margin">Text, Images [or mentall Idolls.]</note> 
               <hi>opinions</hi> have been [and what their <hi>formall Church-wayes
of worſhip</hi> and blind Cain-ike hypocrycy have been] and now they
have ſtuck unto them; when they ſhall fall from one opinion unto
another, and yet have no reſt or undoubted ſtayedneſſe.</p>
            <p>20. Ah; their opinions are nothing but the <hi>Heatheniſh Idols;</hi> as
they were, before they had the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>21. The Learned,<note place="margin">☞</note> and Rulers ſeeke nothing but their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
ambition and honour therein;<note place="margin">Note</note> and they have ſet them up in
<hi>Chriſts</hi> ſtead; but they are onely <hi>Opinion-pedlers,</hi> [Sellers of Images
and mentall Idols, the internall ſuperſtitious reliques of their owne
reaſon, Babyloniſh imaginations] which they ſell [or reach] for
Money; and he that giveth them much; he ſhall have <hi>devout Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations</hi>

From
JACOB BEHMEN. Written from DRESDEN to
GERLITZ, in the Time of
his Perſecution; Dated <date>the
13. of June, 1624.</date> TO
Doctor KOBERN.</head>
            <head type="sub">Immanuel.</head>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y very deare sir, and Chriſtian Brother; I heartily
deſire the continuall working of the Love of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt in you, that your Tree of Pearle may
grow great <hi>under the Croſſe</hi> of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, in ſuch ſtirring and exerciſe; and that we
may all in that power, withſtand in the Faith and in the meekneſſe
of Chriſt, the wrathfull enemy of Chriſt, which at preſent roareth
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58072:115"/>
like a raging Lyon;<note place="margin">☞</note> and ſetteth himſelfe mighty againſt Jeſus and his
Children; <hi>that we may with Paul fight a good fight,</hi> and at length get the
prize, <hi>Our Salvation,</hi> thereby; and not for temporall honour and
pleaſure ſake, deny Chriſt in the Truth once acknowledged; it
would be very hard to recover it againe.</p>
            <p>2. For my part, I thanke God in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that he hath ſigned
me <hi>with his Markes,</hi> and dayly maketh me like unto his Image;
whom I pray, that I may continue ſtedfaſt; alſo that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
my Enemies from the abominable death of Eternall horrour,
wherein at preſent they lye captivated, and know it not; and bring
them alſo <hi>into the light,</hi> that they may know <hi>this way,</hi> and come into
our Eternall Fraternity.</p>
            <p>3. Yet to ſpeake judiciouſly of theſe things, we certainely ſee
before our eyes, that this way is wholly oppoſite to the Devill; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he rageth ſo much againſt it without cauſe; it is indeed a very
great wonder, that he ſhould make ſo great a ſtirre againſt ſo ſmall
<hi>a piece of Devotion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> ſure it muſt needes not reliſh, but ſavour ill
with him; wheras there are many greater Bookes, full of Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Folly, and <hi>partly</hi> of Idolatry, to be found, which he doth
not oppoſe; but his ſpite is <hi>onely againſt</hi> the Way to Chriſt, <hi>that none
might walke</hi> in that way.</p>
            <p>4. For at this very time <hi>eſpecially,</hi> hee thinketh to ſet up his
Kingdome powerfully, and yet he ſeeth at preſent that it hath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in it every where: For the Aſſaylant breaketh in hither from
many Quarters,<note place="margin">Note, This fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Authors Death.</note> eſpecially from the <hi>North,</hi> and we can doe no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at preſent, then not to regard this Enemy, but overcome him
with <hi>Patience</hi> under the Croſſe of Chriſt, with earneſt <hi>Repentance,</hi>
and ſo at length he will become feeble and faint, and this Firebrand
will have an end.</p>
            <p>5. For he is but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fiery flaſh of Gods Anger,<note n="*" place="margin">Gregory Rickter, the Primate of Garlitz. ☞</note> which muſt bee
<hi>quencht</hi> with Divine Love and humility; wee muſt in no way add
fuell to it, to make it burne; but kill it with Chriſts <hi>Victory;</hi> as
Chriſt with his Love overcame the wrath of God and Hell, and
bruiſed Death, and mightily ruled over all his Enemies; and then
ſuch Enemies in the Anger of God, <hi>ſhall not long</hi> prevaile; as
Chriſt hath taught us, that we ſhould <hi>feed our Enemies</hi> with Meate
and Drinke, and <hi>rejoyce</hi> when they <hi>afflict</hi> us for his ſake; our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>6. It is not good,<note place="margin">The temporall Sword, or make War.</note> out of our owne ſelfe purpoſe, to uſe a
† <hi>Worldly Sword,</hi> or Weapon againſt ſuch an enemy of Chriſt; for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o he would be but the ſtronger; but with <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> we
ſhall well overcome him: I regard not his unjuſt<note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
               </note> revilings; I have
a good Conſcience concerning him; the time is comming apace,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58072:115"/>
that ſuch an Enemy will be cut in pieces <hi>by the Sword</hi> of Gods
power.</p>
            <p>7. It is fit we ſhould conſider the Time; for Babel burneth in
the whole World; and there is woe in every Street; onely men
ſee it not yet; but are <hi>blinde</hi> concerning it.</p>
            <p>8. I give you very great thankes for your Brotherly faithfulneſſe
and Chriſtian care,<note place="margin">☞</note> in that you have taken of my Wife, ſome things
into your keeping; if the High Prieſt will needs aſſault my Houſe,
let him doe it, that it may be knowne in all Countries, what a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of <hi>uproares</hi> he is; it will tend much to the honour of him and
his; he will get a great deale of credit in the <hi>Electorall Counſell,</hi>
for having ſtormed my Houſe by his truſty Officers, and broken the
Windows; if others ſhould doe, or cauſe ſuch a thing, the <hi>Counſell</hi>
would not ſuffer them in the City.</p>
            <p>9. Therefore I much marvell that they make ſuch an uproare in
<hi>Gerlitz,</hi> and without cauſe, occaſion the raiſing ſuch a<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or,</hi> Evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port concerning the City.</note> Clamour
abroad againſt the City, if the ground ſhould be enquired after,
it will ſound but odly; nevertheleſſe it muſt be ſo; <hi>for the time is
Borne:</hi> there will <hi>ſuddenly</hi> come ſomewhat elſe; this is but a ſigne,
Type, or Figure; ſeeing they have ſo ſolemnely celebrated <hi>the</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">The day of Pentecoſt.</note> 
               <hi>Feaſt of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> therefore he muſt needs powerfully aſſiſt
them; whereby it may be very well diſcerned, what ſpirit they are
the Children of, which Spirit they ſerve; and this will give us <hi>ſo
much the more cauſe</hi> to avoyd them: I ſuppoſe it is loathſome enough,
it ſtinketh of Phariſaicall Pitch, and Helliſh Soot: O that God
would once have pitty on the ſimple people, who are <hi>ſo very blinde</hi>
and doe pull downe the judgement of God upon <hi>themſelves;</hi> which
will ſhortly be poured forth.</p>
            <p>10. Their ſtability is very well ſeene; that which they approve
of at one time, the ſame they diſallow at another time: O if ſome
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſhould come, and <hi>remand</hi> the Church from <hi>Luther</hi> againe;
what good <hi>Papiſts</hi> would they make.</p>
            <p>11. But let it goe as it doth; <hi>Silence</hi> is beſt: they hunt after a
Gnat,<note place="margin">☜</note> and thinke they have caught Veniſon; but there lyeth couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a <hi>ſmall Graine of Muſtard ſeed</hi> of the Croſſe, in it, which put
Chriſt to death, <hi>that</hi> ſhall burſt their Guts, and grow to be <hi>a great
Tree,</hi> and this none can reſiſt.</p>
            <p>12. My Wife need not cauſe any Window-ſhuts to be made; if
they will breake them, they may; and then the fruits of the High
Prieſt will be ſeene; let her have a little Patience: if ſhee can not
get a place in <hi>Gerlitz,</hi> I will get a place for her ſome where elſe,
where ſhee ſhall have quiet enough; but let her ſtay within at home
and not goe out, except upon neceſſity, and let the Enemy rage, he
will not eate her up.</p>
