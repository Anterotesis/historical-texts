         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving peruſed the Book by You newly publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under this Title,</hi> The Reaſons preſented by the Diſſenting Brethren againſt certain Propoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Presbyteriall Government, And the Proofs of them voted by the Aſſembly of Divines ſitting by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament at Westminster, Together with the Anſwer of the Aſſembly of Divines to thoſe Reaſons of Diſſent; <hi>I congratulate your happineſſe in being Midwife to ſuch a Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit I am bold to deſire ſatisfaction in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in your Title page, as alſo in that later peece touching <hi>Accommodation,</hi> upon which all mens eyes (you know) will, in this juncture of time, be moſt intent, and in which more care and faithfulneſſe would well become ſuch an eminent Scribe: hoping your candor and ingenuity will be my ſhelter againſt all impotent paſſions that might raiſe a ſtorm againſt me in your breaſt.</p>
            <p>The Title-page ſeems to hold out the Trophees of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters over the Aſſembly (not unlike that of <hi>Aeneas</hi> over <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zentius</hi> in his triumphant addreſſe to <hi>Mars)</hi> in large Capitals, THE REASONS <hi>preſented by the Diſſenting</hi> BRETHREN <hi>againſt</hi> CERTAIN PROPOSITIONS <hi>concerning</hi> PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTERIALL GOVERNMENT, &amp;c. <hi>Scilicet.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Mezenti Ducis exitvias tibi magne tropaeum</l>
                  <l>Bellipotens, aptat rorantes ſanguine criſtas: &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
But the <hi>Anſwer</hi> of the Aſſembly comes after in a leſſer Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and lower rank, having but two lines allowed it at the bottom, where it ſits at the foot of that gorgeous Title, upon a little tripod not half an inch broad, like a petty in the School, that needs a Feſcue.</p>
            <p>Now verily, I ſhould have thought it more honour for the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to have led the round, and that the Title-page ſhould have ran thus, THE ANSWER <hi>of the</hi> ASSEMBLY <hi>of</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:161721:3"/>
DIVINES <hi>to the</hi> REASONS <hi>of the</hi> DISSENTING BRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THREN, &amp;c. who being but 7. might better have been thruſt into the Trundle-bed of the two laſt lines; then 50. or 60. men. This, in my poore conceit, (at which perhaps your Beard will ſmile, to the hazard of a drie exhalation from beneath) had better preſerved the reputation of the Aſſembly, if that had been your care.</p>
            <p>Men ſpeak it out aloud, that Mr. <hi>Byfeild</hi> is become, if not a down-right <hi>Independant,</hi> yet, a ſtrenuous <hi>Agitator</hi> for that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that he had not kept ſuch an Antichriſtian thing as a Vicaredge thus long, after his illumination, but for the acceſſion procured for him, while he was Probationer, by the Grandees of the Time. So that I much fear, the world will, by this Title page (which doth ſo extreamly caſt the ſcale for the Independents,) be much confirmed in that opinion of you.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, <hi>It is meet that their Reaſons which were firſt offered to the ASSEMBLY, ſhould be firſt ſet down:</hi> True, in the body of the Book, but this is no reaſon why the Aſſembly ſhould not have the upper ſide, in the Title-page. No man, publiſhing an Anſwer to Another, but in the Frontiſpice he firſt gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Anſwer, if he think it hath the better of his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt; as I think you once thought of the <hi>Anſwers</hi> of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> to thoſe Troublers of it.</p>
            <p>If you tell me, <hi>The Printer or Stationer had the ordering of that Title,</hi> I think you dare not adventure to ſay ſo in the light, leſt it ſhould bring up ſo much blood into your face as would proclaim the falſhood of ſuch a poore excuſe. What Publiſher of a book is ſo long in travail with any page of it, as with the <hi>Title?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you plead <hi>the Order of the Lords, which directs to that method:</hi> I ſay, 1. That if your fellow Convert <hi>John Brown,</hi> and you had ſo pleaſed, the ſenſe of the Lords might have been ſo drawn up, as the honour of the Aſſembly might have been better conſulted or provided for. 2. I do not find you, in ought elſe, ſo punctuall in keeping to their order. They ſay, <hi>The Reaſons againſt the third Propoſition,</hi> &amp;c. You ſay, <hi>againſt certain Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> They ſay, (in reference to that third Propoſition, as you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161721:3"/>
were (ſay ſome of credit) told openly in the Aſſembly) <hi>as well thoſe formerly printed for the uſe of the Houſes, as any other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reaſons and Anſwers never formerly printed.</hi> But you ſay in effect, <hi>Reaſons</hi> againſt other <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> as well as againſt that third: for, you do accordingly publiſh them. And although you have been obſerved lately to ſolicite ſome Lords for an inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at leaſt for an explanation of that their <hi>Order,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you could not prevail: yet have you printed all the reſt; for which, I thank you: onely this I ſay, that it is not for you to anſwer me in the point now between us, that you ſo draw up the Title, becauſe you would be punctuall in keeping cloſe to the Lords Order; for you have tranſgreſſed it in a far greater matter. Shall I tell you what ſome conjecture to be the cauſe of ſuch a tranſgreſſion? They ſay, you cannot forget how much time thoſe 7. men (eſpecially that brazen fac'd peece of impudence, that Proteſtant Jeſuite, that <hi>Antilogorum P<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tifex maximus,</hi> your dear Brother <hi>Philip)</hi> took up in the <hi>Aſſembly;</hi> and that had it not been for that paſſionate and inflexible <hi>D. B.</hi> his endeavours to put a period to thoſe debates, tis verily beleeved thoſe 7. Apocryphal Brethren would have held the Aſſembly till this time, in going over and over, and a 1000. times over, the ſame things again. Therefore you thought fit to give them ſo much roome in your forebox, in regard they took up ſo much time, and would willingly have taken more, in your Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>I hope it may be pardoned, if ſome other man beſide <hi>T. R.</hi> and <hi>E. M.</hi> ſhall print ſome peece thereof better then they have done, although not authorized by M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Harwards</hi> Husband, who received no power from you to impower <hi>T. R.</hi> and <hi>E. M.</hi> to do what they have done herein already. And how comes it to paſſe, that you have agreed to wipe the noſes of the other two Scribes of the Aſſembly with one ſingle Book apeece? I have been told, that they took ten times more pains in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Copies for the Parliament, in entring the Originals into your Books, &amp;c. then you have done. But if they be your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (as men ſay they be) 'tis not unfit the Maſter ſhould take the benefit of their work, till they be out of their time.</p>
            <p>For my part, I could not, for a while, ſatisfie my ſelf, why
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161721:4"/>
you ſhould thus deal with your fellow Scribes, till I was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed of the Reaſons, which, if true, are of ſome weight. If they be falſe, I pray undeceive me, becauſe I had them from ſuch hands, as I am apt, at preſent, to beleeve them.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Byfeild</hi> hath a lean Vicaredge (the very houſe whereof coſt him more, then the whole is worth) and he was to make uſe of ſuch friends to procure an Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as were likely to carry it. Hereupon he had the wit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to Mr. Solicitor, who by good hap had a Mayd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant to put off to a young Stationer, who had as little to begin with as the Mayd, perhaps leſſe. The Sollicitor was willing to gratifie Mr. <hi>Byfeild</hi> in his ſuit, if Mr. <hi>Byfeild</hi> could finde out any thing in the Aſſembly, that might be beneficiall to <hi>Harward.</hi> Mr. <hi>Byfeild</hi> told him, there was nothing in the Aſſembly, unleſſe thoſe <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and <hi>Anſwers,</hi> and <hi>Papers,</hi> ſince by him publiſhed. Hereupon, the <hi>Solicitor</hi> ſeconded Mr. <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feilds</hi> Petition which was preferred in the Houſe of Commons by the new German Biſhop of <hi>Foolham;</hi> whereby an 100 li. <hi>per annum</hi> was ſetled on Mr. <hi>Byfeld:</hi> and the other buſineſſe was ſo diſcreetly managed, that the Lords made an Order for printing of theſe things now made publick. And there went the Hare away from the other two Scribes. Howbeit, Mr. <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi> can plead that he received not one penny from the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. And Mr. <hi>Harward,</hi> they ſay, can make it out, that he received ſomewhat elſe with his wife, beſide this Copy: and ſo I ſee not why all parties ſhould not be well pleaſed: for, they muſt be.</p>
            <p>But truly, truly, Sir, your faith is much queſtioned in the buſineſſe of the <hi>Accommodation Papers.</hi> For my part, this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies me, that you do not atteſt them as you do the reſt, with a <hi>Concordat cum Originali:</hi> nor indeed could you do otherwiſe, you being no Scribe to that Committee, nor alwayes preſent at the Debates and Orders made therein: nor Honeſt <hi>Jeremy</hi> neither, who had little skill what was rightly reported, and what not, he being no Member of that Committee, if your enumeration of the Divines at pag. the 13th. be full.</p>
            <p>Nor could you get any authentick originall, but were fain to run up and down among your new friends to get here a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:161721:4"/>
paper and there a paper to patch up ſomething, as it pleaſe the friends to the Diſſenters Cauſe to furniſh you; by means whereof divers things are wholly omitted, and others man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, which makes the whole very imperfect, and unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to ſuch as have had the happineſſe to be acquainted with all the paſſages of that tranſaction.</p>
            <p>That I may give you a taſte, turn to page 17. of thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, where you ſhall find theſe two groſſe ſlips, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Your Copy runs thus, <hi>This Paper being read, and the day</hi> (you would have ſaid, a good part of the night) <hi>ſpent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining</hi> of it. And ſo you paſſe on to the Order made in the cloſe of that meeting, paſſing over all thoſe <hi>explanations</hi> about which ſo much time was ſpent. But Sir, the Diſſenters did themſelves at laſt explain ſundrie ambiguous termes of their Paper then given in, which explanations were taken <hi>ſillabice</hi> in writing, at that time, and after they had been read to them, and owned by them, were to be kept by the Chairman, and are ſtill extant. But the Independents had no reaſon to deſire the publiſhing of thoſe <hi>explanations</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">They exclude all but their own gang which would, if known, make them a lean company.</note>: therefore, herein you had reaſon to ſuppreſſe them, in caſe you had them by you. But, we hope, one day to ſee them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You ſet down that <hi>Order</hi> of the Committee, <hi>Decemb:</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1945. thus.</p>
            <p>It was Ordered that the reſt of the Divines, Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, be made a Sub-committee to conſider of the Paper of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren, given in, and to meet firſt between themſelves, then with the Diſſenting Brethren, and to prepare ſomewhat againſt the next meeting of this Committee, &amp;c. <hi>But here you groſly mutulate.

            <p>Sure I am, there was a noiſe all over the Town at that time, that when the Sub-Committee of Divines that were to draw an Anſwer to that Paper, preſented their thoughts of it to the Committee, at their next ſitting, <hi>Dec:</hi> 15. (as you quote the time) the Diſſenters fell a cavilling at the Sub-Committee for bringing in an Anſwer, before they had <hi>met with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But, if I ſhould here adde any more, I ſhould exceed the bounds of a private Letter.
