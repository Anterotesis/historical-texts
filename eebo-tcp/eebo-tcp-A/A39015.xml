            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Eometry is a Greek word, which in its proper ſignification telleth us of no other thing then Meaſuring of the Earth; Nevertheleſs, by this word we are to underſtand the Principal Part of the Mathematicks, which is a Science that hath for its Object Quantity continued.</p>
            <p>A continued Quantity is that whereof all the Parts are joined together, as are all ſorts of Extenſions, of Greatneſs, and of Dimenſions.</p>
            <p>And theſe Dimenſions conſiſt principally either in Lines, Angles, Superficies, or Bodies, which are to be conſidered, not according to the Qualitie of the Matter, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Extenſion of the Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geometry</hi> is divided into the Theorick and the Practick. The Theorick is the Science which cauſeth us to conceive and demonſtrate the truth of Geometrical Propoſitions. And the Practick is the Art which guideth the hand in its Operation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geometry</hi> had its beginning amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which were compelled to invent it, for to remedie the diſorder that hapned ordinarilie within their Grounds, by the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> which carried away all the Bounds, and defaced all the Limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of their Inheritances: and ſo this Exerciſe, which for the time conſiſted only in Meaſuring the Lands, for to render to every one that which belonged to him, was called the Meaſuring of the Earth, or Geometrie: But in proceſs of time the <hi>Egyptians</hi> applied themſelves to more ſubtile Enquiries, and by degrees from an Exerciſe altogether Mechanical, they brought forth this Excellent Science, which hath deſerved to hold one of the chiefeſt ranks amongſt all others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geometry</hi> is not only profitable, but we may ſay that it is altogether neceſſarie. It is by this, that the <hi>Aſtrologians</hi> do make their Obſervations by it, they know the Extent of the Heavens, the Duration of Times, the Moving of the Stars, the obſervation of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Years and Ages.</p>
            <p>It is by this Means, that the Geographers do cauſe us to ſee, at one caſt of an Eye, the Greatneſs of the whole Earth, the huge Extenſion of the Seas, the Diviſions of Empires, Kingdoms and Provinces.</p>
            <p>It is from this the Architects do take their juſt Meaſures, in framing of publick Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as well as of particular Houſes.</p>
            <p>It is by the help of this Engineers do bring to paſs all their intended Projects, whereby they take the ſcituation and plat-form of Fortifications, the Diſtance of Places, and that they can at length carry their Meaſure through Spaces acceſſible only to the ſight.</p>
            <p>Perſons of Qualitie, whoſe Birth engageth them to the Wars, are obliged to applie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Science. It introduceth them not only to Fortification, which teacheth them to build Bulwarks to defend ſtrong Places, but alſo to compoſe and ſet up Engines, which may overthrow them; and further alſo it brings them very much knowledge and skill in the Military Art, how to ſet an Army in Order for Battel, how to encamp and divide the Ground for the quartering; and further, it teacheth them to make Maps of Countreys; and to take the Platform of Towns, Forts and Caſtles; to Meaſure all kinde of Dimenſions, both acceſſible and unacceſſible, to invent Projects; and laſtly, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ſo expert and commendable for their Wit and Inventions, as they can be for any ſtrength or couragiouſneſs in them.</p>
            <p>All thoſe that make Profeſſion of entring upon Deſigns, ought to know ſomething of Geometry, ſeeing that they cannot otherwiſe attain the Art of Architecture, nor Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, which are two Parts abſolutely depending on that skill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geometry</hi> is eſtabliſhed upon three ſorts of Principles, <hi>viz</hi> Definitions, Axioms, and Petitions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Definitions are brief Explications of the Names and Terms.</item>
               <item>2. The Axioms are Sentences ſo true, and ſo manifeſt, that it is impoſſible to contradict them.</item>
               <item>3. And the Petitions are clear and intelligible Demands, whereof the Execution and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice requireth not any Demonſtrations.</item>

               <p>AN Architector muſt alſo undergo other Burthens, for that he muſt know how to divide a piece of ground, that no man may be hindred thereby. As for Example, if there were a piece of ground that lay three-corner'd wiſe, with unequal parts, having on the one ſide thereof a Well, but not in the middle: and this ground, or three-corner'd piece of Land is to be divided into two equal parts, in ſuch ſort, that each of them may have the uſe of the Well: it muſt be done in this manner. I make a Triangle marked A. B. C. and the Well is marked with G. Now divide the line B. C. with a dark line in the two equal parts as the Letter D. ſheweth, and then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a line from D. to A. then the Triangle is divided into two equal parts: but both of them cannot yet come to the Well: then draw another line from the Well G. to A. and from the point D. you muſt ſet an Equidiſtancie againſt G. A. marked with E. and drawing from G. which is the Well: the black line to the letter E it will divide the ground in two even ſeveral parts, and each of them ſhall have the VVell at the end of his Ground, for that part A. B. G. E. containeth in it juſt as many feet or roods, as that part which is marked G. E. C.</p>
               <p>I Shewed before, how a man ſhould make a four ſquare Superficies once as great again as it is, but it may fall out, that a man is to make it but half as great again, or more or leſs, as he thinketh good, or as occaſion ſerveth, which the Architector is alſo to learn of neceſſitie. Which to ſhew, I ſet down a right four ſquare thing marked A. B C, D, which I will have three quarters greater: the ſame three quarters I ſet by the ſide thereof, ſo that the ſame with the Quadrate together make a Quadrangle A. E. C. G. To bring this Quadrangle into a right Quadrate, you muſt lengthen the line A. E. yet a quarter longer, or from the ſide of the Quadrangle E. G, and place F. there: then upon the line A. F. make half a Circle: which line will ſhew you the one ſide of the Quadrate which you ſeek for: which Quadrate being made, will contain as much in it as the Quadrangle already made And in this manner you may change all Quadrangles which are long four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner'd pieces of work, into a juſt and true Quadrate.</p>
               <p>NOw to prove that which I ſaid before, you muſt join the Quadrangle with the Quadrate together, in one ſquare <hi>Superficie,</hi> as Q. R. S. T. and from the corner R. to the corner S. draw a Diagonus, and it is certain that that Diagonus will make two even parts. Now <hi>Euclides</hi> ſaith, that when a man taketh any even parts from even parts, the reſt of the parts alſo remain alike: then take the Triangle K. L., and the Triangle M. N. which are both alike: the right four corner'd <hi>ſuperficie</hi> P. is of the ſame greatneſs, that the longer <hi>ſuperficie</hi> O is.</p>
               <p>AGain, you may eaſily change a Quadrate into a Quadrangle, as long or as narrow as you deſire to have it, doing thus; Make your Quadrate A. B. C. D and lengthen your Line A. B. and the Line B. C. Which done, then ſet the length of the Quadrangle, which you deſire to have upon the line A. G. Then from the point G. draw a line alone by the corner of the Quadrate D. to the line C. F. and there you find the ſhorteſt line of the Quadrangle: and ſo to the contrary you ſhall by the leaſt ſide of the Quadrangle finde the longeſt alſo, as you may alſo prove by the aforeſaid Figure: for when you take away the Triangles M. N. and O. P. which are both alike: then the two parts which are K. L. are alſo alike.</p>
               <p>AN Architector may by chance have a piece of work of divers unequal ſides come to his hands, which he is to put ino a Quadrangular or Quadrate forme, to know what it containeth, and ſpecially when it belongeth to more then one man, whether it be Land or any other thing. For although the Architector or Surveyor of Land could not skill of Arithmetick or Ciphering: yet this rule cannot fail him, nor any other man that deſireth to find out the deceit of a Taylor. Thus, I ſay then, let it be what forme ſoever it will, I ſet down this hereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Firſt then, ſeek the greateſt Quadrate or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle that you can take out of it: that done, ſeek yet another Quadrate or Quadrangle, as big as you can take out of it, out of the reſt of the ſaid work: and if you can after that make more Quadrates or Quadrangles out of it, I mean all with right corners, take them out alſo: but if you can find no more in it, then make Triangles alſo as big as <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>u can, of which Triangles (as you are taught before) you may make Quadrangles, and let every piece ſeverally be marked with Characters, as in the Figure fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing may be ſeen.</p>
               <p>LEt by Example your many corner'd Figures firſt be marked with the great Quadrangle with theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters A. B. C. D. and then with a leſs Quadrangle, as E. F. G. H. the reſt are all Triangles. Now ſet the greateſt Quadrangle L. in a place by it ſelf, and then the other marked with M. which ſet upon it, that the two corners or ſides may be alike: which done, lengthen the line E. F. and the line E. G. and where they ſtay or touch under the great Quadrangle L. there ſet an I, from this I. a Diagonal line, being drawn through the corners B. H. the ſame line ſhall be drawn to the point: that, by the ſhutting of the Characters B. M. L. D. will ſhew you another Quadrangle, of the like quantity that the Quadrangle M. is: ſo that the whole Quadrangle D. C. L. M. containeth the two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Quadrangles. Touching the Triangles, when you have changed the ſame (according to your former inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) into Quadrangles, as you may ſee by the Triangle N, ſo may you put that Quadrangle alſo in the greateſt Quadrangles (for leſs trouble.) The great Quadrangle A. L. M. C. is once again placed above with the ſmall Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle O. P. Q. R. ſet upon it, and the Diagonal line is placed behind the greater (which is L. M. T. S both mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with N. ſo that the Quadrangle A. C. S. T. containeth three Quadrangles L. M. N. and as many more as there are: you may in this ſort bring them all in one Quadrangle: if there falleth out any crooked lines, the skilful Architector or Workman may almoſt bring them into a ſquare, and thoſe Quadrangles, if need be, may alſo be reduced into perfect four ſquares, as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>IT is an excellent thing for a man to ſtudy or practiſe to do any thing with the Compaſſe, whereby in time men may find out that which they never imagined: as this night it happened unto me, for that ſeeking to find a neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rule, to make the forme of an Egge, then <hi>Albertus Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi> hath ſet downe, I found this way to make an Antick veſſell, placing the foot beneath at the foot of an Egge, and the necke with the handles above upon the thickeſt part of the Egge. But firſt you muſt frame the Egge in this manner: Make a ſtreight croſs of two lines, and divide your croſs line in ten equal parts: that is, on each ſide five. Then, ſet the Compaſs upon the Center A, and with the other foot thereof, draw in two parts, that is, to C. making half a Circle upwards. That done, ſet one foot of the Compaſs upon the point marked B. and with the other draw in the uttermoſt point C. drawing a piece of a Circle downwards toward the Perpendicular, and doing the like on the other ſide, you muſt make a point below. Then take the half of the half Circle above that two parts, and place it at the undermoſt point of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular upwards above O, where the Center to cloſe the Egge, ſhall ſtand: the reſt under ſhall be for the foot: the neck, without doubt, may be made two parts high, and the reſt according to the Workmans pleaſure, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Figure here ſet down.</p>
               <p>YOu may alſo make another forme of a Cup or veſſel, after the rule aforeſaid. But from the point A. (which doth ſhew the bredth of the foot, and the wideneſs of the mouth) you muſt make your Circle upwards from C. unto the two Perpendiculars, where the body ſhall be cloſed up. The neck ſtanding above it ſhall be two parts high: but the reſt of the Workmanſhip ſhall be made according to the will and device of the Workman.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>BY this means you may make other different kinds of Cups or veſſels: but theſe that follow, you muſt make in this ſo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A Man may make Oval formes in divers faſhions, but I will only ſet down four. To make this firſt Figure, you muſt ſet two perfect Triangles one above the other, like a Rombus, and at the joyning of them together, you muſt draw the lines through to 1. 2. 3. 4. and the corners A. B. C. D. ſhall be the four Centers, then ſet one foot of the Compaſs upon B. and the other upon I, and draw a line from thence to the Figure 2. After that, from the point A. and 3. to 4. you muſt alſo draw a line: which being done, ſet the one end of the Compaſs in the point C. and then draw a piece of a Circle from 1. to 3. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Compaſs being in the Center D. draw a piece of a Circle from 2. to 4. and then the forme is made. You muſt alſo underſtand, that the nearer that the Figures come to their Centers, ſo much the longer they are: and to the contrary, the further that they are from their Centers, the rounder they are: yet they are no perfect Circles, becauſe they have more then one Center.</p>
               <p>FOr the making of the ſecond Oval you muſt firſt make three Circles, as you ſee here drawing, where the four ſtreight lines ſtand: the four Centers ſhall be I. K. L. M. Then placing one point of the Compaſs in K. yon muſt draw a line with the other point from the Figure of 1. to 2. Again, without altering the Compaſs, you ſhall ſet the one foot of the Compaſs in I. and ſo draw a piece of a Circle from the figure 3. to the figure 4. and that maketh the Compaſs of the Circle. This Figure is very like the form of an Egge.</p>

               <p>THE third forme is made by two foure corner'd ſquares, drawing Diagonen lines in them, which ſhall ſhew the two Centers G. H. and the other two corners E, and F. Then draw a piece of a Circle from F. to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure 1. and ſo to 2. Do the like from E. to 3. and 4. which done from the points G. and H. make the two ſides from 1. to 3 . and from 2. to 4. and ſo ſhut up the Ovale.</p>
