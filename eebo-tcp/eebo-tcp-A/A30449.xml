            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Mysteries of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are of all others the most Amazing. A small Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of true Reason, with good Degrees of Humility and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, will easily bring one over to Submit to Matters of Doctrine, relating to the Divine Essence, if it appears that they are expresly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65705:5"/>
though the forming Distinct Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of them be above our Faculties, which God knows are Weak and Short-sighted; but it is a more obvious, as well as a more pressing Difficulty, that arises from the Methods of God's Governing the World. There is no great matter in that which is drawn from the Varieties and seeming Partialities of Providence: The Prosperity of Bad Men, and the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Just, have often such visible tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in this Life, and are followed with such a just Distribution of Rewards and Punishments in another State, that this is no formidable Objection.</p>
            <p>But that the world should be, as it were, abandoned, so great a part of it being, as it were, delivered up in Bulk to Ignorance, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Immorality, and Magick; so small a part of it being enlightned, and of that so very small a part being either guided or bettered by that Light, carries in it a Train of Difficulties, which we can never hope to see through, till welcome at that Light to which we cannot now approach. Why the world was let run into so much Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption for about 4000 Years, before the Son of God was sent forth into it; Why this Light has not Shined into all the Corners of the world ever
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65705:5"/>
since; And that which is the most Amazing of all, is, Why do those who enjoy it value it so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and are so little reformed by it, are indeed Mysteries that we cannot see through.</p>
            <p>Yet though we cannot quite comprehend them, we have some hints given us to shew us, that there was a certain Conduct, and by Consequence a wise Direction in this great Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saction. A time was prefixed for it, long before it happened; and the Accomplishment did punctually Answer the Predictions.</p>
            <p>I shall name only Two of the most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
            <p>About 1800 Years before it, <hi>Jacob</hi> when dying had foretold, <hi>That the Scepter should not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note> 
               <hi>depart from Iudah, till Shiloh should come,</hi> by whom the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be called to the Knowledge of God. The Importance of which was, That the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> should continue to be God's People, under their peculiar Laws and Government, till the Messias should come, to whom the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be <hi>gathered.</hi> The other Tribes were for the greater part so lost, that scarce any Remnant of them was left: But the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> still remained a visible Body of Men, Governed by their peculiar Laws, till
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65705:6"/>
the time of our Saviour's coming into the world. <hi>Herod</hi> had been made their King by the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, and was afterwards Confirmed by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus;</hi> they were thereby brought under Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though <hi>Herod</hi> Governed them indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Mose</hi>'s Law. <hi>Augustus</hi> ordered a Taxing of all the Empire, of the Tributary or Subjected Provinces, as well as of that which was incorporated into the Empire: And this happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precisely at the time of our Saviour's Birth. Soon after that, <hi>Judea</hi> was made a Province; their Current Money was only the <hi>Roman</hi> Coin; <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the <hi>Roman Procurator</hi> Condemned our Saviour; and by that time, according to the Prediction, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were called to the Knowledge of God (through this <hi>Shiloh</hi> the Messias,) the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation was Destroyed, their Temple burnt down, their City razed down to the ground, and they scattered to the Four Winds of Heaven; but far the greater part ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering firmly to their Religion, still owned the Prophecies, which we hope are to have at last a Glorious effect upon them for their final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. Here is one Character of the Time, and we see the fulness of it was come.</p>
            <p>Another is yet more express, given out about 500 Years before the Accomplishment; It was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65705:6"/>
revealed to <hi>Daniel,</hi> That within Sixty nine Weeks <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 25.</note> after the going forth of the Commandment to build <hi>and restore Ierusalem, Messiah the Prince should come, and be cut off.</hi> That by <hi>Weeks</hi> are meant so many Sevens of Years, is confessed by the <hi>Jews;</hi> and can easily be proved to have been a common form of designing such a Period of time among them. The <hi>commandment to build Ierusalem,</hi> was <note place="margin">Neh. 2. 5, 6. Ezra. 1. 2. Ezra 6. 8.</note> given in the <hi>20th.</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus;</hi> the Edict given out before by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Darius,</hi> being only for the building the Temple, and for the worshipping of God in it. Sixty nine Weeks of Years are just 483: Now we have the certain Characters of those times left, by which we are sure, That from the <hi>20th.</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in which our Saviour suffered, there were just so many years, neither more nor less, according to the Calculation of Years that we know the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> then reckoned by, of 360 Days to a Year, which they divided into Twelve Months, assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thirty Days to every Month; which we see by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was likewise the measure that the <hi>Jews</hi> counted by; and of such Years only can that Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s be understood.</p>
            <p>Here are two evident Characters that the <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the time</hi> was come; that a time was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to this great Transaction long before, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65705:7"/>
that it happen'd punctually according to it.</p>
            <p>We do likewise find in the state of the <hi>Gentile</hi> world a great Conjuncture of favourable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances previous to its Appearance: The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire was as calm at this time as it was great: The World was conquer'd, and after a course of many years Wars <hi>Janus</hi> Temple was shut. It was a Constitution made up of Justice and Morality; but was under a Religion that was then so strangely corrupted, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers as well as Laws of that Nation did very much dispose them to an aversion to that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather to that mixture of all Religions, which the wiser and better sort among themselves could not but despise and abhor: By conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence this prepared them to receive a Religion that not only agreed to all their Notions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, but that tended to improve and exalt them all.</p>
            <p>Thus we who cannot know why this was the time marked for the Appearance of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> yet do certainly know that it was precisely marked out, and was as exactly fulfilled; and from that we have reason to acknowledge and adore that Wisdom in it, which we cannot yet discover.</p>
            <p>I go next to the Great Article of the Christian Religion mentioned in the Text, That the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65705:7"/>
who was <hi>sent forth,</hi> was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> understood these two designations to be so inseparable, that they had no other Controversy at first with the Apostles and the first Converts, but about this, Whether <hi>Jesus</hi> was the <hi>Messias,</hi> or not? But supposing him to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> they never questioned his being <hi>the Son of God;</hi> nor did they object to the Christians their giving him Divine Adoration. We have the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the most punctually related of any of all the Passages that happen'd in the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Christianity: The <hi>Jews</hi> heard and saw all that past; St. <hi>Stephen</hi> died calling upon the <hi>Lord Iesus to receive his spirit,</hi> and praying to him not to <hi>lay that sin to the charge</hi> of his Murtherers. If the <hi>Jews</hi> had not then believed that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be truly <hi>God,</hi> and that as such he was to be invocated, they must after this have reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Christians with Idolatry; with making a Man God, and with the worshipping him as such. This they did not do; which shews that then they owned that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was yet more instructing to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who could not but observe that St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ended his life in Acts of Invocation of Christ, to the same effect with those in which Christ himself had called on his Heavenly Father, when he gave
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65705:8"/>
up the Ghost: <hi>Into thy hands I commit my spirit,</hi> being of the same importance with that of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s, <hi>Lord Iesus receive my spirit:</hi> As, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgive them, they know not what they do,</hi> being the same Act in effect with this, <hi>Lord, lay not this to their charge.</hi> If Christ was not truly God, and to be worshipp'd as such, it is not possible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse this from a very high degree of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>I love not in such an Audience to dwell long on Points of Speculation: Yet since this is the Capital Article of the Christian Religion, and since it is one of the great Infelicities of the Age we live in, that as many have been carried to question the Truth of the whole of it, so not a few have with a particular Eagerness attack'd this Fundamental Point of it; I hope the Day, as well as the Time we are in, will justify the insisting a little more upon it.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that if we confess that the New Testament was a Book writ by Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which those who deny this Doctrine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess they do acknowledge), we must also confess, that Divine Honours are through the whole of it ascribed to Jesus Christ: From this, Common sense seems to infer, That either he was truly God, by such a Real Union with the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> who is <hi>God,</hi> as makes both Natures one Person in him; the nearest resemblance to which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65705:8"/>
is the Union of our Souls and Bodies, out of which very different Natures arises one Man, or one Person: Or if this is not true, it will follow, That the Christian Religion, one of whose main Ends was to banish Idolatry out of the world, did really only change the Object of this Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and draw men from worshipping the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the several Nations, to worship one who according to those mens Doctrine was only a Creature, and yet was to be worshipp'd with the same Honour which is due to the Eternal God; which were indeed a Strain in Idolatry beyond that of most Heathen Nations. But to make this Matter yet plainer: All the Sects among Christians that have rejected our Saviour's Divinity, who yet acknowledge that Divine Honour is due to him, may be reduced to these Two; Either such as hold him to have been some Excellent Created Being, made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, and imployed by God in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Governing the world, and so Dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Divine Honour. These were the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of Old, who under many high words, seem to have meant no more but to acknowledge that he was some Created Mind, such as the <hi>Jews</hi> and we all apprehend <hi>Angels</hi> to be; Superior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in rank and order, to any other of them; but no Idea can be formed of a Created Mind,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65705:9"/>
how perfect soever, but what is of the nature of Angels.</p>
            <p>Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> begins it with the rejecting this conceit; and he pursues that in the Two First Chapters, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, that considering the Simplicity of Stile in which the New Testament is writ, are as full as can be imagined. They are of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Negative words, which are always to be severely understood. They are likewise set in the terms of opposition, and so must be strictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: The bare repeating them will make this yet more more sensible. It is said of Christ, <hi>That he was the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person. Being made so much</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>better than the</hi> Angels, <hi>as he hath by Inheritance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a more excellent name than they.</hi> Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Dignity they have, it is a free donation, whereas Christ has his by <hi>Inheritance. To which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 4.</note> 
               <hi>of the</hi> Angels <hi>said he at any time, Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee. But when he bringeth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>in the first-begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the</hi> Angels <hi>of God worship him;</hi> an opposition as express as it is full. These words are in the Book of Psalms; but they are also in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion <note place="margin">Ps. 97. 7.</note> of the last Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> according to the Septuagint Translation, tho' not in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Rejoyce, O ye Heavens, and let all the Angels
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65705:9"/>
of God Worship him.</hi> This being then the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation that was in use among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ, it is most probable that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to it, there being no part of the Law, that the <hi>Jews</hi> think is more full of Mystery and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy than that Song. The Angels being thus called on to Worship the Messias, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strict Expression of another nature in him, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to theirs, and to which they are subject. That is farther prosecuted: Of Angels, this is said, <hi>He makes his</hi> Angels <hi>Spirits</hi> (that is, <hi>Winds,</hi> which <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> imports the quickness of their Motion), <hi>and his Ministers a flaming fire</hi> (a Figure importing their subtil force). In opposition to which, this follows; <hi>But unto the Son he saith, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.—</hi>And, <hi>Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are the works of thiue hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—they shall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</hi> The Creation of the Heavens and the Earth, and Eternity, being in these words plainly affirmed of the Messias, which could not be said without Blasphemy, if he was not truly God. This is carried yet further: <hi>To which of the</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>said he at any time, Sit thou at my right hand,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>until I make thine enemies thy footstool;</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to which, it is said further of Angels, <hi>Are they not all ministring Spirits, sent forth to minister for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65705:10"/>
them who shall be Heirs of Salvation.</hi> This is more expresly prosecuted in the next Chapter, where this is made a part of the difference between the Mosaical and the Christian Dispensation, That <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 2, 3, 4.</note> the former <hi>was spoken by Angels;</hi> whereas this was <hi>first begun to be spoken by the Lord. For unto</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>God hath not put in subjection the world to come</hi> (a Phrase importing in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Stile, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the Messias); whereas the Messias, <note place="margin">ver. 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>though made a little lower than the Angels, was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory and honour, and set over the</hi> whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In the Conclusion of that Chapter, there is an Expression that makes all this yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 16.</note> 
               <hi>but he took on him the seed of Abraham;</hi> which fully shews that the <hi>nature</hi> in him, which he had before his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> was not the <hi>nature</hi> of Angels.</p>
            <p>The Second Supposition on which those who deny his Divinity, do yet pretend to assert the High Dignity to which he is raised, is the Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of that Ministry and Dispensation that was committed to him; in conclusion of which, and as a reward of his patient Sufferings, he was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up, and exalted to Divine Honour. This <hi>Artemon</hi> of old, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> of late, have advanced: But, as by a Spirit of Prophecy, St. <hi>Paul</hi> does in the next place destroy this conceit in that way, which of all others, was the best
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65705:10"/>
suited to the Notions of the <hi>Jews.</hi> He sets Christ in opposition to <hi>Moses,</hi> not only in a priority of rank, and precedence, but in a Superiority of Nature. He Prefaces this with a charge to us, to <hi>consider the High-Priest and Apostle of our Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 7.</note> To which he adds, That both <hi>Moses</hi> and he were <hi>faithful,</hi> but with this distinction; <hi>That</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 2.</note> 
               <hi>this man was counted worthy of more glory than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in as much as he who hath built the House hath more Honour than the House.</hi> He adds to this; <hi>That he who hath built all things, is God.</hi> But the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition follows; <hi>Moses was faithful in all his House</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>as a Servant; but Christ as a Son over his own House.</hi> Words that are as clear as they are full.</p>
            <p>To make this yet more sensible, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, That the Degree of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Inspiration, is set by God himself above any other Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in these Words: <hi>If there be a Prophet among</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Numb. 13. 6.</note> 
               <hi>you, I will make my self known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream. My Servant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is not so, who is faithful in all my House, with him will I speak mouth to mouth</hi> (or <hi>face to face,</hi> as one man speaks to another) <hi>even apparently, and not in dark Speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold:</hi> Or, to put this in Modern Expressions, he shall see God in a true and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Idea. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> was above all other Prophets. The peculiar Excellencies of the <hi>Pe al pe,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65705:11"/>
face to face,</hi> is well known to all who have any acquaintance with <hi>Jewish</hi> Notions. Now after all this, Christ is not only preferred to <hi>Moses,</hi> but is put in such an opposition to him as is that of a <hi>Son</hi> to a <hi>Servant.</hi> These are plain and simple Authorities, that need only a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, but no Commentary, to make us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the force and evidence that is in them. God be thanked, that by his good Providence, and the care of all the Churches, we have this Book brought down to us, in its first genuine and uncorrupted State, in which the Inspired Penmen delivered it to the World. It was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Enemies of this Doctrine, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to corrupt it. They understood that, and followed it; for which we have an undeniable Testimony Recorded to us by a Writer who was too favourable to them to be declined as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial against them. It was <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who in his <note place="margin">Eus. Hist. l. 5. c. 28.</note> History cites a passage from a Writer in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 3d Century, believed to be <hi>Gaius</hi> Presbyter of <hi>Rome,</hi> who tells us that <hi>Artemon</hi>'s Disciples had endeavoured to corrupt the New Testament, but in such a manner, that as they could shew no Ancient Copies to justify their Corruptions, so they did not agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and these Corruptions were, as he says, very strange and enormous ones. So notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65705:11"/>
all the Cry that they do now raise of the Corruption of the Text, we see who they were that begun it; but that the Church was watchful in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving this sacred <hi>Depositum,</hi> and did early detect this Impious piece of Fraud, and stopt it in its first beginnings.</p>
            <p>If any shall ask, <hi>How can these things be?</hi> It must be Answered, <hi>We cannot tell:</hi> We can form no distinct apprehensions concerning them. This is <hi>Wisdom</hi> indeed, in a Mystery: It is <hi>Wisdom,</hi> because it comes from God; but it is <hi>in a mystery,</hi> because we cannot attain unto it. Can we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Eternity, or God's being every where? and that in one single act he sees all things past, present, and to come? Can we form any distinct thought concerning Creation? How Beings arise out of nothing, in consequence to the Will of an Infinite Mind, who said of all things, <hi>Let them be,</hi> and they were? Or can we so much as apprehend how Matter thus Created, shall move at the Act and Will of its Eternal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Can Matter know that Will to obey it? Or can an Intellectual Act give Motion to insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matter? Can we apprehend the propagation of Plants, much less of Animals? And as to that which of all other things we perceive the most sensibly, Can we apprehend how Soul and Body dwell together? How Thought and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65705:12"/>
how distant soever in their Natures, have that Union with, and Influence upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? How a Motion of Matter can throw an inexpressible Agony into a Mind; and how a Mind can command so many regular and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Motions of Matter, as we perceive in Memory, Imagination, and Speech; are diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that confound us. These are such plain and home convictions of the defectiveness of our Faculties, which can much more easily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend difficulties, than resolve them, that it can be no just Objection to any part of the Divine Revelation, that it contains matters out of which great difficulties do arise, and that we are not able to give our selves any account of them. Our apprehensions are not only finite, but very much bounded; we see but a very little way; and therefore we ought not to plead our want of capacity, in opposition to any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be plainly revealed to us in Scriptures. When such things occur to us, we ought to take the <hi>Shield of Faith;</hi> maintaining our selves with this, That the <hi>God of Truth, who cannot Lye,</hi> has revealed such things to us; and when we are sure of that, we are at the same time as sure that it must be true, because it comes from him: And by this we may beat back <hi>all the fiery Darts of the Devil;</hi> all those Objections that arise out of a mixture of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65705:12"/>
Pride and Weakness; for our Faculties are as weak, as our Arrogance and Self-conceit is high. This is so important a part of the Christian Religion, that it deserves well to be insisted on, and to be made out, as much as the nature of the thing, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as much as our Nature is capable of.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be considered, is the ends for which the Son of God was sent forth into the World. They were certainly great, since such extraordinary Methods were taken to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them: When it was introduced with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular and distinct Predictions; when all was supported with such a series of Miracles, done not only by our Saviour himself, but by those who were sent in his name: The propagation it self, considering the Instruments made use of, and the opposition it met with from all hands, being one of the greatest of all Miracles. Now since it is unsuitable to Infinite Wisdom, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy extraordinary Methods for the attaining of some ordinary Ends, it is very just to conclude, That the Ends must be great, when the Means used in order to them were such. They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the greatest that the humane nature was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of: All the Principles of Natural Religion, together with the Tradition concerning the first beginnings of the World, were so corrupted, or so intermixed with Fables, that it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65705:13"/>
to restore these by a Mighty Authority. That which we call strictly <hi>Religion,</hi> was turned whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Idolatry and Magick, Charm, or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. It was therefore necessary to raise up just and great Ideas of God, which the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers had attempted, but faintly and with small success. Barbarity and Vice had so over-run the World, that the plainest Ideas of Virtue were either quite lost, or rendred very doubtful. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a Corruption of Religion, it was no wonder if Atheism made a great progress, since few can be much concerned to support a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that is visibly made up of Fraud; and that may make men the worse, but cannot make them the better for adhering to it; and such was the Heathenish Religion. <hi>Judaism</hi> it self, though sound in its own nature, as well as Divine in its Original, yet was but low, and was become much more so by the increase of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial part by Tradition, which still as it increases too much, does sink the Moral and best part of Religion. It being then necessary to free the <hi>Jews</hi> from their <hi>Bondage</hi> (which is the occasion upon which these words are in this place made use of by St. <hi>Paul)</hi> as well as to deliver the <hi>Gentiles</hi> out of their darkness, which was become black and thick as <hi>the shadow of death;</hi> God sent his Son to give the World true and high Notions of God and his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65705:13"/>
Attributes; of his Justice and Goodness more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly; to open a way of Worship that should be plain and simple; suitable to the Ideas of God, and to our Faculties: And to set such Rules to mens inward Thoughts and Tempers, as well as to their Lives and Actions, as should rectify Human Nature, and render mutual Society both safe and happy. For this end he delivered his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to his Hearers, and lived it as well as he spake it. If an Angel from Heaven had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, as the Law was given on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> it could not have had so sensible an effect, as when the Person who delivered it set such a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern as gave more distinct Ideas concerning his end in it. In it he expressed what a sort of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness he came to promote: Not the Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a pompous Exterior, but the real purity of genuine Virtue; of Truth and Goodness; of Modesty, Humility, and Charity. Here was one great end for which the <hi>Son of God</hi> was <hi>sent forth:</hi> A great one it was; to raise and reform mens Natures; to give us Noble Thoughts and Excellent Rules, as well as a clear Pattern, that can neither fail nor misguide us.</p>
            <p>A Second end of his Coming, was to open such a Method of reconciling Sinners to God, as should both render them capable of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, and yet give them great Impressions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65705:14"/>
both of the Guilt of Sin, and of the Justice as well as the Goodness of God. No offer of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at all, must have made men desperate; as too Easy a one, must have made them bold in Sinning. The offer of a pardon was necessary to be begun with, but it must be made in such a manner, that it might not encourage men to live on in Sin, at the same time that it gave them the hopes of Mercy. The Ideas of the guilt and odiousness of Sin were to be kept up in a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whose chief design was to reform and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Mankind, at the same time that a general offer of a pardon was to be proclaimed to the World. Therefore this Messias, who was to procure that offer to be made, was to become a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> himself in our <hi>name</hi> and <hi>stead,</hi> he was to <hi>bear our Sins, and so to take them away:</hi> He was not to be brought by Priests, to be offered up on an Altar, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did with their Piacular Victims; much less was he to Slay himself, according to some Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that the Heathens had. Every thing in him was to be innocent, as well as great; such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came both the Majesty of God, and the Purity as well as the Dignity of his Person. He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fallen upon by an enraged multitude, who to satisfy their own brutal fury, first treated him most barbarously, and then put him ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously to death; all which he who could have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65705:14"/>
saved himself by Miracle, if not by other ways, not only bore patiently, but with an intire sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Will of God, and an unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Charity towards even those his Persecutors.</p>
            <p>This was only the outside, and the visible part of his Sufferings; but with these he endured an inexpressible Agony in his mind, both before and during his being on the Cross, of which we who understand only the Agonies of guilt, of pain, or of passion, can form no distinct Idea. All this he offered himself to bear; he was not surprized in it; he foresaw it coming, and longed for it. It is by this, and on the account of it, that Sinners are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to come to God, and to claim their pardon. In this they find great Characters, setting forth both the Guilt of Sin, and the Holiness, the Justice, as well as the Goodness of God. By such a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som it appears, how hateful a thing Sin is, since God has thought fit to offer the pardon of it, in so solemn and so severe a manner. By this the Doctrine of the Messias has this most effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation accompanying it, that he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he loved us, in instances beyond imagination, as well as expression.</p>
            <p>A Third design upon which God sent forth his Son, was to bring men to awaken much within themselves, the Ideas of God in the seriousest and tenderest manner, by frequent Meditation, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65705:15"/>
earnest Prayer: To which he added the most encouraging of all Promises, That God will not only hear, but answer our Prayers; and more especially that he will give his <hi>holy Spirit to every one that asks it.</hi> Our Faculties are not only under a great depression, but a vast disorder: Appetite and Passion do soon fire us, and are not easily resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we may have some good Minutes, but we have many more weak and bad ones: We do plainly perceive that without some inward assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to cure and rectify our Nature, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go through with the business of Religion. Our Saviour has assured us of this; and he has made the condition of our attaining it, to be that which is both in it self easy, for nothing can be easier than to have a thing for the asking, and is the properest Method possible, to keep alive in us great and powerful impressions of God; which are the Seeds and Principles that must reform our Natures, and mould them unto the likeness of God.</p>
            <p>Before the Son of God was sent forth, there were some general Ideas of God's hearing and answering of Prayer, and of his furnishing his Worshippers with an inward aid. But it was our Saviour on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who made it a part of the Covenant that he came to establish between God and man, That a Divine Power should be conveyed into the Faculties of all such as should earnestly pray
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65705:15"/>
to him, by which they should be enabled to pay him that sincere Obedience, of which he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed graciously to accept; and in consideration of which, he does through the Merits and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Christ, pardon all our other errors and defects. This is now to us, a foederal promise; we may depend upon it, and with all humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence claim to it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth great design of God's, in sending forth his Son, was, That he might give the World the most powerful of all motives, to work either on their hopes, or fears, by offering them both a full assurance, and a particular descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Future State. Some notices of this were still in the World; but they were both doubtful and dark: The greatest Assertors of it among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> did it but faintly: They proposed it, rather as an opinion that was highly probable, and fit to be believed, than as that which was certainly true. The hints given of it in the Old Testament, are very general, and may be made capable of other senses: By it the <hi>Jews</hi> might be inclined to believe not only ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther State, but the Resurrection of the Body; but the account they contain of it, is very defective. Our Saviour brought it to Light; he not only affirmed it in many expressions, that were so full and so plain, that it is not possible to doubt any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65705:16"/>
longer about it, without rejecting his Authority: He gave a very express proof of the possibility of the Resurrection, by his own rising from the dead: He went further, and assured us, that we should then be made <hi>like unto Angels:</hi> That our <hi>Bodies should shine as the Sun;</hi> that we should be <hi>for ever with God, inheriting that Kingdom which was prepared for us;</hi> previous to this, he told us, That <hi>we shall hear his voice,</hi> by the power of which we shall be raised out of our Graves, and be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to all that we have done in this Life; and that the <hi>micked shall go into everlasting punishment, and the righteous into life eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being then so evidently delivered, and so fully described by him, we have in it given to us <hi>exceeding great and precious promises,</hi> with the greatest encouragement possible, to undertake that course of Holiness, which he has set before us, in consideration of the glory which, with it, he hath also set before us. We are assured by him, that if we go through Life in an imitation of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and an Obedience of his Laws, as well, as in a submission to those Sufferings by which he may think fit to exercise our Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we shall at last escape out of this evil World, and from these Vile Bodies: We shall arise above the depressions of Sense and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the disorders of Appetite and Passion. We
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65705:16"/>
shall drop our Bodies with all the necessities and weaknesses that hang about them; and shall arise into a state of pure and clear light; into a state of purity and perfection; into the fellowship of Angels and Saints, and be brought to see and enjoy God to all Eternity; And that too, with all the fulness of comprehension, as well as of joy, that our Faculties in their utmost enlargement and elevation are capable of.</p>
            <p>These are the hopes that the Son of God has given us. I will not turn the prospect, and give the black face of that dismal Eternity, which he has at the same time denounced against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent. The joy of this Day agrees not so well with that, as withthe other more lovely and more animating prospect; which we ought to carry ever in our Thoughts, that so we may <hi>lay hold on that eternal life,</hi> which he who <hi>cannot lye has thus set before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the great ends for which <hi>God sent forth his Son:</hi> They are all worthy of God, as they are the greatest that the Human Nature is capable of. But what are we the better for all this, if we come not under the influences of it, if we are only brought to have chaster thoughts of the Divinity, a decenter way of Worship, with correcter Expressions, and more reasonable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but come not under the vital Energy of it?
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65705:17"/>
If neither our hearts nor our lives are made the better for it, we do very little consider or pursue the ends for which the Son of God was sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World. Can we imagine that all this was designed for no higher end, than to bring men under some forms, and to bind them to some opinions? This amounts to little, and must needs give but a mean Idea of a Religion, that with how much pomp soever it might be introduced, seems now to have very little effect on the great numbers of those who profess it. This alone dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the World more to doubt of it, than all that prophane minds can draw from any part of it, as a prejudice against it: Then shall these be the most effectually confuted, when the World shall see many instances of such true Christians, over whose Thoughts and Actions this Religion bears sway. Human Nature is too universally corrupted, to expect great numbers of such; but a happy mixture of some of these among the Crouds of those who are called Christians, but are the reproaches of their Profession, would give another air of Authority to all that we can say in behalf of our Faith; If we could at the same time appeal to such who are the living Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies for Religion.</p>
            <p>This ought to be the noble Ambition of those, whom God has eminently distinguished from the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65705:17"/>
rest of Mankind, and exalted above them: To be patterns to others to follow, is an honour far beyond the Authority of Commanding them: The Examples of those in great posts, will be both followed and observed in that which is good, as well as in that which is bad. Happy they who live so as to convince the World of the power that Religion has over them; and that give such an Essay of the beauty as well as the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of true Holiness, as disposes the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to love it as well as to follow it.</p>
            <p>Let us all then consider for what ends God <hi>sent</hi> his <hi>Son</hi> into the World; that we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them, and correspond to them. Let us fill our minds with great thoughts of God, with just ones of our selves, and with the generous Principles of Virtue, even in its most Heroical instances. Let us study the Doctrine of Christ, that we may be enlightened by it, and have it in all its branches distinctly before our thoughts, and in our memories; that so we may ever know how to conduct our selves by it: And let the pattern of our Saviour's holy Life and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be ever as a Picture before us, that we may always study and copy after it. Let the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of what he suffered for us, and for our Sins, be ever tender upon our minds; to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us when we reflect on our Sins; to give us

deep horror for what is past, and great cantion for the future: That so we may learn to value those Souls that were to be purchased at such a price, as well as these Sins that were to be expiated by such a Sacrifice. Let us not sink under the sense of our frailty, since we have great assistances at hand, such as will strengthen us against all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and will enable us to resist all temptations, and in the end to be more than Conquerors. All this is offered to us through him, in whom, as <hi>the fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily;</hi> so out of that <hi>fulness</hi> we shall all receive <hi>grace</hi> proportioned to our occasions, to our necessities, and to those servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which we are to be imployed.</p>
            <p>Finally, Let us with joy look beyond Life and Mortality, and all the fading glories of this World: Those scenes that change so often, and so suddenly. Let us look beyond Sense, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all that train of Vanity and Vexation that accompanies them, unto those Regions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, where dwelleth Light and Love, and Life for evermore. Let us look unto <hi>Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith,</hi> whom God sent forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, to seek and save lost Sinners, of whom we ought to reckon our selves among the Chief. <hi>To whom with the Father and the H. Ghost, be all Honour and Glory both now and evermore.</hi>
