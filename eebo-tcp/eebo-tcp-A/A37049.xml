            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And since, in the second place, all their Afflictions are afflictions only of <hi>this present time,</hi> for a <hi>season,</hi> and but for a <hi>moment,</hi> not protracted according to desert one minute beyond Death, let be Eternities length; Since moreover the heaviest Loads, and greatest measures of them are but light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Afflictions, and His severest correctings of them are in measure with <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Discretion; He stayeth his rough Wind in the day of his East Wind,</hi> and doth in great Wisdom sute and proportion the tryals, of his People to their strength and standing; <hi>in His faithfulness, not suffering them to be tempted above what they are able, but with the temptation making a way to escape that they may be able to bear it:</hi> Its not his manner to put new Wine into old Bottles, nor to sew a piece of new Cloath unto an old Garment.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Decay of Religion at this day in the World, is come to such an height, as that it is observed by all who pretend unto any Concernment therein, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by Many. By Religion we understand the Power of it in the Hearts and Lives of Men, and not any Outward Profession of it only; much lesse the generall pretence that is made unto it, in them by whom its power is openly denied. Neither is it manifest onely in the fruits of Sinfull security and the flagitious lives of all sorts of men, but begins to be so also in its effects, in the present state of things in the World filled with Misery and Confusion: <hi>For the Wrath of God</hi> is many wayes <hi>revealed from Heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> and in many Nations the Visible tokens and demonstrations of it do abound. <hi>For, there is in them no peace; to them that go out, nor to them that come in; but great vexation is upon all their Inhabitants. Nation is destroyed of Nation, and City of City; for God doth vex them with all adversity.</hi> For whatever may be the thoughts and counsells of men in these things, the Judgements of God are not meerly subservient unto their lusts and passions; it is his own controversie with the world for neglect of the Gospell and opposition unto it that he pleadeth in them, neither can our present respite in the enjoyment of outward mercies be any evidence unto us, that we are not the objects of the same displeasure. All men are in the same condition among whom the same sins and the same relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from the power of religion are found; for God is no Respecter of persons, It is indeed an effect of divine patience, which if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused unto security, will issue in a more fore revenge. In the mean

time the voice of God unto us in all the miseries and desolations we hear of in the world, is, that unlesse we Repent, we shall all likewise perish. Neither are we altogether left without pregnant warnings among our selves in many severe dispentations of divine providence. And those who are not utterly hardened through the deceitfulnesse of Sin, may easily see the hand of God lifted up in various intimations of his displeasure. But hitherto it must be acknowledged, and ought to be bewailed, that the Security of the world seemes to be unshaken, and the  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ndation of Sin not to be stemmed in the least measure.</p>
            <p>What are the reasons and causes of the present general defection, from the Truth, Power, Holinesse and Glory of the Gospel or Christian Religion, I have enquired into and declared in a peculiar Treatise designed  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto that end. Some few things suited unto the present occasion may be here observed. All decays in Religion begin in individuall persons, though it extend it self unto fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and so the infection spreads unto greater societies, Eclesiasticall and National. For such also is the order in the genuine progresse of the power of Religion whereunto it is opposed. The testimony that God gave unto <hi>Abraham</hi> was, that keeping the way of the Lord himself, he taught and commanded his Children and household after him so to do. And if the living power of Godlinesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the History of Christ, and the Gospel in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ence unto it in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, National Acts are neither useful to the Souls of men, nor do any way tend unto the Glory of God. And the sole use of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Religious Order and Professions lost, where they are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto the Ingenerating and promoting of Holyness, or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Obedience in particular Persons. Wherefore if any Revival of the Power of Religion in the World may be yet hoped for; if any stop may be put unto the Fatal Declensi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, which it suffers under, the forming and restoring of the Principles of it in the Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of such Persons is the way whereby it must be attempted; from and by them must it be discused into Families, and greater So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities: Here must all Reformation begin, or in the use of means suited thereunto. How this may be effected, we have one instance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many, proposed unto us in the ensuing Discourse.</p>

men, is the neglect of the Holy and Perfect Rule of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or of the Law of God, without a recourse unto a Diligent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Attendance thereunto, without a due Sense of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God therein; and of the Account which they must shortly give of their regard unto it; there can be no just Expectation of the Re-introduction of the Power and Glory of Religion. And many wayes there are, whereby men are diverted from the due Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and holy complyance with this Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> False and Corrupt Interpretations of the Law, do counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance many in Various Lusts; and the neglect of Manifold Duties. The <hi>Pharisees</hi> of Old representing the Design and Sense of the <hi>Law,</hi> as regarding Outward Acts and Practices only, laid an Axe to the Root of all True Holiness and Religion in the Apostatizing Church of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Vnder a Pretence of Establishing a false Legal. Righteousness, they destroyed the true Righteousness of the Law. And these things go together alwayes. Those who plead for a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of their own, as it were by the Works of the Law, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly by False Glosses and Interpretations destroy the Spirituallity, and all Animating Principles of the Law it self. For, rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Sense of the <hi>Law,</hi> and to seek for Righteousness by it; or as it were by its Works, are altogether Inconsistent: whereas therefore, many men, partly by their Natural Blindness, are no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> able to discerne the Spiritual Sense of the <hi>Law,</hi> and partly out of their Dislike of, and Enmity unto it, will not comply with the Light which is tender'd unto them, they have sought by False Interpretations to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the <hi>Law</hi> it self unto their own Lust and inclination. So e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently was it with the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of Old. Nor are the Presen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Apprehensions of many about these things much different from theirs. For such Expositions of the <hi>Law</hi> are embraced, wherein there is little Respect unto the Spiritual frame of the Heart, or the Internal Actings of the Adverse Principles of Sin and Obedience: The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Commandement is also by many exceedingly straitned, nor will any thing scarcely be allowed to be Commanded or Forbidden in it, but what the Letter doth plainly express. And it is evident how such Apprehensions will insensibly weaken the Sense of a Necessity of Vniversal Mortification, and abate the Diligence of the mind in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring after a renewed Spiritual Frame of Heart; by such means a De <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lension from all true Holyness and Piety will be effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. For, when men once begin to sati <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ass of Religion, they will not long abide in a Conscientious Observation even of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The separation of the Duties of the Law from the Grace of the Gospel, will have the like effect. For this will quickly issue in a pretence of Morality, set up its opposition unto true evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And there is no way whereby the whole Rule of Duty can be rendred more ineffectual and useless unto the souls of men. For take away that Reconciliation which is made in Christ between the Law and the Gospel, and it will prove a killing Letter only. And so far as this imagination is gone about it quickly manifests it self in its Fruits. For every attempt of men against the Grace of God will issue in the ruine of morality among themselves.</p>
            <p>Such Apprehensions as these in a coincidence with abounding ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations suted unto the Lusts of all sorts of men, cannot but promote the Interest and prevalency of Sin and Antichrist in the World. However manifest it is, that that is a great neglect and contempt of the holy Rule of obedience in the most, with great ignorance and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding of the designe and sense of it in many. Wherefore an upright endeavour to Declare and Vindicate the Authority and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, as also to make Application of it unto the Consciences of professed Christians, to direct them in, and press them unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant performance of all Duties of obedience, cannot but be esteemed seasonable, and through the blessing of God may be singularly useful. So our Lord Jesus Christ himself observing the mischief that had befaln the Church by the false exposition of the Law, obtruded on the people by the Pharisees, began his Prophetical Ministry in the vindication of it from their corrupting glosses, restoring its pristine Crown of purity and spirituality, as the Jews have yet a Tradition, that it shall be so in the dayes of the <hi>Messia.</hi> And on the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration it cannot be denied, but that the Endeavour of this worthy servant of Christ in the work of the Gospel, the Authour of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Exposition of the Decalogue, is both seasonable and worthy of Acceptation. For as other endeavours also are required in all them on whom it is incumbent, to take care in their respective stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the improvement of Holiness in the Church, and the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the progress of Sin, what in them lieth; so for the reasons before-mentioned, that in this particular way is peculiarly seasonable and  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d useful. And I am perswaded, that every pious, humble and


<pb facs="tcp:55484:24"/>
unprejudiced Reader, will judge that much benefit may be obtained by his performance. Some may easily see how short that measure of Duties which they have prescribed unto themselves doth come, of what is indispencibly required of them; and others may take a plain prospect of that whole Scheme of Obedience in principles, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, manner, and end which they sincerely endeavour to come up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And sundry things there are which appeare to me with a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of Excellency in the whole discourse.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Plainness and perspicuity in teaching, seems to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by the Authour throughout the whole book. Hereby it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated unto the meanest Capacities, which is the greatest excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Discourses of this nature as unto outward Forme and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For, whereas its only end is to direct the Practice of all sorts of Christians, all Ornaments of Speech, every thing that diverts from plainness, sobriety, and gravity, is impertinent thereunto. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the things themselves treated of, are such, as the most wise, knowing, and learned among Believers ought to be exercised in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: So, the way and manner of their Delivery or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is accommodated unto the Vnderstanding and Capacity of the meanest of them that are so, that benefit may redound unto all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In particular instances and cases relating to daily practise are so distinctly proposed, stated and determined, as that the whole is a compleat Christian, directory in our walking before God in all duties of obedience; let the pious Reader single out any one duty or head of duties to make his tryall upon, and if I greatly mistake not, he will discerne with what wisdome, and from what deep experience his plain directions are managed, and do proceed. As to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular instance, let him consider what he discovereth concerning pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer, and the Miscarriages therein, which men are lyable unto, <hi>pages 80, 81, 82,</hi> or apply himself unto what he supposes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more immediately concerned in, unaffected plainness, perspicuous brevity, with solidity of judgment, will every where represent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Adde hereunto, that constant respect which is had in the whole discourse unto the heart and inward principles of Obedience, with the contrary actings of the flesh, and temptations of all sorts. And thence it is that these Discourses, (though delivered with all plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of speech) will not be well understood by any, but those who in some measure have their senses exercised to discern both good and evill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55484:25"/>In the whole a full testimony is given, not onely against the prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate lives of many called Christians, but that barren careless pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession also, which too many satisfie themselves withall; who pretend more unto the truth &amp; power of Religion. And as these who are sincere in their obedience, may in the examination of themselves, by the rules here laid down, discern the decays which possibly they have fallen under in this hour of temptation which is come on the face of the earth, to try them that dwell therein; so also may they be directed in their Christian course unto the glory of God, and the Comfort of their own Souls: Which that all may be, is the hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of,</p>

That there are few convictions of sin. 2. Little repentance for sin. 3. Much security, presumption, confidence in self-righteousness, and the like, upon which the ignorance of this Scripture hath great influence, even as amongst the Jews the ignorance of its Spirituality made many neglect the chief part of holiness, and proudly settle on self righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and slight Christ the Mediator; as we may see in <hi>Paul</hi>'s example, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. and this was one reason why our Lord expounded it, that by it sinners might see more the necessity of a Mediator, who is the end of the Law for righteousness to all that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4.

Clear and confirm some Rules or Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations useful for understanding of the whole Law.</p>
               <p>The first Conclusion that we take for granted is, that this Law (as 'tis Moral) doth tye even Christians and Believers now, as well as of old; which appears from this, that he who is God the Law-giver here, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.38. is the Ang <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing confirmed by them both in their Practice and Doctrine, sheweth that the breach of the holy Law of God, is n <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ss sinful to us now, than it was to them before us.</p>
               <p>The second Conclusion is, that though this Law, and obedience thereto, lye on Christians, and be called for from them, yet it is not laid on them as a Covenant of Works, or that by which they are to seek or expect Justification; no but on the contrary, to overturn self-righteousness, by this D <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ine which manifesteth sin, and of it self worketh wrath; which is also clear, in that he is here called, <hi>Our God,</hi> which he cannot be to sinners but by Grace: And also it appears from the Lords owning of this sinful people a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his, and his adjoyning to this Law so many Ceremonies and Sacrifices which point out and lead to Christ; and from his adding the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as a help to the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. (which was a Covenant of Grace, and was never altered, as to its substance) in which the people of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as his S <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, was comprehended; therefore it appears that this was never the Lords intent in covenanting thus with his people, that they should expect righteousness and life by the adjoyned Law, but only that it should be useful in the Hand of Grace to make the former Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> effectual: So then, though we be bound to obey the Law, we are not to seek righteousness or life by the duties therein enjoyned.</p>
               <p>The third Conclusion is, that both Ministers in preaching, and people in practising of this Law, would carry with subordination to Christ; and that the duties called for here are to be performed as a part of the Covenant of Grace, and of the obligation that lyeth upon us thereby, and so all our obedience to God ought still to run in that Channel.</p>
               <p>If we ask how these two differ, to wit, the performing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Law, as running in the Channel of the Covenant of Grace, and the performing of them as running in the Channel of the Covenant of Works, or how we are to go about the duties of the Law with subordination to Christ and his Grace?  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> answer, they differ in these four things, which shew, that these duties are not only to be done, but to be done in a way consistent with, and flowing from Grace: which also follows from this, that in the

               <p>These Conclusions as necessary Caveats being laid down, we


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55484:35"/>
shall propose these distinctions for clearing of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1 We would distinguish betwixt a Law and a Covenant, or betwixt this Law, considered as a Law, and as a Covenant; a Law doth necessarily imply no more than 1. To direct. 2. To command, inforcing that obedience by Authority; a Covenant doth further necessarily imply promises made upon some condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or threatnings added if such a condition be not performed: now this Law may be considered without the consideration of a Covenant, for it was free to God to have added, or not to have added promises, and the threatnings (upon supposition the Law had been kept) might never have taken effect; but the first two are essential to the Law, the last two, to Believers, are made void through Christ; in which sense it is said, that by him we are freed from the Law as a Covenant, so that Believers life depends not on the promises annexed to the Law, nor are they in danger by the threatnings adjoyned to it: Hence we are to advert when the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works is spoken of, that by it is not meaned this Law simply, but the Law propounded as the condition of obtaining life by the obedience of it; in which respect it was only so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally given to <hi>Adam</hi>: This then is the first distinction betwixt the Law, and the Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Distinguish betwixt these Ten Commandments simply and strictly taken in the matter of them, and more complexly in their full Administration, with Pr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the second sense it is a Covenant of Grace, that same in substance with the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with the Covenant made with Beli <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4 Distinguish betwixt the Moral, and Ceremonial, and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Law; the first concerns manners, and the right ordering of a Godly Conversation; and because these things are of perpetual equity and r <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law is in Ceremonies, Types, and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, pointing at a Saviour to come; this is also abrogate, the substance being come; but there is this difference, that the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Law is but <hi>M <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5 When we speak of things Moral, we are to distinguish between things <hi>Naturally Moral,</hi> that is, such (as love to God and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and such like) which have an innate rectitude and holiness in them, which cannot be separate from them, and things <hi>positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Moral,</hi> that have their obligation by a special positive super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added Sanction, so that their rectitude flows not from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things themselves, as in the former: As for instance, in the fourth Commandment it is naturally Moral that God should be worshipped, Nature teacheth it; but that he is to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on such a day particularly, that comes to pass by vertue of his positive Command; the first cannot be altered, the second by the Lord may; but till he alter it, the Authority lies still on all, and it is equally sin to sin against any of them, though without the positive Sanction, there is no obligation naturally requiring obedience in some of them.</p>

And though such duties be in themselves Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, suppose praying, hearing, and such others, which might be instanced, yet the timing of them, or going about them at such a time, and in such a manner, is not Moral simply, but as these are by circumstances called for.</p>

               <p n="3">3 Observe, that this Rule o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for instance, that part of the fourth Commandment is negative; <hi>In it</hi> (that is, on the seventh day) <hi>thou shalt do no manner of work,</hi> yet sometimes, when necessity calls for it, some manner of works is lawful on that day, because it is only a negative Positive, and not a negative Moral: And so <hi>David</hi>'s eating of Shew-bread, was against a negative Command, though not against a negative Moral, but a negative Positive.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Take this Rule, that in all Commands, joyntly and several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we would have special respect unto the scope God aims at by them all in general, or by such a Command in particular: now the general scope is (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15,  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6.) perfect and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute holiness, even as he is holy; and therefore whatever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, he requires that it be absolutely perfect in its kind, as that our love to him be with the whole heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so our love to others be as to our selves; our Chastity and Purity, all must be absolute. (see 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5.) This Rule will teach us what we are to aim and level at: And whatever Exposition of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments comes not up to this scope, is no doubt defective; and by this Rule only can we be helped to the right meaning of every Commandment, for each of them his its peculiar scope, both as to the duties it requires, and sins it condemns. And by this Rule it is that our Lord Christ (whose Exposition with that of the Prophets is best) draws in the least and smallest branches of  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lthiness to the seventh Commandment, which dischargeth


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55484:38"/>
all things contrary to perfect and compleat Purity.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The fifth Rule is, that the Law is spiritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. and that not only outward obedience to such duties, or outward ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from such sinful acts is called for, but the Law, having a spiritual meaning, calls for spiritual service, and that in these three: 1. As it requires spiritual duties, such as Faith, Fear, Love to God, and to others; right habits, as well as right affections, and outward actions; and therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> to prove the spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Law, instanceth in the habit of Lust, <hi>Rom</hi> 7. as a thing thereby discharged. 2. The Law is spiritual, in that the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof reaches to the Spirit, and very inwards of the Heart, affections and thoughts, as well as to the outward man; the love it requires, is love with all the Soul, Heart, and Mind. Hence there is Heart-Idolatry, Murder, and Adultery, as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, therein condemned. 3. It is spiritual, in respect of the manner; it requires, as to all outward duties, that they be done to a spiritual end, from a spiritual principle, and in a spiritual way, opposite to the carnal way, to which the unrenewed heart of man is inclined; in which sense we are commanded to walk in the spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. and so praying and praising, which this Law calls for, is praying and praising in the spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="6">6 A sixth Rule is, that beside the duty expressed, there is more implyed in the affirmative Commands; and beside the sin pitched on, there is more forbidden in the negative Precepts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all duties and sins of these kinds, in whatsoever degree: As for example, in the affirmative Commands; 1. Where the duty is commanded, all the means that may further it are commanded likewise: Hence under care to preserve our Brother, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17, 18. it is commanded that we should reprove him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Where any thing is commanded as a duty, all duties of that kind are commanded, as keeping holy the Lords Day, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the fourth Commandment; there hearing, praying, watchfulness all the Week over, and all things belonging unto the Worship of God that day, such as Tythes, that is, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for a Ministry, calling of fit Ministers, building Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are required, though they be not all duties of that day. 3. Where a duty is required, the owning and suitable avowing of that duty is required also; and so believing in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55484:38"/>
profession of Faith are required in the same Commandment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10 4. Where the duty of one Relation is required (as of Childrens subjection) there is required the duty of the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (as of Parents) yea, and also of all under that name.</p>
               <p>Again, in negative Precepts observe: 1. Where great sins are forbidden, all the lesser of that sort are forbidden also; as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Adultery, Murder, and Idolatry, all light, obscene Whorish words, wanton looks, unchaste thoughts, revenge, rash anger, worldly affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are forbidden; and they are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prohibited under the grossest terms, to make them the more detestable, odious, and dreadful. 2. All means that may prevent these sins are commanded, and all snares, or occasions, or incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them are prohibited. 3. Where any sin is forbidden, there the least scandal about it, or the least appearance of the guilt of committing it, is forbidden also; for God will have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple holy, and shining in holiness, unspotted, and without scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and abst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We are not only forbidden the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of such sins our selves, delighting in them, and inclining to them, but accounting light or little of them in others; yea, we are commanded and ought to mourn for them, when commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The seventh Rule is, whatever duty lies upon others, we are commanded in our places to further them in it, as Masters are to further their Servants, Husbands their Wives, one Neighbour another, by advice, direction, incouragement, prayer, and other helps, as in the fourth Commandment is clear, where the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants duty, and the Strangers, is imposed on the Master; and whatever sin is discharged in our selves, we are discharged any manner of way to partake in the same with others, whether by advice, example, connivance, ministring occasion, or by sporting and laughing at it in them; for so the Rule is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Keep thy self pure, partake not of other mens sins:</hi> Men may be free themselves, as to their own personal breaches, and yet highly partake of others breaches of the Law.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The breach of one Commandment virtually breaks all; there is such a connexion and linking together of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that if the Authority of God be slighted in one, it is so in all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55484:39"/>9 One thing may in divers respects (as an end or means) be commanded or forbidden in many, yea in all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ignorance and drunkenness are, because they disable for all duties, and dispose to all sins: Of this kind is idleness also; and so knowledge, sobriety, watchfulness <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are commanded in all the Commandments; for without these men are unfitted and incapacitated for performing any commanded duty.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The tenth and last Rule is, the Law is holy, just, and good, therefore the least motion against it, or discontentment with it, is sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. In sum; take these few watch-words concerning the obligation of the Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That it obligeth to all duties, and to all sorts of duties, publick, private, to God, to others, and to our selves; and that words, actions, gestures, yea thoughts, and the least motions of the heart, come under its obligation: his Commandment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad, so that there is nothing so little, but it ought to be ruled by this Word, and that in all persons of all Ranks, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to doing or suffering.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That it obligeth to the right manner of duties, as well as to the matter, and to every thing that belongeth to duties; and thus in its true extent it reacheth to the forbidding of all the sins that are contrary to duties commanded.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That it obligeth the whole man, the outward, in deeds, words, gestures, and appearances or shews; the inward, in the understanding, will, affections, memory, conscience; and so it requires that the mind, will, and whole nature be sanctified, and conform to all these Commands.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That it obligeth to obedience in all these always, and in the highest degree, so that the least disconformity in habit or act is a transgression; the obedience it requires is perfect in all these respects, that not only there must be no breach of any of these Commands directly, much less a continuance in a breach, but that also 1. There must be no appearance of breaking them, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. There must be no consent to break them, though it come not forth to act, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.28. There must be no cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves in the way of any temptation or snare, whereby we may be inticed or occasioned (to speak so) to break them; as <hi>Dauid</hi> was by his looking on a woman, 2 <hi>Sam,</hi> 11.2. which <hi>Job</hi> guards against, <hi>Job</hi> 31. v. 1, 4. there must be no corrupt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55484:39"/>
affection, or inclination to evil, even where it gets not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, there must be no tickling of delight in the thing, though the heart dare not consent to act it, nor any discontentment with the restraint that keepeth from such a thing, or secret wishing that such a thing were lawful; but on the contrary, we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count every commanded thing right, <hi>Psalm</hi> 119.128.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The involuntary motions of the mind which never get assent to any of these evils, nor are delighted in, yet even these are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by this Law, because they flow from a corrupt Fountain, and are the Evidences of disconformity to Gods Image in our nature, and they ought not so much as to be in us. Hence doth the Apostle complain of lust, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. though resisted by him.</p>
               <p n="6">6 It reacheth not only to streams of actual corruption, but to the Fountain of original sin, whereby we entertain within us the seed and incentives unto actual evils that contradict this holy Law. By all which we may see what holiness it calls for, and how often (if we were examined in all the Commands by these Rules  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we would be found defective and faulty, and what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of humiliation and repentance we may have for what is past, and what challenges we may have hereafter from this Law, with what need of continual applications to the Blood of Sprinkling, and of Washings in that open Fountain, to the House of <hi>David,</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for sin and uncleanness, and what need of endeavours to have our steps ordered more exactly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it.</p>
               <p>Before we close the Preface, I shall first add two distinctions more, then two more Rules: 3. Give you some Scriptures for your memories cause. 4. Give some directions or helps to those who make conscience to study this Law. 5. Answer and clear a special case.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Then ye would distinguish betwixt this Law as given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and as given to <hi>Israel</hi>; for as given to him it was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, but as given to them it's a Covenant of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so from us now it calls for Gospel-duties, as Faith in Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. Repentance, Hope in God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and although it call for legal duties, yet in a Gospel-manner; therefore we are in the first Commandment commanded to have God for our God, which cannot be by sinners obeyed, but in Christ Jesus, the Covenant of Works being broken, and the tye of Friendship thereby between


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55484:40"/>
God and Man made void; so that now men, as to that Covenant, are without God in the world, and without Christ and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.12, 13. And so our having God for our God, (which is pointed at in the Preface to the Commandments) and Christ for our Saviour, and closing with his Righteousness, and the Promises of the Covenant (which are all Yea and Amen in him) must go together.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Distinguish betwixt the divers Administrations of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and of the Law, in respect of Positives, falling under the second Commandment; for that Commandment tyed the <hi>Israelites</hi> before Christ to Circumcision, Sacrifices, the seventh day of the Week, and other Ceremonies agreeable to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Law, and Covenant of Grace then; but now it forbiddeth them to us, and requireth other duties; for the Priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change also of the Laws belonging thereto; yet that Commandment, as a part of the Moral Law, doth perpetually oblige and tye to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, and none other, and that according to the manner which he prescribes.</p>
               <p>Next unto the Rules already laid down for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Commandments, we add two more.</p>
               <p>The first is, that the Commandments are so to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that none of them may contradict another, that is, there is nothing commanded in one that is forbidden in another, or contrary; one duty doth not justle with nor thrust out another, but they differ only; and then two duties coming together, in that case one of them ceaseth to be a duty for that time, as is said in that distinction of affirmative and negative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>The second Rule is, that all these Commandments bind and call for obedience from men, according to their places, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualifications and circumstances: The fifth Commandment calleth for one thing from a Magistrate, another from a Subject; a Magistrate is to edifie one way, a Minister another, a private Christian another; a Servant is one way to reprove his Fellow-servant, a Master another way: The Law requires more from a man of parts, power and riches, than from another, as to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and improvement of these gifts: The Law being just, has in it a proportionableness to places, parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and sets bounds


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55484:40"/>
to stations, but alters them not, nor confounds them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For the help of your memories, and that ye may have these Rules more obvious, ye may draw them all under these five Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>The first Scripture is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. v. 96. <hi>Thy Commandment is exceeding broad</hi>; which though it be more extensive in its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet it doth certainly include this Law, which in an especial way is <hi>the Commandment,</hi> and in the sense and comprehensive meaning thereof is <hi>exceeding broad</hi>; for it takes in the fulness and extent of the whole Law, in its obligation, as to all things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and duties of all sorts.</p>
               <p>The second Scripture is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. which speaks to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of the Law in the obedience which it calleth for, <hi>the Law is Spiritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Scripture is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. which speaks the perfection of its nature, <hi>the Law is Just</hi>; therefore fretting against what it commandeth, or wishing it were otherwise, is a breach thereof; <hi>It is holy</hi>; therefore to be disconformable unto it, is to be unholy; it's good, and therefore it ought to be loved and delighted in.</p>
               <p>The fourth Scripture is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. and it speaketh the great end of the Law; <hi>The end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure Heart, and a good Conscience, and Faith unfeigned</hi>; which threefold End speaketh out the absolute purity and holiness called for in our love to God and others, so as to have a good conscience in this before God: all which must slow from unfeigned Faith without presumption, resting on Jesus Christ, who is in this sense the end of the Law.</p>
               <p>The fifth Scripture is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8. <hi>The Law is good, if a man use it lawfully:</hi> and this guards against abusing of the Law, and putteth us to the lawful use of it: There are extreams in abusing the Law; as 1. When it is used to seek Righteousness by it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain 2. When the Authority of it is pretended for something it Warrants not, such as the Traditions of the Fathers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. seeking of Salvation by the observation of Circumcision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. When its Authority in practise is denied. 4. When it is turned from practise to vain speculations and questions. 5. When it is so used as it deters and scares from Christ 6. When it is so made use of, as it oppresses and discourages a Believer, for whose sake (1 <hi>T <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 1.19.) it was never made or appointed, as to its threatnings and


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55484:41"/>
condemning Power: And lastly, in a word, when it is not used to the ends, and in the manner expressed, in the former Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Because the study of this Law is so singularly useful, we not only press and commend it, but add further some few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, whereby we may be helped rightly to use it, and to guard against the abuse of it in our hearing and reading of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The first direction is, ye would look on it as God's Word, and take it as if ye heard himself from <hi>Sinai</hi> pronounce it, that so ye may tremble, and be more affected with holy fear when ever ye read, hear it, or meditate upon it; for so was the people affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when it was first promulgate.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Be much in prayer for grace to take up its meaning; <hi>David (Psal.</hi> 119.18. <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> prayed often for this, and thought it not unbecoming a King, yea a believing King, and a Prophet, to study this Law, and pray much for opened eyes to understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In your reading seek to understand so as to practise it, for that is the end of knowledge, and the end the Law it self aims at, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.1, 2. we knowing no more in God's account than what we endeavour honestly to practise; and not aiming at pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, indisposeth both for understanding and practice, and makes men exceeding careless.</p>
               <p n="4">4 As ye hear and learn any thing to be duty or sin, reflect on your selves, and try whether that be sin in you, and how far short ye are in that duty; for this is the proper use of the Law, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal sin and transgression, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. and therefore it is called a <hi>Glass, Jam</hi> 1.23, 24. and ye would look in it so as ye may know what manner of persons ye are, and may know what spots are upon you.</p>
               <p n="5">5 When the Law discovers sin, ye would open your Bosom to let in Convictions; for the Law entered that sin might abound, not in practice, but in sense feeling, and conscience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. and follow these Convictions by repentance, till they necessitate you to fly to Christ, and leave you there.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Take help from Christ's Sermons, and the Prophets, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this Scripture, for they are the only Canonical; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the best Commentary upon the Commandments; yet ye would not despise the light holden forth in humane writings, such


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55484:41"/>
as the larger Catechism, which is very full as to this, and if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably improved, will prove exceeding profitable for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The Grave Case that we would speak unto, before we enter particularly on the Commandments is, whether any of these Commandments may be broken in our sleep, by Dreams, Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which otherwise are unlawful, or whether when a man is sleeping and dreaming he be sub <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ect to the Rule of the Law, and if its obligation extend to him even then? This question hath its own difficulty, and although it be not good to be curious in it, yet it wants not its own profit, as to the peace and quietness of God's people, or to their humbling and stirring upun to repentance, if it be rightly decided. I know almost all run on the negative, as if men were not in the least guilty of sin by such Dreams, upon this ground, upon this ground, because they are not then in a capacity to use and exercise their reason, but that they are in this case as mad, distracted, or frantick men. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be sober in speaking to this; yet I shall adventure to speak my mind a little about it, with the reasons of it.</p>
               <p>And</p>
               <p n="1">1. We say there is a great difference betwixt sleeping dreaming men, and mad-men. 1. Because madness is wholly in it self penal, and is a disease following sinful man as other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases: but so it cannot be said of such dreaming; for as sleep was natural (there being before <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall a Day and a Night as well as now, and there b <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing an instance then of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sleeping) so must dreaming be, being procured by the restlesness of the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the roving of the Imaginations, which is some way natural; but that men dream of such subjects, or that their dreams are of such a nature (as filthy or prophane) seems clearly to follow sin, which dreaming simply doth not; and therefore man is not so passive in this, as in madness. 2. Because in dreams men have more use of Reason than in madness, though (as the School-men say) that use be imperfect, yet as they grant (and Experience confirmeth it, and <hi>Augustine lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Confess.</hi> acknowledgeth it in himself) men may reason and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in sleep, yea sometimes reject some motions, and though dreaming yet not give consent unto them; and that upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which at other times possibly they will imbrace. Hence is it that there is a sort of suitableness and likeness betwixt mens


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55484:42"/>
dreamings, and th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir rational actings when waking; children and mad-men, or men in a distemper, having more foolishness and less reason in dreams than these who have more use of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but wise men in a distraction, and natural fools, have no such difference then: Beside, we conceive that dreaming is more proper to reasonable men than Beasts, and to men that have ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ercise of reason than to children, but madness may be in all.  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Because a mans former carriage in moral things hath much more influence on his dreams when he has clear use of reason, than it can be said to have upon him when in madness, as to the things committed by him in it. 4. Neither is it without some weight, that under the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.10. Sacrifices and Washings were appointed for some sins committed in sleep and dreaming (whatever they be in themselve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) which were not appointed for the sins of such as were frantick: All which put together, and duly considered, we cannot look upon sins, I mean things otherwise unlawful, in dreaming, and sins in distraction, as equal.</p>
               <p>Yet secondly, there be some things that we willingly grant in this matter: As 1. That we do not com <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rehend under these sinful dreams every passing transient thought or motion in sleep, which has meerly an idleness and unprofitableness with it, which though it might possibly be sinful in men waking, (when they should aim in the least thought at something edifying) yet we think dreams that are m <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We come now more particularly to the words which the Lord himself spoke: concerning the number of these Commandments, and general scope of them (as hath been said) there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: but there be four things we would sp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fore we come to speak particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the first Commandment. The first is, whether these words, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. be a part of the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, or a Preface to all the T <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n? <hi>Ans.</hi> We think it is a ground laid down for pressing and drawing sorth our obedience to all the Commandments, yet it hath relation more especially to the first Commandment, as the negative expression there cleareth, which is, <hi>Thou shalt have no other gods before me,</hi> that is, no other than <hi>Me</hi>: what <hi>Me?</hi> even <hi>Me the Lord thy God that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt:</hi> So then there is a special relation betwixt this Commandment and the Preface, as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the positive part of this negative Commandment, and it doth especially clear these three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 What is the right object of worship, it is <hi>Jehova, Elohim, the Lord,</hi> that sheweth the Unity of the Divine Essence; for so <hi>Jehovah,</hi> being a word in the singular number, is ordinarily look't on as pointing out this, then <hi>Elohim,</hi> which is a word in the plural number, speaketh the plurality of Persons in the God-head; so that the Lord commanding and requiring obedience, here is one God, and three Persons.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It cleareth what is the right Channel in which our service should run, it is in the Channel of the Covenant, our obedience


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55484:45"/>
is to be directed, not to God abstractly considered, but to God as our God, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> saith he, and thy God by Covenant; so the expression is, <hi>Deut</hi> 28.58. <hi>That thou mayst fear this glori <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us and fearful Name,</hi> THE LORD THY GOD. This maketh our service and worship sweet and kindly; and without this relation there can be no acceptable service performed by sinful man to God; and that relation (that by the Covenant of Works once stood betwixt them) being broken, it saith it must be made up again, which only can be done in Christ; and it saith also, that this relation to God in him, and obedience to the Law, can consist well together.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It cleareth what is the right and great motive of obedience, to wit, the benefit of Redemption, love and thankfulness, upon that account, constraining to the performing of these duties that are commanded, that they may be done willingly, and in a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be asked, why the second Commandment, and the fourth Commandment, have reasons pressing obedience annexed to them, which none of the other hath, at least expresly set down by the Lord? <hi>Ans.</hi> This may be a reason, because all the other Commandments are by the Law of Nature determined in mens Consciences, and the sins against them are by Natures Light seen to be evil; but the substance of these two, to wit, what way he will be worshipped in externals, and on what day as the solemn time of worship, being determined by Gods posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law, they are not so impressed on mens Consciences as the duties required in the other Commandments are; therefore the Lord addeth reasons to  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ach of these to perswade to the obedience of them; as to the second, <hi>I am a jealou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> God;</hi> and therefore will not admit of any the least appearance of declining from me, even in externals; and to the fourth, keep the Sabbath day, for I have put a difference betwixt it and other days, though before there was none, which is further amplified in the Text: Now by this reason (which is also given by the School-men) it may appear, that the second Commandment concerning outward worship, according to our way of distinguishing them, is distinct from the first, which requireth the inward worship due to God: for the first Commandment is Moral-Natural, and can never be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and has as much impression on a Natural Conscience as


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55484:45"/>
any; and therefore, according to this ground, needed no reason.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It may be observed also, that some Commandments have Promises added to them, which others have not; not that any Commandment wants implied incouragements, but in some they are expressed, as in the second, <hi>He sheweth mercy to thousands, &amp;c.</hi> and in the fifth, <hi>That thy days may be long, &amp;c.</hi> The reason given why Promises are particularly expressed in these two is, that obedience to these two seemeth to bring most hurt  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o men, and is most cont <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ary to th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir corrupt wills and affections, it seemeth not so prejudicial, nor is it so obnoxious to the hatred of the world, that men love God, and fear him in their hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is outwardly to confess him before men, and that by adhering close to the true manner of worshipping him. This maketh men obnoxious to persecutions, prosses, losses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be seriously taken up in the externals of godliness, sometimes bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much prejudice with it, and is to many troublesome, and so to be obedient to Superiours, and tender of Inferiours, is not easily condescended unto; therefore God to counterbalance the difficulti <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that accompany the obedience of these two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hath added Promises to them, the more to incourage and stir up to the obedience of them.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing we would take notice of is, that some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments have threatnings expressed in them, which others have not, as the second, and the third, not that any Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wanteth implied threatnings; but the reason is, because men ordinarily count light of the brea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h of these two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if they be (as they think) honest at the he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t, though they be very negligent and careless in many outward things and though in the manner of worship they be very slight and perfunctorious, yet if it be to the true God, they think the less of it: And so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so men are given to count very light of reverent using God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Holy Name; therefore he hath put a threatning to both these Commandments, to make men know he will not so easily pass them, as men oft times imagine; and that all these three, reasons, promises, threatnings, are added to the second Commandment, it doth very clearly and convincingly shew of what conceinment that Commandment is, and how ready men are to break it, and that there is special consideration and regard to be had to it, so far is it from being to be  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </head>
               <p>IN this first Commandment we may consider these two: 1. The thing commanded. 2. The qualification of the Command.</p>
               <p>The thing commanded is negatively set down, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods,</hi> directing to the right object of worship, and differencing the true God from all supposed Gods; for though there be but one God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet are there many who are <hi>called Gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4, 5, 6. The qualification added, is in these words, <hi>before me</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which tend not only to the aggravation of the sin here discharged, as being done in his presence, and done, as it were, in contempt and despite of God who always sees; but especially to shew the extent of the Prohibition, that it tyeth up not only from outward Idolatry, but even from that which is inward and secret, and that men see not, and is known to God only; and so this Commandment r <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quireth not only external worship, but that which is inward and spiritual before God. Hence the scope of this first Commandment lieth clearly in these two things, (wherein it differeth from the second) to wit, 1. That it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who is the right object of w <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This Commandment, as all the rest, hath a positive part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring something, and a negative part prohibiting something: We shall, in the first place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> speak to what is required here, and we take it up in these three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 And first it requireth the right knowledge of God; for there can be no true worship given to him, there can be no right thought or conception of him, or faith in him, till he be known: He must be known to be one God in Essence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. and three Persons, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. He must be known in his Attributes and Essential Properties, Infiniteness, Immenseness, Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55484:46"/>
Eternity, Omnipotene, Omniscience, Wisdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Justice, and Faithfulness: He must also be known in his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial works, whereby his Soveraignty and Majesty appeareth, as his works of Creation, Providence, Redemption, and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth it; as the Covenant of Grace, and its terms; the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and his Offices: no service or worship can be offered to God, nor can we have any ground of Faith in him, without some measure of distinct knowledge of these.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It requireth from us a suitable acknowledging of God in all these his Properties: As 1. That he be highly esteemed above all. 2. Loved. 3. Feared. 4. Believed and trusted in. 5. Hoped in. 6. Adored. 7. Honoured. 8. Served and obeyed. And so 9. He must be the Supreme end in all our actions, that should mainly be aimed at by us.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It requireth such duties as result from his Excellency, and our acknowledging him to be such a one: As 1. Dependance upon him. 2. Submission to him, and patience under cross Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from him. 3. Faith resting on him. 4. Prayers put up to him. 5. Repentance for wronging him. 6. Communion, and a constant walking with him. 7. D <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lighting in him. 8. Meditating on him; and such other as necessarily may be inferred as duties incumbent to Creatures in such a relation to such a God, whose Excellency and worth calleth and inviteth men to all suitable duties.</p>
               <p>Next, it is necessary that we add some Advertisements to these Generals.</p>
               <p>And</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the Commandment requireth all these, and in the highest and most perfect degree.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That it not only requireth them in our selves, but obligeth us to further them in all others, according to our Places and Callings.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That it requireth the diligent use of all means that may help and further us in these; as Reading, Meditation, Study, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 That these things which in some respect may be given to Creatures, as love, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet when they are required as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, they are required in a far more eminent way; so that Creatures must yield and give place when God cometh in competition with them in these; and these things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God, as resting on him, adoring of him, are to be given to no other.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:55484:47"/>5 All these things are so required, as none of them thrust out another; but that all so consist, as every duty may keep its own place, without prejudice to any other.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we would consider the negative part of this Commandment, for the extent thereof will be best discerned by cons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dering what is forbidden therein, and how it may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: It is indeed the Commandment, in reference to which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the rest, almost the general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty of men think themselves most innocent; and yet upon tryal it will be found, that men are most guilty of the breach thereof: We may look upon the breach of this Commandment more <hi>largely,</hi> as God is any way wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that which is his due; or more <hi>strictly,</hi> as it relateth to that which is more properly Idolatry.</p>

               <p>We shall first speak of practical Heart-idolatry, especially when lawful things are made Idols, which is the most subtil kind of Idolatry, and that which men most ordinarily f <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55484:49"/>
because they have such means; as <hi>Asa</hi> trusted to the Physitians, and not to God, namely in that particular, the cure of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; or as the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. who founded his taking rest to his Soul on his full Barns; and so some trust their standing to such a Great Man who is their Friend: And this is known; 1. By the means to which men betake them in a strait, as when they stand not to make use of sinful means. 2. By what noise they make when they are disappointed. 3. It is known by this, when their leaning on such a Creature marreth their resting on God, and on his Providence. Hence it is hard for men to be rich, and not to place their confidence in riches; and so Christ speaketh of the difficulty of rich mens being saved. 4. Then men trust in their riches, when the having of them maketh them to think themselves the more secure, and maketh them proud and jolly, as if they added some worth to those who profess them, which could not be, if they were not something too much thought of.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fourth way how Creatures are idolized by men, is in their <hi>fear,</hi> when men or events are feared more than God, and fear maketh men sin, or at least keepst them back from duty, in less or more like those Professors, who for fear of the Jews (<hi>John</hi> 12.42.) did not confess Christ.

                  </gap> whom they hate, when they fear more him that can kill the body, than him that can destroy both soul and body. Thus great men and powerful in the world are often idolized, and good and well-qualified men may be made Idols also, when men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so addicted and d <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5 The fifth way of committing this Idolatry is by <hi>service,</hi> when a man is brought under the power of any thing; so what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This may be known 1. By what men are most excessively taken up with, and most careful to fulfil and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish.


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55484:49"/>
2. By looking to what it is for which they will take most pains that they may attain it. 3. By what getteth most of their time and labour. 4. By what overswayeth, and overcometh, or overaweth them most, so that they cannot resist it, though it thrust by duties to God; and when they are never so taken up with <hi>Gods service,</hi> but it indisposeth them when ever they come to immediate worship; it is an evident token that such a thing is the mans Idol.</p>
               <p>These be the most ordinary ways how men fall in this sin of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry: it were hard to speak of all the several Idols which may be loved, feared, rested on too much, and so put in God's room: I shall instance in a few.</p>
               <p>The first is the World, this is the great Clay-Idol that both covetous and voluptuous men hunt after, crying, <hi>Who will sh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ssive desire to have the World's Goods, and to have by these a name in the Earth, is many a mans Idol.</p>
               <p>A second is the Belly, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.19. a shameful God, yet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by the most part of men, who travel for no more but for a portion in this life to fill the Belly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17.14. to win their living, and provide for their Families. To this sort also belongeth Gluttons, Drunkards, Palate-pleasers, (who are lookt upon as the dainty men in the World, abounding alas in our days) being according to Satans Maxim, ready <hi>to give skin for skin, and all they have for their life</hi>; and aiming at no more, <hi>Job</hi> 2.4. Thus Satan thought to have found out <hi>Job</hi> when his riches were quite gone; thus he tempted the Lord Christ to provide Bread in an anxious way; and thus fear of want captivateth many.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third great Idol (which is comprehensive some way of all) is a mans Life, his Honour, Credit, Reputation, Good Name, and Applause in the World; his own Will, Opinion, Tenets, Judgments, whereof men are most tenacious, and will not quit sometimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as the Proverb is) <hi>an inch of their will for a span of their thrift.</hi> Thus men are said <hi>to live to themselves,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15 in opposition to living unto God, when self-respect swayeth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55484:50"/>The fourth is Men of Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have done or may do some considerable good or evil to one, or have something in them eminent beyond others: These oft-times, in regard of the fear, love, or trust men place in them, are made great Idols.</p>
               <p>The fifth is Lawful Contentments, as Houses, Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, unto which men are often too much addicted, and with which they are often too much taken up, even sometimes with that which is in it s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lf very little, and so they prove their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols.</p>
               <p>A sixth is <hi>Self-righteousness,</hi> mens prayers, their repentance, blameless walking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these may get, and often get more of their confidence, and weight of their Eternal Peace, than they should: So the Jews laid the great stress and weight of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon this Idol, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3.</p>
               <p>The seventh may be outward Ordinanc <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s in purity, external forms, and profession of Religion, when men rest upon these, and press not after the Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Jews who cryed up the Temple of the Lord, the Covenant b <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>twixt him and them, and their external relation to him, <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The eighth is any gift of God which he hath bestowed on men, such as Beauty, Strength, Wit, Learning, when men who have them lay too much weight on them, or think too much of them; yea Grace it self, the sense of God's love, and inward peace, may be put in Christ's room, and more sought for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times than Christ himself: Now when these are rested on, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, and he slighted, or when they are missed, and he not delighted in, then they are Idols.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Ease, quietness, and a mans own contentment, is oft-times a great Idol; and it is so when a man is so addicted to his case, as he cannot abide to be troubled, Thus was it with that man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. <hi>Soul take thee rest:</hi> His E <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se was his Idol, and he rested on it, and made it the end of all his buildings, and laying up of goods; but his riches were his Idol, as he grounded his expectation of rest upon that which he possessed: So many idle men who frame their life so as they may not be troubled, though they be no ways profitable, but spend what they have, making this the drift of all they do, that they may have an easie life, when this overswayeth them as their last end, (though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, if they were not wedded to their ease, might be more


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55484:50"/>
profitable) and often with abstaining from, and neglecting of many necessary duties, that they may eschew trouble, it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Idol.</p>
               <p>A tenth is wandering fancies and <hi>Chimera</hi>'s, the mind pleasing it self with them, and delighting to entertain them, and pursuing them from a design to find satisfaction in them, even in such things as never had, nor it may be, can have a being, except in their own imagination and fancy; such are called by <hi>S <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The means and second causes, Physitians, Armies, Ministers, Stars, and Natural Causes, by which God useth to work (by some called <hi>Nature</hi>) are oft-times so trusted and leaned to, as they are made mens Idols; nay by many in these days, Judiciary Astrology, Palmestry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are much studied and doted on, and the Scriptures antiquated and laid aside in a great measure.</p>

An Idol is then most subtil, when it lurketh in the heart, and seateth it self principally in mens mind, aim, and inward contentment, and they inwardly ascribe too much to such a thing, and yet, it may be, in their external practise, there is not much to discover this.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Then are Idols most subtil, when they lye in such things to which some what of fear, love, delight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is allowable, as in lawful things, which may in some measure be lawfully loved, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and sought for.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When they are in negatives, as in Omissions, Ease, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then they are more subtil than when they lye in something men posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively seek after, or in the Commission of something forbidden.</p>
               <p n="4">4 When they pass under a lawful name, as when Pride goeth under the name of Honesty, Anxiety under the name of Lawful Care, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then they are hardly discovered.</p>

opinion so much stuck to, and laid weight on by many.</p>
               <p n="6">6 When it is in means that have been used, or are allowed by God for attaining such an end; as it is hard to keep bounds in this case, so it is hard to discover the Idolatry of the heart in it.</p>
               <p>In all which it is to be advertised, that Idolatry in these things consisteth mostly in the inordinateness of the heart, and affections to them, and that it lyeth not so much in our actions about them, as in the manner of our acting, and the circumstances ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying us and our actions, anxiety, estimation, excessive care, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For clearing the difference betwixt this idolatrous love, fear, service, and true love, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take these Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1 When our love to Creatures drowneth our love to God, and maketh us to cast off duties we owe to him, as in <hi>Demas.</hi> 2. When in part it marreth us in the performance of duties to God, as in <hi>Eli.</hi> 3. When it so taketh us up in our practise throughout the day, that we give not necessary time to the Worship of God, in praying, reading, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. When it indisposeth for these; so that when we are praying or hearing, the heart is carried away after Creatures, and the mind is taken up with some other thing than God, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33.31. 5. When they too much, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily haunt the heart in meditation, or when we lye down or rise, and at such times when our thinking on such imployments contributeth not to the furtherance of them, it sheweth that they have too much of the heart when they possess it always, and when it is seldom taken up actually with better things, but these steal in easily and at all times.</p>
               <p>It may appear now 1. How common this sin of Idolatry is. 2. How great guilt and hazard men are lying under thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 1. Few are convinced of it. 2. Many years Idolatry lyeth together upon the Consciences of many. 3. There is little repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it, though many ways one may insensibly slide into it.</p>
               <p>It is not so very useful or needful here particularly to enquire what Idol is predominant, and hath chief room, if these three things be granted. 1. That there may be, and are many Idols of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at once, as Legions distracting the man, and swarming in his heart. 2. That successiv <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st; and because God's Soveraignty is holden forth here, there is no sin that may not be reduced to it, as being a disobedience to this Soveraign God: We shall first permit some general ways whereby it is broken, then insist in some particulars.</p>
               <p>More generally it is broken three ways, as hath been said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p n="1">1 By derogating from God that which is his due; so all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of him, disobedience to him, wronging his infinite Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as if he were nor Omnipotent, Omniscient, Infinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> denying of his Providence in less or more, are breaches of this Commandment. Thus he is wronged, when he getteth not every way that which is his due.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By attributing to God what is not consistent with his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Perfection, Purity, and Holiness, as that he doth or can do wrong, change, not keep his Promises, or not guide the World wisely; that he hath any bodily shape, or may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When what is due to God, as Faith, Hope, Love, Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is given to Creatures, whether to idols li <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

answer, Love may be given to some things, and naturally is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for to some things; but 1. Not simply, but with subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God; not for themselves, but out of obedience to God; and as they may be useful to us in helping us to honour him, and as they are his gifts. 2. We are not excessively to love or rest on these, but so, as from love to God, we be ready to quit, yea to hate them, as Christ speaketh of Father and Mother, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. Again, there may be some kind of confidence given to some things; but 1. Not simply, nor 2. For themselves. 3. Nor always. 4. Nor in all things; but 1. This confidence must be subordinate to God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. 2. It must be with dependance on his blessing for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king means effectual, and so may we expect health from Mea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Drink, Physick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for so they are looked on as means condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to such an end, and yet it is the Lord alone that must be rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on. 3. There may be comparative confidence, whereby men lean more to one mean than to another, as more to a skilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian than to an unskilful, and more to an Army, as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an Enemy, than when it is wanting, because that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is in some external thing, and concerneth not Salvation, and but compareth means amongst themselves, as they are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily made use of by God for attaining these ends; but in this case the means are not simply confided in.</p>
               <p>Next, we are to consider that this Command may be broken all these ways in four respects.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In Doctrine; as when men maintain such things as disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, or give his due to Creatures, and do teach them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33. to 38.</p>

               <p n="3">3 Though it come not to a setled judgment, but only reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the imaginations; so that loose unbecoming thoughts of God, or misapprehensions derogatory to him are  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntertained; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.29.</p>
               <p n="4">4 In practise, when men live as if there were no God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. v. 1. as if he were not omniscient, just, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these do indeed deny him, whatev <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:55484:52"/>Therefore, in the third place, we are to consider, that this Commandment, in the extent thereof, doth condemn 1 All gross Idolaters of any sort, who usually are mentioned under the name of Heathens. 2. Jews, who worship not the true God in his Son Jesus Christ. 3. All Hereticks, that deny the Godhead of any of the Persons; as <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who make but one Person; <hi>Arrians,</hi> who make Christ a Made-God; <hi>Ph <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All prophane men, whether Atheists in heart or in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, disobedient persons indeed denying God, and not giving him his due, which is obedience, whatever in words they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess concerning him. 5. All Hypocrites, who give him but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side service, and so are not in their obedience sincere and perfect as before him. 6. All Compacters with the D <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vil, who consult him, or who leave God's way, and seek to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any thing by an unlawful way; which is 1. To meddle with God's Secrets when he has not revealed them. 2. It is to be beholden to God's Enemy, the Devil, for revealing such things. 3. It is a making use of an unwarrantable mean, which has no bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Promised to it; therefore cannot be used as a mean with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to God, even though the matter enquired after by such means, or by the Devil, be such as he may know. 7. All charming by-words, herbs, or such means as God hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that end, or which have no Natural and Physical Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy for bringing it forth; as in seeking health from Witches, when there must be words so often repeated, or they must be said fasting, or going backward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all laying weight on these, or the like circumstances, without any reason. 8. All Spells, fearing of events, and using superstitious means to prevent these, as lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bits of Timber at doors, carrying a Bible meerly for a Charm, without using it, esteeming days and times unlucky and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; these draw men off from God to some other thing: Of this sont is all Divining by Lots, Stars, Rods; or any other way, not having a Warrant, to find out some secret, or to know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55484:53"/>
that is to come; (it being God's Property and Prerogative to declare what is to come, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 41.) for when there is no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, no Reason in the mean used, the Effect must be looked for, either from God, or from the D <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence sometimes one Charm or word to one at one time, will do what it never doth to another: These means have alway some circumstance in word or action immediately and explicitly, or implicitly flowing from the Devil, which may be good in it self, yet has no force for the end, and so draweth men to own the Devils Institution, which is exceeding derogatory to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God.</p>

When we want these Graces, or perform not these duties required. 2. When they are counterfeited, and not real; as when our humility is not real, our prayers not sincere, but in shew only. 3. When they are defective, as to the measure of Knowledge, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we should be at. 4.

               <p n="1">1 That we may the better understand the breaches of this Commandment, we would first take a view of God's Excellency and Attributes, and see how we sin against all these, for we should walk worthy of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10.

of his Attributes, which are all sinned against, either by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or by omission of something they call for, or by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of something unbecoming them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Consider God in his relations to us, how often is he sinned against as a Father? how is his kindness abused, and he not reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced as Creator of whom we have our Being? yea, he is kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against, and we live not to him from whom and by whom we live; he is a Husband, and yet we go a whoring from him, and prove unfaithful in all our tyes to him; he is a Redeemer of his People, and a Master and Lord of all, but what fear, love, subjection getteth he from us, notwithstanding of all these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Consider God's works for us, about us, and to us, of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Providence, and Redemption, besides his particular Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations both of Mercies and Judgments, all which call for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing suitable from us; and yet every one of them is more way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5 Consider his Will revealed in his Word, and see how far short we are in performing it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, consider what care there is of using the means that may bring us near to, and abstaining from those things that draw us away from God, such as sinful Confederacies, evil Company, light and unsound Books, travelling needle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the knowledge of God being the ground of all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>For clearing of it, consider that some things concerning God are kept up from us, other things are revealed to us; these things which are kept up from us we cannot know: And 1. They are either such as we cannot see now, because they are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible in themselves, as God's infinite Nature and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which as they are in themselves, cannot be comprehensibly conceived, no not in heaven; but while we are upon earth, we see but darkly, as through a glass, and our knowledge of him is rather Faith than sight; or they are such things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable, but God has not thought good to reveal them unto men; as when he will  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>science than Ignorance, which implieth a privation of knowledge which men ought to have; or 2. These things concerning God are such as not only in themselves may be known, but such as we ought to know, because they are revealed to us; ignorance of these is sinful: As 1. Being a disconformity to that knowledge and holiness after which God created us. 2. A fruit of original sin. 3. A cause of many sins. 4. A disconformity to the Law, which requireth us so to know and acknowledge God as he has revealed himself to us; and that in his Essence, in the Trinity of Persons, in his Attributes, Covenants, works of Creation and Redemption, and in his Relations to us; and that we should so know him, that we may thereby know our selves also: And this is that great duty called for in this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we may know him, and his will.</p>
               <p>Again, this ignorance, as to these things, we ought to know, may be looked on as threefold, according to the diversity of its causes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 There is a natural ignorance that is the fruit of our natural corruption and blindness, which hath seized on mens memories and judgments, and, as they think, incapacitateth them to learn, and indeed doth so, as to the spiritual and saving up-taking of the matters of God, till the eyes of the mind be opened by the power of Grace.</p>

In not submitting chearfully to God's way with us, but repining against it. 3. In wishing things had fallen out otherwise than God hath disposed. 4. In limiting God, and prescribing to him, thinking that things might have been better otherwise. 5. In not behaving himself thankfully for what he doth, even when his Dispensations are cross and afflicting.</p>

               <p>THis Commandment is more largely set down than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, partly to clear the Mandatory part of it, and partly to press it; in which two it may be taken up.</p>
               <p>The preceptive, or commanding part, is expressed in two things, v. 4. and v. 5. at the beginning. 1. That no Image be made: And 2. That it be not worshipped.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:55484:57"/>Next, it is pressed three ways: 1. From a reason. 2. By a threa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ning. 3. By a Promise: The words are multiplied, that they may the more fully and clearly express what is intended.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That this Commandment is against all making of Images for Religious service, is clear from a threefold extent mentioned in the Prohibition. 1. The Image of nothing in heaven above, or the earth beneath, or under the earth; that is, the similitude of no Creature is allowed for this end.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Men are forbidden to make either <hi>similitude or likeness,</hi> that is, no sort of Image, whether that which is ingraven in, or hewn out of stone, wood, silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that which is made by painting, all kinds are discharged.</p>
               <p n="3">3 No sort of worship or service religious is to be given to them, wh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That we may have the clearer access to the meaning and use of this Commandment; let us see 1. What is the scope of it. 2. Wherein it is differ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The scope of this Commandment is not meerly and only to forbid making and worshipping of Images, which is the most gross way of abusing the worship of God; but under that to forbid all manner of grosness in the external worship of God, and to command exactness and preciseness in it (as well as internal worship) according to the Rule pr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ribed thereunto by the Lord; and so this Commandment includeth all externals commanded in the Ceremonial Law, and doth forbid all will-worship and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition in the worship of God, all hono <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ring him by precepts taught by men, and not by himself, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 29.13. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. So then in the first Commandment the worshipping of the only true God is commanded, and the worshipping of any Idol is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: here the true worship of that God is prescribed, and the contrary forbidden; the first Commandment sheweth who is to


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55484:58"/>
be worshipped, the second how he is to be worshipped, not in the manner that Heathens worshipped their Idols, nor in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner that men shall feign and devise to themselves, but in the manner he himself prescribeth.</p>
               <p>In sum, this Commandment holdeth forth these three things. 1. That God will not only be served inwardly in the heart, by good thoughts and intentions (which is prescribed in the first Commandment) but also outwardly in the confessing him before men, in external service and worship, in words and gestures suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for the forbidding this sort of external gestures, worshipping and bowing before Idols, doth include the contrary affirmative in all its kinds (according to the first Rule before-mentioned for the right understanding of all the Commandments.) Thus it taketh in all Ordinances of Word, Prayer, Sacraments, Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and failing in these, breaketh this Commandment, when even they are not rightly gone about.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It holdeth forth this, that in that external service and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, God will not have men following their own humour, but will have them to walk by the Rule given, or to be given by him to them, and otherwise it is in vain whatever worship men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. Hence it is said here, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self,</hi> that is, at thy own pleasure, without my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, otherwise what is by God's Command is made to him; and this is to be extended to all Ordinances, yea both to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it self, and also to the manner of that worship, all is to be done according to God's Command only.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It holdeth forth a spiritual service due to God, or that we should be spiritual in all external service, there should not be in us any carnal apprehensions of God, as if he were like any thing that we could imagine, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.29. as is fully clear from <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also all rashness and carnality in external performances is here discharged under <hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing to Images, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, under these three, we take up the sum of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, whereby it differeth from the former, which may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be cleared from these reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The first is, that this Commandment looketh to external worship, and the ordering of that; which is clear: 1. Because the things forbidden in it, as making of Images, and bowing to them, are external acts. 2. These are mentioned as relating to


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55484:58"/>
God's Worship, for they are placed in the first Table of the Law, and for this end Images are only mentioned, as made use of by Heathens in all their worship, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.1. The Lord will not have his people doing so to him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.3, 4, 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Add, that making and worshipping of Images are but one part of mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing of the external worship of God, which is mentioned for all of that kind (as Adultery is pat for all uncleanness in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Commandment) and all kinds of false worship, or all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways of mens abusing the external worship of God are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned under it. 1. Because it is most gross, and this being a most gross way of adding to his worship, it serveth to shew, how God accounteth every adding to his word, or altering of it, to be a gross and hainous sin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.23, 24, 25. 2. Because the Nations about, especially <hi>Egypt,</hi> served their Gods so, and men naturally are bent to it, as appeareth almost by the practise of all Nations; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by the Israelites practise in the Golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. from v. 1. to v. 7. and by <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s practise, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.28. Now the Lord will not be served so, but as he commandeth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. v. 4. <hi>Ye shall not do so to the Lo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, &amp;c.</hi> but contrarily, v. 5. as the Lord shall carve out unto you.</p>
               <p>A second reason to clear this to be the meaning, may be taken from the perfection of the Law, which lieth in this, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth all sin, and commandeth all d <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ies: now it is a sin not only to worship false Gods, but to worship the true God in a false way; and it is a duty also to worship him rightly, according as he hath appointed in his Word: now these sins must be forbidden in this second Commandment, or they are forbidden in none at all; and these duties must be commanded in this Commandment, or they are commanded in none.</p>
               <p>Next, that we may clear, that it is sinful to worship God other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than he hath commanded, it would be observed, there was a twofold Idolatry found in <hi>Israel,</hi> and condemned in the Scripture: the first was, when Groves and Images were planted, and made to Idols; and so the people of <hi>Israel</hi> did often to the Heathen Gods: the second was, when they had Groves, and worshipped in high places, but not to Idols, but to the Lord their God, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.17. so in that place before cited, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you will find two things forbidden. 1. Making of Images to the false Gods, which the <hi>Canoanites</hi> worshipped. 2. Making use of their


<pb facs="tcp:55484:59"/>
manner of worship, and turning it unto the true God, both are forbidden, the first by the first Commandment, the last by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; compare <hi>ver.</hi> 8. (which holdeth forth this scope) <hi>Ye shall not do, every man what seemeth right in his own eyes,</hi> with what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and With <hi>ver.</hi> 30. &amp; 31, <hi>See th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u enquire not how these Nations worshipped their gods,</hi> to wit, by Images, <hi>&amp;c. as  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f ye would do so to the Lord,</hi> no, bat <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>Whatsoever thing I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, observe to do it, tho <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> shalt not adde thereto nor diminish from it,</hi> which cleareth the scope of this Command, as being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely there opened up, <hi>Ye shall not do so to the Lord your God,</hi> wherein more is comprehended than is expressed, namely, not onely ye shall not serve the Lord, as they do their gods, but also ye shall serve him, as he himself prescribeth.</p>
               <p>Hence will it clearly appear, that this command is to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a distinct command from the former, because 1. It containeth distinct matter, forbiddeth sins of another kind, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth duties of another kind. 2. Because they are certainly ten in number, and there cannot be such a reckoning made up if these first two be one, it being clear (as after will appear) that the last is only one, and cannot be divided into two. 3. Beside, it is the the common reckoning of the ancient Jewes as may be seen from <hi>Josephus lib.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> and others; This then being laid down as a truth; we shall 1. shortly put by some Questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Images for clearing the words. 2. Come particularly to shew, what is required and what is forbidden in this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and how we break it in our ordinary practice, T <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Concerning Images two things are to be enquired. 1. If no Image be lawful? and if any be lawful, what these be? 2. If any use, especially religious, of Images be lawful? and if adoration of any kind be to be given to them; We say for Answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That making of Pictures of Creatures, which are visible, or may be comprehended, or historical phansies (to speak so) such as the senses and elements use to be holden forth by (which are rather Hieroglyphicks th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55484:59"/>
1. When such Pictures are obscene and filthy, and against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian modesty to behold, such break this Commandment, but more especially the seventh, because as filthy communication doth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the ears, so do they the eyes. 2. When men become prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in their bestowing either too much time, or too much expence on them. 3. When they dote too much on them by curiosity, and many other wayes they may be abused; but especially in the fourth place, if they be abused to any religious use, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unlawful, as afterward shall be cleared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though making of Images simply be not unlawful and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by this Commandment, yet thereby every representation of God (who is the Object to be worshi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Because such Images cannot but beget carnal thoughts of God, (as <hi>Acts</hi> 6.19.) contrary to this Commandment. 2.

Because it is impossible to get a bodily likeness to set him out by, who is a Spirit and an infinite Spirit, so then every such image must be deroga <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ory to God, as turning the Glory of the invisible God, to the Shape of some visible and corruptible Creature, which is condemned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22, 23. for every Image supposeth some likeness; Now there can be no conceivable or imaginable likeness betwixt God and any thing, that we can i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We are now to clear the second question, If any worship may be given, and what worship is due to Images of any sort? and if it be not a breach of this command to give any religious worship to any of them? that we may answer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider there was a twofold worshipping of Images even amongst Heathens, The first was more gross, when the worship was given to the Image, as being some godhead of it self, thus some think the Images of <hi>Baal, Ashteroth,</hi> &amp;c. and particular Images, that have special names, were worshipped, thus are men said properly to worship the works of their hands, this is against the first commandment. 2. There was a worshipping of Images as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting God, and so the worship was gone about as a part of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done to the true God, such was (in conformity to the Heathens practice) the worship given to the Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to 7. and such were the Groves and Sacrificings in the high places, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.17.</p>
               <p>More particularly there is an immediate worshipping of Images


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55484:61"/>
as Idols, when they in themselves, or for themselves are worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and secondly there is a mediate worshipping of Images for that which they represent, when men worship something in them or signified by them.</p>
               <p>This again may be distinguished with respect to the object, when the worship is directed either first to a false god, or else se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to the true God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider, that there are divers sorts of worship given to the Images of the True God, or of Saints. 1. Some religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which is more than civil, yet not that which is due to God, such <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giveth them for themselves properly, and calleth it <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. Consider what that is which is called religious worship, it dis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ereth from civil and politick worship (such as is given to living men, yea from that civil respect which one will give to the Image of a King, or of one they love, which is not properly worship even civil) and consisteth in other circumstances of a religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration; and it may be known to differ from what is Civil, by these things. 1. By the thing to which the worship is given, that is, if it be a thing, which passeth not under a Civil, but under a religious account, as bowing to a living man is one thing, to a Saints Image, a Sacrament, or such like, which have nothing in them, calling for civil honour, is another thing; and therefore, if any honour be given them it must be on another account. 2. By the actions, wherein we give such worship, as if it be in prayer or in worshipping of God, or in sacrificing, it is one thing to bow then to or before an Image or man, and another thing to do it when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally or historically we are relating something or doing some civil business, as tying the shoo or such like. 3. By the sort of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that has been given to Idols or used in religious service to God, and not suitable for any civil respect to such an object, as bowing the knee uncovering the head, praying, building Temples, altars, making Vows unto them, or before them, swearing by them, or before them, carrying them about with us because of some religious influence they

               <p n="4">4. Consider, that what is said of Images may be said of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and things to which divine honour, or religious worship in the service of God is attributed, for if the one fall all will by this Commandment be overturned, such as 1. Worshipping of Angels or Saints by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as Mediators and helps in our serving the true God. 2. All adoration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Martyrs, such as their bones, dust, cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the adoration of the very Cross (as they say) where on Christ suffered, which hath by Papists a divine sacrifice offered to it, and a divine worship given it in the highest degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.

               <p>For further clearing of this purpose we shall speak to a question which here necessarily occurreth; namely, whether these things mentioned, being worshipped by any sort of religious service, whether directly or indirectly for themselves or for such things to which they relate, or which they signifie, even when men pretend the worship is not given to them, but ultimately referred to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the true God, whether I say worshipping them so, be not Idolatry and a breach of this Commandment?</p>
               <p>In answering this question, 1. We shall clear that there may be, and is Idolatry committed with Images, and means of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, even in such worship wherein the Images which men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are not accounted gods, but only representations of God, and although these means of worship, which they worship are made use of in serving the true God. 2. We shall clear, that all such service, as being Idolatry is forbidden by this command, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be distinguished. If it be performed as religious service, though some such service be more gross, and other some more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and refined.</p>
               <p>First then, That there is such a kind of Idolatry in worshipping of Images, when men rest not on the Images, but direct their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to the God represented by them, we may clear it divers wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:55484:62"/>And 1. From the Heathens, who though some did, yet all of them did not accotnt their Images their gods, but only some representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, and first we may gather this from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22, 23. where it is said of them, 1. That they knew God, and yet 2. That they turned the glory of that incorruptible God into the similitude of Beasts and men, corruptible creatures. Their fault is not that they accounted these representations or Images, which they made gods, but that they declined in their worship, in the worshipping of the true God by such Images.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may also appear by the frequent changes of their Images, while they retained their former gods, and by their multiplying Images of one sort, and divers sorts to one and the same god, and by their giving all these Images one name, and when it is said that <hi>Solomon</hi> and other Kings set up Images to <hi>Asht <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>roth, Baal,</hi> &amp;c. It cannot be thought they supposed these Images to be the very gods themselves which they worshipped, but that they were only set up for their honour, <hi>Kings</hi> 23.13. And when <hi>Manasses</hi> made Chariots to the Sun, he supposed them not to be to the Sun, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.11. Yea was not this commonly acknowledged that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 19.39. and that that Image came down from him, but was not he, nor yet the feigned Goddess <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It may appear by the Heathens own confession, and the shifts they used, when they were charged with the worshipping the works of their hands, as 1. They used to say they worshipped but the <hi>Numen</hi> or god which was in them, and which invisibly after their dedication of them (and not before) dwelt in them; yea, some of them would say, they neither worshipped that Image, nor any devil, but by a bodily sign they beheld what they should worship. 3. When Christians further urged them, that what was signified by their Images was not the true God, but a creature, as by <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Sea; by <hi>Vulcan,</hi> the Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They reply <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d it was not those bodies which they worshipped, but the gods which governed them. So <hi>Augustine, Psal.</hi> 113. <hi>nobis</hi> 115 concerning the Idols of the Gentiles, and <hi>Augustine de Civitat. Dei lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. where he sheweth that <hi>Varro</hi> giveth that reason, why the gods where rather pourtrayed in mans picture (though they were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) because, saith he, mans Soul is a spirit and cometh nearest them, and the body is the vessel of the Soul, and therefore is used to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it. See <hi>Chrysost.</hi> 1. <hi>Eph. Hom.</hi> 18. <hi>Andrews</hi> on 2. Command. <hi>August.</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 96 (<hi>nobis</hi>) 97.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:55484:63"/>And it may also 4. appear from this, That the Heathen gods for the most part (even those of them that were most commonly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped) were some famous men, after death supposed to be Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to whom they made statues and Images, and yet still the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was intended to those to whom they appointed the Images, though they supposed that their gods in an especial manner dwelt in these Images, and answered from them.</p>
               <p>In the second place this may be made to appear from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.31. where the Lord forbiddeth not onely the worshipping of Idols, but of himself by Images, <hi>Thou shalt not do so to the Lord thy God,</hi> that is thou shalt not worship me by Images as the Heathen do their gods, and therefore this is not only possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but is also, and that most certainly, a grievious guilt, even though they pretended it was not Idols but God they worshipped; yet it was not so they worshipped not him but the Idol.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We shall clear it yet further, That the true God may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped (by Idolaters) as they pretend, and yet in Gods account their worship is nothing but Idolatry committed with their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</p>
               <p>We shall give four instances of this. The first is from <hi>Exodus</hi> 32. where it is clear, 1. That the image they set up was not it self ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be God, but as something to represent the true God, for 1. It cannot be thought their minds were so soon darkened as altogether to forget what God had done, and to imagine that the thing which was new made with hands was God, though they be charged with forgetting God, because they were practical forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of him, and their sin did speak it out indeed. 2. The image is called <hi>Jehovah</hi> that brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was a mercy past before the Calf had a being, and therefore the reason why they gave it this name, must certainly be, because they aimed by it to represent <hi>Jehovah.</hi> 3. It is not likely that now they would have worshipped the gods of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or that they would have attributed their delivery from <hi>Egypt</hi> to them, seeing these gods were also plagued; also that <hi>Aaron</hi> should do so is incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who yet joyned with them in this transgression. 4. Beside can it be thought, that so soon they thought it to be God, and yet so easily afterwards passed from it? certainly the words, <hi>That it may go before us,</hi> that is, not to <hi>Egypt,</hi> but <hi>Canaan,</hi> whether God called them, do clearly imply, that they looked on it only as a representation of <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:55484:63"/>2. It is clear that they sacrificed burnt Offerings and peace Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings before this image, and this was the same service which was due to the Lord, and so it was proclaimed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.5. and therefore it was to the Lord, and not to the image (for it self) that they sacrificed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is clear that they are charged for <hi>turning out of the way,</hi> and that because of their <hi>making a molten image,</hi> which seemeth to infer, that their guilt was rather in the manner of worship and making of that image for worship <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, than in quitting God alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and thus they grosly failed in the manner of worshipping him, by occ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>si <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n of <hi>Moses</hi> his absence, for now they want that sign of Gods presence, which formerly they had, and have not such a visible commerce (as it were) with God, it is that they complain of. and this want of a visible sign (and not of God simply) do they intend to make up by this image.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This may be further confirmed from <hi>Acts</hi> 7.40, 41, 42. where it is said, that because of this si <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they were given up to gross idolatry which could not be, had this been idolatry of the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sort.</p>
               <p>The Second instance is from <hi>Judges</hi> 17. where you will find that that Idol, which <hi>Micah</hi> made is not by him or his Mother accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted God, but is made use of by them, as they think, for furthering them in Gods service, as appeareth, 1. From this, that it getteth not the name of any strange god. 2. That he seeketh a Levite for a Priest to it, and promiseth to himself Gods blessing from that, not that the Idol would bless him, but <hi>Jehovah, ver.</hi> 13. 3. That it is said, the Priest asked counsel of <hi>Jehovah</hi> for the <hi>Danites, Judges</hi> 18.6.</p>
               <p>The Third instance is that of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who did sin and made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin, by the Calf he set up at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> that they were not intended to be worshipped as Idols, for themselves, but as means, whereby they might be helped to worship the true God, may appear, 1. From <hi>Jeroboams</hi> motive, which was not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the people from the true God, at least as he supposed, or to make them alter their God, but to alter their manner of worship, and to divert them from going up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship, from which his fear of their revolt to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> arose; hence the Calves are not provided to prevent worshipping of God, but are put in place of their going up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; as the colour of reason pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him for this alteration sheweth; and so one service is


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55484:64"/>
put for another, without changing their God, and all the reproofs that his sins meeteth with from the Prophets run at this, that he altered the manner of Gods worship in putting up new signs in new places, and appointing new sacrifices and Priests. 2. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from this, that as it was distinct from that way of serving God, which was in <hi>Judah,</hi> so was it from the way of the Heathens, yea from the way used by such idolatrous Kings as <hi>Achab,</hi> who are said to do worse; because they did set up strange gods (which the Calves are not called) and <hi>Baalim</hi>; and <hi>Jehu</hi> when he destroyed the false Gods, yet he retained this manner of Worship; and there were no cause to discriminate <hi>Jeroboams</hi> sin from <hi>Achabs,</hi> or to look upon it as any thing lesser, if all the difference had been only in the change of worshipping the image of one Idol into the worshipping of the image of another, but the difference was in this, that the one worshipped the true God in these images, the other Idols indeed. 3. Hence there was still some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in that land, and Prophets sometimes sent them by the Lord, yea when they were led captive, and others sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their place, it is said 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They learned the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the god of the land, that is th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> true God though they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted themselves with serving their Idols also, and thus the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> continued worshipping they knew not what, though they pretended to worship the true God, <hi>John</hi> 4.22.</p>
               <p>The Fourth instance is that corrupt practice used sometimes in <hi>Judah</hi> of setting up high places and groves, when yet they did not th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reby intend to serve Idols, but the true God, and yet they are reproved for this as a gross Corrupting of the worship of God.</p>
               <p>And it would seem clear sometimes in <hi>Judah</hi> and often in <hi>Israel,</hi> even when they are charged with idolatry, that yet the knowledge of the true God, was not obliterate among them, nor they so bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish in their worship as other Nations about them; we take it then for a clear truth, that they often did worship the true God, by images, when they did not worship the images directly.</p>
               <p>The Second thing may be easily cleared and made out, to wit, that all worshipping of God by images though the worship be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be given to the true God, and not to the image but to the thing signified or represented by the image, is yet unlawful and idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry, forbidden by this commandment what ever sort of worship it be, if it be religious, as hath been said, and this we shall make out by these Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:55484:64"/>The first is from the general scope of this Command, which is to forbid not only the over-turning of Gods Services, but also all Will-worship, though mixed in with the Service (as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that was which is mentioned, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. of worshipping Angels, which yet was so subtile that they pretended, they were far from taking from God any thing that was his due) that this is the scope of this Command, is clear from <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.8 where the Lord forbiddeth men in his Worship <hi>To do what seemeth good to every one in his own Eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But so it is, that the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God before Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Will-worship, <hi>&amp;c.,</hi> till it be shewen that it is prescribed by God.</p>
               <p>Secondly: That way of Worshiping God is clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the more particular scope of this Command; which is first, to discharge all gross thoughts of God or his Service; which scope, As it sayeth, God cannot dwell in Temples, So, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can He be worshiped by mens hands, that is, by Images made with mens hands, as these in <hi>Athens</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.24, 25. For they ignorantly worshiped the true God; 2. To shew that he should not be served as Idolaters served their Gods by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4, &amp; 12.30, 31, 32. This binds us to the Word for all institute worship, but especially restraineth us from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, their way of worship as well as from their Idols, <hi>Thou shalt not do so to the Lord thy God:</hi> Note, that <hi>So</hi> set down, <hi>v.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> relateth to Groves, Images, High places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which place doth not only discharge such Service to be given to Idols, but the giving of any such Service to God himself, who will have no such Service: And if it be clear, that worshipping him by Groves and High places be condemned, why not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping him by Images also? for the prohibition <hi>So,</hi> looketh to all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: This Command hath a general prohibition in it, that leaveth no Image out, whether of God, Saint, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing for any Religious use under whatsoever shape: For 1. It dischargeth the making of any Image of any thing, for any Religious use. 2. It dischargeth all Worship to be given them, whether outward by <hi>Bowing,</hi> or inward by <hi>Servico,</hi> or whatsoever followeth on these; and therefore no distinction used by Idolaters can salve the matter, or avoid the strength of this Command, especially considering that it directeth men in


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55484:65"/>
the manner how they should serve the true God, and doth not simply prescribe who is to be acknowledged as true God, which is done by the first Command.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: If by this Command Heathenish Idolatry, or the Serving God by Images be condemned? then the serving of God by Images also amongst Christians is here condemned; But the Heathens serving God by Images, is here condemned, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If it be answered that Heathens did represent by their Images that which was not God, and that this was their fault? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 1. It is not like that all did so, nor that any at first did so; but some had a notion of the invisible God-head, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they changed it into an Image like to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Creature. 2. Yet here the Argument holdeth; If Heathens, who worshiped, suppose, <hi>Jupiter, Vulcan,</hi> &amp;c. and their Images of Gold, Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were holden for Idolaters, not only as worshiping <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and these Idols which were so represented, but also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as worshipping Gold and Silver, and such Images and things as they made use of to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present them; then also Christians must be said not only to worship what is represented, by those Images, but the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges themselves, and so to be guilty of Idolatry on that account: the Reason will hold alike in both; and if their Exception, that they worshipped not the Images, but what they represented did not exempt them from being found guilty of worshipping such Images in particular; neither will Christians upon that Plea be found exeemed from this guilt; for, a <hi>quatenus ad omno valet consequentia.</hi>

Argument: If that Idolatry committed by the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilderness, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. and that which was set up in <hi>Israel</hi> by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and that of <hi>Manlisses,</hi> 2 Chron. 33. be to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Idolatry; then that which is practised amongst the Papists in worshipping of their Images, and God by them, is to be condemned as Idolatry: But the former is condemned in Scripture as gross Idolatry, because it falleth off, and declineth from the way of worship the Lord hath prescribed, and turned Gods People like to Idolaters in their way; therefore also the latter is to be condemned as Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:55484:65"/>There is no exception which the Papists give in here against this Argument, but the like might have been given by the <hi>Israelites.</hi>

               <p>For</p>
               <p n="1">1. If they say, They worshiped not the true God before these Images, that is answered already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they say, it was condemned because they represented him by such Images, that is not enough: For 1. The Command forbiddeth all Images of any thing: 2. The opposition men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou sawest no likeness, or Image, but heard'st a Voyce,</hi> hath no middle, but argueth against all alike: Hence these Images, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. that had Noses and Mouths, but smelled not, and spoke not, were condemned as well as those complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If they say, It was not lawful then, but is lawful now; this were to say, that the Gospel admitteth of more Carnal Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than the Law, whereas its Service is more spiritual without all doubt.</p>
               <p>From all which, we may clearly conclude, that in such Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice there is a two-fold Idolatry committed: 1. In that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of some holiness and venerability that is supposed to be in such Images, reliques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Religious worship (though inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to what is attributed to God) as given to them for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, according to the Decrees of that second Counsel of <hi>Nice</hi>: 2. In that they pretend by such Service to worship the true God, though in an Idolatrous manner forbidden by him, besides what <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his followers maintain, who give to the Images of God, Christ, <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Cross, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> scandal to others; for, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> (speaking against the expressions used by Heathens from <hi>Psal.</hi>

(after he hath rejected their Images, and their interpretation, and excuses also) sayeth, <hi>he who worshippeth and prayeth towards an Image is an Idolater</hi>; for, <hi>who</hi> saith he, <hi>worshippeth and prayeth towards an Image, who is not affected with it as if it heard him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In short then, the Idolatry that striketh against this Command, may be summed up in these particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When by some visible sign, representation, or Image, the God-head is wronged as being thereby made like to it; this is

               <p n="2">2. When by our worship we tye the presence of the true God, to some Place, Image, Statue, or Relique, as if they had somthing in them, or communicated to them more divine than any other thing; or, as if God heard our Prayers better at Images, and by them; or as if there were a more special pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nted by them; as Heathens supposed their Gods dwelt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly in their Images, and did answer them there. Now the supposing that there is in any thing somthing venerable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of such respect, is the ground of all Idolatry; the inward leaning to it, and trusting in it, is against the first Command; but the outward  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xpressing of this esteem and trust is against the second Command: Thus men sin in praying to things that are (though rational Creatures) as Angels and Saints; or to things that are not, as empty Images that have no Deity dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, or to lifeless Creatures, as the Cross, Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is Idolatry, when Idolatrous worship, used in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Idols, is given to God contrary to his Command; so <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.30, 31. <hi>Thou shalt not do so to the Lord thy God</hi>; and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.17. Their keeping up of Groves for the worship of God; and that invention of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calfs, are condemned as Idolatry.</p>

When any thing of that External worship, which is due to the true God, is given to any other, even though it be with a purpose not to shut him out altogether from his due, yet when it is in part given to any other thing, as to the Cross, Saints, Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is called worshipping of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> see <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. compared with <hi>Psal.</hi>

be said by men for palliating this kind of Idolatry: Thus the scope of the Command, and the reason and ground of worship being considered, it is evident that all these are Idolatry.</p>
               <p>We would now further consider, first, the positive part of this Command, and next what is forbidden in it.</p>
               <p>And 1. For the positive part of this Command, we conceive it doth reach, 1. To all external Ordinances, such as Doctrine, Worship, Government, and Discipline: We are here enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep all these pure, according to his word: Thus any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour breaketh this Command, when it is vented and made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as secret errours break the first.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It reacheth to all external <hi>Obedience,</hi> such as receiving the truths of God, submitting to the Government and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of his House, entering therein as Church-Members, often hearing the Word, not only on the Sabboth, which is required in the 4th. Command, but at all occasions, when God shall give the opportunity, it being a special part of his worship; right using of the Sacraments, and worthy receiving of them, praying externally, internal prayer being required in the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; outward confession of sin, when called for; confession of the truth in times of tryal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this obedience is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to extraordinary duties as well as ordinary; as Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Swearing, Fasting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="3">3ly. It reacheth to the right manner of doing duties; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, it requireth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. That they be not done in Hypocrisie, for God will not be so worshipped in any duty. 2. That all our worship and duties be directed to God, in, and through the Mediator, and that none come to God but by him, who is the appointed High Priest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. That all our Obedience and Service be Spiritual.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. It taketh in all external gestu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es, and outward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in praying and hearing; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as, that the eye be fixed, and the carriage not light, but decent; that there be no laughing that the looks be stayd and grave; these in a special manner, in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, are to be looked unto.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:55484:67"/>5thly. It requireth every Mean that may further Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, as educating and training up men for the Ministry, entertaining them, providing places and accommodations for publick worship, and every thing of that kind, without which the external worship of God cannot be performed.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly. It requireth the removing of all letts and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods worship, or whatever is contrary thereto, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our places and stations; such as Heresies and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks by condigne censuring of them, removing all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worship, and whatever may be occasions of it, or whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath been, or may be abused to it, purging the House of God from corrupt and insufficient Ministers and corrupt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>But let us see in the next place what is forbidden in this Command, and how it is broken.</p>
               <p>In the first Command, what immediatly reflecteth upon God himself, is forbidden; here, what immediately reflecteth on his Ordinances and appointments, contradicting them and Him in them, is discharged; there is none of the Commands more frequently broken; and yet men most readily think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves free of the breach thereof; and therefore ye should consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is broken</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Doctrine, or doctrinally. 2. In practice. 3. In both, when the Doctrines vented and published against truth, have external practices following on them as that doctrine of Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship hath, which we have spoken to already, and is the gross breach of this Command; and the Lord instanceth it as being the greatest, because where this is, all sorts of Idolatry are: for it supposeth Idolatry against the first Command, and that some esteem and weight is laid upon that Creature we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, beyond what is its due; as if there were in it some divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or ability to help, whereby it is thought worthy of such honour, whereupon followeth that external worship which is given to it upon that account; and so because Saints are thought able to hear and help, men pray to them; and because the Cross is thought holy, men worship it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as this Idolatry is manifold among the Papists, so it is palpable when Prayer is made to Saints, Reliques, Bread, the Cross, Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55484:67"/>Now that we may further explain this; consider, that this Command is three ways broken doctrinally, (all which have a great influence upon mens breaking of it in their practice); or, the Service and Worship of God, is three ways wronged by the doctrines of men. 1. When some thing is added to his Service which he hath not commanded, and this is superstition and will-worship largely so taken: Of this kind are 1. The 5 Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Sacraments added to those two the Lord appointed. 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more Mediators than the One Mediator Christ. 3. More meritorious causes of Pardon and Justification, than the blood and merits of Christ. 4. More Officers in his house than he hath appointed, such as, Bishops, Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. More Ceremonies in worship, as Salt, Spittle and Cream added in Baptism to VVater, and Kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Lords Supper. 6. More Holy-days then God hath instituted. 7. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to be acknowledged for the Word of God than the Scripture, as Traditions, Apocrypha, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many such things, whereof (for the most part) Popery is made up.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It is broken when his Ordinances are diminished, and any thing which he hath commanded, is taken away from them, as is clear from <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Ye shall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought there from:</hi> and thus they break this Command, by taking away the Cup from <hi>Laicks</hi> (as they call them) in the Lords Supper, and the use of the Bible from the People in their own Language; also it is broken by taking away Baptism from Infants, and Discipline or Excommunication from the Church, and by taking away the Sabbath day, and publick singing of Psalms, or such like; not to speak of that Blasphemous, and some-way Pagan-Her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sie of <hi>Qunquerisme,</hi> over-turning most, if not all the Ordinances of God, destructive to all true Religion and Christianity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing, at least having a native tendency to introduce, old Paganism and Barbarity.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. This Command is broken by corrupting of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as when the Word is mis-interpreted and mis-applyed, Prayers are used in a strange Tongue, the Word is mixed with Errours, and the Church, both left without Discipline and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused in civil things, which tendeth to the corrupting of Gods Service; unqualified-men put into the Ministry and kept in i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55484:68"/>
when Sacraments are rested on and worshipped, even as the Brazen Serpent was abused, and the Temple, though appointed by God at first for good ends, was afterward rested on and Idolized.</p>
               <p>Again, this Command is practically broken four ways: First by gross prophanity and neglect of the practice of known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of worship; this way, are guilty all prophane Contemners of Sacraments, Word, Discipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All Neglecters of them when they may have them: and all these that set not themselves to go rightly about them, in secret, in Families or in Publick; and wh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re many opportunities of Gospel Ordinances are, this sin is the more frequent; and so all Atheists that contemne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and these that would only serve God with a good heart and intention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they pretend, without any outward worship, are condemned here; and also those, who for fear or advantage give not testimony to the Truth and Ordinances of Christ, when such a testimony is called for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men sin against this Command, when they practise will-worship and superstition in servin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When worship, or Service under the Gospel is astricted to such a place, as if it were Holier to pray in one place than in another, and that therefore God did hear Prayer there more willingly and easily than in another place. Or 3. In respect of bodily posture, as if there were more Religion in one posture than in another; as in receiving the Lords-Supper Kneeling, or Praying in such and such a posture, except in so far as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and otherwise rightly regulate by  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When it is without a Divine Warrant tyed to such a time only, as <hi>Christmass,</hi> (commonly called <hi>Yool</hi>) <hi>Easter, Pasche, &amp;c.</hi> which is an Observing of times that God hath not appointed. 5. When it is tyed to such an occasion or accident, as, to Pray when the Clock striketh, or when on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55484:68"/>
these things he can give no reason for; the Prayer is good, but the timing of it so, and astricting it to that thing, is superstitious; so your lightwakes and Diriges (as ye call them) are upon this account to be condemned, either as superstitious, or as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, or at the best, as the reliques and causes or occasions of both: For 1. Once in times of Popish darkness they were so used, or rather abused. 2. Why are your Visits stinted to such a time more than another? It profiteth not the defunct, and it hurteth the person you come unto; a multitude not being  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it for comforting or instructing; and yet it cannot be called a meer civil visit, being trusted with such an occasion; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it suteth not, nor is it a Christian carriage toward the Dead, and after the Burial of the Dead, to spend time together in such a way as is commonly used: Beside, it is superstitious, when a thing without reason is astricted to such a time or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as giving and receiving of gifts on <hi>New-years-day,</hi> too too common amongst Christians, though a Heathenish custome; which day, as <hi>Gratian</hi> observes, was dedicated to their Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god, <hi>Janus</hi>: He asserts likewise, that such Christians, as in his time did observe it, were Excommunicated; and <hi>Alchuinus,</hi> with others, write that the whole Catholick Church appointed once a solemne publick Fast to be kept on a <hi>New years Day,</hi> to bewail those Heathenish Interludes, Sports, and lewd Idolatrous practises that had been used on it. 6. When some weight is laid on the number of words, or set repetitions of Prayers, <hi>Ave Maria's,</hi> or <hi>Pater Noster's,</hi> or on the reading so many Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or saying so many Prayers. 7. When any take a word of Scripture at the opening of the Bible, or by a thought suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as more besitting their condition because of that, without weighing the Word it self; and lay more weight upon that word than upon another that hath the same authority and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness to their case, which is to make a Weerd, or Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book of the Book of God, for which end he never appointed it. Thus also men are guilty, when they account Sacraments more valid, or lay more weight on them, because dispensed by some Ministers, than when dispensed by others, though having the same warrant, or because of the difference of persons that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take therein with them;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:55484:69"/>However some of these things may be in themselves good, yet they are abused by some one circumstance, as in unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable timing them, or in laying that weight on them which is not warranted in the Word, which 1. Altereth the way that God has laid down. 2. Bringeth us to prefer one circumstance to another, without any warrant. 3. Maketh a necessity where God has left us free, and so bringeth us into Bondage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may go wrong in practising lawful duties many ways, as to the manner of performing them, when they are not so done as is required: As 1. When we do not propose to our selves the right end we should have before us. 2. When they are not done from a right inward Principle. 3. When they are done in Hypocrisie and Formality, and rested on; all which may goe along with men in all Duties and Ordinances; and generally all our short-comings in the right manner of commanded duties striketh against this Command.</p>

                  </gap>ndeavours to entertain and maintain the true worship of God, are here forbidden; so likewise the putting in, and keeping in unworthy Ministers; the traducing, holding out, and putting out of Faithful Men; the with-drawing and Sequestring their maintenance from them; the diminishing of it, or straitning them in it. Horrid sins, though little thought of, and lightly look'd on by Men, drawing no less deep before God than ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the free course of the Gospel, breaking up the treaty of peace betwixt God and Sinners, carryed on by Faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as the Ambassadors of Jesus Christ; and saying on the matter that he shall not see of the fruit of the travel of his soul in the salvation of the souls of men to his satisfaction, so far as they can impede it by outing and discountenancing his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, the instruments made use of by him for bringing about; and thus also, all Sacriledge, <hi>Simony,</hi> and the like, cometh in as breaches of this Command; and all Partiality in Church-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, Tolleration of Errours, countenancing the spreaders of them, slighting of discipline, conversing unnecessarily and unwarrantable with such as are Excommunicate, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable

innovating in the external worship of God; and when we are not ayming and endeavouring to have our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, and all under our charge, brought under subjection and conformity to the Ordinances and Service of God as well as our selves.</p>
               <p>But because this Command in an especial manner looketh to publick Ordinances, let us see a little more particularly how it is broken in these: 1. In respect of Preaching and Hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Publick Prayer. 3. Praising. 4. Sacraments. 5. Fasts; and in all these, there are faults of three sorts. 1. Some going before the performance of these duties. 2. Some following after. 3. Some going along in the performance of them.</p>
               <p>And again, 1. Some are guilty of the breach of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by neglecting these duties. 2. Some are guilty in the wrong manner, of going about them.</p>
               <p>And 1. Before hearing the Word men break this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. 1. In not Praying for the speaker. 2. In not Praying for themselves, in reference to this end, that they may profit by the Word. 3. In not setting themselves to be in a spiritual composed frame for such a work. 4. In not watchfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting what may divert them or distract them, or straiten their minds when they come to hear, not ordering their other affairs, so as they may not be a hinderance to them in meeting with the blessing of the Gospel. 5. In not ayming to have the right esteem of the Word. 6. In not blessing God for it, or for any good received before by it. 7 In not coming with hunger and thirst, as new born Babes, having laid aside what may hinder its, being received with desire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. 8. In not denying our own strength, as to the right discharge of that duty, that so we may make use of Christ. 9. In not minding that when we are called to hear, it is to trust with God in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. 10. In going to hear with prejudice. 11. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without expe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2dly. Men sin against this Command, when they are come to hear, and while they are about this duty of hearing; 1. In not looking to God, or not receiving the Word as Gods

In not yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ears and memories, or yielding only their ears and memories, but not casting open their hearts to the Word, to let it sink down in them. 6. When though it be heard, yet it is not understood, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.13. 7. When though under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, it is soon forgotten. 8. When there is not a peculiar trembling and fear in our waiting upon the Ordinances, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.1, 2. and <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.5. There is a special fear which we ought to have <hi>before his Name.</hi> 9.

When we needlesly stumble at any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, especially when we care so lightly as to laugh at what is spoken, to the prejudice of the Ordinances. 12. When we are more for knowing than for doing, more for informing the mind than for reforming the heart and life. 13. When there is carping at the VVord, or censuring of it rather than our selves 14. When we make no application of it to our selves, and try not whether we have such a fault, or if we perform such a duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 15. When we are not present, as before God, to hear, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.33. 16. When we itch after novelty of expressions, or words, or things, rather than thirst after the sincere Milk of the Word, that we may grow thereby. 17. When these novelties are more entertained and laid weight on, than known duties or truths. 18. When the word is heard with respect of persons, and the same truth, or expression, or Scripture cited by one, is not so respected and received, as when spoken by another, contrary to <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. v. 9. 19. When there are vain looks as well as idle thoughts. 20. When there is a wanton, light, unreverent carriage. 21. When there is immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and strange Apparel unbecoming that Ordinance. 22. When there is speaking or talking, out of the case of necessity, in time of Sormon, though it were by way of Prayer, it is sinful, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were Ejaculatory in reference to what is at present spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. 23. When there is reading of somthing, (even though


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55484:70"/>
Scripture) unseasonable. 24. VVhen there is insisting on good thoughts, that tend to divert from hearing. 25. VVhen men are observing Vanities in time of hearing, such as the Apparel that others have on, or the painting that is on the House, or the cuplings of the roof, or such like. 26. When there is not an intermixing of ejaculatory Prayer for our selves and others, and the Speaker, that God would help him, and them, and us, to keep such a Word to the time when we may have need of it; and when God is not blessed when a word is rightly spoken. 27. When there is any quenching of convictions, or the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or stirrings of affection wakened up by the word. 28. When there is diverting to a doting love of the Speaker, or the thing as spoken by such a Speaker; or the manner of expression, and a delighting in these, more than in God, or a respecting of Him or our own profiting. 29. When we do not look upon, and make use of the Preached Word as a means to convert, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a mean to conform. 30. When we do not make use of Promises offered in Preaching, and directed by God to us by an Authorized Ambassador, and do not so lay weight on them as from him. 31. When we reject the many sweet offers of the Gospel, and come not to the Marriage of the King's Son: 32. When we do grieve Gods Spirit who presseth it upon us. 33. When we tread under-foot Christs Blood by our little esteem of it. 34. When we give no credit to, nor lay due weight upon threatnings. 35. When we have not the Faith of Gods Providence, or of the Judgment-to-come. 36. When there is not an accepting of Christ. 37. When there is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of him. 38. When there is not reverence in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from our hearing of the word.</p>
               <p>After hearing also, there are many ways whereby we are guilty of the breach of this Command. 1. Forgetting what we have heard. 2. Letting the heart unnecessarily look back again to other objects, and follow other thoughts, and not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on what hath been heard. 3. Not comparing what we have heard with the Scriptures. 4. Not following the Word with prayer for the watering of it. 5. Needless falling to other discourses, immediately after the hearing of the Word. 6. Casting it all aside as to practice, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. v. 6. to 23. 7. Fretting at some things that have been spoken. 8, Spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55484:71"/>
Censures Or 9. Commendations of the thing Preached, or of the instruments that Preached, as if that were all. 10. Not following the Word with self-searching Prayer, and fruits suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, endeavouring to practise what is required. 11. Not trembling at its threatnings, nor forbearing what was thereby discharged. 12. Not helping others to make use of it. 13. Not repenting of faults committed in the time of hearing. 14. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle delight in remembring of it. 15. Finding out shifts to put by its directions or challenges. 16. Applying them to others rather than to our selves. 17. Misconstruing the Ministers end in pressing of them. 18. Misinterpreting his words. 19. Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reporting, or misrepresenting them. 20. Not being troubled for fruitlesness in hearing, without any use, but being as a stone without sence or feeling. 21. Leaning on hearing, as if having been in the Church were a piece of holiness, though no fruit fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on it. 22. Prophane abusing words of Scripture, or phrases used in preaching, in mens common discourse; much more when they are mixed in wanton and profain sports, or jests and gybes.</p>
               <p>All these ways men may sin, when they come to hear the Word; they sin also by absence when they come not, neglecting the opportunities of the Gospel; there are also divers sins which men are often guilty of in reference to hearing, even on week days: As 1. Little love to the Word, or delight in the opportunities of it on such days. 2. Too much love to some other things that procureth lukewarmness in hearing. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning occasions of hearing the Word on such days. 4. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providently bringing on a necessity on our selves that we cannot hear. 5. Caring little to have a Ministry, whereby we may be instructed at all times, and therefore we want such occasions. 6. Setting our selves, and using our wits to discourage the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters we have. 7. Not being waited on, with our absence from week-days Sermons. 8 Mocking at them who are present. 9. Disrespecting the Ordinance for some worldly or personal respects, preferring any small trifle thereto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us instance the breach of this Command in publick prayer, which is a part of worship which very nearly concerns the glory of God; and certainly when it is wronged through the unsutable, and not right discharging of this duty, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is in a special way broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:55484:71"/>We shall not here look to every thing, but especially to what concerneth publick Prayer, indeed we fail also in secret Prayer, and in giving Thanks both alone and in our Families. 1. By contempt of this excellent Ordinance, many slight Prayer in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and in their Families, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> which is a clear breach of this Command as well as neglecting it in publick, when men do not countenance Sermon or Prayer, though at the same time walking Idlely in the Street or in the Fields. 2. By casting up of Prayer to others, reproaching it, calling it Hypocrisie, and those who use it Hypocrites. 3. By mocking the Spirits work in Prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before we come to Prayer, we sin. 1. By not watching to keep the heart in a frame for Praying always. 2. By not watching over every opportunity that we may have for Prayer, whereby many occasions are lost. 3. In not longing for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Prayer. 4. In not stirring up our selves to seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness when we are about to Pray. 5. In letting the heart run loose when we are about other things, which indisposeth for Prayer. 6. In having a self particular end before us in our Prayers. 7. In our little respecting God for strength and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and little looking to him for his Spirit to our selves, or these who are to go before us in this duty of Prayer. 8. In our little examining our selves that we may know what to Pray for, and what distinctly to confess. 9. In our not meditating on what we are to say, that we may as to the matter of our Prayers speak in Faith. 10. In ayming more to find and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise gifts, than to have grace acting in us. 11. In our rushing rashly on such a weighty and spiritual duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. In Prayer; and 1. On the Speakers part there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways whereby this Command is broken: As 1. By rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sencelesness, not exercising the spirit, but the mouth, telling over our Prayers as a Tale without life. 2. Praying in our own strength, without looking after the influence of the Spirit. 3. Not drawing near to God by Faith in Christ, but leaning too much on our Prayers, from a secret false opinion of prevailing more with many words well put together, than by exercising Faith on Christ, and resting on Him, as if God were perswaded with words. 4. Inadvertant Praying, uttering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised Petitions and expressions without understanding.


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55484:72"/>
5. Not praying humbly and with soul abasement: Nor 6. Singly to please God, but men, seeking expressions that are pleasant rather then sensible. 7. Saying many things we think not, not being touched with the weight of sin when we confess it, nor with the desire of holiness when we mention it: counterfeiting sometimes liberty and boldness, sometimes restraints and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints more than is real. 8. Limiting God in particular suits. 9. Cold in what is of greatest concernment. 10. Want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and holy fear. 11. Want of a right impression of a present God. 12. Not praying for others, and little respecting the condition of those we pray with; or what we do of this kind, is either but cold, and for the fashion; or if there be more apparent zeal and seriousness for others, it would be adverted that it be not upon design to flatter and please them rather than to obtain spiritual blessings to them. 13. Desiring things for satisfying our selves more than for Gods honour. 14. Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off before we come to liveliness and liberty, having begun lazily and without life. 15. Not insi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ting to wrestle with God when under Bands. 16. Precipitating with the words before the heart ponder them, or the affection be warmed. 17. Posting through it, as duty, only for the fashion, without respect to God, or love to the exercise, or driving at any profit by it. 18. Wearying and not delighting in it. 19. Not ayming at Gods presence or sensible manifestations in it, or at a Hearing in that which we pray for. 20. Being more desirous of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in publick than in private. 21. Fretting when we are put or kept under Bonds. 22. Growing vain and light when it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well with us, and turning carnal and unwatchful when we get liberty. 23. Impertinent use-making of Scripture-words, either ignorantly or vainly. 24. A secret expectation of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for our Prayer, and so resting upon the work done, as if there were merit in it. 25. Using expressions not easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. 26. Using undecent gestures, and scurrile  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xpressions. 27. Not observing Gods dispensation to us, nor his dealing with our souls in the time of Prayer, that we may conform our suits accordingly, as we find many of the Saints have done, who end in Songs after they had begun sadly. 28. Not praying with servency for Christs Kingdom, and for Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. 29. Exercising gifts rather than grace, when we pray. These are Sins upon the Speaker's part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:55484:72"/>Next, ye should consider the sins of them that joyn: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side what is general and common in the duty of praying, we fail often in joyning. And 1. In this, that many think, When ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayeth they need not pray, but let the Speaker be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone. 2. When we observe not what is spoken, that we may go alongst in what he prayeth for, and be upon our watch that we may joyn, and that we may do it in judgment. 3. The mind waving or wandering, and we hearing, but not praying. 4. Censuring the words or gestures of the Speaker. 5. Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our eyes or minds on some other things, and giving way to other thoughts that may divert from joyning. 6. Sleeping in time of Prayer. 7. Confusedness in that exercise, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly joyning with what agreeth to our selves and our own case, nor with what agreeth to others joyning with it for them. 8. More cold and indifferent in what concerneth others, than in what concerneth our selves. 9. More careless of being heard and answered when we speak not, as if we were less concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thinking it enough to be present, although in our heart we joyn not; and, not being affected with the prayer of another, nor acting Faith in it, we soon weary when others pray. 10. Not being edified by the praying of another, nor taking up our sins in his Confessions, nor our duty in his Petitions. 11. Much Hypocrisie in such duties, while we seem to be joyning, but are doing nothing 12. Not endeavouring to have affections suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what is spoken, stirred up in us. 13. Not praying that the Speaker may be sutably guided and helped in bringing forth Petitions that may answer our wants. 14. More indifferent that another who speaketh as mouth for the rest, want liberty, than when we are put to speak our selves, although it be Gods Ordinance, 15. Not rightly touched with any expression we cannot joyn with, but rather stumbling at it. 16. Our being ignorant of the meaning of many expressions through our own fault so that we cannot joyn in them. 17. Muttering words of our own, and not joyning with what is said. 18. Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctness in consenting or saying <hi>Amen</hi> at the close.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. After Prayer both Speaker and Joyners fail. 1. That they watch not over their hearts, but soon return to other things, as if then they might take liberty. 2. Not waiting for an answer, nor observing whether Prayers be answered or


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55484:73"/>
not. 3. Not being thankful for Answers when they come: Nor 4. Intreating and pressing for an answer if it be delayed. 5. Not reflecting on our failings, whether in speaking or joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 6. Not remembring what we have uttered in Prayer but presently returning to a carriage that is very unlike those things we have been speaking before Him. 7. Not ke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ping up a frame for new opportunities of Prayer. 8. Not pressing after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant walk with God betwixt occasions of Prayer. 9. Resting on Prayer after we have done, and thinking something of it if we seem to have been helped to Pray. 10. Carnally heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and displeased, if it hath been otherwise. 11. Not being humbled for the sinfulness and defects of our Prayers. 12. Not having recourse by Faith to the Blood of sprinkling for pardon of these sinful defects.</p>
               <p>We are to consider how men break this Command in Praise and Thanksgiving: And here there is failing, in general. 1. In the utter neglect of this necessary duty; alasse, what of that duty do we in secret, and yet it is singularly for Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and as clear a duty as Prayer. 2. In mocking praise of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by prophaning Psalms for our carnal mirth. 3. In neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting and slighting of it, though not altogether, yet by unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent going about it. 4. In accounting it to be almost no duty at all, and in being but little challenged for slighting of it, or for irreverent using of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. We sin before we go about this duty: 1. In not preparing for it. 2. In not praying for the Spirit, to fit and enable us to Praise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. and for a fixed heart for that work, <hi>Psal.</hi> 108.1. 3. In our not ayming at a spiritual disposition for such a spiritual duty. 4. In our not endeavouring for a right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Majesty of God. And 5. For clearness of our interest in him: And 6. For an impression of the excellency of his way, and meaning of his word; all which are exceeding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary unto the right performance of this duty, and without them we cannot Praise sutably.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. We are guilty of many faults in the time of praising. 1. Doing it without respect to Gods glory, and for the fashion only. 2. Hypocrisie, not praising him with the whole heart, performing it only with the lips, when the heart is away. 3. Ignorance, when we want understanding of the words we


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55484:73"/>
express. 4. No sutable impression of Gods greatness and goodness upon our hearts when we praise. 5. Not ayming at Communion with God in this duty, as desiring, minding, and hoping to praise him for ever. 6. Not being taken up with Spiritual and Heavenly delight in him, and in the work of his praise. 7. Lightness, laughing, or mainly affecting of, and carnally doting upon, some tone or voyce more than being suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affected with the matter, and making melody in the heart to the Lord. 8. Forgetting what we do sing, and not knowing or considering what it is we sing, the heart not being present nor fixed. 9. Not being constrained by love to praise, but some custome or natural Conscience constraining us to it. 10. Not offering up our praises in and through Christ Jesus, <hi>H <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 15. 11. Soon satisfied in our praising, as if we were little troubled to be fitted for it, and because little of our selves ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it, we are the less careful how we discharge it, but stint and limit our selves to some certain customary matter which puts us to few prayers before, and makes but few challenges af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 12. Not intermixing ejaculatory prayers in our praisings. 13. Much Hypocrisie when we sing the cases of others, or their thoughts and estimation of God, and study not to be something-like their frame and exercise. 14. Not framing our affections in praising to the subject of our praise; whether it be some sad case or some chearful condition, or some Historical or Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical subject; and when imprecations are a part of the Song, we soon fall off, or praise one and the same way in all. 15. Not serious in blessing God for former mercies to his Servants, if it be not so well with us in the mean time, nor chearfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his former deliverances of his Church and people in which we have not personally shared. 16. Not being affected with his keeping of us free of many sad cases we sing, and others have been in, nor blessing him for delivering them. 17. Not letting the Word of the Lord which we sing, sink down in us for engaging our hearts to, and chearing our spirits in good. 18. Not assenting to, and giving him glory in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the justness of his severest threatnings, and the most fearful Scripture-Imprecations. 19. Not rightly observing those things that are the subject-matter of Scripture Songs, so as to put a difference between some things we are to tremble


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55484:74"/>
and scare at, such as the falls of the Saints; and other things which we are to imitate and follow for our edification. 20. Gadding in idle looks, so that some scarce look on their books (although they can read) that they may the better have the sense of what they sing. 21. Not putting a difference betwixt praying a Petition that is in a Psalm, and singing of it, which should have a sweetness with it that may incourage us to pray for, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect what others before us have obtained. 22. Wanting such considerations about the matter sung, when it suits not our present case, as may sutably affect us, and fit us to glorifie God in that duty: as, when we sing of the eminent holiness of some of the Saints, we are to bless him that ever any was so holy, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be our sinfulness; and that we have hope of pardon though under many failings, and much unlikeliness to that case we sing. 23. Not singing with the voyce at all, although the tongue be given us as our <hi>Glory,</hi> that we may therewith thus glorifie God.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. After we have been about this duty of praise, we sin. 1. By falling immediatly into a carnal frame. 2. Not looking back or examining when we have done, how we carryed it in praising God. 3. Few challenges for our many failings in praise. 4. Little Repentance for those failings. 5. Not keeping the heart right for a new opportunity of praise. 6. Not keeping a record of his mercies in our memories, and upon our hearts to engage us to praise him. 7. Not walking in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of love, which would sweetly constrain us to this duty, and make us delight in it.</p>

               <p>Before we enter to speak of the faults we are here guilty of we may in general propose some things concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: As 1. For what ends God hath appointed them, that so we may know what is to be expected in them. 2. How they effectuate the ends, that we may know how we should go about them; and we shall speak to these two joyntly, because we cannot speak to the one, but we must speak to the other.</p>
               <p>But before we speak to these, some things are to be p <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: As 1. That God hath thought good always to add Sacraments to his Covenants; thus the Covenant of Works had its Sacraments: <hi>Adam</hi> had the Tree of Life for a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to confirm him in the Faith of that Covenant; so the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace in all its administrations had its Sacraments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for confirmation thereof, as before Christs incarnation it had, Circumcision, the Passover, and divers Sacrifices eff <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:55484:75"/>2dly. Although the nature of the Covenant alter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in respect of our use-making of it; yet, as all Covenants have some essentials in which they agree, to wit, a Promise and a Restipulation; so all Sacraments have something common, to wit, that they Signifie, Seal, and Strengthen the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in assurance of enjoying what is promised according to the terms of the Covenant to which they are as Seals appended, the Tree of Life confirmed the promise of Life to <hi>Adam</hi> upon condition of perfect Obedience; Circumcision confirmed it to <hi>Abraham</hi> upon condition of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. The Sacraments of the Covenant of Grace before and after Christ, differ in circumstantials, as the Covenant it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old and New Testament doth; but in essentials they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for they seal one and the same thing, and after one and the same manner.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. There are some chief things common to all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Covenant under one administration; As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Baptisme and the Lords Supper, they agree both in this that they seal the Covenant, and represent Christ and his benefits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in either of them there are some peculiar promises and benefits especially looked unto; and also they have their peculiar manner of sealing these things which are common to both; Believers are also confirmed in the same things by the Word, but the Sacraments confirm them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, more clearly, and sensibly, and proportionally to our weakness and necessity.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly. No Sacrament is of, and from it self valid, but its validity and efficacy is from the Covenant and Promise, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is a Sacrament; and so it is a seal to none but to such as are in the Covenant, and keep the condition of it, to them it seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the benefits promised, though absolutely and simply it seal the truth of the conditional promises; and so it may be said conditionally to seal, to all the Members of the Church, the truth of what is promised upon such a condition; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, The Tree of Life sealed this Truth, that who stood in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience should have Life, but it did not seal to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he should have Life, except upon condition of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience; the like may be said of Circumcision, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:55484:75"/>6thly. Hence every Sacrament doth suppose a Covenant, and the Receivers entry into the Covenant, to which the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he receiveth relateth: so that we come not to the Sacrament properly to enter into Covenant with God, but first the Covenant is entered, and then the Seal is added, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. First, God entered into Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and then the Seal of Circumcision is added as a confirmation thereof.</p>
               <p n="7">7thly. No Sacrament giveth any new right which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver had not before; only it confirmeth the right he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; he hath access to the Sacraments upon the account of his external right.</p>
               <p n="8">8thly. Sacraments confirm still something that is future, and to come, they being instituted for the confirmation of our Faith and Hope in those things, of which we are most apt to doubt; as the Passover strengthened the <hi>Israelites</hi> again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t the fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destroyed; the Tree of Life confirmed what was promised to <hi>Adam</hi> and not performed; and so all Sacraments help us to believe the making good of some promise not performed, for they serve as the Oath and Seal; and indeed when we Preach the Gospel, we offer a Sealed Covenant and a Sworn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>These things being premised, we come to speak to the things proposed; and we say, The Sacraments of the New Testament (of which only we speak purposely) have in God's appointment and our use, these three ends especially;</p>
               <p>The 1. is, to represent clearly the nature of the Covenant, and the things promised therein, as, the washing away of sin, Christ himself, his death and benefits, and the way how we come to the application of all these, to wit, by Faith freely, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Jesus Christ for taking away guilt, and strengthening us to an holy walk; in all these the Sacraments (that is, the signs and word of Institution added) do fully and clearly, 1. To the Ears: 2. To the Eyes: 3. To our other senses of feeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only hold forth what is offered, but our way of closing with and accepting of that Offer; as if God, who by Preaching letteth us hear him speak (inviting us to be reconciled to him) were in the Sacraments, letting us see him tryst and close that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with us by his Ambassadors; in which respect, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be called the <hi>Symbol</hi> and <hi>Token</hi> of the Covenant, as


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55484:76"/>
it is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and this way the Sacraments have a teaching use to bring to our remembrance Christ, his sufferings and benefits, as well as our estate, what it was without him, and before our closing with him; all this by the word and elements with the actions concurring, is represented to us, as if it were acted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, for making the way of the Gospel the more clear to our judgments and memories, who either senselesly take it up, or sluggishly forget these spiritual things; the Lord, who sometimes maketh use of Parables and figurative expressions or similitudes, to set forth spiritual things to make them take with us the more, hath chosen this way to make use of external signs and actions for the same ends also.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second end of Sacraments is to seal and confirm Gods mind and revealed will to man, and to put him out of question of the truth of his promises, that so he may have a further prop  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o his Faith, and may draw more strong consolation from the promises of the Covenant upon this ground. In this respect they are called Seals (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.) of the Righteousness by Faith, that is, not the Righteousness of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, but of his obtaining Righteousness by IT, and not by works, that is, They are seals of that Covenant which offereth and promiseth Righteousness to such as believe: So was the Tree of Life a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to <hi>Adam</hi> of the promise of Life; so was Circumcision to <hi>Abraham</hi> a Seal and Confirmation of the promises of the Gospel, as Gods Oath was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18: And so are the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to us.</p>
               <p>This Confirmation may be three ways looked on: 1. As that which confirmeth the Proposition, 2. the Assumption, 3. the Conclusion of a practical Syllogism, whereby the Believer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth from the Gospel that he shall be saved.</p>
               <p>The Proposition is this, <hi>He that B <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>li <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>veth shall be saved</hi>; this by the Sacrament is simply confirmed as a truth that one may lean unto: Then the Believer's Conscience in the Faith of that, subsumeth, I will then take me by Faith to Christ; seeing that is a sure truth, I will rest on him and hold me there; or more clearly, I do believe in him.</p>
               <p>Now 2 This assumption that <hi>I,</hi> or such a man hath Faith is not confirmed simply by the Seal, for the Sacrament is to be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55484:76"/>
judge such a one to have Faith; yet it may be said to be so far con <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irmed as one whose  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith doubteth may by this be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to rest on Chri <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, and quiet himself on him; thus Faith is confirmed while it is helped to Assume, though the man be not clear that he hath assumed; as also one having according, to Gods command, cast himself on Christ, and according to his institution, taken the Seal, I say such a man may conclude from the Seal, as w <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll as from the Promise that he is accepted, even as one having prayed may conclude he hath been heard, having done it according to Gods will in the name of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly When the Conclusion is drawn, <hi>Therefore I shall be saved,</hi> the Sacrament doth not confirm that simply to us, more than it did to <hi>Adam</hi> (who afterward brake the Covenant of Works, and so attained not the thing Promised) but it sealeth it conditionally. <hi>If thou Believe,</hi> thou shalt be saved, and so the Assumption must be made out by the search of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before the conclusion receive any confirmation by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; yet by strengthening the <hi>major proposition; Such as Believe shall be saved</hi>; it strengtheneth the <hi>Conclusion</hi> also: for if that were not true, my having Faith, or flying to Christ were no great comfort; and so consequently it has influence on the Believers comfort in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> as God's Oath and Seal did confirm the Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and also strengthened his Faith in believing it should be made out to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>Again, it is to be considered that the Sacrament Sealeth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, not only as it sayeth, <hi>All that Believe shall be saved,</hi> but also as it says, <hi>Thou, if thou wilt Believe, shalt be saved</hi>; and the seal is so appended to that conditional Offer, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant standeth not only sure in general to all Believers, but to Me particularly upon my closing with it, as if God were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly singling me out to make the offer unto me, and to take my engagement, and to put the seal in my hand, by which Faith is more particularly helped and strengthened than by the Word alone; there is great use therefore of the Sacraments, in that thereby we get Faith quieted in the believing of this, that God will lay-by his Controversie, and keep his Covenant, and make forthcoming his Promises to those who flye for refuge to Jesus Christ, according to his Oath and Seal: Thus he sealeth the


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55484:77"/>
                  <hi>Major</hi> Simply, the <hi>Minor</hi> Conditionally, but Particularly; Or we may suppose God speaking to us from the Covenant thus, He to whom I offer Christ, he may receive Him; and all that believe, and receive the Offer, shall obtain the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing offered: But I offer Christ to thee: therefore thou mayst and shouldst receive him; and if thou accept the Offer, thou shalt obtain the Blessing offered, and shalt be saved: Thus the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> are simply sealed, but the Conclusion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally: Or the Sacrament sealeth the Offer simply; but the Promise as it is applyed to such a particular Person Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, if he receive the Offer; so that none needeth to question God's Offer, nor Christs Performance on our Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus the Sacraments may be called <hi>Testimonies,</hi> of Gods Grace to us, because particularly they seal that Offer of his Grace unto us, namely <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> by him, and his being content to give Him upon condition of our believing.</p>
               <p>The Third end and use of the Sacraments; is, to exhibit and apply Christ or his Benefits to Believers; hence in the Sacraments we put on Christ, and eat him: which is not done, by any Physical Union of Christ or his Benefits with the Signes; but as in the Word, Christ communicateth himself when the Spirit goeth along with the Promises, and Hearers bring not only their Ears, but their Hearts and Faith to that Ordinance: So here by the Sacraments Christ is Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to us, when we come not onely with Ears, Eyes, Tast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but with Faith exercised on Christ in the Sacrament with respect to his Institution: and he cometh by his Spirit with the Elements, and Word, whereby the Union with Christ is so much the more near and sensible, as it hath upon the one side so many and great External helps in the means appointed by God; and on the other side a proportional Blessing promised to goe along with his Ordinance by the Operation of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Hence it is that all this Communion is Spiritual, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Spirit, and received by Faith; yet it is most real, and having a real Ground &amp; Cause, and real Effects following, not by vertue of the Sacraments in themselves, more than by the Word or Prayer considered in themselves; but by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the promises being laid hold on by Faith. And now Word and Sacraments being joyned together, they concur the

more effectually for bringing forth those  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nds intended in the Covenant.</p>

               <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> The Sacraments hold forth a Mutual Engaging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and his People; God holdeth out the Contract, the Covenant and Offer; We by our partaking doe declare our acceptance of that Offer on those Terms, and ingage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, that we shall make use of that righteousness therein held forth for our Justification, and of that Wisdom and strength therein offered for our direction and Sanctification: In this respect our taking of the Seal, is called our <hi>Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>; And <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. he was to be punished that wanted the Seal of God's Covenant: Thus our accepting and receiving, looketh to the Word, holding forth the Terms, and God s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These are the main and principal ends of the Sacraments, though they serve also for outward Distinguishing of Gods People from all other societies and persons.</p>

When Gods Grace and Goodness in condescending in them to us, is not admired and blessed. 5.

Accounting them better when Administrated by one Minister, than when by another; or esteeming little of them, because dispensed by some men, (though lawful Ministers) as if men added any worth to the Ordinance of God. 12. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver actually laying weight on any of them, or drawing comfort from them, or less than should have been done. 13. Not wishing and praying that others may have good of them. 14. Not fearing the wronging of them by multitudes who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of them, and not endeavouring to have abuses of that kind helped, but making them common to all indifferently and promiscuously. 15.

               <p>Next in him that Administreth Baptism, there are oft-times diverse failings. As 1. When it is customarily dispensed without respect to it's end. 2. When in Prayer the Childs Salvation is not really and seriously aimed at, but for the fashion. 3. When it becometh a burden to dispense it. 4. When it is not thought much of, that Christ admitteth such into his House, or himself to be a partaker of such mercies, but be a Dispenser of them to others. 5. When he followeth it not privately with his Prayers for a Blessing; besides what failings may be in unsuitable words, and Humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And seeking himself in the words that are spoken, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Edification of the Hearers.</p>
               <p>When we are Witnesses and On-lookers, we fail. 1. In wearying and fretting, because we are detained a while. 2. Not

setting our selves to be edified by that we see  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>done and hear spoken. 3. Not sympathising with the Child or its Parents in Prayer. 4. Not being thankful to God for such a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Ordinance to such a Childs behalf. 5.

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All of us that are Baptised, fail wonderfully, less or more. 1<hi>st.</hi> That we never (as we ought) reckon our selves obliged by that tye we come under in Baptism. 2. That we neither are, nor seriously study to be, as we ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it. 3. That we are not thankful for it to God, who admitted us to that Ordinance. 4. That we do not esteem it above all bare carnal Birth-Rights how great soever. 5. That we do not seek to have it cleared, in the extent of it, as to the Priviledges and Benefits thereby conferred on us and our Children. 6. That we do not pursue after the Blessing therein Covenanted to us. 7. That we do not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the performance of the condition of believing and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Christ which is the condition of the Covenant of which Baptism is the Seal. 8. That we do not lay weight on our Baptism for strengthening our Faith both in Spiritual and Temporal Difficulties, as if it were no Seal of the Covenant. 9. That we are often ignorant how to make use of it. 10. That we do not account our selves wholly Gods, as being given away to Him in Baptism, but live to our selves. 11. That we do not sight against our Lusts, Satan, and the World, according to our Baptismal Vow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. That we do not adorne our Christian Profession with an Holy Life. 13. That we walk and war against Christ, instead of figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55484:80"/>
under his Banner. 14. That we do not aggravate our sins, as being committed against this Tye. 15. That we are not patient under Sufferings, nor penitent and humble under all sad Dispensations; notwithstanding that we are by our Baptism bound to take up the Cross. 16. That we do not meditate on our ingagements, nor repent for our Neglects. 17. That we do not aim and endeavour to come up to the main ends of this Ordinance. Which are. 1. The eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing out Regeneration and ingrasting into Christ. 2. The giving up our selves to the Father, Son, and Spirit. 3. Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Christ on the most costly and dearest terms. 4. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Directions from him and walking in him. 5 Seeking the things above, and not the things that are on Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. Mortification to Creatures, and to be Crucified with Christ. 7. The improving of this Tye, not onely for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging us to these, but for strengthening us in Him to attain them, and to comfort our selves in all Difficulties from this ground. These things are much a-missing; Alas, they are much a-missing: For we lamentably neglect to draw all our Strength and Furniture under all tentations, and for all Duties from Christ by vertue of this Baptismal Obligation and Tye: We resort but seldome to this Magazine and Store - House; this precious Priviledge is (Alas!) but very little manured and improved by us.</p>
               <p>We come next to speak of the sins we are usually guilty of in reference to the Lords Supper, and they be of several sorts. 1. Some are Doctrinal when the Institution is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, as in Popery: These we will not now meddle with. 2. Others are practical, and they are either in Ministers and Elders, who admit and debar, or in such as are admitted or debarred.</p>
               <p>And First, we are to consider, that men may sin against this Ordinance, by not Communicating. As 1. When they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and wilfully neglect it. 2. When they are not frequent in it, but carelessly slight it, when conveniently it may be had. 3. By not foreseeing and ordering our Affairs, so as we may not be hindred, when an occasion of that Ordinance offereth it self near to us. 4. By incapacitating our selves to be admitted through ignorance or scandal, and by negligence


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55484:81"/>
to remove these. 5. By sretting at our being debarred, or at these who has a hand in it. 6. Not repenting of the causes which procureth our being declared. 7. Not seeking to be humbled under such a weighty censure, and to get the right use of it for the time to come. 8. Suspecting that it proceedeth from carnal ends. 9. Reporting amiss of those who do it 10. Not praying for them that partake in this Ordinance, where-ever we hear of it in any place. 11. Looking rather to the unfitness of some that are admitted, and the neglect of duty in Office-bearers in debarring, than our own. 12. Not sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing with them, and yet on that ground absenting our selves, to wit, for the faults of others.</p>
               <p>And here, by the way, we beseech you take these few words of Exhortation. 1. Look on debarring of ignorant and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous persons from the Lord's Table as Christ's Ordinance. 2. Consider wherefore your selves are debarred, and as you may be assured it is from no particular prejudice or disrespect, so ye would repent &amp; be humbled for that which procureth it. 3 Be making up what is wanting for the time to-come: your failing in any of these is a fault, and let none think themselves the less bound to the study of holiness, because they are kept from partaking of it: But the sin of some is; they shift it, because they will not stir themselves up to a sutable frame for it, and yet they are not sutably affected with the want of it.</p>
               <p>Next, there are faults in them that are admitted to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and these both in Hypocrits and true Believers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively; and that 1. Before. 2. In the time, and 3. After receiving the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>And first: Before receiving there are many failings: As 1. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the end and nature of this Ordinance. 2. Not stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to know it: Nor 3. To have the heart rightly affected with it. 4. Not endeavouring to keep up a high esteem, and holy reverence of the wonderful Love of God in giving of his Son, and the Son's condesending Love in coming to dye for Sinners. 5. Not seeking to have the Covenant clearly closed with by Faith, before it be sealed by the Sacrament. 6. Not endeavouring to have all by gone quarrels removed, and our Peace established. 7. Not searching our way, that we may be well acquainted with our condition, so as we may have the


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55484:81"/>
distinct knowledg of it, when we come. 8. Not carefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring a sutable frame of heart by Prayer, Meditation, and Reading. 9. Not praying for a blessing, either for him that administreth, or for those who are to joyn with us, to prevent their sin. 10. Not minding their instruction who are under our charge. 11. Not presently renewing (if before closed with and consented to) our Covenant before our partaking. 12. Not sequestring our hearts from other things for that end. 13. Not fearing to miss the thing offered, and to contract guilt instead of getting any good. 14. Not searching after the sins of former Communions and other sins, and repenting of them. 15. What we ayme at in these, not ayming at them in Christs strength. 16. Not ayming and endeavouring constantly to walk with God, and keep communion with him in all duties, that we may have the more access to communion with him in this Ordinance. 17. Not laying aside of rooted prejudices and secret malice. Nor 18. Admonishing such whom we know to lye under any offence of that kind, that they may repent and reform. 19. Unstayedness in our ayming at communion with God in it, or coming to it more selsily than out of due regard to the glory of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. In our going about this Ordinance, there are many faults that usually concurr: As 1. Our giving too little respect, or too much to it, as is said before of the Sacraments in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. 2. Our not exercising Faith in the present time, according to the Covenant and Christs Institution. 3. Want of Love to constrain us, and want of that Hunger and Thirst that should be after Christ. 4. Want of that discerning of the Lord's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which should be, so as, 1. To put a difference betwixt Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, and common Bread and Wine in respect of the end. 2 To put a difference betwixt this Ordinance, and Christ himself, who is signified and exhibited by it. 3. To lay in some respect a further weight on this than on the Word only, though it be some way of that same nature. 4. To put a difference betwixt this Sacrament and other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and so discerning it, it is to conceive of it rightly. 1. In respect of its use and end according to its Institution, 2. In respect of our manner of use-making of it, not only by our senses or bodily Organs, but by Faith and the faculties of the


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55484:82"/>
soul, looking upon, and receiving Christs Body in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and feeding on it there as in the Word, and more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sensibly: for the Sacraments do not give us any new thing which the Word did not o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fer and give before, but they give the same thing more clearly and sensibly. 3. In respect of the blessing; not only waiting for a common blessing for sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body by that Bread and Wine, but for a spiritual blessing to be conferred by the spirit to the behoof of the soul, 4. Its so to discern it as to improve it for obtaining real commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt Christ and us, by a spiritual feeding-upon, as his own Body; so that when there is any short-coming in these, in so far the Lord's Body is not discerned. 5. We sin in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Ordinance, by want of Reverence, when we come without Holy thoughts, and a Divine frame, and without Love ravishing the heart, which is most sutable at such a time; much more do we sin when we come with carnal, loose, or idle thoughts, or any unreverent gesture, or with light-like appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, or cariage in coming or sitting. 6. By want of Love to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and sympathy with such as are Strangers to Communion with Christ. 7. By not distinct closing with Christ, or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Covenant with him, or ingaging of our selves to him. 8. By stupidly, or senselesly taking the Elements without any affection, and by being heartless in the work, and comfortless because we want sense. 9. By not chearing our selves by Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may obtain and win to sense, and by pressing too little at sense or comfort. 10. By not improving this Ordinance in reference to the general ends of a Sacrament, or the particular ends we should ayme at in this Sacrament: As 1. Fellowship with Christ himself. 2. Communion in his Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. 3. The sense of these, and the comfort of them. 4. The lively commemoration of Christs Death and Sufferings, and of the Love he had to us in all these; for the stirring up of our Love again to him. 5. The strengthening of our selves in the way of Holiness, by strength drawn from him by Faith. 6. Minding his glory, and the setting forth thereof, with respect unto, and hope of his Coming again. 7. Particular ingaging of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections one to another. 8. Ingaging our hearts by serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions to make for suffering: Lastly, We sin here, by not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on our hearts in the mean time, that we may know what


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55484:82"/>
they are doing, nor putting up ejaculatory prayers to God in the time; receiving the Sacrament with our hand, and yet not receiving him in that mean by Faith into the heart, nor feeding on him, and satisfying our selves with him really present in that mean: for he is to our Faith really present there as well as in his Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. After Communicating there is a readiness to slip and fall into these faults: 1. Irreverent and Carnal removing from the Table. 2. Forgetting what we were doing, and falling imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to loose words or thoughts. 3. Not reflecting on our by past carriage, to see what we were doing, and what frame we were in, and what we obtained. 4. Not repenting for what was wrong in every piece of our way and carriage. 5. Not following on to obtain what we yet miss, and not still waiting for the blessing, even after we are come away. 6. Not being thankful if we have obtained any thing 7. Fretting and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if we have not gotten what we would have. 8. Or being indifferent and careless whether we get or want. 9. Carnally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loose after Communions, as if we had no more to do. 10. Vain, or puffed up, if we think we have attained anything. 11. Little or no keeping of Promise made to God, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as before 12. Digressing on the commendation or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of what was heard, or seen, rather than making use of it for our profit. 13. Making that Ordinance an occasion of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for some faults we conceive to have been about it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it should be ground of Union and Love. 14. Not entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenderness, and a frame that may keep us ready to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate again. 15. Not meditating on what we have been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 16. Nor longing again for the like occasion. 17. Not helping others that did not come, or had not the occasion of coming, to it. 18. Conceitedness because we were admitted. 19. Despising others who might not be admitted. 20. Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or secretly snuffing at any who goeth, or has gone about it with more tenderness than we, or who endeavoureth to keep their Promises better than we: This sin of Emulation and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual envy, at any who out-runs us in tenderness and proficiency (touched in these two last) is, as very natural to us so, most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; it participates of <hi>Cursed Cain</hi>; this sin is the worst of all Malignity, and is always accompanyed with a wideful and


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55484:83"/>
devillish satisfaction with, and complacency in, the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comings of others, that so we may be the more noticed. 21. Secret disdain at tender Christians beside us, as Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical. 22. Turning aside to live like others who have been debarred, as if there ought to be no difference put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those who have this Badge, and those who want it, or setting up as if all were done, when we have Communicated. 23. Want of Watchfulness against recurring Tentations and Snares: Vanity and conceit if we attain any thing, and want of pity to those who did not come with so good speed. 24. Indiscreet speaking either to the commending or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of Speakers and Formes, but little or nothing to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>In the last place we shall speak a little to this Question; If and How, the admission of scandalous persons doth pollute the Communion? And if it be sinful to receive it with such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? Or, if Joint-Communicants be thereby defiled? Let us for answer, consider <hi>Pollution</hi> distinctly  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with reference to these Four things. 1. In reference to the Sacraments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 2. In reference to the admitted that are scandalous. 3. In reference to the admitters. 4. In reference to the Joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Communicants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As to the Sacraments, there is a twofold pollution: The <hi>First</hi> is, Intrinsick and Essential, which by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Institution of Christ, turneth it then to be no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as it is in the Masse: or to be hurtful; as when Significant Ceremonies, sinfully devised by men, are mixed and added besides, and contrary to Christs Institution. The First everteth the Nature of the Sacrament, and it's hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth no more a Sacrament. The <hi>2d</hi> poysoneth it, so that it may not be received without partaking of that sin actively.</p>
               <p>There is another way of polluting the Sacrament, that is Extrinsick and Circumstantial, not in Essentialls, but in our use-making of it, and ther Application thereof beyond Christs Warrant, as when it is Administred to one upon whom Christ alloweth it not. In that case it is not a Sacrament to that person; yet it is so in it self. This Pollution is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of it to us, or a making it common. Thus the Word


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55484:83"/>

For wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Institution; the reason is, because that which warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth debarring and censures of all sorts, is edification; and when that end cannot be gained to a people or person, such censures may be omitted; and except some bounds were to be fixed, here, the difficulty in abounding differences would prove inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable: And therefore, when a sin is become Epidemical, and very Universal; On the one hand the more tender and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously-scrupulous would be instructed to much sobriety, and earnestly dealt with, not to indulge themselves a liberty to rent the Church, or to divide from it when such persons are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being otherwise capable of the priviledge; because exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in this case by a sentence from the Sacrament, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably miss its end, which is, Edification, and would weaken the Authority of the Ordinance of discipline, if not hazard the liberty of the Gospel: On the other hand, Ministers would by all means take head, and be obtested in the name of the Lord, that they (which is readily incident in an hour of tentation) run not on the Extream of shifting their duty, insulting as it were over tender Consciences, and strengthening the hands of the Wicked by compliance with, or accession to these sins; but would under the pain of making themselves horridly guilty, manage obvious ways, deal fairly and faithfully in making use of the Key of Doctrine, when the use of the other will not in all appearance be so much for edification; that by publick doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal separating the Precious from the Vile, and by straight down-right private dealing, they may in the sight of God commend themselves to every mans Conscience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us consider if this Ordinance be polluted to the joynt-Receivers; suppose that some are sinfully admitted by the Office-bearers of the Church? And we say that it i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution or sin to them to partake with such, for the Sacrament may be blessed to them notwithstanding, as Christ's Ordinance,


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55484:85"/>
even as when the Word is unwarrantably applyed in promises and admonitions; so that Pearls are cast before Swine: yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing some tender souls to be present, they may meddle war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably with that abused Word as God's Word, and it may prove useful to them; For confirming this Truth, we offer these Reasons.</p>
               <p>The first is, The Word and Sacraments are of one Nature, and are polluted or made use of, one and the same way; only the difference is in this, That the one usually is doctrinally wronged, the other disciplinarily. 2. Because-that, unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable admission of others is not the Communicator's, but the Minister's sin, therefore it cannot wrong them more than want of preparation in others who come. 3. Any others sin cannot loosen me from my Obligation to a duty: now it is the duty of every one, as <hi>to examine themselves,</hi> so being prepared by suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble self-examination, <hi>to eat,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. and yet in that Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> many did sinfully approach to the Lords Table: Now though the Command requiring self-examination, will not warrant Rulers not to examine, yet it will warrant private Communicants to endeavour rightly to go about that duty themselves, and not to be much anxious what others do, as if other mens carriage were the ground of our approaching to the Lords Table. 4. It is notwithstanding a Sacrament without any mixture of mens corrupt additions, and so the neglecting of it, is the neglecting of a Sacrament. 5. If scandalous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers did corrupt it to others, then a corrupt Minister could never celebrate a Sacrament; which would contradict the Lords way in appointing such somtimes to dispense his Mysteries both in the Old and New Testament; and if the Ministers corruption pollute not the Ordinance, much less will the scandal of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 6. The practise of the Lord's People in receiving Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments this way, both before Christs Incarnation, and since, proveth it. 7. It would be a great and inextricable snare to Consciences, if the fruit of their communicating depended not only on their own preparing themselves, but also on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and joynt-Receivers; if their not preparation or failing in it, brought guilt on us, it were impossible that ever we could with clearness receive the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:55484:85"/>For 1. It is hard to think, a Communion is celebrated but there is one or more who should not be admitted, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of one or two, as well as of many is a prophaning of the Ordinance: yea, if we thought them to be scandalous; yea, if we knew them not to be holy, we could not in Faith communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them, lest the Ordinance be defiled by us, if their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing were ours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The presence of a Hypocrite would defile it to us, for his Hypocrisie defileth it to him, and he has not right before God, to come, neither would it warrant us that we knew not: For 1. Many do sin, when they know not. 2. It is not our knowing his sin that defileth the Sacrament, but it is his Hypocrisie and Rottenness. 3. Thus the same Sacrament might be as God's Ordinance participated warrantably by one who knew not, and not by another who knew this; which were hard to make out.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Believers their being out of a frame, would pollute this Ordinance to us, and incapacitate us to receive it, for it is in that case sin to them, and we should keep as great a distance from their sins, as from the sins of others.</p>
               <p>Yea, 4. One could not communicate with himself (to speak so) if that ground were true: For 1. We have Corruption. 2. We know we have it, as well as we can know any other mans. 3. It doth pollute the Ordinance in part to our selves, and bringeth guilt with it; therefore, if sin known in another, would do it, much more that which is in our selves; for if it be Corruption as known to be in others, that polluteth it; then that same known in our selves must have that same effect: for, <hi>à quatenus ad omne valet consequentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be said 1. This Corruption is but halfe (to say so) in our selves, being weakened by grace, and not allowed. <hi>Answ.</hi> Yet it is Corruption, and certainly half-corruption in our selves will weigh more than whole corruption in another, especially considering that necessarily this polluteth in part all our holy things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be said, We cannot be freed from Corruption, while here, and so we could not go about any duty, if that reasoning were good. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 A mixture of good and bad in the visible Church, is as certain as a mixture of Grace &amp; Corruption in a


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55484:86"/>
Believer. 2. If our own corruption which involveth us in sin in the manner of our doing duties, will not loosen us from a commanded duty, much le <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s sin in others; yea, we are no less prohibited to communicate with sin and corruption in our selves, than in others; and also we are commanded as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to purge our own hearts as the Church.</p>
               <p>This truth in doctrine the sober of the Independents ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove as to themselves (what ever be their practice as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) as the only way to eschew confusion, and keep unity and order: So <hi>Hookers</hi> Survey, <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>Amesius</hi> de consc. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Norton adver.

               </p>
               <p>As for other Questions, as, How the Sacraments Seal? or what they Seal? the <hi>major</hi> or the <hi>minor</hi> proposition? the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise as a Covenant, or as a testament legating Christ and his benefits to us? These would require a larger dispute than our intended work will admit, and therefore we shall not meddle with them.</p>
               <p>The last thing in which we shall instance the breach of this Command, is in reference to the duty of Fasting; concerning which we would take notice of two things: 1. That Fasting is a solemn piece of external religious worship, when rightly and religiously discharged. 2. That men may be guilty of many sins as to their practice in reference thereto.</p>
               <p>First: That it is a piece of external worship, is clear. 1. From Precepts commanding it. 2. From the practises and examples of the Saints in Scripture. 3. From Scripture-directions given to regulate us in it; yet it differeth from Prayer and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 1. That those are ordinary pieces of Worship, but this is extraordinary, proceeding from special occasions, either of a Cross lying on, or 2. Feared and imminent; 3. or some great thing which we are to Suit for, or such like. Although it be an extraordinary piece of Worship; yet the more holy we read any to have been, we find they have been the more in this duty of Fasting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to consider that Fasting is not of it self a piece of immediate worship, as Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but mediate only as it is made use of to be helpful to some other duty, such as Praying, Humbling of our selves, Mortification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:55484:86"/>Again, 3. Fasting may be considered in four respects: 1. As it is gone about in secret, by one single person setting himself a part for Prayer, and for Fasting to that end; many  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nstances whereof are in Scripture. 2. As its private, or a little more publick, being gone about by a Family, or some few persons joyning together, as <hi>Esther</hi> and her Maids. 3. As it is publick, being performed by a Congregation, as <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2, 3. 4. As gone about by a whole national Church: These four are all mentioned, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.11, 12. where we find, 1. the whole Land. 2. Families together. 3. Families a-part. 4. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Persons or Wives a-part, setting about this duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider Fasting in respect of the causes that call for it, and there are 1. Publick causes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. 2. Particular and Personal, as of <hi>David</hi> for his Child, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16. 3. For others, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35.13. And 4. it is to be minded in a special way for helping us against spiritual evils, casting out of Devils, mortifying of Lusts, as also under sad temporal Crosses and Losses, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.21. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. ult.</p>
               <p>Next, as there are some times and cases in all these which call for Fasting with Prayer to be seriously gone about; so we may sin in reference to this duty many ways: As 1. When it is slighted, and not gone about at all; and thus men are guilty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1. By contemning it, or 2. Counting it not necessary; or 3. By negligence, so that we will not be at pains to stir up our selves to a frame for it: Or 4. Will not leave our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, or work for it. 5. In not esteeming highly of it. 6. In not labouring to have sit opportunities to go about it. 7. In scarring at it as a burden. 8. In casting it up as Hypocrisie to others, and mocking at it in them. 9. In not joyning in our affection with others we know are Fasting. 10. In our unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent use of it. 11. In neglecting causes that relate to the publick, or to others; contenting our selves with what relateth to our own necessity. 12. In not being affected with our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of that duty, nor mourning for it, and repenting of it, nor being humbled under the many evils which the neglecting of it carryeth along with it. 13. At least neglecting one part or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this duty of Fasting. 14. Not setting our selves seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to be at the end designed in Fasting, which maketh us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglect it, or go formally about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:55484:87"/>In going about this duty of Fasting, there are two Evils to be avoyded: The 1. is, giving too much to it, as if it did merit, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 1. or as if it self did mortifie sin, or make holy, or were Religious worship in it self: The 2. is on the other hand, when it getteth too little, being looked on as not necessary or profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the framing of ones spirit, and sitting them for Prayer, self-examination or wrestling with God, and not accounted a sit mean for that end, more than when it is neglected.</p>
               <p>In speaking of the sins we are guilty of, as to this duty, we are to consider more particularly how we sin before it, in our preparation to it. 2. In our going about it. 3. When it is ended.</p>
               <p>And first, before our going about it, we sin 1. When the right end of a Fast is mistaken, and it is not considered as a mean to help us to a more spiritual frame. 2. When we do not stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be clear in, and to consider the special grounds that call us to it, not ayming to have our heart from conviction affected sutably with them. 3. When we are not put to it from the right motive, but go about it selfily, to be seen of men; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.16. or for the fashion. 4. When its not gone about in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to a command of God, and so we Fast to our selves, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5. 5. When there is no secret examination of our own hearts, to try what frame we are in, what lusts reign in us, or prevail over us; Nor 6. any particular dealing with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand to be enabled for this duty, and helped in it, and that both for our selves and others. 7. When we are not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to be in good terms with God, and studying to be clear as to that, before we come to put up suits to him. 8. When we neglect Christ, and turn legal in it. 9. When we do not separate our selves from all other affairs timously the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 10. When we are lazie in rising so timely that day as should be. 11 When we do not (if it be secret) labour to be unseen in it to any. 12. Not setting our selves seriously to it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3. abstracting our selves from diversions, and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing up our selves for it.</p>

By not joyning seriously with others, when they pray, especially in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which concern others. 14.

By little of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Repentance or sense of Sin, that day for humbling the Heart in the sense of our own Vileness, and loathing of our selves. 16.

By being defective in Reading and Meditating on what may humble us; but much more when by Looks, Words, or Thoughts, we marr the right frame, and sett of our Hearts. 19.

               <p n="3">3d. We sin after Fasting. 1st. Soon returning to other thoughts. 2. Letting any frame we had attained, slack and wear out. 3.

               <p>These Particulars applyed to our own Hearts, may be useful for our Conviction, and Humiliation. Ah! Who can say I am Clean? All of us are Guilty, either by neglecting such Duties, or by thus and thus going about them unsuitably: from those Sins, we may read also the contrary Duties, or Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiaons, that are required for the right discharge of these Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The preventing of these Sins, will bring in the Duties called for, and the right manner of going about them. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55484:88"/>
the going about these Duties, without the manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, is but as it were the making of some <hi>Image,</hi> for our selves in the Lords Worship, which he has not commanded, and so he may say, <hi>Is it such a Fast that I have chosen?</hi> Isaiah, 58. 5. or, Is it such a Prayer I called for; and, <hi>Who hath required these things at your Hands?</hi> Isa. 1.12. These Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, which the Lord putteth to our Conscience, will make many Prayers, and Praises, and much Worship, that now seemeth to be in great Bings or Heaps, come down to a smal bulk, when they are thus fanned, sisted, and searched by this Seive; and all those things casten, which are found to be Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this Command.</p>
               <p>We come now to the manner how this Command is pr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssed, which is. 1st. By a Reason. 2d. By a Commination 3d. By a Promise. All which speak a readiness in men to fail in this Command, and a special notice that God taketh of the Duties required in it, and of the Sins forbidden in it. Men might readily say; What needeth so much Rigidity in the manner of Worship? and, If it be to the true God, though it have in it some mixture of those things, which have been formerly abused, it is not much to be stood upon: The Lord therefore in pressing it, addeth this Reason, <hi>I am a Jealous God,</hi> (saith he) that will not onely have my Church and Spouse, Honest and Chast indeed, but Chast-like: As <hi>Caesar</hi> said, His Wife behoved, not onely to abstain from all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty, but from all Suspicious Carriage: Even so will the Lord have his People carry it so to him, as a Wife should carry to a Jealous Husband, with such Circumspection, as he may not have any occasion of Suspicion. <hi>Jealousie</hi> here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth two things. 1. A Facility or Aptness, as it were to suspect any thing which may look like a giving that to any other, which is due to God: So a Husband is said to be Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, when he is apt to suspect want of Love in his Wife, and is ready to gather from every Circumstance, her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another; even though there be no palpably De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative Ground of it. Thus Jealousie is taken amongst Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It importeth a severe Indignation, against every thing which giveth Ground of Suspition; it cannot abide that:


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55484:89"/>
Hence Jealousie is called, <hi>The Rage of a Man,</hi> Prov. 6.38. This Wrong will not be endured, when many others will be dispensed with. Any thing that seemingly slighteth Him, or inclineth the Heart to another, is to Jealousie insufferable. These two, after the manner of men (as many other things) are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to God, to shew that he will not admit, that which is Suspicious-like in His service; but if his People depart from him in deviating in the least from the Rule given, He will be provoked to be avenged on them for it. This is the force of the Reason: The Commination or Threatning added, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth this; it is in these Words, <hi>Visiting the Iniquities of the Fathers on the Children.</hi> To <hi>Visit</hi> here, is, To punish the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for the Fathers Faults; though God should seem for the time to forget the Breaches of this Command, and not to take notice of Corruptions introduced by men in his Worship; yet, saith he, <hi>I will Visit,</hi> or revenge that Iniquity, not only upon the present Race, but upon the following, even <hi>Vpon the Third and Fourth Generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For clearing this, let us see, First, What is the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here threatned? 2. On whom it is? Upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of them that transgress this Command. 3. How it is executed? 4. Why the Lord doth so? That we may vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this place, and clear it from Appearance of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, with that in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 18. Where it is said, <hi>The Son shall not bear the Iniquity of his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The First Question then; is, What it is that is here Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? <hi>Answ.</hi> We doe not think that this place speaketh only of Temporal Punishments, and that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> of Eternal: For the Scope of both, will contradict this; for that passage <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. is occasioned from the Peoples present straits, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth directly of Temporal Judgements; so, that Distinction will not clear this seeming Contradiction. Therefore we conceive here to be understood mainly Spiritual and Eternal Evils, which God threatneth to the Children of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parents. (For, that Temporal Judgements follow them, and are included in the Threatning there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on).</p>
               <p>This will be clear, 1st. By considering that the thing threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here, is, that punishment which the Breach of, or Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55484:89"/>
committed against this Command, or other Commands, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth; yea it is the Punishment, that sinful Parents deserve, he <hi>Visiteth the Iniquities of the Fathers,</hi> on the Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that which the Breach of this Law, or which the Parents Guilt deserveth, is Eternal Judgement, and not Temporal only. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The thing threatned here is proportionally of the same Nature, with the thing promised afterward; the one being opposite to the other: But it were a wronging of Gods Mercy, to his People, to say, that his <hi>Mercy</hi> only looketh to Temporal Benefits. <hi>Ergo,</hi> this Threatning must also look unto, and comprehend Eternal Plagues.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scope may clear it; which is, To restrain Parents, from the Sins here forbidden; because by such Sins they bring Wrath, not only on themselves, but on their Posterity after them, even when they are gone, as ye have it <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.18. Now this reason would not have such weight, if the Plagues threatned to Parents were Eternal, and to their Children, but Temporal.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Threatning must put some Difference betwixt the Children of the Wicked, and the Children of the Godly: But Temporal Difficulties, and Stroks will not clear up this Difference: for often the Children of the Godly, share most in these. It must therefore be in Spiritual Things, they differ mainly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What is threatned here, must especially in the Event, <hi>Light upon the Third and Fourth Generation,</hi> And not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily go beyond that. Now ordinarily the Children of Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men in outward things, thrive best unto the Third and Fourth Generation; and after that come their Temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; therefore it cannot be that, which is here only, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, meaned.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Consider <hi>Caein, Ham,</hi> &amp;c. upon whose Posterity, this Curse was peculiarly derived, and there you will find somewhat more than what is Temporal.</p>
               <p>The Second thing to be cleared here, is, the Party threatned to be thus punished: It is not the Fathers that are expressed, but the Children after them, as it is <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.18. All is fore-faulted, the whole Stock, and Family; Concerning


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55484:90"/>
which, let us take these Three Considerations along with us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That these Children punished, are not Innocent in themselves, but being guilty before the Lord by Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; or by both it and Actual Sin, making themselves liable to such Plagues; they have no reason to say, <hi>The Fathers have Eaten Sour Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth are set on Edge</hi>: For whether the Judgements be Temporal or Spiritual, the Children have deserved them, and cannot say they are wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this Consideration reconcileth this place, with that of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where God putteth them to it, thus: None Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent are plagued; but ye are plagued: therefore saith he, Read your own sin out of your Plagues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider, that the Threatning against Children of such Parents, is here limited to the Third or Fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; all their Posterity is not cursed thereby. 1. Because Gods kindness is such, as to leave a Door open for Penitents. All fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet Mercy opened a Door of Hope to sinful Man: And surely the Threatnings of this new Covenant, are not so peremptorie, as to shut the Door of <hi>Mercy upon Sinners.</hi> 2. The Third and Fourth Generation are especially threatned, because these are nearest the Parent, and have most of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in them; he knoweth them best; and often he may live to see these: Therefore the Lord threatneth these, that it may most affect Parents; it being for the Second, Third, and Fourth Generation, that they most ordinarily travel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider, that in this Threatning, (as also in the Promise following) God doth not give or lay down a constant Rule, to which he will be tyed, as if he could not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise at any time; For to say that, were Derogatory to his Election, and the Soveraignty of his Grace; and therefore that is not the Scope: But here he giveth a Declaration of what usually, and ordinarily he doth, and what men, if he deal with them in Justice, may expect from Him: Yet it is still so to be understood, as the Son of a Wicked Person, may be found to be an Elect, and the Son of a Godly Person Rejected; that he may continue his Plagues longer than the Third or Fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or break them off sooner when he thinketh Good. For though by this, He would restrain Parents from Sin, yet


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55484:90"/>
hath he a door open to many such children for mercy; even as the contrary promise hath many exceptions as to the Children of Godly Parents, that walk not in the paths of their Parents going before them, as many known instances of both, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do make out.</p>
               <p>The third Question is, How God doth execute this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? or, How he doth reach Children with eternal Plagues for their Parents sins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He doth it certainly, and he doth it justly: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Children must not only be considered as guilty, but as guilty of the sins of their Parents, which we may thus conceive; 1. As to the Child of a wicked Parent, lying in natural Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God denyeth and with-holdeth his renewing and restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace which he is not obliged to confer; and the Lord in this may respect the Parents guilt justly. 2. When grace is denyed, then followeth the temptation of the Parents practise, the Devil stirring up, to the like sin, and they furthering their Children to wickedness by their example, advice, authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that it cometh to pass in Gods justice, that they are given up to vent their natural corruption in these ways, and so come as it is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.13. to approve their Parents sayings. 3. Upon this followeth God's casting the Child, now guilty of his Parents faults, into eternal Perdition with him; and that this is the meaning of the threatning, will appear by the examples of Gods justice in this matter, when wicked Parents have Children that are not so much miserable in regard of temporal things, as they are wicked, cursed, and plagued with Ungodliness; so was <hi>Cains</hi> Children, so were the Children of <hi>Cham,</hi> and so were <hi>Esau's,</hi> who were all for a long time prosperous in the world, but following their Fathers sins (a main part of their Curse) God afterward visited them, on them, with sad temporal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments also.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it be asked, Why God thus plagueth and threatneth the Children of wicked Parents? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. God doth it to make sin hateful, seeing it bringeth often a forfeiture of spiritual blessings, yea, of blessings of all sorts, upon whole Generations and Families. 2. To strike the more terrour into others, who by this may be scared from sin, and made to stand in awe of God, who is so dreadful as to put a mark of Infamy on the race


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55484:91"/>
and posterity of his Enemies. 3. The more to affect and weight the Sinner; it is a part of his punishment to know that by his sin he has not only made himself miserable, but all his Posterity: And these may be the Reasons, why, as it were by the light of nature, all Nations in some cases are led not only to punish the persons of some Malefactors, but to fore-fault, an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> put a note of Infamy on their Posterity, for some kind of faults. 4. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Gods greatness, that men may know how soveraign he is; and how, Treason against the most high is to be accounted of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. It is to commend holiness, and the necessity of it, to God's people, and to put them to enrich themselves and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in God, and a good Conscience, rather than in all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral riches.</p>
               <p>These same Questions and Answers may serve to clear what concerneth the Promise also, they being sutably applyed to it.</p>
               <p>It is further to be observed that the Lord expresseth wicked men under that notion, <hi>Them that hate me,</hi> to shew what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and on the matter, Sin, even the least sin, amounteth unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its hatred of God, as being done (as it were) in despight of him, and preferring some lust to him; for there is no question but were God loved, Holiness, (which is his Image) would be loved also; and where it is universally hated, so must He be; for a man cannot serve two Masters, where their commands and actings are contrary, but he must hate the one, and love the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And seeing it is certain that Sinners make sin their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and do not hate it; therefore, they must hate God, who giveth contrary Commands: and so somtimes Sinners wish that there were not such Commands. Again, he expresseth the Godly in the Promise, under these two designations, 1. <hi>Those that Love me,</hi> that is the inward Fountain and comprehensive sum of all duties. 2. <hi>Those that keep my Commandements,</hi> that looketh to the outward effects of Love, and is the proof of it, so that there is no mid's betwixt these two, to Love God, and keep his Commandements, and to Hate him, and slight, or break his Commandements, and so no mid's betwixt God's gracio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s promise to Parents and Children, and his Curse on both.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55484:91"/>Lastly: It would be in a particular way observed, that though every sin hath hatred to God in it, yet he puteth this name of Hating him, in a special way upon the sin of corrupting his Worship and Service, to shew that there is a special enmity against God in that Sin, and that it is in a special way hateful to him; as upon the other hand he taketh Zeal for the purity of his Worship, as a singular evidence of love to him.</p>
               <p>Let us close this Command with some words of Use; and</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ye may see what good or evil to us and ours, and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, there is in Disobedience or in Holiness: O Parents! what mercy is it to you, your selves, and to your Children that you be Godly? Alas, this Curse here threatned, is too palpable upon many Children, who are cursed with profanity from the Womb upward: Why do you that are Parents wrong your poor Infants? and why neglect ye that which is best for them? Here also there is matter of much comfort to Parents fearing God; this Promise is a standing portion to a thousand Generations, which though it be not peremptory, as to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual persons; yet 1. It secludeth none. 2. It compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth many. 3. It giveth ground for us to be quiet for all our Posterity, till they by their own carriage disclaim that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant wherein this Promise is included. 4. It giveth War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for a Believer to expect that God may make up his Election amongst his Seed rather than amongst others: It is true, sometimes he chooseth some of the Posterity of wicked Parents, yet oft-times the Election of Grace falleth upon the Posterity of the Godly. 5. It is a ground upon which we may quiet our selves for temporal things needful to our Children; certainly these promises are not for nought, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.26. and 102. <hi>ult.</hi> 112.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be humble, O be humble before God, for he is Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Abhor sin, for it is hateful.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Love Holiness, for it is useful to us and ours: First, Thereby our Children have temporal mercies so far as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.26. 2. They have spiritual and saving mercies amongst them. 3. They have all Church-priviledges, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Children of them that are within God's Covenant.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:55484:92"/>5. Children! Be humbled under the sense of the Iniquity of your Parents, when ye remember their ways: or possess what unjustly they have gotten, ye become guilty of their sins without Repentance. Especially you have need to take notice of this, that are the Children of Parents, that have opposed the purity of God's Service and Worship, and the work of its Reformation, and have been Corrupters of it: Children may be partakers of their Parents faults, and so plagued for them several ways; and we think that this forfeiture is more than ordinary. And therefore, as, amongst men, there are special crimes beyond ordinary procuring such a sentence, so is it here. And 1. They be guilty by following their foot-steps, in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Parents sins, as <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Children did. 2. In ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Fathers way, praising their Fathers sayings or doings; as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.13. 3. In winking at their Parents Sins and Wickedness. 4. In boasting of their Oppressions, Blood-shed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they were acts of valour and man hood. 5. In being content that their Fathers sinned, if it gained any possession to them. 6. In possessing and enjoying without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance what to their knowledge they sinfully purchased. 7. In spending Prodigally and Riotously what the Parents Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously gathered; the sin of the Parent here, is the Seed of the Sons sin. 8. In professing sorrow for the want of occasion to live in Ignorance, Prophanity, or Looseness as their Fathers did, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17, 18, 19. they said that things went well then. In not being humbled before God for the Sins of Predecessors, nor confessing them to Him; as <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.42. nor repairing the Losses or Injuries which we knew they did to any that were wronged or oppressed by them.</p>

               <p>By all these God is to be known, and something of him may be seen, and we take under <hi>Name</hi> here all these to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: The first, because the scope is to Hallow himself in Obedience to all that he Commandeth, as appeareth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.31, 32. and the first Petition in the Lord's Prayer, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> being compared with the other two that follow, cleareth it. The second is properly and primarily in the very letter here understood. The third cometh in by native conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for attaining the scope of the Command, so that there is neither word nor work of God, but all relateth to this.</p>
               <p>The Second thing to be cleared, is, What is meant by taking <hi>his Name in vain. To take his Name</hi> (as it's <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.16. and 16.4.) is to mention any of those things before spoken of (which are so many pieces of his Name) or any way to meddle with them in thought, word, or deed, as by writing, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: <hi>In vain</hi> doth not only comprehend, 1.

               <p n="2">2. It is required that the matter be not only lawful, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and of some weight: hence Lotting for a thing of nought, or Swearing in a thing of no importance, are an abusing of the Name of God, and a tempting of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is required that the matter be necessary also; for if a thing may be decided other-ways, it ought to be neither by Lotting nor Swearing; hence in the Hebrew, to Swear is still used in the passive voyce, to shew that men ought not to Swear but when they can do no otherwise, and when a lawful call presseth to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It would  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>There is this difference betwixt this Command and others; in other Commands, God expresseth the highest degree of every kind of sin, to scare men from the breaches of these Commands;

               <p>If it be asked, Why the Lord is so peremptory in urging this Command, and in pressing the thing here commanded in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leightest?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That he may in this set out his own Greatness, and work a fear and reverence of him in the hearts of his people; therefore will he have them reverently using that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth him, that the due distance betwixt God that is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Creatures that are on Earth, may be imprinted on us, and entertained by us, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>Lev.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because his Name, whereby he holdeth forth somthing of himself, or that infinit excellent Being, called God, is great, dreadful and glorious, and is so to be had in reverence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 111. that more than ordinary watchfulness should be used in testifying our respect to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because this is the way to curb Atheism and Prophanity, which the Devil driveth on by these steps; first to think little of God, and then by little and little to inure men to proha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and habituate them to baffle and affront the Name of God: Hence it is that he takes possession, mainly, of young ones this way; and hardly ye will see any that irreverently medleth with the Name of God, but they are gross, or fall at length to be gross, in other things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God's Name is precious, and given to his people for a great refuge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10. therefore will he not have that which is their singular mercy to be abused.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:55484:94"/>For more particular considering the matter and breaches of this Command, we shall draw it to these heads; and 1. We shall speak to what concerneth Swearing, Vowing, or publick Cov <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Concerning Lots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These we shall consider, especially with respect to our practise.</p>
               <p>In speaking of what concerneth Oaths, we would 1. speak of an Oath. 2. Of the Obligation of it, for this Command both requireth Oaths, and the keeping of them, and it may be broken in reference to both.</p>
               <p>We would in the entry distinguish betwixt these four 1. Oaths. 2. Asseverations. 3. Simple affirmations or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions. 4. Imprecations or Curses.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Oaths are such as directly invocate God by such like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as <hi>Be, or By, as By my holiness I have sworne,</hi> Psal. 89. <hi>I swear by the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Asseverations (called vehement Assertions) are expressed thus, <hi>As the Lord liveth, As that Light shineth, in Conscience, Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Simple assertions are such as <hi>in truth, truly, indeed,</hi> which but speak the thing simply, and affirm that to be true or false that is asserted, and so belongeth to the 9th. Command only, as such.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Imprecations are either directed to ones self conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as if such a thing be truth, <hi>then let me perish; Shame befall me</hi> if I do not this or this; or towards others, especially in these, <hi>Shame befall thee, the Devil take thee, a Vengeance on th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e,</hi> and other expressions abominable to mention.</p>
               <p>Again, in Oaths which are for confirmation, let us distinguish betwixt assertory Oaths, that do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but confirm such a thing to be truth; and promissory Oaths, that ingage the person Swearing to the performance of such a thing for the time to come, either absolutely or with qualifications.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:55484:95"/>For clearing the matter, take this proposition, that Oaths in both these cases being well qualified, is a lawful piece of God's worship, and may, and should be made use of by his People; this is a clear truth from these Scriptures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who deny the lawfulness of Oaths under the New Testament, we are not now to meddle with them, because there be few in these days that are in such an Errour. We shall consider 1. What qualifications are requisite to right Swearing: Then 2. Clear some practical questions. 3. Shew wherein this Command is violate in respect of Swearing.</p>
               <p>In an Oath consider, 1. Its matter. 2. Its form. 3. Its rise, or mens Call to it. 4. The expressions its conceived in. 5. Our manner of going about it. 6. Our keeping of it, which followeth after to be spoken to distinctly.</p>
               <p>First, for the matter of an Oath, <hi>Assertory Oaths</hi> must be of things that are 1. True. 2. Weighty. 3. They must be such to our knowledge. Again, <hi>Promissory Oaths</hi> must be in things just and lawful, possible, profitable, and in our power, and which to our knowledge are such.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The forme must be By the true God, it being a peculiar part of his worship, for we can swear by none whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not invocate, therefore Idols, Creatures, Graces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded here, for none of these are God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its rise must be Edification, that is God's glory, our own vindication, or our Neighbours good, or the call of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate putting us to it; and it should be used for deciding of Controversies, when no other mean of clearing or deciding such a thing is remaining; hence we say, <hi>juratus fuit,</hi> he was Sworn passively; and the Hebrews have no active word for expressing it, to let us see men ought not to swear, but to be sworne, or by necessity pressed to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to the expressions in which it is conceived, or the thing sworne; its required, not only that it be truth to, and in the mans meaning that sweareth, but that the expressions be plain and intelligible to his meaning and understanding, to whom the Oath is given; otherwise it deludeth, but doth not clear. Hence these two rules are to be observed. 1. That the meaning be so clear, as may be, and is most ordinarily and obviou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55484:95"/>
from such words and expressions as are used. 2. That the expressions be according as they are supposed to be understood by others, especially him that exacteth the Oath; for if he mean one thing, and we another, God's Name is prophaned, and the end of an Oath frustrate; much more equivocations in expressions and mental reservations are to be condemned here; the first whereof taketh in Ambiguity in words; the second, a different sense in our thoughts from what seemeth to be meaned in our words.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As to the right manner of Swearing, these things ought to be noticed: 1. That it be in judgment, that we understand the thing we Swear, and the nature of our Oath, and him we swear by, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. 2. Fear and Reverence in going about it, as being in an especial way in God's own sight; thus, <hi>to fear an Oath,</hi> is a good property, and the heart would be filled with the apprehension of a present God. 3. Singleness in the end, that it be not to deceive any, but to express the truth truly and faithfully, called <hi>Righteousness,</hi> Jer. 4.2. And for the most part these properties or qualifications may agree to Oaths, Asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Imprecations.</p>
               <p>For the further clearing of this matter, we would speak to some questions.</p>
               <p>And the 1. Question is, How then differ Oat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s from Asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> They should both be in Truth &amp; Judgment with fear, and when called unto; but in this they differ, that in Oaths we are only to make mention of the true God, and swear by him, but Asseverations may be thus expressed, <hi>As thy Soul liveth,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. v. 2.4, 6. and yet we do not swear by the Soul of any.</p>
               <p>A 2d. <hi>Question</hi> is, What may we judge of such Oathes, as are, By Angels, Saints, <hi>Mary, Paul,</hi> &amp; By other Creatures, as Heaven, Light, the World, by Soul, Conscience. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or by Graces, as by Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We need not use much Curiosity in Distinctions: For, we conceive them all to be simply unlawful. 1. Because none of these are God, and swearing is a Peculiar piece of his Worship, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. And swearing by any thing what ever it be, which is not God, is condemned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7. <hi>They


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55484:96"/>
have sworn by those who are not Gods.</hi> 2. Because we cannot invocate any of these, and therefore cannot swear by them, seeing an Oath carryeth along with it, an Invocation of him we swear by. 3. Because they want these Properties due to such, to whom this Worship belongeth. As 1. Omniscience, to try whether we mean as we have sworn or not. 2. Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency. And 3. Justice to avenge, if it be not so as we have sworn. 4. Soveraignty, to call the Swearers to a Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. 4. Because it would derogate from the Scope of this Command, which giveth this to God alone, as his due, and implyeth, that he alone hath all these Properties in him. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such Oathes are expresly Prohibited by Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.34. <hi>Swear not all, neither by Heaven nor Earth</hi>; For, they stand in an Inferiour Relation to God, and are his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. 6. Because as none of these things are God to take Order with us if we swear falsly; so none of them are so ours, as we can lay them in Pledge, for the least Change to be made upon them, in Case our Oath be not true; none of them can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto or diminished from by us. We cannot make one of our Haires Black or White; and therefore ought not to swear by our Head; much-less can we quiet our Conscience, or increase our Faith, that we should so freely swear by these. That place <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.36. cleareth this: For that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.16, 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> speaketh of the Obligation of an Oath sinfully made, as to that manner of swearing, which yet still bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: but it warranteth not the making of such Oaths.</p>
               <p>A. 3d. <hi>Quest.</hi> is, What is to be judged concerning Asseverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; such as, <hi>In Conscience, good Faith, as I shall answer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as I am a Christian; as I have a Soul to be saved,</hi> and such like? <hi>Answer</hi> 1. We think, there is no Question, but if these were rightly, and in the due manner made use of, they might be lawfully used, as Scripture cleareth. 2. Yea, we think, If any Oaths be made use of, these would first he used; and a man may be called to use one of these, when he is not, directly to swear. 3. Therefore we think they cannot be used, but in necessity when less will not serve, and should be used with Fear, Reverence, Understanding, and the other Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And that therefore they sin, who in Common Discourse, rash <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y and vainly use them, which we conc <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55484:96"/>
here; and when they are not Conscientiously used, they lead men to a greater Degree of the sin, here discharged: as we see some begin with Asseverations, then idle Oaths; and then Imprecations, as <hi>Peter</hi> sinfully did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. Reason 1. All these Asseverations are reductible Oaths, and imply the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imprecations in them. Thus, Let me not be esteemed a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, nor have a Soul to be saved; which must relate to God for executing these; therefore, being indirect Oaths, they ought to be used as Oaths, and belong to this Command. 2. Because the very end of any vehement Asseveration, is to confirm what is said, further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than an ordinary Assertion can: Now in so far, it is an Oath; it being proper to an Oath, to confirm what is spoken, and seeing it agreeth with an Oath in the Essentialls, they must be materially one, though Asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, be pronounced in another Form. 3. Vain Asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, are against that Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.37. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Let your Communication be Yea, Yea, and Nay, Nay, and what-ever is more</hi> (in ordinary Communication) <hi>is Evil</hi>: And it cannot be denyed but this is more, and therefore needless and sinful. 4. We do not find Asseverations, such as <hi>My Conscience beareth me Witnesse,</hi> to be used (warrantably) by Saints in Scripture; but with great Reverence, even almost in such things as they used to confirm by Oaths; therefore Swearing is often joyned with them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. 5. For what end are they used? It's either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm some-thing, or to no end; Beside, the needless use of them habituateth Folk to baffle and prophane excellent things, and do inure them to prophanity: hence these that use them most are ordinarily lesse tender in their other Carriage, and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to direct swearing at length. If it be said <hi>good Faith,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth no more but in Truth, and without Dissimulation, (as it's understood sometimes in the Laws,) <hi>Bona Fide,</hi> and <hi>Mala Fide. Ans.</hi> Yet <hi>Faith</hi> is otherwise taken in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Acceptation, and Words would be so used, as they are commonly made use of by others. 2. If it be not Evil, yet it hath the appearance of Evil, which should be eschewed and abstained from, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.17. 3. Whatever <hi>Good Faith</hi> signifieth, yet certainly in our common use, it's more than a simple Assertion; therefore, should a man tell me an untruth, and


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55484:97"/>

Yea, would he not be thought Infamous in breaking his Good Faith? Therefore it is more than Yea or Nay, and so not ordinarily to be used. Yea, we conceive that these Asseverations will have more weight on Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, than simple Asserions; and therefore the Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of dealing Falsly in these, will bite and wound the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, much more sharply than falsifying simple Assertions, which speaketh out this; that they are nearer of kin unto, and more involved in this Command, than at first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Such as are used against others, (I speak by private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,) as, <hi>Shame fall thee, Divel take thee,</hi> and the like; which are either Conditional, as, If thou do not such a thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or absolute, without any such Condition. We say then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That keeping the Qualifications, formerly mentioned, and required to an Oath; one may in some cases lawfully use some Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, even to ones self, the S <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="2">2. Cursing of others by private Persons, out of Passion or Revenge, is simply prohibited, and that in several Respects. For 1. It derogateth from the Glory of God, if He be therein invocated in making Him subservient to our Passions, and to Execute our Revenge; or if He be not  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. As for mentioning the Divel in such Imprecations, as <hi>Divel a bit</hi> or <hi>Fiend a Body,</hi> or such like, it is most Abominable: For thereby the Devil is employed in Gods Room, and God is forsaken; because there is no ground to exspect a hearing of such a Suit from Him, &amp; so you betake you to the Devil, praying him, employing him, rever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Men need not go to the <hi>Wild-Indians,</hi> nor to Witches, to seek Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of the Devil! Alas! There are many such to be found amongst Christians! How sound these Words? What Devil now! The Meckle Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>! It is Horrible to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that which goeth out of some Mens mouths without any fear! Ah! What can be the Reason that Christians thus Worship the Devil, and swear by him, as <hi>Israel</hi> did by <hi>Baal</hi>?</p>
               <p>There remain yet some things concerning Oaths, especially Promissy Oaths to be cleared. As 1. How Promissory oaths differeth from an Assertory Oath.</p>
               <p>And</p>
               <p n="1">1. They agree in this, that Truth is the Scope of both. But 2. They differ in this, that Assertatory Oaths, have but one Verity, to wit, That the thing be, in the Present time, true as the man sayeth or sweareth: But Promissory Oaths have a Twofold Verity, to wit; One present, that the Swearer meaneth what he promiseth. 2. That for the time to come he shall endeavour, effectually to make the thing Truth which he sayeth and sweareth: The First is only a Truth in the Person; The Second is also a Truth of the Thing or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We would difference Vows from Promissory Oaths. Vows have God both for Party and Witness. Oaths may have some other for Party, but God for Witness, to the giving an Oath or Promise to such a Party: Yet in some things there is a great Affinity, as to the matter, in both.</p>
               <p>Concerning Promissory Oaths; we may enquire. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the making of them. 2. Concerning the Obligation of them; That a Man may make such Oaths tying himself to some things in which he was before free; is without all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and clear in the Scripture.

There are somethings indifferent; as Eating, or abstaining from such and such Meats or Drinks, or on such and such days: and although the thing be not simply unlawful, yet Oaths therein would be engaged in, with much Prudence, on such Grounds, and with such Qualifications and Conditions, as may  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Next, such Oaths as to the occasions of parties ingaging in them, may be divided into these three.</p>
               <p>The</p>
               <p n="1">1 is, When we ingage in Publick Oaths and Promises solemnly, when Authority calleth us to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Edification or Satisfaction of another, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate calleth for it. There are sometimes when a Christian may be, Yea, is called to it, for gaining Credit to something, (that the other is called to believe) to interpose reverently the Oath of God, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did to <hi>Laban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. One in secret may thus ingage himself to God, in Lawful and necessary things; As <hi>David, I have sworn, that I will keep thy Righteous Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet in the Third place, all these Oaths, would still be with these Qualifications, mentioned <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. First, in Truth,


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55484:98"/>
namely, the twofold Truth before mentioned. 2. In <hi>Judgment,</hi> that is, with Knowledge &amp; Deliberation minding &amp; understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it is we swear. 3. With Righteousness or Justice, that is, That it be in things, that are acording to the Law of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as well as Piety, neither wronging God, nor others by our Oaths; for Oaths are in themselves still, <hi>Vincula aequitatis,</hi> and not <hi>Iniqui <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>is:</hi> Bonds of Equity and Justice, and not of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Injustice.</p>
               <p>There are also to be observed these Tacite or Express Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all Promissory Oaths, (and sometimes it is fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them, and sometimes not;) <hi>If God will,</hi> and if nothing intervene to hinder, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. <hi>If I live,</hi> &amp; Health permit. As much as in them lyeth, they shall aim at it, if some Impossibility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene not. 3. So far as the fulfilling of this, shall be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for it can only tye to Lawful things, and Lawful means and courses; and this is especially to be understood of Indefinite Oaths. 4. While things stand so; but if the Case alter Essentially, and men turn Enemies to the Kingdome or Common-wealth, to whom we were by Oath obliged, to give or sell some-what that we know would be made use of, to the Probable ruin or hazard thereof; then it's not in our power, <hi>Salvâ potestate superioris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be asked, How we shall judge of Indefinite Oaths; such as Souldiers give to their Officers, to be obedient to them; or of Oaths in things which are indistinct, and the matter not obvious, as Oaths in Colledges, Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Towns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where the things sworne are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> These cannot altogether be Condemned. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though a man have not, yea cannot have, a particular and distinct knowledge of all Particulars; yet  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he understandeth such Oaths, as binding to all necessary and lawful things, as the General Condition requireth. 2. Because he taketh the Oath for the end, and in the sense, that it is Commonly taken, which bindeth in the Essential things, pertaining to the being of that Incorporation, but taketh not in, every particular strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>By what is said, then; We may, 1. Condemn Oaths in Trivial things, as Oaths in Complements; when men swear


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55484:99"/>
they will not go one before an other. That men are wellcome to their Houses: That they will not let them go so soon: That they shall drink so much, though it may not be to Excess: That they shall return some petty thing they have borrowed, and the like. 2. Rash Promises, such as are hastily and unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly or doubtingly made. But ere we come to Particulars; let us consider what is condemned as <hi>Perjury,</hi> which is the Highest Degree.</p>
               <p>There are these several sorts of Perjury mentioned; some whereof are more direct and immediate; some more mediate and indirect.</p>
               <p>The first sort of Perjury is: When one upon Oath asserteth as a Truth, that which he knoweth is not a Truth, or doubteth of it; or is mistaken in it, through his own negligence, not being certain that it is as he sayeth, whether he affirm or deny: Thus <hi>Naboths</hi> false Witnesses were guilty; and many other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances may be adduced.</p>
               <p>The Second is: When one promiseth some-thing, which he mindeth not to perform, and confirmeth that with an Oath; he is no doubt  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ured, because there is not a correspondent verity betwixt his Oath and his Purpose.</p>
               <p>The Third is: When men promise and intend for the Time to perform; yet, upon no just Ground, fail afterwards in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what they have sworn. This is Perjury, because there is not Truth in fulfilling the thing sworn, according to the Oath. These are direct Perjuries.</p>
               <p>More largely again, a man may be said to forswear himself. 1. When he sweareth to perform a thing, which is simply, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibly; especially while he knoweth it to be so: For as the former is not a swearing in Judgement and Truth; so this is a prophane and wicked swearing, against Light and Judgement, of a manifest Lye and Falshood: So that betwixt his Promise to perform such a thing, and the performance, there is implyed a Contradiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for one to swear, to be to Morrow at <hi>Rome,</hi> who is to day at <hi>Glasgow</hi>; the very swearing is forswear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. When one sweareth an Unlawful or Wicked thing, or confirmeth it with an Oath; like those Forty that swore to kill <hi>Paul</hi>; especially if that oath be contrary to some Duty which lyeth formerly by Oath on the Person swearing: For, that is


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55484:99"/>
not to swear in Righteousness and Justic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: Beside, that it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on a necessity, either of breaking that Oath, and so of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perjured, or of going on to fulfil it; and so of being doubly perjured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Men are Forsworn and Perjured, when they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil a Wicked Oath; as <hi>Herod</hi> did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in beheading <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>; for, though he seemed not to over-turne, and make void his own Oath, but to keep it: Yet this (as also the former) over turneth and maketh void, the Scope and Nature of an Oath in General, and is a plain Contradiction to it, and maketh an Oath, which should be <hi>Vinculu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Aequita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> a Bond of Aequity: (there being <hi>Nulla Obligatio,</hi> But <hi>ad Officium,</hi> no Obligation but to Duty,) to be <hi>Vinculum Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatis,</hi> a Bond of Iniquity: And so thwarteth with the very end wherefore such Oath's are appointed; In which respect <hi>David</hi> did better in not Executing his Rash Oath, but keeping the General Scope of all Oaths, when he refused not to harken to <hi>Abigail's</hi> Counsel, even to the Non-performance of what he had sworn.</p>
               <p>It may be Questioned here, Whether one man may be accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to anothers Perjury, if he constrain him to swear, of whom he hath a suspition that he will forswear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Distinguish 1. The matter in which, if it be of Grave Concernment, or of little Moment. 2, Distinguish, betwixt the Publickness and Privacy of it. 3. Distinguish betwixt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as betwixt a Judge, who is to decide, and a Party that is the Pursuer.</p>
               <p>We say then. 1. A Party pursuing, in a Particular of his own Concernment; especially if it be of no great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; may, Yea, should forbear pressing such a Person to swear, both for sparing the Party, and for respect to the Name of God; since he can hardly, in this Case, be very hopeful to gain by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We say, (notwithstanding in some Cases,) that the Judg may admit such to swear, especially in Publick Scandals. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none can certainly know, but God may constrain them to swear Truth. 2. Because it is his way, left to decide all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies; and a Judge cannot eschew it, when it lyeth on him to put a close to such a Controversie, at which he cannot win by any other means; though great Prudence is to be used in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55484:100"/>
in such a case, especially it being of that Nature as is in Scripture appointed to be decided by Oath, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.17.</p>
               <p>The great question is concerning a promissory Oath, if in any case it may be made void, and cease to oblige, or, in what cases that may be?</p>
               <p>That every Oath bindeth not according to the Letter, we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose needeth no reasons to clear and confirm it: There are two ways in general how the obligation of an Oath promissory ceaseth. 1. When the Oath it self is null, and never had any obligation. 2. When by some other thing intervening, there is a loosing from the obligation which the Oath once had.</p>
               <p>That it may be clear that, notwithstanding of this, Oaths are of a most strict Obligation, having the great and dreadful Name of God interposed in them; and that many things, what-ever weight be layed on them by men that way, do not loose from it, such as these following which we shall put by, in the first place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No mans temporal loss in Goods, Name, or Estate, will loose him from his Oath, nor make it null and voyd, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. <hi>ult</hi> 12. that our ingagement by Oath is to somthing of its own nature indifferent, will not loose us, though there be here no other tye upon us to the thing, and that without the Oath we were free; yet the Oath once engaged in, will tye us, as is clear from that same 15th. <hi>Psal.</hi> For an Oath is of its own nature Obligatory, and according to <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. Persons at their own dispose must do even in such cases as they have bound their Souls. 3. Though we were engaged in the Oath by the deceit and guile of others, the deceit being circumstantial only, yet if the thing be not sinful, it bindeth us, as is clear in that Oath to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> wherein the deceit was such. 4. Though by fear or violence the Oath hath been extorted, yet the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawful, it bindeth because of the honour of God's Name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed. 5. Though it was sinful as to the manner, and rashly made at first, as that with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> was; yet is it binding, if lawful in the matter, there being a great difference betwixt <hi>juramentum illicitum,</hi> an Oath unlawfully come under as to its manner, and <hi>juramentum de Re illicitâ,</hi> an Oath in an unlawful matter. 6. Though we could devise and find out some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55484:100"/>
or meaning of the words of the Oath that might seem to make for loosing us from its obligation; yet, if that was not meaned at the first tendering of the Oath, but otherwise under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by him that did take it, it will not absolve nor excuse from the guilt of Perjury, To put afterwards a new gloss on it; because an Oath is <hi>stricti juris,</hi> and will not admit for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect nor on any account, of interpretations prejudicial to the native truth of it, lest it should be found to be, according to <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. a Swearing deceitfully. 7. Though there may be a good meaning and intention in reversing the Oath, and going cross to it, men not doing so for a particular end of their own, but for a publick good as is supposed; yet that will not absolve from the obligation of the Oath, nor from the guilt of Perjury, as is clear in God's punishing <hi>Saul</hi>'s Family for breaking that Oath with the <hi>Gibeonits,</hi> even though he did it out of his Zeal to the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> as the Scripture expresly affirmeth, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.2. 8. Though the Oath be conceived by a Creature, as at least the immediate object of it, and so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made in that respect; yet, being made, it tyeth from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect due to God, who shineth in his Creatures, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.19, 20, 21. 9. Though the thing become impossible, if that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility might have been prevented by our searching our selves as far as in us lay, we are not freed from the guilt of Perjury, though the thing Sworn do now by our own sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness become impossible; or if the thing Sworn might have been performed before any such impossibility came on; or if we might have prevented it by our sutable circumspection and diligence. 10. Though a sinful Oath, to wit, being made on a sinful promise, in it self, bind not; yet the sinful condition being fulfilled it bindeth; as in the case of <hi>Judah,</hi> his promising a Kid to <hi>Thamar,</hi> upon that wretched condition of prostituting her self to his sinful Lust, who did offer the performance of what he had engaged to, upon that most sinful condition now fulfilled; for the condition being fulfilled, the promise is absolute, and the sin was not in giving the Kid, but in the condition that was made, which is past. 11. Much less will it exempt any man from the guilt of Perjury, that in Swearing he had a meaning of the words of the Oath, contrary to what in common sense they bear, &amp; in the construction of all indifferent persons, or to their


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55484:101"/>
meaning <hi>sine juramento,</hi> or <hi>extra juramentum</hi>; or that he had any reservation in his own mind; the first is, Aequivocation; the second is mental Reservation, that have no place in such an Oath which should be plain, single, and clear. Neither 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. will a dispensation from any other, as for instance, from the <hi>Pope,</hi> who hath no power to dispense in Oaths, nor from lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, except it be in things wherein by our relation to such Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours we are subjected to them, loose the obligation of our Oath, nor free us from the guilt of Perjury; if, I say, the matter of the Oath be in things to which their power over us doth not extend, in such things doubtless they cannot dispense. 13. The obligation of an Oath cannot be loosed, nor the guilt of Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evited by commutation of the thing sworne, for it must be according to what has proceeded out of our mouth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.4. 14. Nor can it be loosed, and Perjury eschewed, by any posteriour tye and Oath: for thereby the prior or former Oath is not made null, but the posterior or latter is made null by the former, for <hi>juramentum non derogat juri alieno,</hi> because God is party, and we cannot reverse an obligation to him which Hee or other hath by a prior right and tye.</p>
               <p>But they are null and of no force, 1. When the thing sworne is sinful and unlawful in it self, because there is <hi>nullum vinculum iniquitatis,</hi> there is not, neither can there be, any obligation to Iniquity. 2. When it is unlawful to him that sweareth, as suppose one would swear to do that which were incumbent for a Magistrate or Minister, he himself being but a meer private person, and it no ways belonging to his station; it tyeth him indeed to endeavour by all sutable means the effecting of the thing by them, but not to do it himself, for it altereth not sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 3. When the thing is simply impossible, Oaths cannot bind, in that case. 4. When the Oath is engaged in by any, in whose power the thing sworne is not, as by Children, Wives, Servants, or Subjects, in such things wherein they are subject to others, and of which they are not Masters; it tyeth them only to endeavour it with their approbation or permission, see <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 5. When the deceit is not in circumstantials, but in essentials; as, suppose one should swear to such another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to pay him such a debt, or to give such and such obedience, thinking him to be the very person to whom he oweth these


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55484:101"/>
things, who yet is not the person we suppose him to be; the ground of the Oath is null, and its obligation accordingly ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as when <hi>Jacob</hi> was deceived by his getting <hi>Leah</hi> first for <hi>Rachel,</hi> because such an Oath wrongeth another, to whom that which is sworn is due, and supposeth the condition of being due. 6. When the Oath is impeditive of a greater good, or of a moral duty; as suppose a man had sworn not to go to such a place, nor to speak to such a person, nor to eat such meat; that Oath (being at first rash, and without judgment) if duty and necessity call him to the contrary of what he hath sworn, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, because a moral command may require him to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take on such a charge there, or to speak to that person for his edification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this would be tenderly applyed, and with great circumspection. 7 When the Oath is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to oblige to the performance of some thing which hath a tendency to an ill end; as for instance, if a Man should swear to meet with a Woman for committing filthiness, to give armes for helping to oppose an innocent, or any such like thing; for though coming to such a place, or giving such armes may be lawful, yet as so circumstantial; this coming, and this giving of them with such an intention, is unlawful, and therefore the Oath is null.</p>
               <p>For loosing from the obligation of an Oath which is lawful, there are these cases granted, 1. When it is contradicted by a Superiour, having power in that very particular, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the case materially altereth, as if one should swear to give such a man armes, who afterward turneth mad, or an Enemy; to give obedience to such a Commander who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards becometh a private man, and ceaseth to be any more a Commander; because in such cases the relation upon which the duty and Oath is founded, ceaseth. 3. When the party sworn unto, relaxeth us: for though none can absolve from a Vow, yet in a promissory Oath, whereby some right accrcrueth to one from another, a man may dispense with his own right; as for instance, he may in whole, or in part, forgive and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge such a sum of money that another by Oath has sworne to give him, which when he doth, in so far the Oath and its obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is loosed; he having, as himself thinketh fit, accepted sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for whole or part; but in Vows to God no man can


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55484:102"/>
dispense, He being party there. 4. When by some after and unforeseen intervening Emergent, the man is quite disabled from performing his Oath, as by Sickness, Plundering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In that case, so far and so long as he is disabled, in so far and so long is he loosed; that condition being necessarily presupposed in giving the Oath at first, though the obligation to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance layeth still on him so far and so soon as he shall be able.</p>
               <p>It may be marked, by the way, that often prophane men are more strict in keeping sinful Oaths, than those which are lawful: the Devil putting home that obligation on them as a snare, and their own corruption siding with the Oath in its matter, maketh it appear strongly binding to them.</p>
               <p>If it be asked Wherein it is that an Oath bindeth more than a Promise doth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> An Oath bindeth to nothing but what is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, but it bindeth more strongly, and so the sin is greater in breaking an Oath than a Promise; because not only our truth to men is engaged in the Oath, but our reverence and respect to God also, and his dreadful Name thereby notably taken in vain.</p>
               <p>So then against this Doctrine of Oaths faileth perjury or forswearing, rash-swearing, indeliberate swearing, as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements (as for instance, if one should swear he will not drink, or go before such another person): Solemne Oaths entered into, at Communions, at Baptism, or in, other lawful Covenants not performed; ah! how often are these broken, even in that which we might easily do? We so carry and keep to God as men could not but quarrel; irreverent swearing even in what is right; grosly prophane swearing, as by Gods Soul, his Wounds, Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Uncouth'd, strange, newly-coin'd and invented Oaths; no doubt by special help of the Devils art, Cursings, wherein the Devil is mentioned, and his aid implored for the execution of mens passionate and revengeful imprecations; yea, not being sutably affected with the Oaths of others, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing them, nor seeking to recover them, not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by all requisite care the preventing of them, with-holding of instruction and correction when called for, and not procuring the erection of Schools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may make many guilty of Oaths

               </p>
               <p>There are some things near of kin unto (to say so) and of affinity with Oaths; as 1. Adjurations, when we adjure or charge one by the Name of God to do or forbear such a thing; as <hi>Saul</hi> bound the people with a Curse, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. And <hi>Joshua</hi> charged <hi>Achan,</hi> Josh. 7. and the High-Priest Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and <hi>Paul Tim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thy,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21. &amp; 6.13.</p>
               <p>Adjurations differ thus from Oaths, that by an Oath we bind our selves to do or forbear somwhat, or to tell truth; by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations we bind others by interposing the Name of God for commanding, charging, perswading to do or forbear such a thing, and implying, if not expressing some threatning or curse if it be not done or forborne: There are three sorts of these in Scripture, 1. When men adjure men. 2. When they adjure Devils. 3. When they adjure unreasonable Creatures, as Serpents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To each of these, a word.</p>
               <p>As to the 1. We say that men may somtimes adjure other men in matters weighty, sutable, and necessary to be done, when it is rightly gone about, and not in passion or for self ends, but so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, gravely, and singly, for the glory of God immediately, or mediately by anothers good being interposed; so, many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples confirm, and so necessity requireth, that when regard to men doth not sutably weigh that such a desire be put home to the Conscience from respect to God and his Authority, who is Witness and will Judge; this some way sifteth a man before God, and so may prove a good means, through his blessing, to make the man serious; which sort of adjurations may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are proper adjurations or charges authoritatively laid on, in the Name of God, or of Jesus Christ; this is done by Magistrates or Ministers in their places, as <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. and giveth him charge to charge others, <hi>v.</hi> 17. This being used in serious and weighty matters, and not too frequently (lest the Name of God become thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible) is the most proper and the most weighty charge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are Obtestations which are serious and weighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and beseechings in the Name of God, and for Christ's sake that one may do or forbear such a thing, as when <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecheth


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55484:103"/>
the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Philippians</hi> by the mercies of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. and <hi>Abigail</hi> interposeth seriously with <hi>David:</hi> this is most properly done by Inferiours, Subjects, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to their Superiours; and hath in it also a more impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite threatning if such a thing be slighted, as in <hi>Abigails</hi> words to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. is clear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are Attestations whereby one is seriously put to it to tell some truth, or to bear witness of some truth asserted by another; thus <hi>Joshua</hi> attested <hi>Achan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We say, These have a binding virtue in some cases, and cannot without contempt of God (who so chargeth them, and before whom they are so attested) be slighted; and therefore if it be not properly Perjury for a man, either not to speak at all, being attested, or to speak what is not truth; yet sure it is more than ordinary contempt, and a greater sin than if no such adjurations, attestations, or obtestations had been used, because the Name of the Lord has been interposed by others: and if such attestations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be lawful, as we have proved them to be in some cases, then ought they to have weight, or they are used in vain; we see our Lord Christ answered to such, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. after a while's keeping silence.</p>
               <p>And in reference to these ye fail,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In giving little enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment unto, and laying little weight upon the charges and obtestations of Ministers, which come unto you by them from this Word and Gospel; these charges of Ministers are as if an Herauld gave a Charge in the Magistrates name, which bindeth as from him, and more than another message delivered in other terms; in this then, Ministers are as Heraulds charging you in their Master's Name, even in the Name of the great God, and of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Prince of the Kings of the Earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When one of you putteth not another <hi>seriously</hi> to it, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear and abandon sin, or to practise such a duty, charging them, or rather obtesting them, as they will answer to God to do so, as often in the Canticles we find, <hi>I charge you, O Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Jerusalem.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In your overly, rash, and slight way of using obtestations and grave intreaties, meerly or mostly for the fashion, or by way of complement, or in petty and trivial things; as when ye say, for God's sake, for God's blessing do this or that, only


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55484:103"/>
as a customary by-word; this is no doubt more than on ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary taking of God's Name in vain in common discourse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye take on you to bind others in the Name of God, not considering what ye are doing; and in a matter not necessary, and of no weight exposing the Name of the Lord to contempt, and thereby tempting others to care but little for it; this is a most horrid and crying sin amongst our ordinary Beggars, whereof others also are guilty, who are not sutably affected with it, and do not in their places seriou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="2">2. For adjuring of Devils, it is two ways lawful, and two ways not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is lawful to command Devils in the Name of God by those who are called to it, and are gifted to cast them out. 2. It is lawful for any by Prayer to God, and the exercise of Faith on Him, to endeavour to repel and resist them, and to beg that he would rebuke them; as thus, The Lord rebuke thee Satan; this way we neither command the Devil, nor pray to him, but pray unto the Lord to command him.</p>
               <p>Again: It is unlawful, 1. When one adjureth him who is not called to it, as those Sons of <hi>Sceva</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.13, 14. This certainly being a peculiar and extraordinary gift, as those of prophecying, fore-telling of things to come, speaking with Tongues, and healing of the Sick with a word, were; ought not without special warrant to be usurped more than they.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is unlawful when it is done by exhorting or obtesting of, or praying unto the Devil himself, and intreating him as we do God, which way implyeth, 1. Friendship with him when we intreat him as a Friend. 2. Prayer or worship to him who is not the object of it. 3. An obligation on us to him, when he yieldeth to obey; and he will not fail, if by any means he can, to put that complement or obligation on us, and so Ne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Pharisees</hi> falsly and blasphemously, charged on our blessed Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. as if by Belezebub; that is, by Collusion with the Prince of Devils, he had cast out Devils. There are no doubt, many Sins committed this way, while some take on them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently to Command the Devil, as if with an <hi>Avoid Sathan,</hi> they could put him into Bonds: And others seek Health from Devils or Witches, (especially when it is supposed to come from them,) and intreat them to do such and such things: All which are Breaches of this Part of the Third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is said of Adjuring Devils, may be said Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally of Adjuring Unreasonable Creatures, which is the same wayes Lawful and Unlawful: Charming also, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Name over Diseases, as if some special worth and Efficacy were in some words; is unlawful and Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Command.</p>
               <p>It followeth now that we say some-thing to Vows, which are Bonds, whereby a man bindeth himself (and so they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from Adjurations) to God only as party, and that in things belonging to God; willingly, and upon Deliberation. (And so they differ from Promissory Oaths, wherein we bind our selves to others; and in matters which are not of themselves Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.)</p>
               <p>Under Vows we comprehend, 1. Sacraments. 2. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, solemnly ingaged into before others. 3. Particular Vows to God. 4. Promises and Ingagements, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Heart only, or also outwardly expressed to, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord: For though these have not alwayes God's Name, formally and expresly interposed in them; yet He being Party, and they being made to him, he cannot but be singularly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, as Party, Witness, and Judge, in the making and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of them: Therefore, do we Comprehend all even pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, expressed in Prayer to him, as being of the same kind, though not of the like Degree.</p>
               <p>We mind not here to medle with Speculative Debates about Vows, but to hold us only at what concerneth Practise: And say, 1. That such Promises to God, and Ingagements, being rightly made and taken on, or rightly gone about; are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lawful, but some-times necessarily called for, as appeareth.

From the end of Vows, which is to bind us to something the more straitly, and to evidence our greater desire and willingness to be so bound: And therefore they being Midfes, for that end; when the end is in a special manner called for; and may, in all probability, be the better obtained, by the use of this Mean: then, is it called<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for also, and cannot be omitted. 4.

               <p>If it be asked, 1. How Vows bind? We Answer, 1. In Moral Duties, they make the Obligation no greater; for, they being laid on by the Command of God, and having his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, there can be no Addition to that in it self: But there is a twofold Addition, 1. In respect of us; so that though the Obligation be not greater in it self, yet we joine our Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Consent unto that, whereby, as by a positive Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added Voluntary Consent, we bind our selves; so that in some respect we have two Bonds (the Law, and our Oath both) for one. 2. Though it make not the former Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to bind more strongly in it self; yet it maketh that Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have a more deep Impression upon us; so that a man, by Vow bound to a commanded Duty, will think himself more bound to it, than before; and that Command will have a deeper Impression, and a more weight on him, to perswade him to do, and to challenge him when he hath omitted, than before. Again, in things that are meerly Accessaries to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious end, as Extrinsick Means; for Instance, Fasting, Stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Home, Vowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> never maketh the doing of these of themselves, to be Acts of Religious Worship; but it maketh our keeping of them to be by a Religious Tye; so that without Prophanity they cannot be altered, out of the case of necessity.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, 2. What is to be thought of our Common and Ordinary Ingagements, 1. By Baptism. 2. At the Lords Supper. 3. By Oaths in Covenants. 4. Ingagements in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate to God by Vows, Purposes, Promises, Resolutions, in thoughts within; or expressed in Prayer: (I suppose it doth not a little concern all of you to know, how they bind and when they are broken.) We Answer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That, All these are binding, and still accounted so, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 119.106. <hi>Psal.</hi> 67.) is not to be doubted, yea binding in an Eminent Degree, as being made To God, and not only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55484:107"/>
Him: The Nature of the thing and our consent also bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: For, 1. If interposing the Name of God to men doth bind, much more to God. 2. If a Promise solemnly ratifyed bind to men, much more to God. Hence 3. Our Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Baptism, and the Lords Supper, receive Strength and Conviction against us from the Covenant, which we solemnly Ratifie and renew with God therein, and that before the World: And our Breach of these Vows is charged on us by the Lord, as an open Breach of his Covenant; the Obligation whereof is pleaded from them, <hi>Genesis,</hi> 17. ver. 10. and 14. and else-where.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet do they not bind absolutely, as the Duty lyeth upon us and as we should aim at it; for though we be bound by the Law to be perfectly Holy, and without sin; yet doth not a Vow so tye us, or that Obligation is not from our Vow, but from the Law; because our Vow is to be understood, 1. With Respect to our Nature, now Corrupt and sinful: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Vow, Absolutely, to be without Sin, or absolutely to abstain from it, is injurious and impossible. 2. With respect to our aim and desire. 3. With respect to our not Approving, or Dis-approving our selves in any thing, wherein we come short. 4. In respect of the Obligation to endeavour it, which is, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and by all suitable means to presse at it, and to leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing undone, which may further it: So then 1. They do not bind Absolutely or Simply, but Respectively. 2. Not as to the Victory, but as to the Wrestling and Fighting for Victory. 3. Not as to the Event, but as to the Means which are in our Power; and therefore some plead, That they had not broken Covenant, though they had Sins, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though they bind not Simply or Absolutely, (and are not therefore to be so taken or understood) yet they tye Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, 1. To the main of having God ours in Christ. 2. In other things, thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They tye us to live in no known Sin, especially Outward Sins, and to delight in none. 2. To omit no Known Duty, but to essay the doing of it. 3. As to the Manner, to essay it seriously; so that though a man cannot swear, that he shall  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave no Corruption in him, while he is upon Earth: Yet in so far he may: As 1. Not to approve of it. 2. To leave


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55484:107"/>
no means unessayed, consisting in his Knowledge, that may help to mortifie it. 3. Seriously, and in good Earnest, to be aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Mortification of it, in the Use of these. And so this Tye of a Vow is, 1. As far as in us lyeth. 2. As Universal as the Duty is. 3. Constant and always binding. 4. When it's taken on, we should not let it lye on, (to say so) till the Sun go down, but endeavour that we may be free of it; it bindeth us to quit Sin, as well as to eschew it. It reaches not all Infirmities, to make them Breaches; but known Sins, or the least sins stuck to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning these Vows, we say; That the Breach of them is a very great Sin, and doth much more aggravate Sin, where it is, than where it is not: So that the Sins of Christians against Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, Communions, Oaths in Covenants, Secret Ingagements, Resolutions, and Promises to God, are much greater than the Sins of others. Hence the Lord chargeth <hi>Israel</hi> with Covenant-Breaking, by vertue of their Circumcision which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as a Seal thereof, and aggravateth all their Sins by that, and looketh on them in that Respect, as singularly sinful, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.24. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.8. &amp;c. which could not so well be, if there were not some Peculiarity in that Obligation. Our Baptism, doubtless, is no less binding unto us, nor the Breach of our Baptismal Vows less sinful, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. Neither can there be any reason given, Why the Breach of an Oath to man, should be charged on a Person, as a Sin and Infamy; and the Breach of an Oath to God, not be much more charged so. Oh! Take notice then, ye who sin willingly, who Drink, Swear, omit Prayer; Let your minds wander, and study not Holiness in good earnest, that your sins have these Aggravations to make them horrible, infamous, and inexcusable, 1. There is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Perjury against the Oath of God, which even according to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.33. was Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Thou shalt not (say they) Forswear thy self, but shalt pay or perform thy Oath to the Lord. 2. There is unfaithful dealing, and Abominable Treachery, to break under trust, and to keep no Ingagement to Him. 3. There is not only Perjury, and Treachery simply; but towards God, which is more, and draweth a great deal deeper, than towards any other. It's Dreadful to deal Unfaithfully, Treacherously, and Perjuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55484:108"/>
with Him. 4. All this is in things that are very equitable and much for your own good, which maketh no small aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 5. This is done not only against promises, but against many promises, and many other bands. 6. That its often and in many things that you sin against these promises. 7. That sin is little resented or laid to heart on this consideration, and as so aggravated.</p>
               <p>If it be said, Then it is better to make no promises at all, than to come under such aggravations of guilt by breaches of them, for none keep them exactly: and so men must needs be in great and continual disquietness and anxity while under them; Were it not better, then, to be doing without promising?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not free to us, Not to make them more than it is To break them, or not to keep them; and when we are called to make such Promises, and make them not, it becometh sin to us as was said. Its not free to us, whether we shall be Baptised Communicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or not; therefore, whosoever would not so engage, were to be censured and punished as utter despisers of the Lord's Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. &amp; <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They, who refuse to take them, lay themselves open to the temptation of being more easily prevailed with, not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form these duties, or of being sooner insnared in such sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not formally engaged by Vow against them, and so they make themselves culpably accessary to the strengthning of tentation, and weakning of resolution; to the contrary whereof, they are no doubt obliged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you intend indeed to perform these duties, then ye may ingage to do so; but if ye will not so much as Promise and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to do them, it cannot be expected in reason that ye will Do them; especially considering that even these who honestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and ingage, do yet notwithstanding, find a great difficulty to do and perform. O take heed that you be not, by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to engage, making a back-door for your selves to go out from your duty, that so you may the more easily, and with the less challenge, shift it.</p>
               <p>If it be yet said, that the sin of simple omitting the duty, is less than the omitting of it after engagements and vows to the contrary. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is not so to a Christian, who is called to engage himself, yea, who by Baptisme is already ingaged;


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55484:108"/>
for 1. The man that neither ingageth to do, nor doth the duty, faileth twice, whereas he that ingageth and performeth not, faileth but once: though that once failing, is, by its being cross to his ingagement, not a little aggravated; so that in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect each fault or failing exceedeth the other; the one is a greater sin considered in it self, but the other is greater consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered complexly. 2. The man that ingageth not, is more accessary to his own falling, in  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>spect that he used not that Mean to prevent it; yet the other when fallen, is more guilty, in respect of the breach of his ingagement. 3. The man that will not ingage, bringeth himself under a necessity of sinning; for if he perform not, he faileth twice, as is said; if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, he faileth, because he ingaged not when he was called to it, so his performing is not the performing of a Vow to God, who requireth promising, in some cases at least, as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming. 4. The man that Promiseth and Voweth, and also performeth what he Promised and Vowed, his performing is so much the more acceptable, as it proceedeth not only from the awe of a Command, but from a spontaneous and free-will offering of it to God, and so is both Obedience to a Command, and the performance of a Vow; for thus, he chooseth obedience, as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.30. It is not so with the other, whether he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it or not, though we think, that God often letteth the man fall that will not ingage, because he sayeth by his refusal that he trusteth not to God for the performance, otherwise he would ingage and undertake on his account also; he sayeth withal, that he aymeth to perform, only because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eschew it: And if he could shake off, and be freed from that Obligation to Holiness, that he would not out of respect to God, or love to Holiness, take on a new one. 5. The man that ingageth not, sinneth more unexcusably in that he will not do that which is the lesser, and in his power. The less and more easie a thing it be to promise and ingage (as it is no doubt more easie than to perform) the omission of it is the greater sin, and more inexcusable. The case is indeed, as to Heathens, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, who were never thus engaged, nor called to engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but, unto Christians it will be no excuse.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed that this is very hard; for then no Christian will be free of Perjury, nor have Peace. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I grant the


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55484:109"/>
case is hard, and the Strait great; but it is such as sloweth from our own corruption in this, as in other duties and parts of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: for as the Law is holy, just, and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and is not to be blamed as accessary to our sin; so the Vow is holy, just, and good, and is not to be blamed, if in the circumstances right, because of our breach. 2. As I think, it is hard to keep our selves free of sin, even against light, so I think it is a difficulty to be kept free of this aggravation of sin, to wit, of committing it against our engagements; and therefore (as the manner of the People of God is) I think it safest to take with these aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of our sins, as chief parts of them (to speak so) and to take them with the rest to Jesus Christ, that we may obtain pardon of them through Him, and to maintain our peace rather by often washing our selves from the silth of breaking, than by pleading no breach at all. 3. Yet may Christians (even as in other duties of holiness) in their Vows and Promises to God, have peace, and say, in a Gospel-sense, We have not turned back from thee, nor dealt falsely in thy Covenant, as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.17, 18. which certainly implyeth not absolute holiness, or exact performance of all the Articles of the Covenant; but that 1. In the great and main Articles, they were honest, and did not put another God in his room to provoke him to Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie. 2. That they intended truly the keeping of all, and said nothing by their profession or engagements, which they minded not to perform. 3. That they had some testimony as to what was past, that they had in some measure walked accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their engagements, and had left nothing undone, at least willingly, and with approbation of themselves therein, that might have furthered them in keeping Covenant, but had stuck to Him in doing and suffering honestly; a man sincerely, and in the strength of grace studying this, may attain to such a testimony from his own Conscience, and to a good measure of peace; yea, a man that may have quietness in his performing duty upon the account of other tyes, without engaging, may also come to have quietness in his engaging to it.</p>
               <p>If then there be a necessity to engage, it may be asked, How peace may be attained in it, and how we may be helped to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We should endeavour to be clear and quiet, as to the soundness of our by-past engagements, and of these


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55484:109"/>
we presently enter in, as to the motives, grounds, ends, and manner of engaging, that all be right there. 2. If any thing be seen to be wrong, it should be taken with, and mended, that we use not Vows mainly to put by a challenge for the time, without any more of it. 3. Ye should seriously mind these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: 1. Forget not your Vows and Engagements, be minding them often, and thinking of them so as they may never be forgotten, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.4, 5. 2. Defer not to pay them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.21. Delays make the impression of the weight of the Vow, and of the dread of Him to whom it is made, much to wear out; and, taking liberty to be slack in paying of it, for, but for this once, or for a little while, is a direct breach of it self, and maketh way for more. 3. Keep in mind, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such a frame of spirit as ye were in when they were at first made; such humility, tenderness, awe of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We often, alasse, take on Vows in a good frame, to be on the matter a sort of excuse for us in letting such a frame go, or at least to ease us a little for the time, as if engaging were performance, which is not the least part of the deceit of our hearts. 4. The perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the thing would be followed as it is undertaken, to wit, in the strength of grace, and by virtue of life derived from Jesus Christ, quickning and strengthening us both as promising and performing. 5. We should be often considering the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the sin of Breaking, and examining our selves about our keeping of them; making breaches, that are particularly observed, the matter of confession to God, and of serious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before him. If we would suffer these things to sink down deep in us as in the sight of God; this no doubt would make them have a quite other impression. 6. We should still keep the knot fast, and if one promise or resolution seem to be loosed, we should forthwith cast another; or if one obligation given, seem to be weakned, we should give another, that there may be still some obligation standing over our heads; and following en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, not formally, but soberly and seriously renewed, may be made use of to bind on the former upon us, and to make th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55484:110"/>
solemn Oaths and Covenants, we neither find in Scripture that they have been frequent, but on some great and very grave occasion; neither could they well be, (so great multitudes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in them) without diminishing from the weight of them, and so without wronging of God's Name. 7. We should by no means suffer breaches, though never so small, to lie long on, but should get us to the Fountain with them, as foul and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, lest they bring on more and greater.</p>
               <p>Now then try Perjury and breach of Vows and Oaths to God, 1. In Baptism, which extendeth to engage professing Believers to the mortification of sin, and to the study of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as to both Tables of the Law, and to a conversation as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Gospel. 2. In, and at Communions, where the same Covenant is Sealed. 3. In your Oaths solemnly taken in Covenants. 4. In your more private engagements to God, and for him to others.</p>
               <p>Beside these which are common, some come under particular Oaths and Engagements by vertue of their stations; as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Elders, Magistrates, for the faithful discharge of their respective duties; some by their Relations, Office, and Place, as Husbands and Wives each to other; as Parents in reference to their Children, to bring them up in the nurture and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, and in his fear; some by vertue of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trades and Callings have come under particular Oaths to such and such Incorporations, Trades, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And some on more particular occasions have come under engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: O look well what you do, and have done; there will, I fear, many be found Perjured. I do not here speak of every particular infirmity, but certainly there is sin against God, and Perjury before him which cannot easily, if at all, be interpreted so with men; in which respect, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. the Lord condemned putting away an innocent Wife, even though it seemed to have a permission by Law; in these things when men do not what they may do, or if there be yet more in their power than is done, or if the obligation of the Oath on them awe them not, or weight them not, it cannot but be a prophaning of the Lords Oath: Many, alasse, according to their several relations and stations, are found guilty here, who have little or no awe of God on them in these things.</p>
               <p>In sum, This Command is broken these three ways, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55484:110"/>
to such engagements; 1. In shunning to make them when we are called to it. 2. In not making them rightly. 3. In not performing of them when made; and it bindeth 1. Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to many things which cannot come within the compass of ordinary infirmity. 2. To eschew all known sinful deeds, as Swearing, and what may be inductive to it, Drunkenness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Gaming, needless Contentions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. To do all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties, as to Read, Hear, Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. To do them as seriously as we may. 5. Not to lye in any seen or known sin here forbidden, nor to delay Repentance, though for never so little a while; it dispenseth not at all here, because these are in our power, and when we fail, it is not out of ordinary infirmity.</p>
               <p>Beside what is said, there are yet two ways of taking or using the Name of God, which are sib or of kin to Oaths; The 1. is that of Appealing to God to judg, as <hi>David</hi> did, that God might judge betwixt him and persecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 24.12. The 2d. is that of attesting God, thus, <hi>The Lord knoweth, God is my Witness, my Witness is in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Job</hi> doth, <hi>cap.</hi> 16.19. and <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 1.9. These are lawful when called unto and rightly gone about, but when abused in rash precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, passionate appeals, or in unjust matter, as <hi>Sarahs</hi> was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. and in rash unnecessary attestations, or in triffling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they are more than an ordinary taking of God's Name in vain, and therefore should never lightly be interposed and made use of.</p>
               <p>The great breach of this Command is Blasphemy, though Perjury be most direct. That we may see how this sin is fallen into, we shall 1. Define it; 2. Divide or distinguish it, which we shall find to be exceeding broad; Blasphemy then against God, (as the word beareth) is a wronging of God's holy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty by some reproachful speeches or expressions, uttered to His disgrace; we say <hi>Uttered,</hi> because that which is in the heart is most-part <hi>Atheism,</hi> and Infidelity, and so belongeth to the first Command.</p>
               <p>Of this there are three sorts, or there are three ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men fall into it: 1. When any thing unbecoming God, is in word attributed to Him, as that he is not just, holy, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> such as that complaint, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25. <hi>The ways of the Lord are not equal.</hi> 2. When what is due to him is denyed him;

Isa. 36.18.20. 3. When what is due to God is attributed to a Creature, or arrogated by a Creature: thus the <hi>Jews</hi> charged <hi>Christ</hi> as guilty of Blasphemy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.49. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.33. (supposing him to be a Creature) because he forgave sins, and called himself God; of this sort of Blasphemy, as to some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, is the commending or crying up our own or others parts, pains, wit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for attaining, effecting, and bringing to pass of somewhat to the prejudice of divine providence; so those of <hi>Zidon</hi> did to <hi>Herod,</hi> Act. 12.22.

               <p n="2">2.

present testifying of it, or bearing witness to it, and after fore-going convictions yielded unto in some measure, and stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or lying on as weighty, and making the Conscience to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, as may be gathered from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 3. It is not in one particular sin or act, but in a total and resolute opposing of the Truth, whereof men are convinced, seeking to bear it down in others, and to extirpate it out of the world, as the <hi>Pharises</hi> did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. who not only rejected Christ as to themselves, but opposed him in all others, and sought utterly to undoe the Truth; <hi>This is the Heir, come let us kill him,</hi> say they. 4. This opposition flows from malice against the truth, hatred of it, and from accounting it a thing unworthy to be in the world; not out of fear or infirmity, or from mistake, but out of envy and despight at it for it self: On this account the Lord object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to the <hi>Pharises,</hi> Joh. 15.24. <hi>But now they have both seen and hated me, and my Father,</hi> and <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 5. It is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal against every thing of the Spirit, and obstinately constant, without any relenting, grief, or fear, except only lest it attain not its end: the fear of that tormenteth it; but its malice and hatred groweth, as it is marred or obstructed, being deliberately begun and prosecuted. 6. It has in it a special contempt of, and disdain at those special means and works of the spirit, whereby a sinner is reclaimed, as Convictions, Repentance, renewing again to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. It doth despight to the Spirit, and to Jesus Christ, as to any application; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptously rejecteth him and his satisfaction, and any glance of the Spirit that beareth that in; simple contempt, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and infirmity, is against the Son, but this which is thus qualified, is against the Spirit, and is never to be pardoned; the first is against the object Christ, but the second is against him who is, or him as born-in on sinners by the Spirit, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by them after their being under these convictions, and acknowledging of them; this irremissibleness, is not simply that the sin shall not be pardoned, for so many sins are to the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; nor yet simply, because it endeth in finall impenitency (though that be with it too) since many sins are followed by that also: but we conceive it to be in these,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That seeing this sin (which can be said of no other sin) doth wilfully, and out of despight, reject Christ, there can be

no other Sacrifice gotten to expiate it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. <hi>There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more Sacrifice for it,</hi> and though the person after the first Commission of it may be keeped a while in the land of the living, yet the nature of that sin being to grow in malice, and to reject that remedy there being no other, and this being still wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and maliciously rejected, availeth them not; so their sin is never pardoned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the person guilty of this sin cannot be renued by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the heart of him suppressing that work maliciously; this impossibility is not from the inefficacy of Grace, but from the order which God hath laid down in the working of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and in the pardoning of the Penitent; so that as he will pardon none but Repenting Believers, so he will work Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in none but in those who yield, through Grace, to his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's Work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God in Justice hath sentenced that sin with impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and unpardonableness, making that one sin thus Capital and unpardonable; thereby to scare the more from thwarting with his Spirit, he has denyed ever to give them that are guilty of it, Repentance, and hath said, that he will plague them with spiritual impenitency unto the end.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Blasphemy may be considered as it is, 1. Doctrinal, or maintained by some men in their Tenents, such were those of the old Heriticks, such are those of the <hi>Pelagians, Papists, and Arminians,</hi> as to the nature of Providence, and the work of Grace upon hearts, or 2. As it is in expressions indeliberately brought forth, or 3. In oaths, as when men swear by the Wounds, Blood, Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of our blessed Lord, which as they are hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to hear, so is it reproachful to his Majesty, that these should be so abused, or 4. In Deeds, Writing, Painting, Acting, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting any thing Derogatory to him, which are also charged with Blasphemy, in abusing Gods Name to such ends, 5. It may be in a high Degree, when men act such a Blasphemy, or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently when they punish it not, when we do not rent our Cloaths (as it were) at the hearing and seeing such things in Testimony of our sorrow and Detestation (which was the sin of the Princes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30, 24, 25. who though they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what displeased, yet they had not zeal vigorous against that wicked Deed of the King): when we have not suitable hatred

It may be either, as we are guilty of it by our own Deeds, or when me make our selves guilty of the Blasphemy of others, as having sinfully occasioned it to them, tempted them to it, and laid such and such a stumbling before them, as is said of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. and of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 2.24. <hi>That they caused others to Blaspheme the Name of God because of them</hi>; thus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, especially those who have a profession beyond ordinary, and particularly Wives and Servants, by their miscarriages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty of the Blasphemy of others, against Godliness, and such and such Duties of Religion; bec <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There are these things especially that make others Blaspheme, 1. Some gross out breaking as <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery, 2.

               <p n="6">6. Blasphemy, may be considered either as it is, here in the way by men living, or as it is by them in the place of Torment; who keeping still, no doubt their former wicked Nature and Corruption, and not considering God as he is in himself, but as they feel him in the severity of his Justice punishing them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have good thoughts of him, but will fret at his power and Justice, which they cannot get free of, though it is like, after


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55484:114"/>
their sentence is past, this is to be considered, as a part of their cursed Estate, and doth increase meritoriously their judgment, as Blasphemy in the way did.</p>
               <p>These wayes of breaking this command spoken unto are more grosse and extraordinary: we should now speak a word to such as are more common in our practice, and these are of two sorts.</p>
               <p>The 1. is more grosse, when the name of God, or any thing bearing the Name of God as his Ordinances, Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are prophaned, out of Duty. This is done, 1. When these are mocked, or scorned, which is a high Degree of prophaning his Name, 2. When the Scripture-phrases, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, or tearms are baffled (to speak so) to our sinful scoffing, Jeibing, and Geiring of others, though we do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly mock or geir at the Scripture it self. 3. When in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry discourse, and unnecessarily, Gods Name is used, though we intend not swearing, neither think that we do swear. 4. When ordinarily upon such and such occasions, the Lords Name is used in irreverent, and unwarrantable exclamations, as, <hi>O Lord, O God,</hi> what is this or that, <hi>&amp;c</hi>! I hope in God, or trust in God to see such a thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And possibly sometimes in passion. 5. When it is used in way of by-word, or of certain irreverent prayers, when a person is troubled and grieved, and would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press that passion at some thing that falleth out not desired, God help me, God save me, what is that? what mean ye? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, God bless me, for Gods blessing do such a thing: If God will, in Gods strength, and I trust in God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I shall do such and such a thing: for Gods sake do this or that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6. VVhen it is used in meer complements, God keep you, God be with you, God bless you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, with many, are too ordinary Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 7. VVhen it is used lightly in way of asseveration and indirect swearing, God a bit, God have me, if it be so, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 8. VVhen it is used in a senseless and superstitious custome, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such and such particular occasions, as when men say, O, God be blessed, and <hi>God bless</hi> at sternutation or neesing (which <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> reporteth to have been used by Heathens, and particularly by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was none of the most Religious men) God be here, God be in this house, when one entereth into a house; or when the Clock striketh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:55484:115"/>The 2. way (which is less grosse, but more ordinary) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we fail in reference to this Command, is in lawful and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary duties of worship, by sinful and unprofitable discharging of these; whereby the Name of God is often taken in vain, and his holiness which he loveth prophaned: this fault and failing is two wayes fallen into,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In respect of the manner of going about such ordinances or duties of worship, 1. VVhen the Lord is not sanctified in them, nor the rule and manner prescribed by Him, kept; this way, sinned <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Lev.</hi> 10. by their offering of strange fire. The Lord complaineth of <hi>Israel</hi> as guilty of this, <hi>Esay</hi> 29.13. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.8, 9. VVhile <hi>they drew near with their lips, and their hearts were far away, they worshipt me in vain,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>teaching for Doctrines the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men.</hi> 2. VVhen men use not such ordinances, and perform not such duties profitably, when prayer, reading of the Scripture, Sacrament, Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> want their native fruit, then his Name is taken in vain, and in that respect his ordinances frustrated and made, as if they had not been used or performed, so  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. To <hi>receive the Grace of God in vain,</hi> is to miss or let go the benefit of it, and to frustrate and disappoint our selves of the native end and use of it; This is the first way in respect of which our duties are in vain as to God, so as he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them.</p>
               <p>The second way is as to our selves, and here again we may consider the taking of the Lords Name in vain, in ordinances and duties two wayes, either 1. Simply, where there is no honesty at all in them, nor fruit from them, but meer Hypocrisie, or at least Hypocrisie in such particular Acts. or 2. when it is Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, that is, though there may be some reality and fruit, yet considering what it should be; yea considering what means the person hath, there is a great defect as to that which should and might have been; thus were the <hi>Hebrews</hi> challenged, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. not that they were altogether fruitless, but that they were not so fruitful as under, and by such means they might have been, and that therefore they had in a great part used them and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them in vain; this may and often doth befall even those who have some measure of sincerity, yet fall far short of what they might have attained of the knowledge of God, and of


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55484:115"/>
other blessed fruits by the right improvement of the means they had.</p>
               <p>VVe may add a third way how his Name is taken in vain, and that in respect of it self, or of the ordinance or duty; what indeed it is, and in respect of what it appeareth to be, when the shew is much more than the substance; and when the sincerity, reality, and inward Reverence and esteem of our heart in name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, keepeth no just proportion with the words of our mouth, and our large external profession; thus did the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and thus do all Hypocrits take and bear Gods name in vain, not being at all answerable to what they seem to be; this may be also in others comparatively, in respect, 1. of the Law. 2. in respect of the means we have, 3. in respect of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
               <p>That our Conviction may be the clearer, let us see what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the right going about of duty, or to the suitable mentioning of the Lords Name, the want whereof, or any part thereof maketh us more or less guilty of taking it in vain. 1. Then there is a necessity that we propose a good and right end, and aim singly at it; for if all things should be done to Gods glory, this of the Naming of the Lord should be in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner so: this is a mans call to Pray, Preach, Hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to wit, the concernment of Gods Name, that is, 1. That God may be honoured. 2. That we our selves, or others may be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. 3. That a command may be obeyed in the Conscience of Duty; Those then who adventure to profess or name God, or to go about any ordinance, seeking themselves, and not the Lord, as is supposed men may do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5, 2. out of envy, as they did of whom <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16. 3. To be honoured of men, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> designed by their lo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. 4. For the fashion, or out of meer custome. 5. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king peace with God, by mentioning his name so often in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, mis-regarding and taking no notice of the Mediator in the mean time: these I say and such like will meet with that sad word, <hi>In vain do ye worship me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a necessity of a good principle in naming the Lord (to speak so) both of a Moral and Physical principle: the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is Conscience, and not Custome, which falleth in with the end, the Physical is the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>No man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

Sincerity, as to the exercise even of the natural faculties; Thus what ever unrenewed men speak in Duty, without the Spirits influence and exercise of grace, they make themselves guilty in it; and, when they say, what in sincerity they think not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is necessary that that principle act in the right manner, that is, 1. Sincerely, <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.14. 2. In fear and reverence, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.1, 2. 3. With faith and respect to Jesus Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. 4. With Judgment and understanding. To speak of him, not knowing what we say, or to whom we speak, wrongeth him: thus ignorant, passionate, rash, irreverent and inadvertent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of God, or medling with any Ordinance or Duty, wrongeth him, and is a bringing of vain oblations, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly forbiddeth, <hi>Esa.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When ever we make mention of God, we should study to be in case to mention him as ours, as our God and Father in Christ, in all ordinances and duties, that is, 1. Taking up our natural distance. 2. Looking to Christ for removing of it. 3. Resting on him, and making use of him for that end. 4. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in the mentioning of God as ours. 5. With thanksgiving and blessing, when ever he is named, as the Apostle often doth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is required in respect of the use, fruit, and effect, that something which is profitable may remain and stick with us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the duty which is gone about, or the way of mentioning God, such as some conviction and testimony of the Conscience. 1. That Gods honour; 2. The edification of others in way of Instruction, or Conviction, or of Reproof, or of comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. My own edification and spiritual advantage, or, 4. My own exoneration and peace, as to the performance of such a duty, were in some measure of singleness aimed at and endeavoured; and as there is a missing of any of these, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance should be exercised, and faith for pardon; some fruit, some sense, some lesson, some discoveries, some convictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be sought after to remain. When these or any of these (if all the rest of them can be altogether without one) are wanting, this command is simply broken; if in part they be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is comparatively more or less broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:55484:116"/>Let us then take a view in particulars. 1. Look to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, Oh! what emptiness is there, much more appearance and shew, than reality and substance? yea what desiring to seem something, rather than to be? if our professions (who are least in them) were mett and measured by our reality, O how lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vast a disproportion would be found? the one would be quickly found much broader and longer than the other, the outer-half much bagged as it were, being a great deal larger than the inner, even where there is most sincerity and reality.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look through publick duties, if there be not much taking of Gods Name in vain, in hearing, praying, praising, using the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if so, O what a Libell might be drawn up against us from every Sabbath, Prayer, Sermon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof we often cannot tell what fruit remaineth, except it be sin, guilt, and hardness; and therefore doubtless his Name is much taken in vain in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Look through private duties in families, Reading, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Singing, Conferring, Catechising, saying Grace, or seeking a Blessing, and giving thanks at Table; how little regard is often had to the name of the Lord in these? and how little care and pains is taken to walk by the former rules in them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Look through secret duties, betwixt God and you, how ye pray in secret before God: ah! often so, as ye would be ashamed to pray before men; how do ye Read, Meditate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in secret? how do ye joyn in prayer with others? which in some respect is secret; God knoweth how poorly we acquit our selves in these ordinarily, and how much we take his Name in vain in them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Look through occasional duties, wherein ye have occasion to make mention of God with or to others, as when upon any Emergent of providence, we will say, It is Gods will, God hath done it, God is good and merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in any particular duty of christian Communion, in instructing, comforting, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing, or convincing of others, or debating with them; how often, when the Scripture, and the name of God will be in our mouths: in these, and the matter of debate may fall to be some of his ordinances, will there be but very little reverence and respect to God in our hearts?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Consider how this sin of taking his Name in vain is fallen

in by writing, not only when Treatises are written, but almost in every Epistle or Letter, there will be found some prayer or wish, for fashion-sake, wherein there is but little Conscience made to have the heart joyning in it; how much irreverent using of the Scripture and of Gods Name, is there in writing of Letters, particularly of Burial-Letters, thus.

               <p n="7">7. Look through accidental mentionings of God (if we may say so) in salutations, God save you, God be with you; In pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for Children, evidencing rather our fondness on them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, than our love and reverence to the Name of God; for such as are in any present hazard, God save; for any favour, curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie or complement, God bless; these are good (as the Apostle saith of the Law) if used lawfully, but they are often sinfully, rashly, ignorantly, yea prophanely abused, we having often more respect to them we speak unto, than unto God. I would not condemn the use of them being duties, but exhort you to gard against the abuse, and to use a grave, reverent, understanding, and sensible way of expressing of them, or of any thing like them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Consider narrations of Scripture-stories, or other stories, questions, tales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the Name of God is mentioned, and possibly when we tell them, to make a sport of them, and to make merry with them; how often is his blessed Name taken in vain in them? certainly the mentioning of his Name were often better forborn, than so irreverently used.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Consider the Usurping of Gods Attributes, or of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in him, rashly, as when men confidently, yet without all warrant, assert God is mine; I trust in his mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sweet Christ my Saviour, my Mediator, Ah! how often is this, which is the very Crown of grace, to wit, in Gods doing good and shewing mercy, abused and prophaned most sinfully and shamefully!</p>
               <p>There is one particular, which yet remaineth to be spoken of on this Third Command, which concerneth Lots, Omens, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Observations and such like, whereby the Name of God is wronged, in being not only slighted, contemned and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vain in these events (which yet are guided by Him) but


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55484:118"/>
the Disposal of things, which is due to God, is denyed to Him, and Attributed to Chance, Luck, Fortune, and such like.</p>
               <p>We shall then: 1. Shew what <hi>Lotting</hi> or <hi>Lottery</hi> is. 2. How it Concerneth this Command. 3. Distinguish Lots, into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts. 4. Shew what are Lawful, and when they are Lawful. 5. What are Unlawful.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Lot</hi> or <hi>Lotting</hi> is, The Committing, of the Decision of some thing, in an Immediate way to Divine Providence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Intervening Causalties, or Influence, of any Second Cause, to sway in that Decision: So that when the thing fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out, and is decided, there can be no Reason given, Why it is so on Mens part, but that the Lord was pleased to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: As it was in that Instance of Lotting, about the Election of the Twelve Apostles, in <hi>Judas</hi> his Room, <hi>Acts,</hi> 1. So from <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 16.33. It's clear that that is a Lot; <hi>Whereof the whole Disposal is of God</hi>: And therefore it is said, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.18. <hi>to cause Contentions to cease, and to part betwixt the Mighty</hi>; Because none can quarrel, concerning that which Man hath no hand in.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Lot,</hi> may be many ways appointed, either by the Throw of a Dice, or the like; or by some other mean putting Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betwixt one and other, even as men shall appoint: as when it is; By what Beast they shall first see, by what Saying, or by what Book they shall first hear, or look on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Only we think, Lots differ from Omens, or Superstitious Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thus: 1. Lots are to decide betwixt two; the other, are Collections, which one may make concerning himself. 2. Lots follow on some appointment that is mutual and are free; the other may be other-wayes.</p>
               <p>That Lots in the use of them, concern this Command; these things will make it out several ways. 1. That which putteth God to it, in an Immediate way, concerneth this Command, especially; I mean, whatever putteth him to declare his mind, or reveal himself; that putteth him to it, and is a special Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Invocating of Him: But Lots or Lotting, putteth him to it, in an Immediate way; For, 1. None other can dispose of them but he, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33. 2. What is discovered by those Lots, is either God's mind or the Devil's, or is by Chance;


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55484:119"/>
but it cannot be any of the latter two, therefore it is the First. 3. It is the putting him to it, more than he is by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Because, 1. It is by an Extraordinary way, and often added to Prayer. 2. It is for the manifesting of a secret Decree; For by it, we are to understand, what God has appointed, and Eternally decreed, concerning such an Event. Hence it is, that in Scripture, Prayer is so often, if not always joyned with it; and therefore it must in a special manner belong to this Command: Yea, if God be slighted in it, he is wronged: if acknowledged according to his Interest, he is in a special manner concerned, where he wholly ordereth the thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is either a Mean, appointed by him to understand his mind or not; if appointed by him, then it is in so far his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and his Name is concerned in it; if not, then it is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The medling with God's Secret, or with his Will, or Way of revealing it in his Providence, must belong to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but this especially, meddleth with all these: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That which cannot be gone about, but the Name of the Lord, is either wronged or honoured, in it; must necessarily belong to this Command, for that is the Scope of it: But none can Lot without either depending on God, for the ordering of, and acknowledging of him in it, when it is done; and so without honouring him, or neglecting him, and so taking his Name in Vain. 1. By miskenning his Providence, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get that decided some other way. 2. By Irreverent going about it. 3. By Attributing it to some other thing. 4. By not acknowledging God in it, nor submitting to it, when done so. So then these three wayes men fail, and take God's Name in vain. 1. Before the Lot. 2. In the time of it. 3. After it is past.</p>
               <p>Lots, are ordinarily divided into three sorts. 1. <hi>Divine,</hi> which are from extraordinary Warrants. 2. <hi>Devilish,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Devil is either Invocated, or, in Circumstances, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision is put to him, and guided by him. 3. <hi>Humane,</hi> which are ordinarily gone about amongst men.</p>
               <p>Again, They are divided: 1. In <hi>Divinatory.</hi> 2. <hi>Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatory,</hi>


                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:55484:119"/>
whereby men find out some-what that is Secret, as <hi>Saul</hi> found out <hi>Jonathan</hi>; or are led to some Duty. 3. <hi>Divisory,</hi> By such the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was divided, <hi>Joshua,</hi> 13.6. 4. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory,</hi> or, for Play: This division is large and Comprehensive, and hath several steps, according to the weight of the things, as they are greater or smaller, or indifferent.</p>
               <p>Concerning them we say; That all Consultatory, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinatory Lots, except by an Extraordinary Warrant, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and a Tempting of God, who has now given us other wayes and means, to direct us in what is meet for us to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning those Devilish Lots, there is no Question of the Abominableness of them; such as fore-telling of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, Horo-Scopes, or Deaths; the finding of things lost by naming of all suspected Persons, turning the Riddle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet 3. We dare not condemn all Divisory Lots, if rightly gone about.</p>
               <p>Because, they are frequently made use of, in the Scripture; <hi>Joshua,</hi> 7.13, 14, and 15. &amp;c. <hi>Acts,</hi> 1. Yea they seem to be, from the Light of Nature, <hi>Jona,</hi> 1. 2. The use of them, is Moral and perpetual, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.18. To cause Contentions to cease, and to part between the Mighty. 3. When they are rightly gone about, they are a Honouring of God, and are a Manifest acknowledging of his Providence. I say, Rightly gone about: Where,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The matter should be weighty or of some Consequence; that is, It should either be weighty in it self; or it should be so by some Consequence, or Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; making a light thing, in it self weighty, otherwise it is (as Swearing is, in a matter of no moment) but a baffling of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It should be Necessary, that is a thing, that without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inconveniences, cannot be in another way decided: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to put God to reveal his mind, in an Extraordinary way, when there is an Ordinary at hand, is a tempting of God; even as; to leap over a Wall is, while there is an ordinary pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to go thorow by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It should be with a due Respect to God, acknowledging him, to be the Decisor, calling on his Name in the Use of it, and


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55484:120"/>
looking to him for the Decision, as we see almost in all Lottings, and even of those Heathens, <hi>Jonah,</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It should be gone about, in the right manner. 1. With Reverence, as if we were to hear God pronounce the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and speak his Mind; as while <hi>Saul</hi> is a taking, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>stand b <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fore the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.19.22. 2. In the Faith that God guideth it; and so, without Auxiety and Fear. 3. In Singleness, Committing it to Him, even in Heart, as well as in Appearance; Abstaining from all Fraud or Tricks, or any thing which may have Influence, as a second cause, to mar or cast the Decision; this were a High way of mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, to put the Decision to Him, and yet to endeavour to give the Answer our selves.</p>
               <p>Lastly, After the Lot, there should be a Reverent Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of God's Mind, without Fretting or Grumbling, and a chearful submitting to it, as we see in all the Cases instanced in Scripture. These Rules being observed, we think that for dividing of Stations or Charges; or of Portions, which cannot be otherways done, without Offence or Prejudice; Lots may be used.</p>
               <p>Yet, I would say these few things, for Caution here:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ye should not in petty things use them, when the matter is of no value at all, or of very small value; so that ye are indifferent, how it falls out: Or when it is not of that weight, that ye would give an Oath in it; but rather quit it, (and there would be here a Proportion kept,) ye should rather in such a Case hazard some Loss than put it to a Lot, out of that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ye owe to God's Name: All the Cases in Scripture are weighty: In your Ordinary Merchandize, I desire you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this;</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ye should not fail to use your Reason, and Honest Skill, more, in Sharings and Divisions, for preventing of a Lot. Folks some-times, betake themselves to these for ease, when yet their Reason, rightly made use of, might bring to a satisfying Decision. God hath not given Reason to Man in vain, or for nought: when Reason then may do it; essay it, and forbear a Lot.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let it be in such a matter, and so used, as ye may seek God in it, and in call His Name by Prayer: To Lots in a thing,


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55484:120"/>
that folks will not, or dare not pray in, agreeth not with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture examples, nor with that tenderness which a Believer should have at such a time: It should then be in a thing respecting a promise.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, we may see how men fail here, 1. In weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things, by not keeping the right manner before the <hi>Lot,</hi> in the time of it, and after it is past, when it endeth not strife. 2. In Trivial things, by making this too Customary; so that folk use the <hi>Lot</hi> almost in every thing, making that which is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to become ordinary, contrary to the nature thereof. It is an ultimate Judge and Decider, even as an Oath is for ending all Controversies: it is like unto <hi>Moses</hi> (as one saith), the great matters should be reserved to it; yea it is greater than <hi>Moses,</hi> its God himself, thus in His providence passing a Decision; The lesser things would be otherwayes Decided.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may gather from what is said, what is to be thought of such Games and pastimes as run on Lottery (having that for the very foundation of them) and have an immediate depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on providence for the issue of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are <hi>Lottery</hi> cannot be denyed, for they have all that is in <hi>Lotting</hi>; there is in them a putting of things to a doubtful event as to us; and that event is guided either by God, or by some other, and which-ever of the two, we say, it will be a Breach of this Command; so trivially for our pleasure to take the name of God in vain, as many formally do; for none can tell, how such a thing will come to pass by any reason.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That to do so, or to use a Lot in this case is a sin, may also be made out clearly, 1. Because it is against the end of Lots, which is to divide or decide where there is Controversie, and so it interverteth their end, and becometh sinful; even as Swearing were no Controversie is, is a sin. 2. There is either no necessity at all to take that way, or there is but a made-necessity of our own, it must therefore be a tempting of God; as suppose this to be the end of Lotting, to know in the upshot whether so much Money should belong to you, or to me; no doubt that point of right to whom the Money belongeth, may be decided as well at the entry; therefore this way of decision is in vain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Lotting which hath in it no reverence to God, but ba <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fleth his Name, nor is consistent with the right manner of


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55484:121"/>
                  <hi>Lotting,</hi> cannot be lawful; but this is such: for it is not only, <hi>de facto,</hi> contrary to the former rules, but in its own nature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with them; this is clear, 1. From the great frequency of <hi>Lotting</hi> in these Games. 2. In the little dependance on God for the event that is in them; and indeed a spiritual frame of dependance on him, cannot well, if at all consist with them. 3. From its inconsistency with serious prayer: what! can or dare men pray in earnest for Gods guiding in these things, in every throw of the Dice, or shuffling of the Cards? or in faith expect still the revealing of his Decree that way? or when it is done and past, can they suitably acknowledg Him in it? Men dare not look so seriously on these things, yea they know they dare not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That way of <hi>Lotting</hi> which cannot but occasion the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Name of the Lord; and his providence, cannot be right; but this is such: for we must say, that either Gods hand is not at all in such things, and so we deny his providence; or we must say that he may be put to it by this common and coarse way, and that in our sport, and for our pleasure in his immediate providence to declare his mind; which is a notable Baffling (to say so) and Prophanation of his Name; hence it is that men so often Swear, Curse, Fret, and exclaim in these Games at Cards, Dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (wherein chance, luck, fortune, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are so much looked to, and in a manner deified) and altogether overlook and misregard the Majesty of God, as if he had no Providence at all in such things.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What is done without warrant of either Scripture-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or practise, cannot be done in faith? Now there can be no suc <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> warrant drawn from Scripture for such playes or games, the very foundation whereof is <hi>Lottery,</hi> and not only accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rarely incident to them, as may be on the matter to other lawful Recreations, if that can be called <hi>Lottery</hi> at all, which is rather an undesigned, unexpected surprizing Incident of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; whereas in the other, the decision by a <hi>Lot</hi> is designed, waited for, and all along the game referred unto, and hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yea it is insuitable and inconsistent with the Scripture-way of using <hi>Lotts,</hi> which is alwayes in most grave and important things; but this way of using them is manifestly to abuse them.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:55484:121"/>6. That which hath a native tendency to ma <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e any Ordinance of God Vile and Contemptible, cannot be Warrantable; Now that <hi>Lotting</hi> in these Games hath such a tendency to make the Ordinance of a <hi>Lot,</hi> and of Prayer, which should at least be joyned with it, Contemptible; is obvious to any serious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial considerer of it, neither can it in reason be thought that, that which is in so Sacred a manner, and with Prayer to God, to be gone about in one thing, and is by Him appointed for such an end as an Oath is; can Warrantably be used in a manner, and for ends so vastly different from the former in an other thing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If <hi>Lots</hi> belong at all to this Command, then these <hi>Lotting</hi>-Games are unlawful: for they cannot with any Religious reason be supposed to be commanded in it, and therefore they must be forbidden. And, if in trivial things, <hi>Lots</hi> be unlawful, much more in such Games which end not strife and contentions, but often and ordinarily begin them, and bring them to a height: and therefore do the Ancients declaim against this as a Sacrificing to Devils, and invented by Idolaters</p>
               <p>If it be said here, that these things are thought but very little of by men; <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, and no great wonder; for most men use but to think little of the breach of this Command, yet are their breaches sinful notwithstanding; as many take Gods Name in their mouth lightly, and think but little of it, and yet that maketh not their doing so, cease to be a sin. God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Certification here the more peremptorily for that very end, that men may not think little, or lightly of the very least breach of this Command (to let pass more grosse breaches of it).</p>
               <p>If it be further objected here, Why may not such Playes or Games be used as well as other Playes, wherein sometimes Chance or Fortune (as they call it) will cast the Ballance? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Though in those other, Chance may now and then oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally occur, yet that is but accidental; these are simply, or at least mostly guided by <hi>Lotting,</hi> and immediat providences, and cannot be prevented or made to be otherwayes by the best art and skill of men. 2. In these other Games there is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of second causes, and an use of mens parts, Natural and Moral, for obtaining such an end ultimat (in some respect) and immediate; as for example, when men strike a Ball with a


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55484:122"/>
Club, or throw a Boul to a hole, they are guided therein ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as they are in coming down a Stair; and they act therein, as in other things by second causes and use of means, whether of Body or mind; but in these <hi>Lotting</hi>-Games it is not so, for all is cast &amp; hung upon extraordinary providence, even as if a man, who cannot, would betake himself to swimming in, or walking upon the Water, when an other betaketh himself to a Bridge or to a Boat.</p>
               <p>In Summe: As <hi>Lots</hi> and Oaths are much for one end, to wit, the ending of Controversie &amp; Strife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.18. So ought the same Rules almost to be observed in them both. Then 1. Before the <hi>Lot</hi> we should look to and follow Gods call and depend on him in it. 2. In the time of <hi>Lotting,</hi> we should act reverently. 3. After the <hi>Lot</hi> we should reverence the Lord, and submit to the event of it as to his mind, even though our frame has not been so right: As an Oath bindeth when taken in lawful matter, though there hath been rashness as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by vertue of Gods Name which is interposed; So do <hi>Lots,</hi> Because how ever we be as to our frame, it is He who decideth as to the event; therefore ought that decision to be looked on as most Sacred; God having thought good beside the general rules in his Word to give evidence of his mind by <hi>Lots,</hi> as to some particular events; and though these Games at Dice or Cards may in the compleat frame of them require some skill, how to manage such throws or such particular Cards when a man hath gotten them; yet that, that-throw is such, casting up so many blacks and no more, that such a man hath such Cards and no other, that is meerly by immediate providence, and so must of necessity be a <hi>Lot</hi>; or it is by some other means which would (if assaid) wrong God also very much; And though skill may possibly influence the event as to the upshot of the Game, yet in these throwings or shufflings there is no skill, or if there be any thing that is accounted Art or Skill, it is but deceit, seeing the scope is by these to leave it to providence in its Decision.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine concerning such Games, was the Doctrine of the Ancients, who did vehemently inveigh against this sort of <hi>Lottry,</hi> see <hi>Cyprian de Aleatoribus,</hi> who fathereth it on <hi>Zabulus</hi> and calleth it the snare of the Devil, and compareth it with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55484:122"/>
so <hi>Ambrose de Tobia, pag.</hi> 590. It was also in some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils condemned, <hi>Can. Apost. Canon</hi> 42. <hi>Con. Trull. Canon</hi> 50.</p>
               <p>This hath been the constant ordinary Judgment of Protestant Writers on this Command, and some of them have written pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Treatises to this purpose, particularly <hi>Danaeus</hi>; wherein he proveth that such <hi>Lottry</hi> is unlawful in it self, and most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to men; this is likewise the Doctrine of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though none of the most rigid Casuists, yea it is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our own Church, these being, as unlawful Games, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of old; and of late, to wit, <hi>Anno</hi> 1638. by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> according to a former Act of an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly held at <hi>Edinburgh, Anno</hi> 1596.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Consider for scarring from such Games, these Two things. 1. The contrary events (that follow most ordinarily on such <hi>Lottry</hi>): Strifes, &amp; Contentions are occasioned, if not caused by them, which are ended by the other, so very different are the events. 2. Consider that most men who use them, fall often into grosse Prophaning of Gods Name, or into high passions at best.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Omen,</hi> or sign, or Token is, when men propose to and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve with themselves, that if they meet with such and such a thing, they will construct so and so of it, or when they seek it from God for that end; Thus <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant did at the Well seek to know the mind of the Lord, and accordingly drew Conclusions about it, concerning a Wife to his Master's Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. So did <hi>Jonathan</hi> about his Assaulting of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. So likewise did <hi>Gideon</hi> about his success against the <hi>Midianites, Judg.</hi> 6. And <hi>Mary</hi> for confirmation of Her faith concerning what was told her by the Angel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.34. This is still to be understood as to some particular fact or event, &amp; not in a common Tract, or for the Determin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion of a general Truth; as for example, <hi>Mary</hi> believed that Christ was to be Born, but knew not that she was to be his Mother; but <hi>Zacharias, John</hi> the <hi>Baptists</hi> Father, did (it seemeth) doubt of Gods power, or of the event or Truth of what was told to him; and therefore he sinned in seeking a sign when the other did not; The <hi>Philistines</hi> sinned most grosly, when they sent back the Ark and did hang the Decision of that question, whether their plagues came from the hand of God, or by chance, upon the motion of the Kine? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. And it is alwayes a sinful tempting of God, when


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55484:123"/>
men out of curiosity from unbelief, or needlesly, put Him to give a sign that they may thereby know his power, will, or wisdom.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Observation</hi> is, when we gather such a thing from such a providence that occurreth without any forecasting of ours, or determining with our selves before hand about it, being a merely surprising unexpected Emergent: we shall only say in general concerning <hi>Omens,</hi> and <hi>Observations,</hi> that when they agree not with the Word, and our Duty revealed and injoyned therein, they are not to be adventured on nor regarded, but utterly sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because then certainly they degenerate &amp; become extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; neither are the examples of such who being led by an extraordinary Spirit have used them, to be followed by others who have not the same Spirit; doubtless it is safe for us to take heed to the more sure word of Prophesie, and to follow the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring rule of the word of God, and not extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples for which we have no warrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Superstitious Observations</hi> are not so much about daily occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring providences, which all are obliged piously to mark and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to the best spiritual advantage, and in the careful marking and suitable improving whereof, there lyeth a special piece of spiritual wisdom, more especially of such providences which may, from the Lord, help either to confirm a man in his Duty, or Deter him from a sin or snare; as they are about some set and marked actions of Creatures, and these very fechless and silly too (though I deny not, but that simply they are providences also) which are reputed to be so many fixed Rules and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of natural wisdom, but really Instituted Spells, or Freets, or the Devils Rudiments and Grammar (to say so) to sink mens minds into <hi>Atheism.</hi> And <hi>Observations</hi> are alwayes Superstitious, when we collect and conclude that such and such events evil or good, will happen to us, or befall us from such and such occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring works and passages of providence, for which no reason can be drawn either out of the word of God, or out of the course of nature; in a word, for which there is neither Scripture-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, nor can any natural cause or reason be assigned; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, To think, it is unluckie to meet such and such Persons first in the morning (which useth to be called an evil foot) for a Woman with-child to step over a <hi>Hair-teather,</hi> for folks to neese putting on their Shoes, for one to have Salt falling toward him


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55484:123"/>
on the Table (the fear whereof maketh some to suffer no Salt to come to their Table) to have a <hi>Hare</hi> cross ones way, to burn in the right ear, to bleed some drops of Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again to think that it boadeth good luck for folks to have drink spilt on them, to find old Iron, to burn on the left ear, to dream on such and such things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is a multitude of such Freets and Superstitious <hi>Observations,</hi> which many retain still, and but few without some and free of all; a sin from which it is to be feared the Land hath never been thorowly purged, since it was <hi>Pagan</hi>; a sin very natural to men, and which hath amongst Christians its observable Increase and Decrease according to the more or less free course and success of the Gospel; All Christians should abhor such freets, as smelling strong of much ignorance of God, of much <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Paganism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this sort, or very like them is, Folks meeting with such a word in such a Sermon, which may have some allusion, or seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing answerableness to a case, or particular, formerly dark, or doubtful to them, which they take for clearing of them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of the thing without due examination thereof, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true meaning of the Scripture, and the Analogy of Faith: And their having such a place of Scripture brought to their mind, or at the first opening of the Bible cast up to them, which they look on as more befitting their condition, and that because so suggested and cast up, without pondering the word it self; and lay more weight on that word on that very account for solving of such a doubt, and for clearing and determining them as to such a thing, than on any other having the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and no less, and it may be much more suitableness to the thing, without any further tender and serious scrutiny, as if that were a special and extraordinary Revelation of Gods mind to them thereabout; which is a most dangerous practise. And (as we discoursed before on the practical breaches of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Command) is to make a Weerd or Fortune-Book of the book of god, which he never appointed for such an end; again I say, a most dangerous practise, and yet too frequently incident to some Religious Persons, especially in their trouble and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, whereof some stupendious instances might be given, which would fright all from ever daring any more to adventure on such a practise not bottomed on the Word it self, which God


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55484:124"/>
hath certainly given to his people to be used by them with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian prudence, according to its own principles, and not to be lotted with, or to have their state or condition, or the decision of what they are dark or dou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>l about, at hap-hazard cast on it, according to their own groundless fancies and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</p>
               <p>We come now to the threatning or certification wherewith this Command is pressed, <hi>The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.</hi> In which, three things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: 1. The Fearfulness and terribleness of the Judgment and Punishment, whereby the Lord will avenge the breach of this Command. 2. The Extent of it, as to every particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual person found guilty, <hi>the Lord will not hold him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> Him, who ever he be, what-ever he be; if there were but one, he shall not escape; and if there be many, not one of them shall be missed or passed-by in this reckoning. 3. There is the Peremptoriness and infallible certainty of it, God will not be disswaded from it, nor will he alter this Sentence, but it must and shall stand against him.</p>
               <p>The punishment is implyed in that, <hi>Not to be holden guiltless,</hi> wherein there is more contained than is expressed, implying these Three: 1. That he shall not be forgiven nor absolved, and so shall never enjoy God's favour and friendship, which no man, who hath sinned, can without pardon, enjoy; thus the Judgment is negatively to be understood, He shall never enter into Heaven, nor see the Face of God, if he Repent not. 2. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively it implyeth that he shall be found guilty, and shall be dealt with as a guilty person, that he shall be eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, shut out from God's presence, and cast into Hell to be there tormented for ever and ever. 3. Eminently it imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a very high degree of punishment, that the degree shall be eminent, and that in respect of other sins this sin shall have a peculiar weight added unto its Curse, an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be ranked amongst those sins which shall be in the Justice of God most severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; a particular instance and proof whereof, is in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, whose Judgment shall be in Hell amongst the sorest; the Hypocrites portion of Wrath will be a large portion.</p>
               <p>The Peremptoriness is implyed in these words, <hi>The Lord will not hold him guiltless, the Lord will not,</hi> &amp;c. which imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55484:124"/>
1. That Sinners shall be reckoned with and Judged for sin, in which reckoning this sin shall be especially taken notice of. 2. That all Sinners shall be summoned to appear before the Judgment-Seat and Tribunal of God, and have their particular Libel and Accusations of their particular sins, wherein this sin shall be particularly taken notice of, as a main Article. 3. That there shall be a Sentence and Doom passed upon the Guilty, and that whosover shall be found guilty of this sin, shall find Divine Justice severely passing Sentence upon them. 4. That there shall be a holy rigid execution of that Sentence without mercy, by a high degree of wrath upon all who shall be so Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced.</p>
               <p>If any ask, How this <hi>Threatning</hi> is to be understood? for <hi>Answ.</hi> We should distinguish betwixt such, who repenting for it, do by Faith in Christ make peace with God, and others who continue in it without repentance: and so say, 1. That it is not to be understood as if the breach of this Command were declared to be simply unpardonable to any who shall be guilty of it; for that is neither consistent with the grounds of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nor with experience, whereby it is found that grace often extendeth it self to the pardoning even of such. 2. But that it is in it self a sin most hateful to God, and a sin that bringeth great Wrath on all that are guilty of it, and shall be found to be so, before his Judgment Seat. 3. It sayeth that all who are guilty of it, while their peace is not made with God through Jesus Christ, yea in some respect there-after, should look on themselves as thus highly guilty; and that all who are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, should account themselves to be lyable to this stroke of wrath, and to be under this Sentence of the Law that standeth particularly pronounced against them. 4. It sayeth, that men do by this sin, exceedingly hazard their eternal Salvation, and that their Repentance is rare, and so likewise their Pardon; it being found in experience that men, habituated to this sin of taking God's Name in vain, do but seldom get Repentance. 5. That when Repentance cometh, and is given, such as are guilty of it, will be in an especial manner challenged for it, and found to be in a high degree, bitter unto them in all their after-reflections upon it. 6. That it will very readily have much influence in marring a mans peace, and obstructing the intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55484:125"/>
of God's favour, and the joy of his Salvation, even when it is pardoned; as we see in <hi>David,</hi> who made the Name of God to be Blasphemed, and was therefore put, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. to cry and cry again for the joy of God's Salvation; for removing (amongst other reasons) of that scandal. And withal, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on temporal Judgments as it did on <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.7. That when it is pardoned, it will in the said remembrance of it, make them loath themselves, and walk humbly, softly, and in the bitterness of their souls; and withal, to think much of, and to magnifie, and wonder at grace that did ever pardon such. Sinners, as it did <hi>Paul,</hi> who loatheth himself, and highly exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Grace on this account, that it pardoned him who was a <hi>Blasphemer</hi>: As for such who never betake themselves for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, nor obtain mercy, it has these effects; 1. It maketh their Conscience lyable to the sore and grievous challenge of this sin, and to the plain and sharp threatning that is pronounced against it, which being despised, and God himself much wronged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, cannot but bite, nay, gnaw the Conscience so much the more. 2. Justice hath a clear ground to proceed upon against them, not only as Sinners in general, but as guilty of this sin in particular, and so because of it, in a special manner liable to wrath. 3. An eminent degree of wrath in Hell; for as there are different degrees of torment in Hell, so this sin, no doubt, will make those who are guilty of it, share of that torment in a high degree. 4. That it further hardeneth and incapacitateth for pardon (though not simply) the persons that are guilty of it.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, Why this sin is so threatned and punished even beyond other sins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Because it is accompanied with the most hainous ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, and so draweth on the greatest guilt: As 1. It is a sin immediately against God himself, and is not, as sins of the second Table, nay not as other particular sins of the first Table, whereby men divert from God to Idolatry, giving to Idols what is His due, or turn their back on him, or slight his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded worship, as in the first, second, and fourth Commands; but this doth immediately and directly, and by commission ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate on God himself most daringly and presumptuously, as it were baff <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng and affronting him who has made himself known


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55484:125"/>
by his Name. 2. It is the fault, sign, or symptome, yea, and cause of the most gross Atheism in the heart, and enmity against God; for it is his Enemie's property <hi>to take his Name in vain,</hi> Psal. 139.20. It cannot be in the heighth, but where <hi>Atheism</hi> is, and the awe of God is not; and where there is much of it, there is proportionably much Atheism; it speaketh forth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is no right knowledge or faith of his Greatness, Holiness, Power, Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would make men fear him, and stand in awe of him; hence ordinarily those who are gross in this, are otherways gross in many other things; for it fitteth and disposeth for Atheism, and it inureth and habituateth a man to contemn and despise God, whereas, on the contrary, if a man make Conscience of any thing, it will be of this. 3. It is that which dishonoureth God most amongst others, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them occasion to Blaspheam, as <hi>David</hi>'s sin did, and as those false Prophets and Seducers with their followers are said to do, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. and where this prevaileth, all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is accounted, among such, but as a fancy and nothing, and therefore he will punish it severely. 4. It is often and most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the guilt of such as acknowledge God in profession, but in works deny him, and do not worship him as God: It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst light and convictions, yea, and professions of an interest in God; therefore, there is an emphasis here, The Name of the <hi>Lord thy God.</hi> 5. It is not so of Infirmity, as other sins which pleasure, or profit may push men on to; there is ordinarily here none of these, but either simple Atheisme; or prophane custom that maketh it so much the worse, that it is customary.</p>
               <p>The second reason why the Lord thus threatneth and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that sin, is that he may thereby vindicate his own holiness, and imprint the awe and terribleness of this great and dreadful Name <hi>the Lord our God,</hi> upon the hearts of all, it being one of the greatest benefits bestowed; or which can be bestowed upon men, to wit, the manifestation of the Name of God, when it cometh to be abused (being the abuse of the best thing, and so the greatest abuse) it is the more severely avenged, and thus one way or other the Lord will have his Holiness and Greatness known amongst all his Creatures; and therefore, whosoever shall think little of his Blessed and Holy Name here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55484:126"/>
upon baffle and prophane it, God shall make them think more of it hereafter, when he riseth up to take Vengeance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He so threatneth and punisheth it, because men take a liberty and latitude in it, in formal Praying, rash Swearing, Jestings, Writings, Tenents, Disputes, Plays, by Lots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore he putteth the greater stamp of his Indignation on it, either to restrain them from that liberty, or to make them smart for it; and men also but very seldom severely punish it, therefore He himself will.</p>
               <p>If any should ask the cause, why men do ordinarily take so lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle notice of this Command, and so generally sin against it? I-confess it may be at the first wondered at, considering that it has such peremptory threatnings, and is very often followed, even here in this world, and in the sight of men, with shame and visible judgments; and that there is ordinarily no profit, nor credit, nor any such satisfaction to carnal lusts or pleasures to tempt and push on to it, as are to other sins; and that yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, men should so frequently sin this way, must be also as wonderful as it is abominable. But we may conceive it to proceed from these Causes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Much Atheism, and the little heart-esteem that there is of God, and of his Majesty; the little Faith that there is of his dreadful Justice, and severe and peremptory execution of his threatnings; little of these within, maketh men careless to be watchful, and what wonder if this break forth, when in his heart the man sayeth, There is no God; then this followeth, as is clear, <hi>Isa.</hi> 37. in <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> who when once he saith, <hi>Who is the Lord,</hi> then he treadeth on his Name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a natural pride and stout-heartedness in men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, flowing from the former, whereby they set their mouth against God, and think it is a piece of bravery not to stand in awe of him; and (as <hi>Goliah</hi> did) to defie the living God, and to contemn and trample upon all Religion and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which appears sooner and more clearly in nothing, than in stout words against the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.13. and in prophaning of his Name; hence it is to be observed, that where this sin raigneth, there is either a height of desperate security and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid senselesness, or a devillish gallantry in contemning God and all Religion, all Prayer, and other spiritual exercises as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55484:126"/>
pretty men, or men of spirits; as if, forsooth, topping with God, and bidding a defiance to the Almighty, were true knowledge, and the grand proof of a brave and gallant spirit, and of a pretty man: O! what a dreadful length is this that men are come? to say in effect, Who is the Lord, that I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence his Name?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Devil knowing well both these, taketh occasion to stir men up to it, and what by offering occasions of irritation to vent their passion, and what by habituating them to it from custome, and the example of others, whereby keeping them off some other sins which others may be guilty of, he is in God's righteous Judgment permitted to harden them in this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There may be also something in the nature of this sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth not ordinarily wrong others externally, or because it may be in a truth, or in profession of duty, or in worship; or because it may be fallen into inadvertantly without fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought or deliberation; therefore the Devil hath the greater advantage to drive men on to it, if not by Swearing falsly, yet prophanely and rashly; if not by God, yet by some Creature; or if not so, yet by formal and fruitless discharging of duties, or by some other way; and because ordinarily there is no such evil that sticketh thereby to others, as to make them resent it, nor no ill meant to themselves, as they in their proud self-love, do conceit; therefore they are the less affraid of it before, and the less challenged for it afterward.</p>
               <p>Let us make some use of all this in a few words. 1. Then, see, and gravely consider what sin this is, what wrath it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth, how far, and how wide in its guilt it extendeth it self, and what severe reckoning will be for it? O then! what is your hazard, and what will be your sentence when this Judgment shall be set, &amp; when the Judge cometh to pronounce it? tell me who of you will be able to purge your selves of this guilt? This Sentence may, and will one day make many of you to tremble, when the Lord will say, <hi>Man, thou tookest my Name in vain in such a Company, at such a Play and Sport, in such a Contest, in such an Oath, yea, in such a Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Here is your Sentence, <hi>I will not hold you guiltless, but guilty for this cause</hi>; This, this is the truth of God, if we believe his Word, yea, whether we believe it or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:55484:127"/>Let me therefore speak two words further to all of you, Old and Young, Godly and Prophane, Rich and Poor, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> O take more notice of this sin, and be more watchful against it, think more of it, and look more to every way it may be fallen into; and by all mens study to prevent it, fear to name <hi>the great and dreadful Name of our Lord the God</hi> irreverently; tremble when ye hear it named; and when ye read, hear, pray, or do any duty, as ye would eschew this Curse and Threatning, and be found guiltless in the day of the Lord, eschew this sin of taking his Name in vain.</p>
               <p>For helps to this, let me commend unto you,</p>

                     <p>Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it Holy: Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy Work, but the Seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any Work, Thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy Man-servant, nor thy Maid-servant, nor thy Cattel, nor thy Stranger that is within thy Gates; for in Six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the Seventh day; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord blessed the Sabbath and Hallowed it.</p>

               <p>THe Lord in his infinite Wisdom and Goodness, hath so far consulted mans Infirmity, as to sum up his Duty in these Ten Commands, called <hi>Ten Words,</hi> that thereby his darkness and dulness by sin, might be helped by an easie abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation: The first Command therefore containeth mans duty to God in immediate Worship, requiring that the only true God should be worship'd: The 2d. stinteth and limiteth men to that worship alone which he perseribeth: The 3d. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55484:128"/>
Reverencing of him in all his Ordinances, and a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner of going about them.</p>
               <p>This Fourth pointeth out the Time which most solemnly the Lord will have set a-part for his Worship, that so He, who is both Lord of us, and of our time, may shew what share he has reserved as a Tribute due to himself, who hath liberally vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed on us the rest; which time is not to be understood exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, as if he would have only that spent in worship (there being no exclusive determination of exercise of worship, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them in Scripture, that is to say, that they shall be so long and so often, and no longer, nor oftner) but that he will precisely have this time as an acknowledgment from us, even as when he gave <hi>Adam</hi> the use of all the Trees in the Garden, he reserved one; so when he giveth Six days to us, he keepeth a Seventh for himself.</p>
               <p>This Command is placed in a manner betwixt the two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, because it is a transition as it were from the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and containeth in it duties of immediate Service to God, and of Charity towards men, and so in some sort serveth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile (if we may speak so) the two Tables, and to knit them together, that so their harmony may be the more clearly seen: It is also more largely and fully set down for plurality and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of expressions and words than any other in either of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; yet hath it notwithstanding, been in all times in a special manner assaulted and set upon, and endeavours used to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it: Satan ayming somtimes to darken the meaning of it, somtimes to loose from the strict tye of observing it, and that not only by old <hi>Sabbatarians, Anti-sabbatarians,</hi> and corrupt School-men, but even by those whom God hath made Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in the main; And especially by a Generation in these days, who having a hatred at all Ordinances, and at all the Commands of the Decalogue, yet do especially vent it against this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; because in it is contained a main foundation of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. As it is wonderfully great presumption for men to assault and set upon God's Authority, even where he hath strengthned himself (as it were) most, by more full explication, and more large and particular pressing of duty, and forbidding of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary sin, as he hath done in this Command, more than in any of all the rest; So it will be necessary before we can speak to the


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55484:129"/>
practical part of piety comprehended in it, concerning the sanctification of the Christian Sabbath, or Lord's day, either in the negative or positive part of it, to speak doctrinally (for clearing of the precept) to these three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether this Command be moral, and do oblige us in its Letter as other Commands do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is the particular morality of it, and the literal meaning of the words.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How our Lord's day standeth in reference to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? and whether thereby the same sanctification be required as to it, though its institution arise from another ground, than is required to the Seventh-day-Sabbath? Somewhat of all these must needs be spoken unto, and we begin to speak first of its morality before we speak of its meaning, because all dependeth on this, both in respect of exposition and practise; for if it be not moral and perpetually binding, it's not necessary either to explicate it, or to study and press the practise of it; but if it be found to be moral, then no doubt it concerneth us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the same moral sanctification of a day now as it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Our Assertion then in reference to this is, that, The duty of setting a-part and sanctifying of a portion of time, as it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the fourth Command, for God's Service as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth, is moral, and the obligation thereunto perpetual, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as in the duties of the other Commands; the obligation to this, being no more dissolved than to those, though there may be difference in the degree of the obligation which they lay on in respect of the matter contained in them; my meaning in a word, is, that a day or one of seven is as necessary to be kept holy unto God now, (upon supposition of his determining the particular day) as it is necessary to hold and keep up the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship prescribed by God; neither without sin can another day be put in the room of it, more than other worship can be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in the place of divinely prescribed worship; for the time is set and fixt by the Fourth Command (pointing at a solemne and chief time) as the worship it self is by the second.</p>
               <p>For clearing of this, consider, 1. That we mean not here mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-natural, as if without any positive Law such a thing had been binding; no, but moral-positive, that is laid on by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55484:129"/>
which is standing unrepealed, and so bindeth by vertue of, the authority of the Law-giver, as several other commands and precepts do; as namely, those concerning Sacraments, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the second Command, and those concerning one Wife, and forbidden desires of Marriage belonging to the Seventh; which being so often broken by many Saints, and dispensed with in some cases, cannot be thought to be morally-natural since the Lord dispenseth not so in these, nor can it be thought in reason, that his Servants would have been ignorant of such a natural thing: It is then moral-positive that we mean, to wit, that which is binding by a positive Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider in this question, that there is a great difference betwixt these two, to say the Seventh-day-Sabbath which the <hi>Jews</hi> kept, is moral, and to say the Fourth Command is moral; the one may be, and is abolished, because another is brought in its roome: The other, to wit, the Command may stand, and doth stand, because it tyeth morally to a Seventh day, but suc <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a Seventh day as the Lord should successively discover to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by him; and though the Seventh be changed, yet one of seven is still reserved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is need to distinguish betwixt the moral substance of a Command, and some ceremonial appendices belonging to it: So the Fourth Command might then possibly have had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ceremonial in that Seventh day, or in the manner used of sanctifying that Seventh day which now is gone as double Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in its reasons whereby it is pressed; (as there is somthing peculiar to that People in the Preface, to all the Commands) as there was in the Sacraments of the old Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the second Command; yet both a Sabbath day and Sacraments may be, and are very necessary and moral in the Church; it is not then every thing hinging on this Command, as proper to that administration, and so but accidental to the sanctifying of a Sabbath, that we plead for; but this is it we plead for, that the Command is, as to its main scope, matter, and substance, moral-positive, and that it standeth as still bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obliging unto us, and cannot without sin be neglected or omitted; it might be enough here to say, that if this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand were never repealed in the substance of it, nor did ever exspire by any other thing succeeding in its place, then it must


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55484:130"/>
needs be still binding; for certainly, it was once, as obligatory-proclaimed by the Law-giver himself, and was never since in its substance repealed, nor is it exspired or found hurtful in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but is as necessary now as then; it is true, the Seventh day Sabbath is repealed by instituting and substituting the First day Sabbath, or Lord's day, in its place; but that doth rather qualifie the Command than repeal it; for 1. It saith that a day is moral and necessary. 2 It saith a day of seven is moral and necessary, which is all we say; and why necessary? as agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this Command no doubt; whence we may Argue, if the substance of this Command be kept even when the particular day is changed, then is the Command moral (which this very change confirmeth) but the former is true, as is clear in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; therefore it followeth that the Law stands unrepealed; for it's palpable that the day, as to its number or frequency, and duration, with the manner of sanctifying of it, belongs to the substance of the Commandement, but what day as to its order, first, second, or seventh doth not, because the first cometh in immediately upon Religion, God's Honour, and the good of Souls, which the other doth not: This Argument will stand good against all who acknowledge this Law to have been once given by God till they can evidence a repeal.</p>
               <p>To speak somewhat more particularly to this, the way we shall make out the morality of it, is by considering, 1. How the Scripture speaketh of it in general. 2. How it speaketh of the Decalogue. 3. How it speaketh of this Command in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. 4. By adducing some Scriptural Arguments for it: As for the 1. To wit, the Scriptures speaking of it in general, we say, If the Scripture speak as frequently in clearing the Fourth Command, or the Sabbath (which is the morality of it) and press it as seriously, and that in reference to all times of the Church, as it doth any other moral duty; then for substance this Command is moral and perpetually binding, (for that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be the Character whereby most safely to conclude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Command, to consider how the Scripture speaketh of it,) but the Scripture doth as often mention, and is as much, and as serious in pressing of that Command, and that in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to all states of the Church as of any other, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. We shall make out this, by shewing 1. its frequency in mentioning


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55484:130"/>
of it. 2. Its seriousness in pressing it. 3. Its asserting of it as belonging to all times and states of the Church.</p>

And this is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted also in this same Command, where it is called, the <hi>Sabbath of the Lord,</hi> in opposition to, or contradistinction from the other six dayes: all which seemeth to speak out something more than Temporary in this Duty of setting a Seventh day apart for God (for we speak not yet of the particular day).</p>

               <p>Hitherto there is no difficulty, the pinch will lye in this, If the Scriptures speak of it as belonging to the days of the Gospel, In which (for making of it out) 1. We have these hints, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. Where Christians going about the Moral Duties of the Sabbath, is especially observed to be upon one day peculiarly. 2. That Title of the direct appropriating of a Day to the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. Which places will fall in to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered particularly when we come to the last question; Besides these we may produce three places to prove a Sabbath as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the New Testament; though not the very Day used or observed for the Sabbath in the Old; and this will be enough to make out the Assertion, two of them are Prophesies, the third of them is in the Gospel. The first Prophesie is in the 66. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Esaiah</hi> v. 23. The second is in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Description of the New Temple, <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.44, 45, 46, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where 1. It is clear that these places relate to the Dayes of the Gospel, as none can deny but they do so eminently. 2. It is clear that though they Prophesie of the Services of the Gospel under the names of Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proper to the Old-Testament-Administration, and of the Sanctified and set-apart time of the Gospel, under


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55484:131"/>
the Name of Sabbath which then was determined, and whereto men were then bound by the fourth Command as they were to Sacrifices by the second: yet these Prophesies infer not by vertue of the fourth Command the very same Day to be under the Gospel, which was under the Law, more than the same Services by vertue of the second; which none will deny to be in force, notwithstanding of the change of Services: and there is as little reason to deny the fourth to be still in force as to its substance, notwithstanding of the change of the particular Day. Yet Thirdly it is clear that from the mentioning of these Services this will follow, that there should be set and fixed Ordinances, and a way of Worship in the New-Testament, as well as in the Old, and that there should be a solemn chief set-time for the Sabbath which men ought to sanctifie, and that they should no more admit any other times, nor so set apart into a parity with it, than they were to admit any Service or Worship not allowed by God, or that was contrary to the second Command: for if any thing be clear in them, this is clear, that they speak first of Services, then of solemn times and Sabbaths, and of the one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, which must certainly infer, that both external Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and a solemn chief time for them, do belong to the New-Testament; Hence it is that many Divines (from that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>) do draw conclusions for fundry things out of those places, as 1. Concerning the necessity and continuance of a standing Ministry, and though Ministers now be neither Priests nor Levites, yet ( <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> say they,) it followeth clearly, that there will be a Mini <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>try, because such are spoken of there. 2. Concerning the necessity of, and a Warrant for Church Discipline, and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not only Doctrinally, but Disciplinarily the Precious from the Vile, and debarring of those who are Morally unclean from the Ordinances: because these things (say they) are Typified in the substance by the Porters being set to keep the Doors, and by the charge given to the Priests. 3. Anent the continuance of a Church, and of the Ordinances of Word, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Congregating of Christians to attend these, though there shall be no material or Typical Temple, because of the Moral things there being expressed and Prophesied of, under the names of the Old-Levitical-Services; yet could not a Warrant


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55484:132"/>
be inferr'd from them for these, (and that <hi>Jure Divino</hi>) if the things were not Morally to bind, which were so signified.</p>
               <p>Hence I argue, if the Sanctifying of a Sabbath as a piece of worship to God be Prophesied of to belong to the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then are we bound to the Sanctification of a Sabbath as a necessary Duty; but the continuance of Sanctifying a Sabbath unto God, is specially Prophesied of, and foretold as a piece of worship under the New-Testament, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third place is <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Pray that your flight be not in the Winter,</hi> neither on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> where the Lord insinuateth, that as Travelling is troublesome to the Body in Winter; so would it be to the minds of the Godly (for he is now speaking to his Disciples alone) to Travel on that Day, specially and solemnly set apart for God's worship; now if there were no Sabbath to continue after Christs Ascension, or if it were not to be Sanctified, there would be no occasion of this grief and trouble, that they behoved to Travel on the Sabbath, and durst not tarry till that Day were by-past, and so no cause to put up this Prayer; which yet by our Lords Exhortation seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to infer that the Sabbath was to be as certain in its time as the Winter: And doubtless this cannot be meaned of the <hi>Jewish-Sabbath.</hi> For 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> That was to be abolished shortly. 2. Travelling on the <hi>Jewish-Sabbath</hi> was to be no cause of Grief unto them, if indeed all dayes were alike; neither would it be scrupled in such a case by the Apostles to whom he now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 3. Besides, if no Sabbath were to be, it had been better and clearer to say, Stand not, and griev not to Travel any day: but his words imply the just contrary, that there was to be a solemn Sabbath. 4. He mentioneth the Sabbath-day only, and not the other Festivals of the <hi>Jews</hi> which were to be kept holy also, and by this he distinguisheth the ordinary Sabbath from those other dayes, and opposeth it to many, as being now the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Holy day on which they should eschew, if possible, to Travel; and would therefore pray to have it prevented: for in the New-Testament the Sabbath spoken of as the solemn time for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is ever meaned of the Weekly Sabbath, and other Holy dayes are called the first or last day of the Feast, and therefore if the Lords meaning were that they should pray, <hi>that their flight might not be on any of the</hi> Jewish <hi>Holy dayes,</hi> to mention


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55484:132"/>
the Weekly Sabbath only, would not be sufficient for that end.</p>
               <p>To say that it was for fear of scandal, that they should pray not to be put to flye, will not remove the former reasons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides at that time the Apostles and other Christians had given up with the <hi>Jews</hi> and stood not on scandal in such things in reference to them, on whom, as the Apostle faith, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.16. Wrath had come to the uttermost, and who were not infirm but malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and so in respect of offence to be dealt with as the Lord did with the Pharisees; and therefore, all things being conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it appeareth from our Lords words, that a Sabbath among Christians was to be Sanctified 40. years, or there-about, after his death, which proveth that the Scripture mentioneth a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to be Sanctified under the New-Testament.</p>
               <p>We come unto the second way of making out the Morality of this Command, to wit, by shewing how the Scripture speaketh of the whole Decalogue, and thus we reason.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If all the Commandments of the Decalogue be Moral, then must this be so also; for it is one of them; and if it were not Moral and binding, there would not now be <hi>Ten words</hi> (as they are called by the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.4.) but Nine only, which at first blush, will and cannot but seem strange and absurd to those who have from Gods word drunk-in that number: But all these are Moral and binding, as is granted by all, (except the Papists who deny the second, and therefore score it out of their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms) And that they must be all alike Moral and binding, may be made out, these two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All of them in the Old-Testament had alike Authority, Priviledges, and Prerogatives, which neither the Judicial nor Ceremonial Law had, as 1. To be distinctly pronounced by God himself, without adding more, <hi>Deut</hi> 5.22. 2. To be written by His own finger in Tables of Stone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.18. 3. To be laid up and kept in the Ark, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And if these and other Prerogatives did put a difference, and shew a difference to be put betwixt the other Nine Commands, and all Judicial or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Laws, Why not betwixt them, and this also? 2. In the New-Testament they are all alike confirmed; when the Law in general is spoken of, none of them is excepted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Command is necessarily included.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:55484:133"/>For which we should look first to that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17. Where our Lord in a special manner intendeth to vindicate the Moral <hi>Law,</hi> and to press holiness in Moral Duties upon His Hearers, even in another sort than the Pharisies did: Think no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> (saith He) <hi>That I am come to destroy the Law and the Prophets, I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill; Verily he that breaketh one of the least of these Commands, and teacheth Men so, shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led least in the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c Where, by Law, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be understood the Moral law, for he was thought to be a Transgressor of that, and especially of this Command in it (for that Sermon in <hi>Mathew</hi> cometh in, in order after His being challenged for breach of Sabbath, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And His scope is to wipe off that Imputation, and how? by shewing that He still presseth the Moral law, even beyond what the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies did. 2. It was the Moral law especially, which the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
s corrupted, and whereof he undertaketh the Vindication, and it is Holiness in Obedience to that which he presseth as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary beyond what the Scribes and Pharisies did; and indeed it was in that law they failed mainly, and not in the Ceremonial law. 3. The offence and mistake that Christ is to praeoccupie and rectifie amongst His Hearers, requireth this: for many of them sancied that by the <hi>Messiah</hi> there should be a Relaxation from the Duties of Holiness called for in the Moral law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, saith He, think not so; now a Relaxation from some other laws might have been thought of warrantably. 4. It is such a law whereof to teach the Abrogation at any time is sinful and pernicious, therefore it is certainly the Moral law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We reason thus, when He speaketh of the law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or by way of eminency (meaning no doubt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue) He speaketh alike of all its Commandements, even of the least of them and so of this. 4. Also <hi>that he came not to destroy it,</hi> which yet the Lord never did of Ceremoni <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls, but rather foretold the Abolition of them, as he did of the seeking and worshiping of God in the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem, &amp;c.</hi> Yea when he cleareth the Doctrine of the Sabbath from the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies corrupting Traditions, he doth never weaken its former Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, nor insinuate its weakness, but sheweth the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, which from the beginning made it not only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the works of Piety and mercy, but exceedingly help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to both.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:55484:133"/>A Second place, Confirming the whole Decalogue (or rather Asserting it's Authority,) is in the Epistle of <hi>James, Jam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>He that Offendeth in One, is Guilty of, All</hi>: Why! Because He is the same God, and Law-giver (And no Servant nor Angel) who spake them All, one as well as another of them: And it being clear there, that he speaketh of the Decalogue, called the <hi>Royal Law</hi>; (there being no Law instanced in; nor any other, that can be of a like Authority, in these Laws instanced, but only it; nor that could be pleaded for, by <hi>James,</hi> on such Grounds, on such a time,) and it being also clear, That he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all those Laws, which the Lord spake at that time, alike Authority; (other-wise, his reasoning would not be good, if any one Law or Command, could be instanced to him, of the Ten, which the Lord spake, and was abrogated, and not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) it necessarily followeth, that this 4th. Command, being one of the Ten, must be of equal authority with t
he rest.</p>
               <p>It may be noted also, That <hi>James</hi> here doth not, (as neither doth our Lord, nor any of his Apostles, when they cite the Law) give New Authority to the Laws he citeth; but suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them to have it already; and maketh use of them, as Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the thing he pressed; which could not be, if their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority depended on, or flowed from, the present Citation of them</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we reason further thus; Either there is some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duty, contained in this Command, and laid on by it; which is not in any of the former; or there is but some Ceremonial thing in it, reducable to one of them: For, the Perfection of this Law requireth, that all things needful to the Worship of God, should be summed in it and the Scope thereof, which is, Briefly to compend all requireth there should be nothing in it, that's needless, superfluous, or that might have been left out.</p>
               <p>Now if the matter be Moral; not contained in any former Command, then is the Command it self Moral; seeing a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Substance, and Matter Denominateth the Command so: Yea, it must be Moral, other-wise some-thing Morally neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Gods Service, (such as the Determination of its chief time) should be omitted. It may be assumed, yet further: It must be Moral, (be it what it will) to eschew a Tautology in


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55484:134"/>
this short Compend of Duties; and that, of Moral Duties too.</p>
               <p>Again, If it be not Moral, but contain some Ceremonial thing reducible to one of the three former Commands: Then 1. It might have been put amongst other Ceremonials. 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremonials might have been put in with it: Or, 3. A Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son given, Why all are not Reducible to some Moral Command. 4. If the matter of this be Reducible to another Command. then can it not be accounted a Distinct Command; neither ought it here to have been given as such, but sub-joyned to some other; as the Servants and Beasts resting, is sub-joyned to this. 5. It would be shewn to what Command it's Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible as to the Substance of it, if it be Ceremonial: 6. A Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would be given, Why amongst Ten, One, and Only One, is set down, so far different from all the rest. And if all these Absurdities, follow the Denyal of it's Substance to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; then, for eschewing of them, we must conclude it to be Moral: and so the Fourth Command is Moral.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we reason thus; If it be not Moral, it must either be Judicial, or Ceremonial, for the Matter and Substance of it; but it is not Judicial: that is, it belongeth not to Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Policy, and Civil Society, principally and especially, in that one Nation, because no such Duties are Comprehended, at least Primarily, in any Command of the First Table; but in the Second, which teacheth Duties to others, as this First, doth  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o God: Neither is it Ceremonial; For, All Ceremonies, that are Typical, have their Rise since the Fall, and relate some way to Christ to-Come. But this of sanctifying One Day of Seven, had it's Rise in the State of Innocency, and was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> before he fell, and therefore cannot be called Ceremonial Properly, more than the Command of a Man's leaving Father and Mother, and cleaving to his Wife, so that they too should be one Flesh, which the Apostle <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. maketh use of. Besides, if it were Ceremonial in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, then were it Typical and Significant of some-thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which is hard to shew: Then also had it not been Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to have retained it; for Ceremonials now in their use are not only Dead, but Deadly: But this Morality, in Substance the same with the Command which we plead for, was retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55484:134"/>
by the Apostles, and Primitive Church; (to say no more) There-fore it is not Ceremonial: And so this Law must needs be Moral.</p>
               <p>To say, That the Command is partly Moral, partly Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial; if we respect it's Substance, will not hold: For, 1. There is no such other Law. 2. That were to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, betwixt Ceremonials, and Morals; which it seemeth, the Lord himself hath aimed and resolved to keep clearly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct. 3. What ever be Ceremonial; That which was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and injoyned to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise; and wherein we may agree with Him, under the Gospel, cannot be Ceremonial: For, neither of these States are Capable, of Proper Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; but both agree on a Seventh Day. Therefore, it is not Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial.</p>
               <p>The Third way, we make out the Morality of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is, By particular considering of it self; and here we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus.</p>
               <p>If it be not only put into the Decalogue, with the other Moral Commands; but more singularly explicated, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed even in it than they; then it is certainly Moral; that is, perpetually Obligatory with the rest. But so it is put and set down in the Decalogue; and pressed even more than the rest of the Commands, as on other Accounts, so possibly in this; because it's Ground is Positive, and Men need the more Words about it: Just as in the Second Command; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Now, that it is thus put, and pressed; apeareth these several wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It shareth of all Common Priviledges, with the rest of the Command, set down in the Decalogue, that were all spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yea, Written by the Lord immediatly, and l <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>id up in the <hi>Ark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is proposed, and set down in it's Form, both Positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>Remember the Sabbath, to keep it Holy,</hi> (and Negatively) <hi>in it thou shalt do no manner of Work,</hi> &amp;c. Where-as all the other Commands, are but one of these wayes set down.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hath the Particularity in it, that all the rest have; to wit, To be in the Singular Number; <hi>Thou shalt,</hi> &amp;c. To shew, That it speaketh to every one in particular: Yea though all the


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55484:135"/>
Commands, concern all Ranks, yet only here, are Son, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Man-Servant, Maid Servant, and Stranger, expresly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as comprehended in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a special Equity, holden out here in the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of this time: There are Six Dayes given us, to Labour on; and therefore it is all the Reason in the World, that the Lord have the Seventh: And if this Concession of God's, of Six Dayes to work on, be Moral (For all the time is God's; and we cannot, for our use, take any part of it, but by His grant; and there is no other Grant: But this dividing and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Time, betwixt him and us; in which Division too, he hath given us by far, the large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Share; to wit, Six parts of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:) Then must the setting a part of a Seventh Day, be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral also: And so the Command it self, wherein both are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, <hi>viz.</hi> The Sixt given to us, and the Seventh reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for him; they must needs stand and fall together: For they Mutually put each other; Thou shalt labour Six Dayes, and Rest on the Seventh; Thou shalt Rest on the Sabbath Day, and Labour Six.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Day is claimed by the Lord, as a thing wherein he hath a special Propriety: It's the <hi>Lords Day</hi>;  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or though he did give <hi>Six,</hi> yet he reserved <hi>a Seventh.</hi> And can, or dare, any say, That he discharged that, or dispensed it away from Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to any other? If not, it must be His still; and cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sacriledge, be other wayes applyed.</p>
               <p>Obedience to this Command, is pressed by an exceeding Weighty Reason, drawen from God's own Example; which maketh it clearly Relative, to it's First Institution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. Where it is said, That He Rested after Six Dayes Work, the Seventh Day; <hi>viz.</hi> the whole Seventh Day, and so should we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the more effectual, for proving the Morality of this Command: Because 1. It's a Reason that took place, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Innocency, and so respecteth no Type or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. 2. It is Universal, belonging to all Men, who are God's Creatures: And therefore, since the Reason is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, so must the Command be like-wise.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This Command alone, and beside all others, is expresly pressed in the observation of it, not only on Masters and Rulers for themseves, but as taking burden on them, for all under


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55484:135"/>
them, and within their Families to endeavour the sanctifying of the Lord's day with them, and by them as well as by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; whereby the extent of this Command is clearly and earnestly holden forth in more express terms, than in any other of all the Commands; though this be implyed in them also.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The observation of it is pressed and encouraged unto, by a special blessing which He hath annexed to the time set a-part by himself; <hi>He blessed it,</hi> that is, He made and still maketh it useful and refreshing as a special blessing to his people who keep his Ordinances, seeking Him therein; this day has a double portion and increase, beside any other day, for his Peoples Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, Edification, Comfort, finding of His Presence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to say now that this Solemn-time were not moral, were to  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ob the Church of a great blessing; seeing this day, set a part by God for his Service, hath the blessing, beyond any other day commanded, on it; and in the experience of his People often hath it been found to be so.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is specially and singularly ushered in with a <hi>M <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mento,</hi> or <hi>Remember,</hi> which is not expressed in any other Command; and, Shall we think, that where God saith <hi>Remember,</hi> there is nothing to be taken notice of; or, shall we think, that it saith not Remember now as well as then; and if so, Who can warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly forget that which he biddeth remember? which is, not to keep the Seventh day, but the <hi>Sabbath</hi> holy unto the Lord: And may not all these Characters, putt together in one Command (so many not being to be found in all the other Commands if put together); May not all these, I say, convince us that it is the Lord's purpose to have this Command standing obligatory in its substance to the end of the world? Which is so pressed, that if there be little help from Nature's light, to determine the day, or to press its observation, it may be strongly born-in, by the more clear and weighty reasons.</p>
               <p>And so we come to the fourth way proposed for making out the morality of this Command, which is by adducing some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from Scripture.</p>
               <p>The first whereof is, If the Law bind under the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only in respect of its matter, as its natural; nor only as it is repeated in the New-Testament, but also by vertue of the Authority enacting it: then this Law of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55484:136"/>
though not explicitly determined by nature, and though it were not mentioned particularly in the New-Testament, must be binding also, for it hath that same Authority: But the first is true, and is acknowledged generally by Divines (excepting a few) and is clear by Christ and his Apostles their citing of it, as supposing it to be binding: Therefore the last must be true also.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> If this Command be founded on moral grounds, then it self must be moral: But the grounds on which it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are moral: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. 1. It is moral that God should have a solemn and chief set-time. 2. That he himself, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should determine that time, seeing no other could do it and bless it. 3. These reasons-in the Command it self dividing time, into six parts of it to us, and a seventh part to God; and God's resting after six days working; with his making only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days in the week, and employing six of them to work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these reasons, I say, are all moral and bin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing now as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg.</hi> If all moral duties be contained in the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, then this Command must needs be moral: But the first is true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. This Command containeth a moral duty, which is in none of the preceding Commands; to wit, the stinting and determining of the solemn and chief time to be set a part for God's worship, to be one day of s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ven. It is true, Time is commanded to be allowed to God's worship in those other Command <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wherein the duties of worship themselves are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; for, worship cannot be performed more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duty, without some time; but that the chief time should be so much, and so often, is only determined in this Command; from which it appeareth, 1. That an indefinit time of worship, or for it, is not the morality of this Command, because this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth necessarily, as being supposed needful for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of every positive duty contained in the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; its morality, therefore, must be, The determining of  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat definit time. 2. We may hence see a reason why there is no new Command for this in the New-Testament; because this standeth in the Law; neither are, <hi>Thou shalt not Swear, Kill,</hi> &amp;c. mentioned as new Commands more than this; so  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat, had they not been mentioned in the New-Testament (as

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg.</hi> If it be not free for men to carve out God's solemn chief time of worship at their pleasure, then is this Command moral (for that liberty is restrained, by this Command and no other): But it is not free for them to choose what time they please, or to carve it out: This seemeth to be only questionable, which is therefore thus confirmed.</p>
               <p>If it be free to men to carve out what solemn and chief time is to be given to, and set a part for God's worship; then, either it is free to them to choose no time at all, or it is free for them to choose a longer or a shorter than this: But neither of these can be said; not the first as is clear; not the second, because it will not so quadrat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, If it be free to men so to cut and carve at pleasure, on the solemn and chief time for God's worship, its either free for all men together to agree on a day, even one and the same; or its free for each Country, or each man, to choose what day they please; but neither of these are either possible or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to edification; therefore must the day be determined to them; and if so, then sure by this Command: And so its still binding, and cannot in that respect be altered without sin, which was the thing to be proved.</p>

The third Command also anent Swearing might be said to be abrogated, because it is not so positively asserted in the New Testament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obj</hi> The Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. &amp; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. seemeth to cast away difference of times, especially of Sabbath-days; which could not be, if this Command were moral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle cannot be understood simply to cast away the observation of all days as a bondage, &amp; so to make all times alike: For 1. That would contradict his own practise, and the practise of the other Apostles: for it is clear that they diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced the first day of the week from other days, and one day.  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> special is called The Lord's-day, which other days of the week are not. 2. If all times be a-like simply, and all making difference be there reproved, then could there be no time set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to be observed by men, to the marring of that indifferency:


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55484:138"/>
and if so, then hath the Christian Church been still in a palpable gross sin; for if the keeping of a day by vertue of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, marr that indifferency, much more will the keeping of a day by mans command, and so there could never be a Sabbath. 3. We must therefore understand these places not as casting all days and times simply, but ceremonial and Jewish days, or days invented by men, because the scope of the places runneth that way, <hi>viz.</hi> against the bringing in of ceremonial worship as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, which while some weak ones, not yet sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, did still practise, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. the Apostle would not have them hastily condemned in Days, more than Meats; yet is there still a difference betwixt Bread and Wine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper and other meats, which this discourse of the Apostle taketh not away; so is it in days. And in these Epistles to the <hi>Galathians</hi> and <hi>Colossians,</hi> he speaketh of days, and not (as would seem of the weekly Sabbath, which is ordinarily call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a day) as taking in all the extraordinary Feasts of the Jews, which is the more probable, because the c <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>remonial Law was pressed on them as still necessary, by false Teachers: or he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of mere Jewish days, and so of the Seventh day which they kept; for it's of such observation of days as was sinful, and brake them off from Grace and the Gospel, as other ceremonies did; that he speaketh of: but that cannot be said of all days, or of keeping one day of seven: Therefore this cannot be meaned there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obj.</hi> The fourth Command precisely commandeth the Seventh day from the Creation to be kept; but that is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; therefore, neither is the Command so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Objection goeth upon that mistake, as if the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Seventh day were still commanded in it, as the main sub <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is a difference to be put betwixt the mandatory part of the Command, and what is further added for pressing the observation of it, or for ex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the close, that, <hi>He Rested the Seventh Day,</hi> but that, <hi>He Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Sabbath</hi>: Drawing it still from the Seventh precisely, to the Sabbath: Even as in the Second Command: This is, 1. commanded in special, that no Image be made, then. 2. This in  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eneral, that all Gods Commandement concerning His Worship, even such as were Ceremonial, for the time, should be observed with, what-ever others should be given: So here this Fourth commandeth expresly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; because the Recurrency of that time is bounded: and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, what-ever Seventh the Lord shall be pleased to pitch on.</p>
               <p>We have said the more on this, because it doth not only clear the true Scope of the Command, but sheweth the necessity of the Observation of that time, which the Lord hath  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We should put a difference also betwixt <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> and <hi>Mutable:</hi> All the Judicial Laws are Mutable; and the Decalogue it self, in respect of it's Curse; and, as it was a Covenant giving Life, is Actually changed and abolished: Yet is not for that to be reputed Ceremonial, and not Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: (Though all Ceremonials be Mutable, yet all Mutables are not Ceremonial.) Besides, this change is not in the matter. Why may not therefore, the Seventh Day in Order, (which was observed from the Creation, to the Resurrection of Christ,) be chainged to the First Day of the Week, which is a Seventh Day in Number still, without abolishing the Morality of the Fourth Command?</p>
               <p>Amongst other things in this Command, there is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press mention, of the whole Families joyning in this Duty, than is in other Commands: Therefore it being a concerning-Duty to us; and a special thing included in the Command; we shall speak to that Point concerning Family Worship, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we speak of the Second General proposed about the Particular Mor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, That, this Command requireth such a Family-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship distinct from publick and secret, and something to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in worshipping of Go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. The thing called for in this Command is certainly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, yea immediate worship; it being a Command of the first Table, and such a thing as the sanctifying of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Command taketh in all Domestick-Relations, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Children, Sons and Daughters, Masters and Servants, Men or VVomen, yea and Strangers that may be for the time, or on that day, sojourning there; these are all constituent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Family.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The thing required of them is not simply rest from labour, for 1. That is commanded for the Beasts (lest men should be hindered from or interrupted in their holy rest by their waiting on them) and none will say, we hope, that there is no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as to Children or Servants, than as to the Beasts. 2. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Negative, Thou shalt do no work, is included the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, Thou shalt san <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tifie that day to the Lord. 3. The same Duty is required of all alike (in some respect) thou Father, and thou Son, thou Master, and thou Servant, and if wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be called for from the Father, and Master, for the sanctifying of that day, so it must be also from the Child and Servant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The manner of performing this Worship of sanctifying the Lords day in Holy duties, is required not only to be in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, nor only in secret, but by the Members of each Family joyntly, and a part from other Families.</p>
               <p>For 1. It cannot be understood to require worship only in publick together, because 1. there may be in some cases no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to publick worship, and yet the Command of sanctifying


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55484:140"/>
the Lords day lyeth still on, and no doubt by Families. 2. Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on publick worship is but one piece of sanctifying the Lords day, and that but in a part of it; therefore there must be some other thing included here. 2. It cannot be understood of the Master of the Family, his putting the Members of the Family separatly to seek and worship God, and of his own going about Holy duties himself a-part.</p>
               <p>For 1. Though that be worship, yet is it not worship from persons in such a Relation or Family-worship, more than if they were not in such a Relation, or of such a Family; and though it might be said that such and such persons sanctified the Sabbath, yet could it not be said that the Family as such did it; even as Families or persons seeking God in secret, could not be exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered thereby, as to their being in the Congregation; nor their serving of God be so accepted as Congregational-service, i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> they met not together when they might: Just so it is here; yea as it lyeth, by this Command, on a Congregation and a Minister to sanctifie the Lords day, and to come together for that end; so doth it lye on the Family and Master of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this Command there is more required than secret o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> solitary sanctifying of the Sabbath, even a peculiar sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it within one Family distinct from another: I say, 1. more than solitary worship, because the Lords saying <hi>thou,</hi> without repeating Son, Daughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had been sufficient to have laid it on all separately for themselves; the enumeration therefore of the whole Members of a Family must import some other thing, for the former is implyed in all Commands, as <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> that is, as far as in thee lyeth, thou nor thy Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There must I say, be somthing more understood by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar enumeration pressed in this fourth Command. I say, 2. Even a peculiar worship, because it's something laid on by this Command which is holden <hi>within Gates</hi> or doors, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goeth to the Congregation, nor to the persons of other Families, at least ordinarily, but reacheth the Members of such a Family who are within such a Mans <hi>Gates</hi> or Doors; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be a distinct Family-worship mainly performed by that Family together.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:55484:141"/>3. The thing required here is not only worship simply, but worship as from a Member of such a Family, therefore it is not solitary worship: for seeking of God and moral duties in secret still agree to persons in all places and Families alike, but this draweth a line as it were betwixt Families, and so  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ivides one Family from another; yet maketh the Duty more obliging to these within such a Mans <hi>Gates</hi> or Doors than others without Doors; therefore it must be joynt-worship: for, a-part, or as concerning secret worship, all are every where alike obliged.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If by this Command something more in the worship of this day be required of a person that is a Member of a Family in reference to that Family, than there is required of one who is not a Member of such a Family, or is required of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in reference to an another Family whereof he is not a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; then it requireth a distinct Family-worship, for no other thing can be understood but a joynt going about the sanctifying of that day in a stricter and nearer way of Communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Members of that Family, than with persons and Families in and to whom they are not so interested and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If secret and publick worship were only required in this Command, then should we equally and alike sanctifie the Lords day with other Families and persons, not of that Family whereof we are Members; for in these we joyn alike for them and with them; but there is some peculiar thing required here which will not agree to be performed by all alike; therefore it is Family-worship that must be here required.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This Command requireth of Masters, (suppose them to be Ministers, or  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Magistrates) another way of Sanctifying the Sabbath, and Worshipping of God, in and with their Families, than it doth in Reference to other Families; the Command being so particular, to him, and to all that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Gates or Doors, and Members of his Family, speaketh this clearly. But except it be joynt going about of Duties with them, there can be no other thing understood to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for, 1. One may exhort another. 2. All come in publick together. 3. By the Masters example after the publick they all


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55484:141"/>
withdraw (or should at least) to secret exercises. 4. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Ministers may Command other Families to Sanctifie that day; What is peculiar then, as to their own Families, but to joyn with them in Duties of Worship?</p>
               <p n="7">7. If there were not Domestick-worship required on this day, then except it were in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> publick, Members of a Family could not converse together; for they cannot converse together in doing their own works, or in speaking their own words, their fellowship therefore must be in exercises of worship, and so that must needs be required in this Command.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Some other thing is required by this Command, of a Member of a Family which seeketh God, than of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in an Heathenish Family; or some other thing is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from so many persons joyned together as Members in one Family, than from such persons suppose them to be scattered from one another, amongst  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eathenish Families; certainly where Husband, Wife, Children and servants are Christians and Professors of the same true Religion, there is some other thing required of them than where only the Husband, the Wife, the child or the servant is so; but if they were scattered and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came parts or Members of diverse Families among Heathens, they would be obliged to seek God a-part; therefore no less, but much more is joynt-seeking of God required of them, when they are united together as Members of one Family.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Command (when it mentioneth <hi>all within his Gates</hi> or Doors) requireth some other thing of a Master when at home with his Family, than when he is withdrawn from them: But a Master at a distance may Command all in his Family to worship God, and pray to God for them, and so may they all if they were scattered, worship God secretly; therefore when they are together, there is some other thing required of them by this Command, which is, no doubt, To worship God together.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Duties that are to be performed on this day will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this; such as, Instructing one another, Exhorting, Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, Comforting, strengthning one another, and talking to, or conferring with one another, of the word, <hi>D <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55484:142"/>
Which cannot be denyed to be Duties called for, on this day; and yet they cannot be done but by joynt concurring together in that work, and therefore it concludeth strongly that Family-worship, at least on the Lords day, is commanded here; and if Families be called to worship God joyntly on the Lords day by the worship competent for that day, then by proportion are they also called to worship him joyntly on other dayes by the worship suitable to them, there being the like ground for all.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And lastly, that which is required of Families, is such a worship as ought to be performed by them, supposing there were no publick worship, nor yet any other Family, worshipping him in the World. So <hi>Joshua</hi> resolveth <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.15. <hi>I a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d my House will serve the Lord,</hi> and Sanctifie His Sabbath (that being a special piece of His service) what-ever ye will do; but if there were no worshipping of God in all the World but in one Family, then ought that worship to be joynt according to that same word of <hi>Joshua</hi>'s, <hi>I and my House,</hi> otherwise we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved to say, that there might be a plurality of worshippers of God in the World, and yet without any joyning together in worship, which were in it self absurd and contrary to <hi>Joshua</hi>'s Religious Resolution.</p>
               <p>It being thus made out by this Command, that there is such a worship as Family-worship, and that it is Commanded, we shall consider in the next place, how the Scriptures do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hold it out.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then consider, that where the Scriptures speak of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Godly-men, they speak of them as making conscience of this, and take notice of their honouring of God in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as a special part of their eminency; So <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Joshua.</hi> 24.15. <hi>Job.</hi> in the first Chapter of his Book, and <hi>David Psal.</hi> 101. are noted; It must then be a commanded and commendable Duty, which is so particularly remarked in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ye will find it almost in all parts of Scripture, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>Joshua.</hi> 24. <hi>Job.</hi> 1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. At the Dedication of <hi>Davids</hi> House, which was not, sure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some peculiar worship and craving of Gods blessing; even


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55484:142"/>
as in other cases, those who had builded Houses were to Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them, or to Consecrate them, and wherefore? because they were hoven in a manner, and as it were offered to the Lord, for seeking and worshipping Him in them: So, Altars, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.84. were said to be Dedicated when they were set a-part for God's service, and Consecrated for that use. So <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> 12.27. the Walls were Dedicated, and the <hi>Levi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es</hi> brought out for that end; which Dedication no doubt had a Religious use: &amp;, Will any think that they began with Prayer or Praise as <hi>David</hi> did, and left off such Exercises afterward? see also 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20. where mention is made of <hi>Davids</hi> blessing his House. <hi>Esther</hi> and the Maids of her House, and the rest of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their several Families, fasted and prayed. We see it spoken of by the Prophets, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. ult. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.12. and that as a Prophesie of the Converts carriage under the New-Testament. We find it also mentioned, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and 5. <hi>v.</hi> 8. and <hi>Titus</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ye will see it thus practised and pressed before the Flood; God was honoured and worshipped in Families after it (before the Law) by <hi>Abraham, Job</hi> and others in their Families; under it, there was the Observation of it, and that by peculiar Ordinances, as namely, by the Passover; yea it is mentioned, and that most expresly in the very Law, as is said; it was kept up under the Captivity, and after the return renewed by <hi>Z <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chariah</hi> especially; yea it is also renued in the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby it appeareth to be of very special Observation; from all which, it is not a little commended to us</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we consider the many wayes whereby the Scriptures press this Duty, it will be found that there is hardly any Duty more cleared and pressed than it. Is pressed: 1. By Command; 2. By Examples of Godly-men held forth as Paterns for Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 3. By Promises made to it, and 4. By Blessings conferred on the conscientious practisers of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>D <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

commending and adorning qualification of persons that have it and scandalous where it is wanting, and as declaring one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for publick charge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>Hence the Argument runneth strong, That duty which in Scripture is commanded, by many examples commended, and by other motives pressed, the neglect whereof bringeth guilt and offence upon the persons neglecting; is no doubt a necessary Duty, but Family-worship is such: therefore it is a necessary duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is commanded, what we have said from this fourth Command may sufficiently make it out, yet we further add, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19. In which two places it is clear that observing of the law, is not only to be studied by a Master of a Family himself alone, but that the Religious duties of frequent speaking of it, diligent teaching of it, whetting and pressing of it on his Famaly, are to be performed by him; yea it is to be written on the posts of his Door, to shew that Religion must be in the Family, &amp; in all that enter into it, even as carrying the word on the frontlets betwixt their eyes was to mind them of the peculiar and particular sanctification that was called for from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is commended by examples is clear in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, who dealeth both with Children and servants in the Family, and that in things concerning the worshipping of God, as well as in things concerning his own particular Affairs; He Circumcised them, and commanded, yea charged them to serve the Lord, which cannot be supposed to have been done without other duties of worship. And in <hi>David</hi>'s 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20. Who when he has been at publick-worship goeth home to bless his Family, which was certainly to go about some Religious duty with them, as he had been doing with the people in the publick; in the one he behaved himself as King, in the other as a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Head of his own Family in particular; and had it been only to pray for them, that might have been done else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where than at home; but it denoteth the changing of publick worship (wherein he had blessed the people as a publick man, as a Prophet and godly King, and had joyned with them <hi>v.</hi> 18.)


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55484:143"/>
into Family duties, wherein he goeth to concur with them; Intimating that a Holy Solemnity should be partly spent in publick, and partly in Family-duties, without neglect of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret duties: beside that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. &amp; <hi>Psal.</hi>  
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>01. it is clear; and appeareth to have been also practised by all that built houses, who did Dedicate them, and that not without Prayer, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by <hi>Davids</hi> Dedication of his, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. as is said. <hi>Job</hi>'s example likewise maketh it out <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. where there are 1 Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in his Family, as well as for his Family. 2. He sendeth to sanctifie them who were absent, that is, to put them in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness for joyning with him in that service with those that were at home, which he needed not to have done had they been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side or present with him: Yea 3. when he cannot do it personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will do it by another, that God may be worshipped by them all, some way together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I say the neglect of it, is sadly threatned as <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> ult. <hi>Pour out thy fury on the Heathen that know thee not, and on the Families which call not on thy name</hi>; If not-worshipping of God in Families, be a Character of a Family appointed to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and be threatned with a Curse, then prayer-worship in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies is a necessary duty; for it's clear from that place, 1. That by calling on Gods Name, is meant Gods worship in general, and prayer in particular, which is a special part of it. 2. That by Families are meant particular Societies and Companies whether lesser or greater that want this worship, and so are the Objects of that Curse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be said, that by Families there, are meant People and Nations, yea (comparing this place with <hi>Psal</hi> 79. <hi>v.</hi> 6.) Heathens that called not on God. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That doth confirm the Argument: for if Heathens, whether Kingdoms or Families be described by this, that they call not on God; then still it must be a Heathenish Kingdom that has not publick worship, a Heathenish person who wanteth  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecret worship, and so a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Family that wanteth Family-worship. 2. The Curse here is not threatned to Families as Families, but as such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles that call not on Gods Name, therefore it reacheth them  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for, <hi>à quatenus ad onine,</hi> &amp;c. So then what-ever profession Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55484:144"/>
have otherwayes, if they want this duty they are thereby laid open to the Curse. 3. It is all one upon the matter whether by Families be meant Societies lesser or greater: for if it be a fault in Nations to neglect Gods worship, and if the neglect thereof bring a Curse on them, will it not be a fault in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Families, and bring a Curse on them?  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Families cannot be excluded, seeing they are expresly named; though more be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, to wit, that the Curse cometh on multitudes of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or upon Nations made up of Families. And we conceive Families to be particularly named, 1. To shew that the Curse will reach all Societies lesser as well as greater, who have this Character. 2. Because Nations are made up of Families, and because there is fitness (to say so) betwixt the carriage of Families in Religious worship, and the carriage of the whole Land. 5. The comparing of <hi>Jeremy</hi> 10. with <hi>Psal.</hi> 79. will not enervate any of the places; but, when put together, they shew that the Holy Ghost doth mean both Families and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and that what is implyed in the one place is expressed in the other, to shew that God will have both publick-worship from whole Kingdoms and Family-worship from particular Families as parts of these Kingdoms. 6. The ground whence the Curse is derived, is because that such a Society neglecteth such a duty, and therefore how-ever we expound the place and the word <hi>Family</hi> there, it will hold of all Societies in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I said that the having of Family-worship is looked upon as a special qualification, and the want of it as a scandal and offence, for 1. Who are to be admitted Elders or Deacons? Is it not such who have this qualification of <hi>Ruling their own Houses well?</hi> 1 Tim. 3. v. 4. Tit. 1.6. (yea even Widows, 1 Tim. 5.10. are to be tryed by this, that <hi>they have brought up Children,</hi> no doubt Christianly and Religiously, which can ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly, if at all be, without worshipping of God with them) 2. If that qualification, to wit, Ruling their own House well, be found to be wanting, they are accounted to be unmeet to rule in Gods House, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>Whence we may reason thus: That which casteth a man as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for bearing Rule in Christs House, how-ever otherwise

                  </gap>ant of Family-worship doth that; therefore the want of it is a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.</p>
               <p>In these places it is clear, 1. That Ruling of their own House is meant not only in outward &amp; temporal things, but also, if not mainly, in what concerneth the honour, service and worship, of worship of God; for 1. it's the Ruling of Servants &amp; Children together, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. Now it is clear that Children are to be brought up in the fear of the Lord. 2. It's a Ruling that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth them as gracious, which no Ruling in temporal things will do; seeing many meere natural men, are wiser in their own Generation that way, than the Children of light. 3. Many much less fit for Ruling in these things, may yet be fit to Rule in Gods House, as experience cleareth. 4. These words, <hi>having Children in subjection in all gravity,</hi> speak out a Christian and Religious Rule and order to be kept in the House or Family in reference to a Religious end, which cannot but take-in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-worship; yet it is also clear, that he meaneth not simply of inability to rule, but mainly of defectiveness in the improving the ability which God had given for Ruling; therefore it is not said here, He that cannot Rule his House (though that be in part truth) but he that doth not Rule; and it is ranked with excessive drinking, striking, pride, and other grosse ills; it having that same effect that they had, to wit, to declare incapacity for such Offices; Hence this is not to be the Rule of tryal, if he can Rule his own house well, as having gifts sitting him for it, but (supposing him to have these) it's to be inquired if he doth actually Rule it well, which is the evidence of the right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of his gifts; therefore here Ruling in the mans own house, and ruling in the Church or House of God, are looked on as two degrees of one thing of the same nature, because both take in not only gifts fitting for the discharge of the duty of this respective ruling it, but conscience and faithfulness in the improving of them. We shall not here to this purpose insist on the frequent mention that is made in the Scripture of Churches being in Families; But shall proceed to add to what we have said, Six or Seven Reasons or grounds that will further prove and clear the thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:55484:145"/>The first is drawn from nature, which teacheth not only that the true God should be alone served and worshipped, but that according to the Stations God hath put men in, they should improve them with their gifts and parts for a higher end than their own behooff or advantage, to wit, His Glory: And that as they have a peculiar fellowship given them by Him as his gift, so He should have answerable and peculiar acknowledgement from them; and therefore seeing the appointment of Families is Gods Ordinance, and that it's he that giveth to some Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants which are with-held from others, there ought in all reason a Tribute to be given to him resulting from that Society and fellowship: hence it was that before the Law the Patriarchs had their worship specially in their Families; yea Heathens, beside their publick Idolatrous worship, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Temples, had their peculiar <hi>Penates</hi> or <hi>Houshold-Gods,</hi> on whom for their particular Families, delivery from Enemies and protection, they depended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second is drawn from the nature of Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion amongst believers, which as it requireth the performing of Christian duties, according as we are in providence called to them, so it requireth the making use of that tye of Family in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest or relation super added to the former for furtherance and entertaining of that Communion, because there is a special ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess ministred by such a Relation to the attaining of that end; Hence it is we conceive (as is said) that some Christian Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are called Churches, because so many Christians casten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lived in a Christian discharge of all Family-Ordinances (so to speak)</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord by His Covenant doth especially (though not alway) derive mercies to Families taking them in together, and making promises to them, and conferring priviledges on them. So <hi>Abrahams</hi> whole Family was taken in Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. And in the New-Testament whole Families were at once Baptized, which certainly calleth them to a peculiar way of being answerable to such priviledges and ingagements: And is not this one special and very proper way of being answerable to them, that they worship God together, and joyn in blessing him for such mercies, and in prayer to Him for grace to carry suitably to them?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:55484:145"/>4. The mutual interest that usually is in the Condition of members of the same family, calleth for joynt-seeking of God, and worshipping of him, as they are joyntly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the same dangers, the same sins often, the same stroaks, the same duties, the same mercies; for what is so to one, is ordinarily some way so to all, therefore ought they to joyn in confessing of sins, acknowledging mercies, deprecating dangers and stro <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks, and discharging of Duties.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Private</hi> Worship is profitable to all the ends of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It's an acknowledging of God and honouring of him, it helpeth the Master to keep his Authority, and maketh every one in their Family to walk the more respectively towards the rest, and it keepeth from many out-breakings, when they are to meet so often together to seek and worship God; hence, in experience, we often see that these families, where religious Worship is, are generally more civil, at least, than other families, where it is not, and that the children and servants of such families readily profit most, are most coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by Gods blessing, and are in greatest capacity to get good of the publick Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Lord loveth to have a distinction betwixt these that serve him, and these that serve him not: Now as to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily relation, what difference is there betwixt a professing Christian fam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly, where the joynt worship of God is not, and a Heathenish family? Heathens live and eat and work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and when no more is seen, they look very like the one to the other. Even as in a Nation where no publick Worship is, though private persons privately seek God, yet there seemeth to be no publick National difference betwixt that Nation and a Heathen Nation; so in the former case a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-difference will hardly be found, if any should inquire of what sort of families these are.</p>
               <p>Add that it will be hard to say that a man should take care of the outward Estate of his family, and neglect the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and keep Communion with his family in temporal things, and none in spiritual Duties, yea doubtless he should be much more in these, as being both more necessary and more excellent.</p>
               <p>Having first shewed that this fourth command holdeth


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55484:146"/>
forth a family Worship, and having secondly confirmed it more largely from other scriptures and grounds of reason, it followeth now according to the method proposed, that we shew in the third place, how particularly the Scripture descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth wherein it doth consist, whereby it will further appear to be of God. The Scripture describeth it four wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general it is called in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Josua</hi>'s Case, <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way of the Lord, serving the Lord,</hi> very comprehensive expressions, taking in much, and here it's <hi>sanctifying of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> that is, performing of the duties which are to be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the right sanctifying of that day; we conceive it to be in short, to do these things in a joynt family-way, which a Servant of God may, and ought to do, alone, that is, to pray, read, sing Psalms, &amp;c. or to do in a domestick way, what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in providence cast together may do, as to pray, read, further one anothers edification by repeating of Sermons, spiritual conference, instruction, exhortation, admonition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they have their tye of Christianity, and this of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-relation beside, which doth not abrogate the former, nor derogate from it, but doth further corroborate and add more strength to it, as to make it more necessary and less elective, more frequent and less occasional, and to be now by domestick rules authoritatively regular for edification, which cannot so be by the simple tye of Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It speaketh of particular duties, wherein they should joyn, as 1. Here of sanctifying the Sabbath in all the duties of it, adding more to our family-worship that day than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayes, as well as to our secret worship, for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was to have its double offering. 2. Of praying <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> which is necessarily included in that mourning, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. <hi>a fruit of the poured out spirit of Grace and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi> so 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. <hi>Davids</hi> blessing his family is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of his going before them in prayer to God for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on them, not in common as a publick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prophet, which he did with the People, but as a peculiar duty discharged by him to his family, whereof he was head. 3. Of Family fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, or setting of time apart in the family extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Fasting and Prayer, as in <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. in that solemn


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55484:146"/>
mourning, and in <hi>Esther</hi> 4. where it is recorded, that she and her Maids (who were her family) and all the Jews at <hi>Shusan</hi> (who yet could not have in that place a publick fast) did go about that duty. 4. Of Instruction, a most necessary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to instruct and teach the family the knowledg of God; the command goeth expresly on this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7, 8, and 11.19, 20. where we are commanded to talk of the Law within the house, to teach it our Children diligently, or (as the word is) to whet it on them by catechising, and to write on the posts of our doors and on the walls of the house, for what end I pray? Sure for this very end, that the house might have the means of knowledg in it, and that the knowledg of Gods Law might be taught and learned in it, and will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think that the walls should teach and the Master be silent? Especially, seeing it is for the families behoof, that these things were written: What if some in the Family could not read? Which on several accounts might be, then it would follow that they were lost, if there were no more nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teaching then what was by writing on the walls; when <hi>Abraham</hi> commanded his house to keep the way of the Lord, and to serve him, will any think he did not teach them, who he was, and how he should be served? By proportion other things fit for edification, and as Worship to God, come in here, particularly praise, as appeareth by the 30 <hi>Psal.</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled a <hi>Psalm or Song at the Dedication of Davids house.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture speaketh of, and holdeth out the duty of the particular members of the family, and that in reference to the stations they are in, and the relations they sustain and stand under, as of Husband and Wife, that they live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Heirs of the grace of life, and so as their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may not be hindred; of parents, that they do not only provide for their children temporal things, but that they also bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. and 12. both children and servants are put in together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture speaketh of ordering of families by a special Family-Discipline and Authority, therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Abraham, commanding or charging his Servants to keep the way of the Lord,</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>a ruling of their own house well,</hi>

with some resemblance unto ruling in the Church by Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Discipline, with which it is some way compared, as having a fitness, or as being an evidence of fitness, for that</p>
               <p>This Discipline consisteth especially in these three, 1. in making good domestick Laws for children and servants in ordering every thing aright, that concerneth the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Godliness and edification amongst them, and in timing of things rightly so as every duty that is to be done in the family, may be done in the beautiful season of it, 2.

               <p>If it be asked here, on whom doth the burden of dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging duties in the family especially lye, and what is to be thought of <hi>Chaplains?</hi>

               <p>From what hath been said, Family-worship appeareth to be so convincingly clear, necessary and important a duty, that any Objections or Scruples, that can be moved against it, must needs be but of little weight and importance, and may be easily solved and satisfied: It will not therefore be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to condescend particularly on them: And as for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that wait on the conscientious and su <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what can one Minister do as to this alone in a numerous Congregation, if all, or most, Masters of Families be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, who yet must answer to God for the Souls of their Children and Servants, as well as the Minister must for the Souls of all under his Charge; these being under their Charge, as well as the other are under his, as is clear, from this same Command. 5. It very much furthers through Gods blessing all the Family for profiting by the Ministry of the Word, and for joyning in publick duties of Worship, as is obvious. 6. It procureth, or at least, is a fit, hopeful and promising mean for procuring a sutable Discharge of all sorts of Duties, called for from the several Members of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their respective Capacities. 7. It is notably contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive, through Gods blessing, for preventing many publick scandals in the Church, whereby the Name of God is much dishonoured, and the Profession thereof disgraced. 8.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Remembring</hi> may import this, that the Sabbath even when it is past, should not be soon forgotten, but that we should look on the Sabbath past to remember it, lest by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the fruits of it, vvhen it is by, we make our selves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prophaning it.</p>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55484:149"/>
other times and rests are drawn after worship, this time and rest draweth Worship necessarily after it; hence it was that only the Jews feasts were called Sabbaths, I mean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Sabbaths, not civil or politick, as their years were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they included a rest upon Destination to an holy Use.</p>
               <p>That which is mainly questionable here is concerning the day, expressed in this Command, concerning which may be asked, 1. What sort of day, or the <hi>quamdiu.</hi> 2. How often, or the <hi>quoties.</hi> 3. What day of the seven or the <hi>quando.</hi> 4. When we are to reckon its beginning.</p>
               <p>For Answer to the first we say, There are two sorts of dayes mentioned in the Scripture, one is Artificial of twelve hours, so the Jews divided their day, making their hours lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or shorter as the day was long or short, but they kept up the number of their hours alway; the other is a natural day, which is a seventh part of the Week, and containeth twenty four hours, taking in so much time as interveneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Suns begining to ascend, after midnight, the noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Solstice, till it pass the Meridional altitude, which is the Suns Vertical point for that day, till it come to that same very point of Midnight again, which is the Suns natural course every twenty four hours, comprehending both the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial day, which is from midnight to midday, and the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial night also, which is from midday to midnight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>The day mentioned here is the natural day, because it's a seventh day, proportionable to each of the six dayes, given unto us, and they with the seventh making up the Week, it must contain as many hours as any of the rest doth; but <hi>the six dayes wherein God made Heaven and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. are natural days; therefore the seventh, to wit, the day of rest, must be so also.</p>
               <p>Let us only for further clearing and for directing our own Practise speak here a word or two more, 1. We say it is a whole natural day, that is, as it's usually employed by us on any of the six Dayes for our own Works, that as we spend so much time in our ordinary Callings on other dayes, so would we employ so much in Gods Worship secret, private, and publick on that day; what proportion of time we use


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55484:150"/>
to give, or may and should give ordinarily to our Callings on other dayes, we would give as much to God and his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to our Souls, and our spiritual state on the Lords day or Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Therefore 2. there is not to be understood here a rigid pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of all these hours to be spent in Duties of immediate Worship, but our Working and Waking time, having a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our infirmities, and also to our Duties, lest under pretext of infirmity we incroach upon Gods day, and give him less then we give to our selves, or should and may give him: And so in Scripture they accompted, what is betwixt rising and going to bed, as still the Work of one day, or one dayes Work; for as God in conceding six dayes to us, hath yet so done it, as there may be a Reserve of particular times for Worship called for from us to him every day, for keeping up our Communion with him; so on the seventh day doth the Lord allow so much conveniency of sleep and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing, as may be subservient for the main end of the day, these being Works of mercy and necessity, which Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on the Sabbath, which was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet care would be had lest under pretext of these we exceed, and apply too much of what is the Lords unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily for our selves and on our lusts; and if we will wake for ordinary business, and keep upon such and such a Dyet, other Dayes, yea if we might do it, or others no more strong then we, do it, the pretence of infirmity will not excuse u <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally seeing hardly it can be often instanced, that timeous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at Gods Work in that day, or earnestness and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in it, hath proved hurtful, which we may account as a part of Gods blessing on the seventh day, that less meat and sleep may be as refreshful as more at another time; thus much for the <hi>quamdiu</hi> or the Continuance of the day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be inquired how often by vertue of this command that day doth recur? if it be one of seven? or, if it be the very seventh? And so if this day be to be taken definite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the very seventh day after the Creation, or indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for one day of seven, as the Lord should other wayes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or had elsewhere determined; astricting then to a day,


<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55484:150"/>
but not any particular day by vertue of this command, but to such a day as was formerly described or prescribed from the beginning, during the Jewish State, and to such another day as God should after Christs coming reveal unto them, and pitch upon for his service? for taking it for granted, that a Seventh day as moral is commanded, it followeth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, whether it be the Seventh in number, that is, one of seven, or the seventh in order, that is, the Seventh day?</p>
               <p>For answering this we would premit, 1. That there is a great difference betwixt these two; the one, to wit, that there be a Seventh doth concern the matter and substance of piety; the other, to wit, which of these Seven it be, is more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial and is alike, if it be appointed by God, and have the blessing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is usual for God in his commands concerning worship, not at first to express a particular definitely, but to deliver it in the bosome of a general indefinitely, mediately, and by clear consequence, as it were several <hi>Species</hi> under one <hi>Genus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for instance, 1. when <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5. he commandeth his people to offer their Sacrifices in the place which he should choose, here there is a stinting or astricting of them to the place which God should reveal unto them; this before the Temple was built, tyed them to the Ark, and sometimes to one place, and sometimes to another, as it was removed and placed, till it was brought to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; but after the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was built and chosen for the place, it astricted men to that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea when the Temple is destroyed, and Christ come, it astrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men to no place by another, but it obligeth men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God every where in spirit and truth: It's true, this is a Ceremonial precept, and will not hold in all things, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to its abolition, yet while it stood by a positive Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Precept, it sheweth that God may command a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as one day of seven, and yet not instantly so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but that one and the same command may inforce to diverse dayes at diverse times, upon supposition o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Gods manifesting his mind, even as by one command men were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted successively to diverse places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See it instanced in the second Command, wherein God


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55484:151"/>
requireth such a worship, as he himself should prescribe, which is the moral affirmative part of it, and dischargeth all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship by Images, that is, its moral negative part thereof; by vertue whereof Believers were then tyed, to offer Sacrifices, to Circumcise, to keep the Passover, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now Believers are tyed to Baptize, to celebrate the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet by vertue of one and the same command: so here, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which requires the Seventh day from the Jews, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the First day from us Christians, for the Sabbath, because these particulars are not expresly, directly, and immediately called for by these commands, but indirectly and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; yet this second command tyed the <hi>Jews</hi> to abstain from blood, and to circumcise, before the ceremonial Law was added to them, because these commands were formerly revealed to them, but it tyed them to these accidentally (to say so) and by consequence only, even so we say of the fourth command as to the Seventh day, it being instituted before: consider for this <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.26. where six dayes for gathering of Manna, and a seventh for rest, are spoken of.</p>
               <p>A third Instance is in Tithes, which was the Lords requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a part of their Means or Substance, as this was a part of their time; he there required the tenth part of their increase, as here he doth the seventh part of their time; yet God in proportioning their estates, did not particularly limit to any exact and precise order, but as to this proportion of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states whatever they were; so we say here, had not the day been determined otherwayes then by this command, it would not have implyed any particular definite day of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We premit, that though the Seventh day be called mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as is expressed in the command, or understood, yet it is but moral-positive, and so alterable at the will of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and therefore the question would not be much different, if acknowledging the Seventh day to be commanded to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as one of seven, we yet asserted the seventh to be discharged, and one of seven to be still retained, for so one of seven would be binding now, and not the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet lest we should seem to admit somewhat changeable


<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55484:151"/>
in the very command it self precisely considered, we would put difference betwixt the commanding part of the Law, and its explicatory part; the command may be moral and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, although some things in reasons and motives were not so; as in the preface which inforceth all the commands, and in the promise annexed to the fifth, there was somthing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to that people, yet cannot we cast off all because of that; suppose there had no more been in this fourth command, but <hi>remember the day of rest to keep it holy,</hi> that would not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Seventh day, though we think the <hi>Jews,</hi> because of its former sanctification, would have been obliged to keep that day by vertue of this command: And suppose that in the explications or reasons there may be something added peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to that people (which cannot be a Seventh day, but at the most (if any thing) the Seventh day) yet that which is in the commanding part, will still stand moral, to wit, that the day of rest should be remembred; and if it can be made out that it was determined to the <hi>Jews</hi> to sanctifie the Seventh day (though it were in the reasons added) and to us afterward to sanctifie the First day, they will be both found to be a Seventh day, and a day of rest, and therefore to be remembred and to be sanctified; this would resolve into the same thing on the matter; yet we conceive it safest to assert that in this command God hath set apart a Seventh day to himself, which is to be sanctified by us, by our application of it to holy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but doth not by it expresly, directly, and primarily bind to the Seventh day, but secondarily and by consequence, to wit, as it was otherwayes before declared by him, and so it bindeth now that same way to the sanctifying of the First day of the week, as being now revealed by God, just as in the former instances or examples we touched upon.</p>
               <p>That a Seventh day (whatever it be which is chosen of God) and not the Seventh day in order, is to be sanctified by vertue of this command, as injoyning that, as the substance and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, may be made out by these Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That which is the substance of this command is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and bindeth perpetually, as we have formerly proved (for if its substance be not moral, then it self is not so either) but that a Seventh day should be sanctified hath been maintained


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55484:152"/>
in the Church by the Apostles in their retaining the First day of the week, while the Seventh hath been laid by and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver used; therefore it was not the Seventh, but a Seventh day which was primarily commanded in this command; so that no particular day is instituted here more then any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive service is prescribed in the second command; yet the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of what was prescribed, or should be prescribed, was included. Even so it is here in reference to that day; and as we may inferr that the second command injoyned not such and such ordinances primarily, because they are abolished; and that such as were negative or prohibited, as not making of Images, are moral, because they are continued, and Images are to be rejected; just so may we conclude that a Sev <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nth day here was primarily commanded, and is moral because it it is continued, and that the Seventh was not so commanded, because it is rejected and laid aside.</p>
               <p>This Argument especially made out in the designation of the Lords day will prove this, for if that Seventh day was the substance of this command, then either it is to be continued as moral, which were against the current of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein, as Christ hath set forth different ordinances, so a different chief solemn time for worship; or we must say that this fourth command belongeth not to us at all, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof we have made out: It must then follow, that it was not the Seventh day, but a Seventh day which this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand respecteth, which therefore belongeth to us, as it did to the Jews, as well as any other command (and particularly the second command) doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If God hath put a difference some way betwixt the Sabbath commanded here, and the day of his own rest, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, then it would seem it's not that day which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: But he hath put a difference, first, in the mandatory part, <hi>Remember</hi>; what? not the Seventh day, but the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, or day of rest: 2. In the blessing, it is not said, he <hi>blessed the Seventh day,</hi> but <hi>the Sabbath</hi>; therefore is that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence so palpable, as being specially intended; whereas if the scope of the comm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd were only the Seventh day, it had been much more clear to have set it down otherwayes; and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther probable reason of the difference can be given.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:55484:152"/>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Either a Seventh day is commanded primarily, and then the Seventh but secondarily and consequentially, or the Seventh was commanded the Jews primarily, and one of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but consequentially (for both were commanded to them) and the first, to wit, the Seventh as being in use before. But it cannot be said that the Seventh day was primarily command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and one of Seven consequentially only, because the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is first commanded, and then the particular; as when God required Tithes of Increase and Cattle, by the command of Tithes he first required the proportion, and then what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proportion as to order, he himself should carve out to them; and so consequently came in the tenth Beast (which passed under the rod) by a particular command, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.32, 33. because there God determined; but if that tenth had not been set down, the general command had but determined upon the tenth of Cattle, as of Sheaves, or bolls of Corn, even so it is as to the day, the command requireth one of Seven pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily; but that it is this Seventh, followeth from another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If the moral grounds and reasons which press this command do most directly respect a Seventh day, and not the Seventh; then it's not the Seventh day, but a Seventh day, which is primarily commanded in it (for the reasons bear out especially what is moral in it, and principally intended) but the moral reasons pressing it plead more strongly and directly for a Seventh day, and but indirectly for the Seventh day as it was then instituted; <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> That the reasons do direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly press a Seventh day, and in a manner stick closely to it, may thus be made out.</p>
               <p n="1">1.  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the reasons equally press on us the First day and the observation of it (supposing it now to be observed according to Divine warrant) then they do not primarily press the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; but the reasons equally press on us the First day, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, &amp;c.</hi> the major is clear, for the same thing cannot press two different dayes primarily nor equally; that the reasons concern us as well as them upon the supposition aforesaid, may thus appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are universal, and do not belong to that people more then any other, for the concession of Six dayes is


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55484:153"/>
to all, and Gods example of resting, concerneth all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the breaking of that command be equally sinful to us with them, and strike against the equity of the command, and Gods example in us as well as in them, then these reasons concern us also, and us as well as them: Now that they do so, and agredge the sin of prophaning our Lords day as they did the sin of prophaning their Sabbath, we must either grant, or we must deny that they concern us at all: Beside the weight of a challenge from the conscience by vertue of them, will put a tender heart out of question of it, seeing God giveth us Six dayes to our selves, as he did to them, and his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proposed to us ought to be respected by us, as well as by them, and the same general equity is in both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the reasons be a sufficient ground of allowance to us for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Six working dayes together, even the last Six of the week, as they were to them for the first Six; then they determine not the Seventh day to be the day of rest primarily, but a Seventh following these Six of labour; but they do allow us warrantably to work Six dayes, even the last Six of the week, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they do not determine the Seventh day primarily; the connexion of the major seemeth to be very clear: For first, these must stand and fall together, if the concession (to call it so) concern us in the Six working dayes, so must the reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a Seventh. 2. As the concession concerneth us in the Six working dayes, so must the prohibition of work on a Seventh of rest, for the one determineth the other, if the concession be for Six in number, so must the prohibition be for a Seventh in number; but if the concession be of Six in order, then it is the Seventh that is to be reserved, and if the Seventh be related to in the prohibition of work, then the concession must look to the first Six dayes, which it doth not, as we have shewed. And therefore 3. seeing the Six dayes concession looketh to Six in number, so many thou mayest or shalt work together, and no more, the prohibition must also respect the number, to wit, a Seventh, and not the Seventh day: the minor will be clear to the Judicious considerer, by a particular application of the reasons of the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>Further, if the concession respect not the number, but the


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55484:153"/>
order (as it must, if the prohibition of work on the Seventh respect the order and not the number) then 1. what warrant have we for our Six work dayes? if it be not here, where is it? for sure we cannot take Gods time without his order and warrant: 2. and more especially, then could not we by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this command plead allowance for working Six dayes different from the first Six; if so, we would not be astricted by the command to sanctifie one (seeing the one inferreth and determineth the other, and they must go together) which were absurd.</p>
               <p>Yet again it may be made out that the reasons press a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and not the Seventh, by considering the words and force of the consequence in both.</p>
               <p>The first reason is, <hi>Six dayes shalt thou labour, but the Seventh is the Lords.</hi> 1. It sayeth not, take the first Six, but of Seven take Six to labour, and give the Lord the Seventh, for he has reserved it to himself. 2. The same equity is in the inference for a Seventh, that is, for the Seventh, if not more; he has given thee Six, therefore give thou him a Seventh, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude more formally then give him the Seventh; a Seventh is the seventh part of time as well as the Seventh, which is the equity the command goeth on. 3. Had the command intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inferr the Seventh primarily, it would have been more clearly expressed thus, he hath given thee the first six, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give thou him the Seventh.</p>
               <p>The second reason from Gods example inferreth the same, he wrought Six and rested the Seventh, do thou so likewise, and so these that work Six and rest a Seventh (as we now do) follow Gods example, as well as they that wrought Six and rested the Seventh did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If the positive part of the command must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the negative, <hi>&amp; contra,</hi> then it concerneth one of Seven, and not the Seventh: But the first is true, 1. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive part commandeth a day without respect to its order, therefore the negative doth so. 2. The negative is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved thus, ye shall not work above Six, not thus, ye shall not work above the first Six, as the event cleareth. 3. If it be not the first Six, but Six, that is, in the concession, then it is not the Seventh, but a Seventh, that is in


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55484:154"/>
the inhibition, but the first is clear, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If this command, for the substance of it, concern us, as being moral, and bind us to the First day, and the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of it equally, as it obliged the Jews to the Seventh; then it's one day of Seven and not the Seventh, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended primarily by it; But it bindeth us to the First, <hi>Ergo,</hi> That it's moral, and bindeth us now, is cleared.

If the prophaning of the Sabbath be forbidden on this ground, because it is the Lords (as it is in this command) then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of the Lords day is equally forbidden in it, because it's the Lords, and is now appropriated to him according to his own will. 4. The Testimony of mens Consciences, and the constant challenges of all (when tender) as being guilty of breaking this command whenever they prophane the Lords day, do convincingly hold forth that this command concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, and are as so many witnesses of it; and consequently prove that it is not the Seventh day, but a Seventh day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instituted, or to be instituted by God, which is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, and primarily commanded in it; for it's never counted a breach of this command to neglect to sanctifie the Seventh day, neither do the Consciences of well-informed Christi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In sum, suppose now the first day being instituted, that the command were to sanctifie the Sabbath, we would understand it of the First day, because it's already instituted; and the s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But here it may be objected, 1. The Jews kept the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Not by vertue of this command, but by its prior institution, even as they were obliged to S <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>crifices and Circumcision by the second command, though they were not particularly named in it. 2. So we are obliged to the keeping of the First day of the week by this fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; yet it followeth not, therefore this is expresly commanded in it, there being indeed no particular day pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily at least instituted in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be objected, But God rested the Seventh day? <hi>Answ.</hi> Gods rest is not principally proposed as the reason of that Seventh day, but that he rested one day, after six im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the works of Creation. It's to inferr the number, not the order, otherwaies it would not concern us. 2. The Seventh relateth not to the order of the dayes of the week, one, two, three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it's called the Seventh with respect to the former Six of work.</p>

               <p>It remaineth here to be inquired what is the beginning of the sancti <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ication of this day (which belongeth to the <hi>quando</hi>) or wherefrom we are to reckon it, seeing it's granted by all to be a natural day; Now it is questioned mainly, whether its beginning is to be reckoned from evening about Sun-set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or darkness, to Sun-setting the next day, or if it be to be reckoned from morning, that is (as we fix it) when the Sun beginneth to ascend towards us after midnight, which is morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing largely taken, as it's evening largely taken, when the Sun beginneth to decline after mid-day.</p>
               <p>In this debate then, we take morning and evening largely,


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55484:155"/>
as they divide the whole natural day, so the morning is from twelve at night to twelve in the day, and the evening from twelve in the day to twelve at night: And it must be so here, for 1. <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 1. divideth the natural day in morning and evening, which two put together, make up the whole day; and these Six days, made up each of them of morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, are natural dayes, the whole week being divided in Seven of them: and that reckoning from Gods example is no doubt proposed for our Imitation in this. Hence the morning watch was before day, and the morning Sacrifice about nine of the clock, so the evening sacrifice was about three in the afternoon, and the evening watch about nine at night. 2. It is granted by all, and is clear from this command, that as we account the Six working dayes of the week, so must we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Seventh, for one must begin where another end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and if one of them begin at the evening or morning, all the rest must do so likewise. 3. We suppose the sanctifying of the ordinary Sabbath was from morning to evening, I say of the ordinary Sabbath; because for extraordinary Sabbaths, as of the <hi>Passover, Exod.</hi> 12. and of the <hi>Atonement, Levit.</hi> 23. there were special reasons; and though otherwayes they were to be sanctified as Sabbaths, yet that they were to begin in the evening before, was added as a special solemnity of these solemn times, and therefore the example or instance of these will not be concludent here to the prejudice of what we assert, but rather, to the contrary, seeing there is a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of them from the ordinary rule, and the particular intimation of their beginning in the evening, will rather confirm our assertion, that the ordinary Sabbaths did begin in the morning. 4. It's not questioned, if on the evening before, people should be preparing for the Sabbath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we said that this is included in the word <hi>remember</hi>; but if we speak of the Sabbath to begin at the evening before, then it will be comprehended as a part of the very day, and so it will conclude the work or observation of the day to close at the next evening.</p>
               <p>We conceive, especially to us Christians, the day is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the morning, as is said, and to continue till the next morning, for which we reason thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:55484:155"/>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. As other dayes begin, or as dayes began at the first, so must this, but dayes ordinarily begin in the morning, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the first Six of <hi>Moses</hi>'s reckoning begin so, then this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth so also, but they do begin so, which may be cleared from <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. where the evening and the morning make the First day after the Creation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there the morning and the evening do fully divide the natural day, then the morning must go before the evening, every morning being for its own evening: But they do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the natural day, all being comprehended under Six days, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> the consequence is clear, to natural sense, for the forenoon, which is the morning must be before the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, which is the evening; the ascending of the Sun is sure before its declining, and seeing the morning natural (to speak so) of the natural day, is from the twelfth hour at night, this must be the beginning of the day.</p>
               <p>Again, the question then, being only, whether to reckon the evening or the morning first; it would seem necessary to reckon the morning first; for if the evening be first, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening must either be, 1. the evening of a day preceding morning, seeing every evening supposeth a morning to go before it in proper speech (and I suppose the History of the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. is not set down in metaphorical termes;) or 2. it must be an evening without a morning, and that in proper speech (here used) is absurd, and seems also to be as impossible i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> nature, to wit, that there should be a consequent and posterior evening or afternoon, without a preceding morning or forenoon, as that there should be an effect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cause; or 3. it must be the evening following its own morning, and so that morning must be last preceding the first evening recorded <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>the evening and the morning were the first day,</hi> which to affirm would not only be absurd, but would also manifestly fasten the loss of a dayes time on the Scriptures calculation: and it seemeth hard in all speech and Scripture-phrase, to put the evening before its own morning, seeing there must be both morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in each day; neither doth the Scripture speak any way of evening, but when it's drawing towards night, which


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55484:156"/>
still supposeth the morning of that same day to be passed, or else we must divide the day in the middle of the Artificial day, and make the Natural day begin at twelve of the noon day, which will be as much against the Scripture phrase, that reckoneth still the whole Artificial day as belonging to one Natural day, the Artificial day and night being the two parts of one whole natural day.</p>
               <p>All the force of the opposite reason is this, the evening is first named, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is first. <hi>Answ. Moses</hi> his scope is not to shew what part of one day is before another, but to divide one day from another, and to shew what goeth to make a whole day, to wit, an evening and a morning, not a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, but an evening added to the morning which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, that made the first, second, third day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as one would reckon thus, there is a whole day, because there is both evening and morning; In this account it's most sutable to begin with the evening, because it presupposeth the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being added to it, cannot but be a day, whereas it is not so proper to say morning with the evening, as evening now added to its morning compleateth the first day, and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now being past as the morning before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God did put a period by and with the evening to the First day, it being the evening that compleateth the day, and divideth it from the following day, and not the morning: as one would say, the afternoon with the forenoon maketh a compleat day, and the afternoon or evening is first named, because 1. the day is not compleat without it, seeing it compleateth it; 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the day cannot be extended beyond it, now the first day is closed, because the evening of it is come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. What time of the day God began his rest, we must begin ours, but he began his in the morning of the Seventh day, the Artificial night having intervened betwixt that and the Sixth, which is clear; for 1. Gods resting this day is more then his resting in the other nights of the Six dayes, it being granted by all, that he made nothing in the night. 2. There had not otherwise been any intermission betwixt his labour and his rest, which is yet supposed by distinguishing the dayes.</p>
               <p>Again, if by vertue of the command of a day to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55484:156"/>
we should begin the night or the evening before, then, these two or three absurdities would follow, 1. Then we would confound the preparation by the word <hi>remember,</hi> and the day together. 2. Then we <hi>Christians</hi> might also, by vertue of the concession of Six dayes for work, begin to work the night before Monday, as the <hi>Jews</hi> on this suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might have begun their work the night before Sunday. 3. Then we were almost no sooner to begin the sanctifying of the day, then to break it off for rest, and when its san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is closed, as soon to fall to our ordinary Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>

                  </gap>. If by this command a whole Natural day is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for duties of Worship, as another day is employed in our ordinary Callings, then is it to begin in the morning, the antecedent will not be denied, the consequent is thus made good; if men account all the labour of their working time from one nights rest to another, to belong to one day, then must they begin in the morning, or else they must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vvhat they vvork after the first evening to belong to another day, but that vvay of reckoning vvas never heard of, the tvvelth hour belonging to that same day vvith the first hour.</p>
               <p>Again, if by this command a vvhole Artificial day toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (that is, our vvaking and vvorking time betvvixt tvvo nights)  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e to be employed for Gods vvorship, then its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning must be in the morning, for if the latter or follovving evening belong to this Natural day before sleeping time come on, then the even before cannot belong to it, for it cannot have both; but by this command a vvhole vvaking day, or an Artificial day is to be sanctified together, and the even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it before vvaking time end as vvell as the morning: Therefore it must begin in the morning, and not on the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before.</p>
               <p>Further, if by vertue of the concession of Six vvorking dayes vve m <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y not vvork the evening after; then the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth in the morning, for the vveek day follovving must begin as the Sabbath did; but the former is true, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> These things vvill make out the minor, 1. It can hardly be thought consistent vvith this command to vvork immediately,


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55484:157"/>
when it groweth dark before folks rest. 2. It's said <hi>Luke</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 56. and 24. <hi>v.</hi> 1. of the women that stayed from the grave till the first day of the week, that they rested according to the commandement on the Sabbath day, and early in the morning came to the Sepulchre. 3. Because Christ account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a whole Natural day that which lasteth till men cannot work. 4. Gods working dayes (to say so) were such, he made not any thing in the evening before the First day. 5. The ordinary phrase, <hi>To morrow is the holy Sabbath, Exod.</hi> 16.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> sheweth that the day present will last till to morrow come, and to morrow is ever by an intervening night: So if on the forbidden day men may not work till to morrow, then that evening belongeth to it by this command, and if on the Sixth day the Seventh be not come till to morrow, that is, after the night intervene, then it doth not begin at even, but so it is in these places and phrases.</p>
               <p>Yet again; it's clear that in all the examples of ordinary Sabbaths keeping and sanctifying in Scripture, they began in the morning: For instance, it is said, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.27. <hi>Some of the people went out to gather on the Seventh day,</hi> no doubt in the morning, for they knew well there was none of it to be found any day after the Suns waxing hot; they might have dressed of it the night before, and not been quarrelled with, they being forbidden gathering of the Sabbath: the proofs of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Argument give light to this also.</p>
               <p>There are yet two Arguments to be added, which do espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially belong to us Christians, for clearing the beginning of our Lords day to be in the morning; the first is taken from Christs Resurrection thus:</p>
               <p>That day, and that time of the day, ought to be our Sabbath, and the beginning of it when the Lord began to rest after finishing the work of Redemption, and arose; but that was the First day in the week, in the morning, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> This bindeth us strongly who take that day on which he arose to be our Christian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>The second is taken from the History of Christs Passion and Resurrection together, wherein these things to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose are observable; 1. That he was laid in the Grave on Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes night, being the preparation to the great Sabbath, which


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55484:157"/>
followed: 2. That the Women who rested and came not to the grave till Sunday Morning (to use our known names) are said to rest according to the Commandement, as if coming sooner, had not been resting according to it. 3. That his lying in the Grave must be accounted to be some time before the Fryday ended, otherwaies he could not have been three dayes in the Grave, and therefore a part of Frydays night is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to the first day, then the whole Sabbath or Saturday is the second, and lastly a part of the night, to wit, from twelve a clock at night, belonging to the First day or Sunday, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the third, and so he arose that morning, while it was yet dark, at which time, or thereabouts, the Women came to the Grave, as soon as they could for the Sabbath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Sabbath Seventh day ended then, and the first day Sabbath began.</p>
               <p>We now come to the third general question concerning the change, to wit, the change of the Seventh day into the First day of the Week; where first, we shall sum up what is moral in this command, and then secondly by some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions clear the change and its consistency with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>To the first then, this command doth morally and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally oblige to these:  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. That there be a solemn time set apart and observed for Worship: 2. That this should be one day of Seven: 3. That it should be such a day, the very day, which God commandeth, the Sabbath of his appointment, whatever day it should be: 4. That it be a whole natural day of twenty four hours, yet having an Artificial day together undivided: 5. That six, and no more but six, working dayes intervene, and that these be together in a Week; and therefore 6. That the Sabbath be a bounding day, dividing one working Week from another; if then six working days must be in one week, and go together, this will follow also, that the Sabbath must be the first or last day of the Seven.</p>
               <p>As for the Propositions clearing the change and consistency of it with this command, the first shall be this.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath may be changed from the last or Seventh day to the First day of the week without any derogation to this command or inconsistency with it; for all that is moral in it,


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55484:158"/>
to wit, a day, and one day of Seven, and a bounding Seventh day, leaving six for work together, remaining untouched by the change: beside, the Seventh day not having its Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this command expresly and directly, but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally (the particular day whether the Jews Seventh day, or the Christians First day of the week being supposed by the fourth Commandement as instituted, or to be instituted else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) as is said, and it's first Institution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. being only a positive and temporary Law, may be therefore changed, and yet the fourth Commandement keept intire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we need not insist in further prosecution of this Proposition, much being spoken to it on the matter already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Propos.</hi> Not only may the Seventh be altered from what it was under the Law to another Seventh day under the Gospel, but it is meet and convenient from good reasons (even in the Command) that it should be so.</p>
               <p>For 1. If these two ages, before Christ, and after him, be looked on as diverse worlds, and if the Redemption by Christ at his coming be accounted the making of the one, as Gods Creation was of the other, then it's meet that when the world is renued by Redemption, the Sabbath day should be changed for memory of that, as well as it was instituted at first for the memory of the former, there being the same reason for both: But they are looked on as two distinct worlds, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so in the Plural number, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2. and this last world di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the former, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. and the redeeming of the one is looked upon as the making of the other, therefore from that day forth the day of rest is to be such as may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to both, now the day being changed to the first, it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth us of Gods rest at the Creation by distinguishing Six days from the Seventh, and it remembreth us of the new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by putting Christs Resurrection in the room of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>

If the new world be a work as much for the Glory of God, and as comfortable to men, vvhen its begun and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or finished by the vvork of Redemption, as the making of the old World vvas, then the day of rest of the new World is to be made to relate to that, much more if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World be more for the Glory of God, and


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55484:158"/>
for the comfort of men; then by the ground on which the Seventh day was at first instituted, it's also again to be changed, to vvit, the memory of Gods great vvork; but both the former are true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> or thus, if the ground that made the Seventh to be chosen for the Sabbath in the old World be changed in the new, and that ground agree better to another then to it; then it is to be changed: But the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the old Seventh day vvas preferred is now changed, and there are grounds to prefer another day to it for the same ends; therefore it is meet the day be changed also: Or thus, if the perfecting of the vvork of Redemption, and the rest of the Mediator after it, be as much to be remembred as the vvork of Creation and Gods resting after it, then the day is to be changed, but so it is, <hi>Ergo.</hi>

If by Christ in the new World all the Levitical Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices be changed, and the Ceremonial Worship of that day; then it is meet that the day also should be changed: 1. For shewing the expiration of that Worship and Law, it being hard to keep that day, and to distinguish it from the Jewish former Worship: 2. To keep Christians more from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing, and to abstract them even from former Services of the Sabbath now abolished; just as now no particular family hath the Priesthood, as <hi>Levi</hi> had it before, nor no particular Nation hath the Church confined in it, as that of the Jews had (though these vvere not typical properly) yea it vvould be such a day as vvould point out the evanishing of former Ceremonies, vvhich the in-bringing of the first day abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly doth.</p>

To shew he is come. 2. To shew he is absolute over the house and worship of God. 3. Some way to preach his Grace and Redemption in the very change of it: But it is a piece of Worship and Tribute of our time (as is said before) and a piece of Worship capable of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and Remembrance (therefore called the Lords day) which could not be, were not a day of Worship capable of that, and it falleth under the power of Christ, who <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath</hi>; and why is that power pleaded in that particular of the day so often, if it were not to shew, that there is reason by his coming to look on the Sabbath as under him, even as all other Worship was, which stood by Gods positive Command, even as this did?</p>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55484:159"/>
that day be to be kept in reference to any solemn work of God, which was the First day after his perfecting it, then the First day is to be kept: but by the command the former is true, because our resting day is to be kept in reference to the work of Redemption, and therefore must be on the First day, which was the day after its closing and perfecting, as to Christs suffering and labour, though not as to its application, even as the Seventh was of Gods resting from the work of Creation, though not from his works of Providence.</p>

If the Seventh day which the Jews kept, had any peculiar tye or motive unto them, which by Christ is now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, then it was meet that at Christs coming that day should be changed. We would understand here, that there might be somewhat peculiar or typical in their Seventh day, and yet nothing so in the fourth command, which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one of Seven, but not the Seventh: And though we could not particularly pitch upon what is typical or peculiar in it, yet may we conceive that something there is, as in Tythes, Offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though the particular thing which is typified be hardly instructed: As 1. If its beginning was on the evening to them (as some think) the reason of it was peculiar, to wit, their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> at evening, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And in so far at least it would be peculiar to them; And by Christs rising in the morning is changed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's pressed peculiarly on the account of Gods redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from <hi>Egypt,</hi> they had that to think on, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they were, where they got not liberty to rest any day, therefore should they ease their Servants, as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.14, 15. This holdeth especially, if it was on the Seventh day that their freedom from <hi>Egypt</hi> began, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. (which was after that, made the first day of their year, that is, the morrow after they did eat the Passover) as it's made probable by some.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was peculiarly discovered to them by Gods raining Manna from Heaven Six dayes, and by his with-holding it from them the Seventh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was peculiarly accompanied with special Ceremonial Services beyond other dayes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Gods manner of dealing with them before Christ, was to


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55484:160"/>
press duties by temporal and external advantages expresly, and more implicitly by spiritual mercies, therfore it was most agreeable to that way and time to press the Seventh day on them which minded them of the benefit of Creation; but it's otherwise with the Church under the Gospel: Hence their Sacraments had respect (externally) to their deliverance from <hi>Egypt</hi> and temporal things, whereas ours have respect purely to what is spiritual.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Apostle <hi>Coll.</hi> 2.16. taketh in their Sabbaths with their other dayes, and though he take not in all dayes alike, yet it can hardly be denyed but their Seventh-day-Sabbath cometh in there, where all the Jewish times are put together: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would seem there is a type, not in the command, but in that day, though not properly, yet accidentally in respect of its worship, end, application, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> complexly taken; and that therefore this Seventh-day-Sabbath is expired at least, if not repealed, seeing that, dayes and times kept by the Jews are enumerate with their other Services which were antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; even as when the Apostle condemneth difference about meat or drink, his meaning is not to condemn, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is made in the Lords Supper in the New Testament, but what is from the Old, so may the same be said of dayes; It's their old difference he cryeth down.</p>

                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 3. As it's meet that the day of Worship under the Gospel, should be another then what was under the Law, and should therefore be changed; so it's meet that the change should be into the First day of the week, and to no other day. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. No other day has been honoured with so many Gospel priviledges, as 1. With Christs Resurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. It was the First day of his victory and rest: 2. With Christs appearing twice, at least, on it to his Disciples, fingling it out from other dayes; or his appearing is for no purpose particularly recorded by the Evangelist <hi>John</hi> to have been on that day, if there were not something remarkable in it beside what is in another day: 3. The Spirits giving at <hi>Pentecost, Acts</hi> 2. will be found to be on the First day of the week, now no other day can claim so many priviledges, and so many wayes relate to Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:55484:160"/>2. If the grounds upon which the Seventh day under the Law was preferred during that World, do in this renewing of the World agree only to the First day of the Week; then is the First day to succeed; but these grounds proportionally agree only to the First day under the Gospel, which agreed to the Seventh under the Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which made the Seventh day preferrable was, 1. That God had ended all his vvorks on the Sixth, and rested the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; It vvas the First day after the Creation; so the First day of the Week is that day on vvhich Christ rose (having perfected the vvork of Redemption, and obtained victory over death, under vvhose povver some vvay for a time his body vvas before that) and vvas thereby manifestly declared to be the Son of God, to vvit, by his Resurrection from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The force of the example vvill hold here, God made the World in Six dayes, and rested the Seventh, therefore rest ye vvith him; so Christ having for a time suffered, fully over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the First day, and began his estate of exaltation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rest vvith him, and rejoyce that day, it being the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this nevv joyful World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No other day can be substituted in place of the old Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, reserving intire the morality of this command; therefore it must be this that is put in the place of that; for this command requireth, 1. one day of every Seven, allowing Six of every Seven to work, and that together: Now if the day had gone beyond the Sabbath ensuing, it had not been one day of Seven, if it had been the second, third, or fourth day, then the Six working dayes had not gone together. But now the First being appointed for God next to the Seventh, God hath his part or tribute called for, and then came Six working dayes together unto us of that same Week, and so still they run, God hath One, and we have Six of the same Week.</p>
               <p>If it be here objected, that this way, the new World is begun with a Sabbath, whereas the Sabbath closed and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Creation of the old World. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Thus God hath no loss of what he required; for this way, no Week want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its Sabbath. 2. It's most sutable that the old World


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55484:161"/>
should end in a Sabbath, and the new begin in a Sabbath, that so the worship of the new (which most distinctly discovereth the change) might the more immediately and convincingly preach the change, which could not so well have been done if working dayes of both had met together, or a working day of the one, and the Sabbath of the other. 3. Though the old Sabbath was the Seventh in order from the Creation, yet it was the First day after mans Creation, God beginning as it were, and entring him with that, even so when men are brought into this new World or change, God will begin it with gladness and joy to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 4. The day of solemn publick worship required to be observed by this command, was really changed from the Seventh or last day to the First day of the Week, according to the former grounds. That it was really changed, may be made out by these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Apostles and primitive Christians after Christs Resurrection and Ascension, had their solemn day for meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to worship God, yet neither did they by themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in practise keep the Seventh, nor by command appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be kept, nor gave it the title of the <hi>Lords day</hi>: It's true, that often they kept it in a sort with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as they did <hi>Pentecost,</hi> for the opportunity of the multitude coming together on these dayes, or to bury it with honour; as they did practice for a time several of the Jewish Rites antiquated for their gaining, and till they were fully informed of their abolition; but in constituted Churches of the Gentiles, we never read that they kept it, but another day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apostles and primitive Christians kept and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the First day for their solemn day, beyond and above all dayes, yea, and it only as the Christian Sabbath. For 1. on that day they used to meet ordinarily, and that not occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but purposely and determinately, as <hi>John</hi> 20. v. 19. and 26. which is clearly the First day. 2. They are purposely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not for fear (for fear scattereth) but while they are together, they do for fear shut the doors, being very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably led from the news of the Resurrection to be together; and so again, <hi>v.</hi> 26. they meet, and Christ with them: And though it may possibly be, that on other dayes they met;


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55484:161"/>
yet doubtless this holdeth forth something peculiar to this day, and some Lesson to be taken from it: That 1. Christs coming to them is especially trusted on that day, and that while they are together. 2. That when they met at any other time, 'ere he came to them it's never said, they were or came together the second, third or fourth day of the week, but on the First; and vvherefore doth the Holy Ghost record that day, or their meeting on that day, when he omitteth the naming of other days; but that that day in its Exercises may be especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taken notice of, and though other dayes had been much alike in Exercises to them, yet the recording of this day so often, and omitting the other, intimateth a difference, sure they are not alike in this, so much for the 20 of <hi>John,</hi> which is the first place of Scripture we make use of.</p>
               <p>The second is <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1.2. Here they are said to be, <hi>all with o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> accord in one place when Pentecost</hi> came, where it's clear, 1. That <hi>Pentecost</hi> was on the first day of the week, for it was the fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day after the Feast of unleavened bread: Now according to the Jews account their Passover day was on the Sabbath (called <hi>John</hi> 19.3 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. an high Sabbath) in which Christ lay all the day in the grave, as appeareth; for that day is called their preparation for the Feast, wherein Christ suffered which is our Fryday; reckon now what will be the fiftieth day after, or <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and it will be found to be the First day of the week: And it's not only observable for their meeting, but for God's sending the Spirit on them, as a special blessing of that day, and his countenancing of their worshipping him on it, according to his promise; 2. It is clear that they did meet together on this day. 3. That this meeting together was not a daily or ordinary meeting together (for <hi>John</hi> 21 we see they went to Fishing, and no question sometimes they went asunder) for <hi>v.</hi> 1. it's marked as a thing not ordinary to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, that on that day they were altogether in one place. 4. It was not a meeting in reference to the <hi>Pentecost</hi> feast; for 1. They only are together, distinct from the People. 2. It's not in the Temple, but in some other house fit for their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together at publick Worship; it must be therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that day was the time of their solemn meeting, even their Christian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:55484:162"/>The third place is <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. <hi>and upon the first day of the week, when the Disciples came together to break bread</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto them,</hi> &amp;c. where it is clear, 1. That this meeting was for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship, as the breaking of Bread and Preaching inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth. 2. That there is some observableness in this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that it was on <hi>the first day of the week,</hi> and that that day is mentioned rather then any of the former six dayes in which he had been there at <hi>Troas,</hi> though it's more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they had meetings and preaching on them also; but this is the only and great difference, that their meetings on these days were occasional, and it may be but partial (to speak so) but the solemn chief sixt meeting of all, was usually and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily on the First day. 3. This coming together on that day for these ends is spoken of, as a thing that was not new, nor occasional; but as their customary, constant, known, Practice; they came together purposely to break bread and to wait on other Ordinances. 4. It's clear, that by special ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of these Exercises to that day, and by mentioning of the day for that end, that, that day was their most solemn day, and that the Old Seventh day was not so (at least neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily) imployed by them. 5. Neither is it like, That <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ready to depart, would have stayed for the first day of the week, if there had not been some solemn worship in that, or that he would have passed the old seventh day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, especially to the marring of his other occasions had they been equal, if more sanctification had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in it, then in the First day of the week, or that he would have so much insisted in religious publick worship on that day, if the former Seventh had been imployed in that service, but here the Church being constituted of believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there is no mention of the old Sabbath, but as of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother common day of the week; yea 6. <hi>Pauls</hi> spending this whole day in that service, and continuing his Sermon till midnight (yet accounting it still one day) in solemn meeting doth confirm this day to be more than an ordinary day, or then other days of the week, as being specially dedicated to these Services and Exercises, and totally spent in them. 7. It's said, that <hi>the Disciples c <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me together,</hi> they were not sent for that day, but they came together being called and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55484:162"/>
so to do on that day, and as being put to these duties by the day, as the proper Exercises in which it is to be spent.</p>
               <p>Hence we may argue; If the Apostles and primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did observe the First day of the week, as their prime and chief time for solemn, publick Worship, and did pass over the old Seventh day, then is the day changed from the Seventh to the First day of the week, but the first is cleared by the former Instances, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And if these meetings on that First day were not such as used to be formerly on the seventh day, I desire to know a reason, 1. Why their meetings on that day should be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly recorded rather than their meetings on any other day; and then 2. Why the one is so oft mentioned, and the other never, to vvit, that they met the second, third day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the week. Or 3. If their meeting on this First day now (after Christs Ascension) be not like his going to the Synagogue on the Seventh day-Sabbath, and doing such and such things on the Sabbath: that day being most frequently mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas now there is deep silence of that day, and the first day is reco <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ded in its room, neither can the Scriptures speaking of the one, and silence in the other be for no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or for any other purpose.</p>
               <p>And as the practice of the Church holdeth out the change of the day, so doth the Title given, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. to the first day of the week, to wit, the <hi>Lords day</hi> confirm the same, whence we argue.</p>
               <p>If the Title, which by the Lord and his people was given to the Seventh day-Sabbath under the old Testament, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which, and by vvhich, he claimeth a Seventh day in this command; If I say that Title in the New Testament be not given unto the Seventh, but unto the First day of the week; then is the day changed from the Seventh day to the First, and the First falleth now under this command, as the Seventh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did; but the former is true, the First is styled as the Seventh was, and as this command styleth and claimeth the day to the Lord to be observed for him; therefore now is the Sabbath changed from the Seventh day to the First day of the Week.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:55484:163"/>The Titles whereby the Sabbath is distinguished from other days and peculiarly claimed and marked by God as his, and that in this same command, must certainly evidence that day, which he hath set apart and doth claim as he applyeth them: And therefore if these Titles be given and applyed to the first day now, it must needs shew a succeeding of that day unto the former Seventh, for during the Observation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day these Titles were not, nay could not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the First, no day being then the Lords but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.</p>
               <p>Now we find that the Seventh day-Sabbath is in the Old Testament styled by the Lord under these Titles, and so claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. 1. It's called here <hi>the Sabbath of the Lord</hi> or <hi>to the Lord,</hi> that's the Lord's, as contradistinguished from the Six days he hath given unto us, a day that he hath right to, and not we, therefore called <hi>the Lords Sabbath.</hi> 2. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 58.3. It's clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Lord as his, <hi>my Holy Day,</hi> which is so called 1. to distinguish it from other days. 2. To stamp it with the Lords mark in respect of it's use, for it is not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to our use, but to his own, it being his in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>But in the New Testament after Christs Resurrection, the Seventh day is not so styled and claimed, but the First day of the Week is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. I vvas (saith <hi>John</hi>) in the Spirit on the <hi>Lords Day:</hi> In which place these things are clear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That after Christs Ascension there vvas a peculiar day belonging to the Lord beside and beyond other days.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was not the old Sabbath, for 1. <hi>Johns</hi> scope being particularly to clear the time of the Vision by the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the day, the particular day as distinct from other days, to call the Sabbath then used amongst the Jews; the Lords day had more obscured it then cleared it, yea 2. In that it's called <hi>the Lords,</hi> according to the phrase of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it supposeth some relation to Christ the Mediator, as being derived from him which cannot be said of the Seventh day Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it was not any indefinite day of the Lord: For, 1. there is great odds betwixt the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and <hi>the Day of the Lord,</hi> the former looketh to a constant special right and


<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55484:163"/>
peculiar interest that God hath in that day beside other daye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, even as when the Seventh day was called <hi>his Day</hi> before, the Temple, <hi>his Temple,</hi> the prescribed Service, <hi>his Service,</hi> and the Sacrament of the Supper, <hi>his Supper, &amp;c.</hi> 2. That day would be still dark to the Church if it were indefinite, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Johns</hi> scope.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is, and must be such a day as was commonly set apart by Christians to God as his, and that with respect to Christ the Mediatour, and such a day as was known to them; And by the former practises it is clear, that this day is the first day of the Week, being the Lord Christ's day, who now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conquered death, and gotten the victory, He doth therefore claim this day as a tribute to him.</p>
               <p>This being clear, that no other day can claim this title, and that the First day hath good ground to claim it, we may put it out of question, that it is the First day or no day, or if it were not the First, that to no purpose were the designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that day inserted, seeing to no other day hath it been applyed, nor can it be applyed.</p>
               <p>This truth has been uncontroverted in all Antiquity, and almost by all Writers (till of late <hi>Gomarus</hi> beginneth to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion it) as <hi>Rivet</hi> cleareth on this command against him.</p>
               <p>Now (supposing it as unquestionable that this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry First day) we are to inquire if the title applyed to this day be the same with that in the command, and which usually was given to the old Seventh-day-Sabbath, or that then Lords day.</p>
               <p>And it is clear, 1. That this title claimeth this day to God as his day, it being possessively exprest, as when we say, the Lords Throne, the Lords Altar, the Lords Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </gap> left more generally to be gathered: From all which we may gather the conclusion, to wit, that the First day of the week is stiled by the same peculiar Titles claimed by the Lord expresly as his right and due, and upon as valid grounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament, as the Seventh day was under the Old; Therefore now the Seventh day is changed, and the First is come in its room, which was the thing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>In the last room we argue from the Apostles ordinance 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. concerning contributions for the Saints; <hi>As I have</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>given order to the Churches of Galatia, even so do ye,</hi> that is, <hi>the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him, &amp;c.</hi> I say we argue thus, That not the Seventh, but the First day, is the chief solemn day for worship after Christs Resurrection.</p>
               <p>If the First day of the week be particularly and eminently pitched on by the Apostle, and that in diverse Churches as the fittest time for expressing their Charity, then must there be somewhat eminent in the First day, giving ground for such an appointment and ordinance, as the Apostles singling that


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55484:164"/>
from other days for such an end (and no other reason can be given, but that that day being more especially and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately appointed for God, is most fit for that Duty, which is a Work of Mercy) but it's there clear, that the Apostle pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth singularly on that day beside other days, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For strengthening of the Argument, consider 1. That it's clear to be the first day of the week, since that same phrase which is used by the Evangelists, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.1. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.2. <hi>Luk <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> 24.1. is made use of here by the Apostle, who no question followeth the Evangelists phrase, yea his following that phrase may hint at a reason, why he commandeth Charity to be on that day, or sets it apart for that use as beyond other dayes, to wit, our Lords Resurrection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's clear, that he thinketh it not indifferent what day it be done on, nor that all days are alike, therefore he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on that day, the First day, and that not in one Church only but in many.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this is not commended only to them, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and enjoyned even in reference to the day, and will the Apostle load Churches with Commands in that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance without ground, and universally (to speak so) prefer one day to another, and so as he will have uniformity in the very day in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> with other Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily? Let it not be said, nay nor thought.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this day was commanded even in the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> in which Churches he had condemned the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of days, whereby it would seem to be clear, that he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the preferring of this first day, as one of these days the observation whereof is prohibited and condemned by him, nor willeth it to be laid aside; and that purposely he passed the Seventh day as amongst these days, which were not to be observed and retained but laid aside.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the thing required is a Duty of the Sabbath, being a work of mercy, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. giving Bread to the hungry, is mentioned particularly, as one of the Duties of Gods Holy day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the mentioning of the <hi>First Day</hi> of the week must be looked on, as relating to, and as compared with, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of keeping solemn meetings on that day, and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55484:165"/>
of doing this on the First day of the week must be more strong, and infer somewhat more being compared with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, then if such things were not recorded other ways of the First day.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This command supposeth them to be already acquainted with some special priviledges of the First day beyond others, when he commendeth this as a motive to them to be more charitable, to wit, that it was to be done on that day.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That there must be some peculiar thing in this day ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it fit, yea more fit for such a purpose, as doing works of Charity on it; rather then on any other: And the Apostles commanding this (and that in many Churches) doth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily presuppose a reason why he doth it, drawn from some fitness of this day by another. Now if we will enquire, no reason can be given but that the Seventh day, Sabbath was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and that this First day was instituted in it's place, for otherwise any day was alike; yea the Seventh day being the last day of the week, and the day when men usually rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon their weeks success, it would seem more reasonable for this end, that men at the close of the week should lay up by them, as God had blessed them, then to reserve it, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of another week, were not the First day more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be sanctifyed then the last, and the last to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but an ordinary working day: The fitness then floweth from this, that the first day of the week being the day of their solemn Communion with God, and with one another, and the day of their partaking most liberally of spiritual blessings from him, that therefore they should be most readily warmed in their affections, and be most liberal in their Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to such as wanted, especially if we consider the Jews to be parties for whom that Collection or Contribution was; It's the Apostles great Argument whereby he pleadeth for Charity to the poor Jews from the Christian Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.26, 27. That the Gentiles were their Debtors in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, because they had received spiritual things from them; now this argument is most fresh and powerful, when believers do on the First day of the week record Gods priviledging them with his Ordinances, and giving them his day in place of the Ordinances and day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

deriving these unto them by the Jews, I say this Argument will then be most fresh to incite to that duty in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>

I demand why is it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal? If it were from one Church only it might possibly, have been thought so, but he doth call for this Duty on that day from more Churches: 2. Why doth he not recommend it, but command it as having more then an indifferency in the very day: And 3. Can it be by guess or accident (to speak so) that so many priviledges are fallen on that day? And that so many things are recorded of it, and astricted to it by commands, which is not done of, and to, any other days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if one place would not suffice to prove, that the First day and not the Seventh day was preferred by the Apostles, as the chief day of solemn publick worship, yet all these things put together must prove a preference in that day, or we must say that the Penmen of Holy Scripture have been very partial, who have marked many things, and recorded them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Worship on that day, and have never so much as once for solemn Service named, what was done on the second, third, fourth, fifth dayes; we must either say, that this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertently done (which were blasphemy considering by what Spirit they wrote) or we must say it's done to put a preference on that day, and to shew that it's especially to be taken notice of, as the most solemn day for God's worship by Christians (which is the thing to be confirmed) for, the day that's claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Lords, kept for him, and singularly marked to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged beyond other days, must be his day; but this First day is such, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

This change of the day whereby the Seventh is laid aside, and the first substituted in its room, is of divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and institution; and not by any meer human or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Constitution. I conceive there is indeed no mids here betwixt a divine Institution, which hath Gods warrant and authority stamped on it, and for Conscience sake is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served as being; obligatory thereof, and that immediately; and human or Ecclesiastick Constitutions, which may reach

                  </gap>n, but in the matters of worship cannot bind the Conscience or impose them as necessary: Now that this change is not by the last, but by the first, we prove these ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thus, if it be not human or Ecclesiastick, t <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If no man or Church on earth have power to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods day, now, nay, nor simply, or at all, then it's not human or Ecclesiastick, but first, none can change it, as we might clear from great absurdities, that would follow. 2. If any Church have this power let them shew it, the Old Church had it not, neither the new, as is cleared in the first questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We proceed to evince this change to be by divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution these four ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From reasons flowing from Scripture, or Consequences drawn from it, 1. Thus, where by genuine and native Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences drawn from Scripture any thing is so imposed, as it cannot without sin be altered or neglected, there is a divine institution; but in the change of the Seventh day-Sabbath to the First such Consequences may be drawn from Scripture, as will (upon supposition of the change) a strict it to the First day, so as that cannot be altered or neglected without sin, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it's of divine institution: The question can be only of the <hi>minor,</hi> which is made out from what is said in the third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, thus,</p>
               <p>If these very grounds which plead the conveniency of the change simply, do plead the conveniency of that change to the First day, then by clear and unforced Consequence, the first day is chosen and cannot without sin be passed by, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or neglected, except we say these reasons have no weight; but these very grounds will be found to plead for, and to be applicable to, the First day of the week a lonely: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beside all other days in the new world it m <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55484:166"/>
to that end, the First day cannot be without sin past by neglected or altered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus, if the very day of Christs rest in the new world be to be rested on, and sanctified as the Sabbath, then the First day is to be rested on and sanctified; but by Analogy from the works of Creation, we may see that the First day of rest after the finishing of the work of Redemption is to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. is very considerable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, wherein there is 1. a Prophecy of Christ. 2. Of a day which God hath singularly made for us to joy in. 3. That day is the day wherein the rejected stone is made the head of the corner, which day is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. to be the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on day; yea suppose that day there doth signifie the time of the Gospel, wherein we should joy, yet even that way, the First day is by proportion that day eminently, wherein Christs Victory was manifested, and so the day wherein Christians ought especially to rejoyce.</p>
               <p>The second way we may reason for the change to be by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, is from this command: If (supposing still a change) by the morality of this command, the Seventh can be changed into no day but the first day of the week, then is the change into the first day, of divine institution (for so that must necessarily be, which is by vertue of a command) but by this command no other day can be admitted; for each week is divided in six working days, and these together to us, and one of rest and that to God; now by changing it to the First God getteth one and we six and that together; but if the day were the second, third, fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it would not be so; for the six working days would be interrupted, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that morality of the Command, whereby our days are distinguished from his, that ours, for one week being fully by, we may with the greater freedom give God his.</p>
               <p>The third way we take to prove the change of the day to be by divine Institution is this  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> If by the practise of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, who were guided and inspired by the Spirit in things belonging to their Office infallible, this day was observed as different from other days; then there is a divine institution of, and warrant for, this day; but by the practise of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55484:167"/>
to, other days, or as divine, therefore it's of divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; If the divine practise and example of the Apostles in things moral and common to all, do not either suppose a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine antecedent institution, or infer a subsequent, then their practise and example, which in these things is infallible and unerring, will have no more force then the example of others, which were absurd, their examples being especially pressed on us; and if in any thing their example be divine, it must be in this so particularly and so well circumstantiated; and where their meeting is not recorded to have been on any other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, &amp;c. day, certainly their practise must be not only more then nothing, but very significant; and indeed in posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive worship, the Lord hath been pleased to be more sparing (to say so) and to leave us more to gather from Examples then in negatives, as in the positive part of swearing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Church members, in government, baptism and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Supper, yet none can say that there is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-institution in these, where there may be such grounds or examples.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The divine Institution of the chang may be argued from the title thus, if that which is called the <hi>Lords,</hi> be his by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution and separation from other things not so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; then this first day must be his by divine institution and separation from other days, but all that is called the Lords, is his after this manner, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Let the <hi>minor</hi> be confirmed these three ways, 1. By looking to what is called the <hi>Lords</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the Old Testament, as his house, his Altar, his Priests, his Tithes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are they not still his, because by him separate for distinct uses in his worship: 2. By looking more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, how the Seventh day was called his day, or the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath his, is not this the reason, because it was appointed by him for his worship beside other days? And can can any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son agree better to this? 3. By looking how any thing is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Lords</hi> in the New Testament, there is no other or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter phrase or designation to try by, then that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 21. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, even as this First day, called the <hi>Lords day</hi> is opposed to our dayes or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon days, and that is called the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> because institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, for such and such spiritual ends and uses: And


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55484:167"/>
therefore there can be no better ground gotten for shewing why this is called the Lords day beside others, th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with other Scriptures, and if in other things that phrase import a divine institution, why not in this? I do not mean that this is an institution, or that it will prove that there must be a clear and express institution shewn, but I mean this, that it will inferr there is one, and that it is divine, seeing God is to choose and not we. We might here again produce the four Witnesses already attested for the morality of this fourth Command, to wit, 1. the general practise of primitive Christians, 2. their general opinion and judgment, 3. mens consciences, 4. the dispensations of God; which will also all clearly depone in this, about the change of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 6. Although we know not the peremptory and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise time when this day was instituted, and the very first day sanctified, nor whether it was immediately by Christ, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from him by the Apostles instituted, which is of no great concernment to the main of its institution; yet we think it most probable that our Lord did from the very day of his Resurrection either himself institute it, while as <hi>Acts</hi> i. <hi>v.</hi> 3. he taught them what concerned the Kingdom of God; or did inspire his Apostles to observe it from that time forth; Because, 1. If it was not then instituted, the Church had for some time wanted a Sabbath, the Seventh-day-Sabbath being expired by the Resurrection. 2. The reason moving the change and preferring the First day before others as in a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er capacity of sanctification for that end, was from that time forth. 3. The Apostles practise of meeting; and Christs keeping with them, hath been from the first change, even on the first two first dayes of the week, <hi>John</hi> 20.19, 26. 4. All the practises and other grounds whereby the change is eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, suppose still the institution to precede; which maketh i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> appear to be very ancient.</p>
               <p>And so we resume and close these six propositions, 1. The day may be changed from the last to the first: 2. It's meet it should be so, and there is good reason for it: 3. It can only be to the First: 4. It's so changed actually: 5. It's change is not by Human, but by Divine institution: 6. Its institution


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55484:168"/>
seemeth to be from the rise of the Gospel Church, and the very day of Christs Resurrection. Hence vve infer 1. Good vvarrant, even Gods vvarrant for imploying the Seventh day to our selves, seeing God seeketh but one day in Seven, and novv has chosen and claimeth the First. 2. Gods vvarrant for sanctifying the First-day-Sabbath or the Lords day as his institution. 3. That the Lords day is to be sanctified by us Christians, and that by vertue of this command, as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day vvas by the Jevvs on its grounds.</p>
               <p>We come novv to speak of the sanctification of this day, vvhich is the main thing, and for vvhich all the rest is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vve shall first consider the precept, and then 2. the reasons vvhereby it is inforced.</p>
               <p>The precept is, <hi>sanctifie it,</hi> or <hi>keep it holy,</hi> sanctifying of it is twice mentioned in this command, 1. In the end, it's said God <hi>hallowed</hi> or <hi>sanctified</hi> it, that is by separation, destination and appointment for holy uses, and as a part of worship, so he sanctified the Temple, Altar, &amp;c. not by infusing any holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them, but by appointing them for holy uses; Thus only God can sanctifie a day, or any other thing, so as to make it a part of worship, and no man or power on earth what somever can do that. 2 In the precept it self we are commanded to sanctifie it, that is, by the application of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the uses wherefore he hath set it apart; thus we sanctifie what he hath sanctified when we use it and imploy it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his appointment. And so we are to consider, the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of this day in these duties called for from us on it.</p>
               <p>This sanctification is two wayes set down, 1. In its cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rest, separating it from other uses, and so keeping it from the common uses, to which other dayes may and use to be applied: 2. In its special application to and imployment in holy uses.</p>
               <p>For clearness we shall consider this sanctification, 1. In respect of its rest, what we are to abstain from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, with that strictness cal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

duties it should be taken up: 5. Complexly, in respect of vvhat is called for to the right sanctifying of that day before it come on, in the time of it, and after it is past, and that in publick and private, and by all relations, Master, Servant, &amp;c. and throughout the vvhole man, thoughts, vvords, and deeds, and throughout the vvhole day: 6. Oppositively, or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, vvhat are the breaches of this command, and the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of these sins vvhich break it.</p>
               <p>First then, vve consider it in its rest, vvhich is required; and because there are extreams, some giving it too little, as the Jevvs did before the captivity; some too much, even to being superstitious, as the Jevvs after the Captivity, and the Scribes and Pharisees particularly in Christs time did; stretching this rest too farr. We must therefore consider it more narrovvly and particularly for quieting of our Consciences, for the Jews are by the Prophets <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. and by Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. reproved for both extremes respectively.</p>
               <p>We do then in this matter assert first, That there is a rest required here, which is extensive to a mans words, thoughts, and actions, whereby many things lawful on other dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unlawful on this day.</p>
               <p>Yet 2. we assert, That by this rest all sort of actions are not condemned, but only such as are inconsistent with the end and scope of this command; as by other Scriptures, and the practice of Christ and the Saints is clear: we conceive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these to be permitted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All duties of Piety, as was sacrificing under the Old Testament, or preaching, hearing or going about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under the New Testament: In which sense, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. our Lord saith, the Priests prophaned the Sabbath and were blameless, not that formally they prophaned the Sabbath, or did indeed break that command, but materially they wrought in killing beasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which had been unlawful, had it not been in the exercises of piety.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All things that have a tendencie, as necessary helps and means to the performance of the former works of piety, are lawful, as going to the Congregation to hear the Law, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Assembly for worship by Trumpets, or Bells, or by a Voice, Journeying, going or riding to Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55484:169"/>
the duties of the Sabbath cannot well be done without some of these, nor at all without others of them.</p>
               <p>If it should be asked here, What that, which is called <hi>a Sabbaths day Journey, Acts</hi> 1.12. was among the Jews? and whence it came, and what way may it be stinted or limited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians? <hi>Answ.</hi> It was to them 2000 Cubits, which according to the different measuring of that distance of ground consisting of these 2000 Cubits by a lesser or longer Cubi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, is reckoned to be more or less by learned Men; but all agree (saies <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>) in this, that these 2000 Cubits was a Sabbath daies Journey.</p>
               <p>It arose to be reckoned so from these grounds; 1. From their expounding <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.29. <hi>Let none go out of his place</hi>; thus, Let none go without the bounds of the City, which with its Suburbs was 2000 Cubits, or a mile about. 2. That the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation was so far from the Tents of these who pitched about it in the Wilderness, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. as they supposed; and that the Priests kept that distance from the people in entering with the Ark into <hi>Jordan, Jos.</hi> 3.4. whence they gathered that a man might still go to the Ark or place of worship, as it was then in these cases at a distance from them, and no further on the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>But we say whatever superstitiously or on custome they took up (for that is but their Tradition) we cannot stint a Sabbath daies journey to so many miles, fewer or more, but it must be as the man is in providence cast to reside further from, or nearer to the place where the Ordinances are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed; for one may go many miles and not prophane the Sabbath, if he cannot have the publick Ordinances nearer, whereas another may break the Sabbath by going but to his Neighbours door, yea by walking in his own house, or to his door, if either it be done idly, or with respect to another ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or worldly end, which agreeth not to that day; it is not here remoteness or nearness, but what sweyeth us, and what is our end, that we are to try by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All works of mercy are lawful on that day, as laying beside us something to the poor, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. sending or deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing something to those who are in want, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.7. visiting others, to comfort, strengthen, or otherwaies to edifie them

(that he might take that opportunity by his spiritual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to edifie the Company as he did notably) which he would not have done had it been unlawful to dress any meat on the Sabbath, yet his carriage was such at that Feast most remarkably, that it would be followed as a pattern by such as may be invited by others to eat with them, and shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to go on the Sabbath: And if this were the design of the inviters and invited, mens eating together on that day would not readily prejudice the sanctification of it, as very often it doth: Such is  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By all which Believers have allowance, 1. for piety, 2. for charitie, 3. for what is needful for their beasts, 4. what is needful and convenient, or comly for themselves; and more is not necessary: In these the Lord hath not streightned them,

neither hath he pinched and pinned them up to absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, but hath left them to walk by Christian prudence (yet so as they may not exceed) for the Disciples possibly might have endured that hunger, and not pluck't the ears of Corn, or beasts may live a day without water, and not be much the worse, or some sort of Victuals may be provided to be set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side men on the Sabbath needing no dressing or preparing; yea, a man may live on little or nothing for one day: but the Lord hath thought good not to streighten them, so as to make his day and worship a weariness and burden unto them, seeing he hath made the Sabbath for man, to be refreshing to him, and not man for the Sabbath; nor will he have their Consciences to be festered with inextricable scruples: He leaveth it to men on other dayes, how much to eat and drink by a Christian prudence (yet allovveth them not to exceed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on these) so here there is some latitude left to conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious reason to vvalk by; for some may do something at one time, and not at another, yea, one man may take more pains in upholding his body then is called for from another vvho is stronger, so that it's impossible to set particular rules vvhich vvill agree to all, but men vvould look, 1 to their end, 2. to their need, 3. to vvhat may conveniently attain the end.</p>
               <p>Yet it is needful here to add some qualifications or caveats, lest folk indulge themselves too much, and exceed under the pretext of the former libertie vvhich the Lord hath conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to leave men at.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That men vvould see that the necessity be real, that real sickness keepeth at home, that real hazard maketh them flie, or maketh them bide at home, that it be such a necessitie as they cannot contrive a vvay conveniently to evite vvhen it cometh, or could not foresee before it came.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men vvould see that that necessitie be not brought on by themselves; If the thing might have been done at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, that necessity vvill not excuse; though if the sin be taken vvith, and repented of, and Christ fled unto for the pardon of it, vve may go about the doing that lavvfully vvhich sinfully vve have necessitated our selves unto; as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose one had got vvarning to slie the day before, to bring

such a Physician, or to provide such drugs, &amp;c. if he did it not, then he sinneth, yet vvhen necessity cometh he may still do it, but not vvith a good conscience, till he first acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the former fault of his neglect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It vvould be adverted, if that thing may be done, as vvell another time, or may not vvithout prejudice (that is considerable) be delayed till the next day; Thus taking or giving of physick on the Lords day, making ordinary civil visits, beginning voyages, &amp;c. vvill not sustein and bear vveight before God, vvhen folk do them that day, to have their ovvn vvork day free, and so put by the proper duties of the Lords day, for some things that may be done the day or daies follovving: Thus rest is commanded <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.21. even in sovving time and harvest; because the necessitie is not clear, but dependeth on ordinary providence, and folks are to expect occasion and opportunities for them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Men would take heed that they have not a tickling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie that such necessities fall on the Sabbath, and be not glad to have diversions from the proper duties of the day. They would go about such works with a sort of sadness, though yet with clearness and peace of conscience as to their lawfulness: Therefore Christ saith to his Disciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.20. <hi>pray that your flight be not on the Sabbath day</hi>; because it would be heavy to Gods people to slie on that day, though it was lawful.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We would see that it marr not a spiritual frame, and that in doing these we turn not to mind the World as on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayes; There would be still a respect to the day in our frame (which is called for in the word <hi>remember</hi>) and even when our hand is otherwayes imployed, the heart should not be taken up with these things, but so far as is necessary to the acting of them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It would be adverted to, that they be done without ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity, and so as not to give offence by them (hence it was that Christ ever gave the reasons of what he did on the Sabbath) lest others, not knowing our necessity, judge us guilty of Sabbath-breaking, or be involved without necessitie to do the like.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:55484:171"/>7. Folks would have great respect to the end in these works, and to the motive which swayeth and putteth them on. If it be outward gain or fear of some temporal loss; as if for gaining money a Physitian should go rather on the Sabbath then on another day to save the life of a man; that turneth then to be a servile work, and one of his ordinary Week day calling (to speak so): So if a Minister should preach with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to gain or applause on the Sabbath, or if any man should make a visit for a meer civil end, as we visit on other dayes, without a sutable respect to spiritual edification or furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Piety, it will marr all, and will be found a breach of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We would beware of spending too much time in these things, but would endeavour timely and quickly to expede and dispatch them, and rightly to trust them: Dressing of meat, and trimming, adorning, and busking of folks bodies will not be found a well spent part of the Sabbath, when it shutteth out other duties, and getteth too much time, as it doth with many.</p>
               <p>By all which we may see what need there is to watch over our selves in these things, lest our liberty be turned into li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness, and lest we grow either idle or carnal on that day.</p>
               <p>Let us then consider how far this rest extendeth: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it we take in 1. The rest of the whole man, outward and inward, in deeds, words, and thoughts, so is it <hi>Isai.</hi> 58.13. we should not speak our own words (nor by proportion think our own thoughts) nor find our own pleasures. 2. It goeth through the whole day, for though every minute of the day cannot be applyed to positive duties, yet in no minute of it, is it lawful to do another work (inconsistent with the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and scope aforesaid) that is the negative part in it, <hi>thou shalt do no work,</hi> which bindeth <hi>ad semper.</hi> 3. It is to be extended not only to a mans own person, but to all under him, children, servants, &amp;c. he must be answerable for it, that they rest, and must give them no occasion of work. 4. It's to be extended even to the least work of any fort, if unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as gathering sticks, speaking our own words, &amp;c. these are all breaches of the Sabbath. 5. This rest extendeth to


<pb n="283" facs="tcp:55484:171"/>
all actions or sorts of actions or cases which are not comprehended under the former exceptions which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or are consistent with the sanctifying of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. All works which tend to our external profit, pleasure, satisfaction, &amp;c. all works of our callings which make for the increase of outward gain and profit, such whereby we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily sustain our lives: These <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. are called our own works, and here it's such works as ordinarily are wrought in the rest of the six dayes: So it is doing thy own pleasure as well as vvorks, <hi>Isa</hi> 58.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such vvorks as tend to others external gain or profit as the great motive of them, as Servants may be vvorking for their Masters profit, and yet prophane the day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as are not necessary on that day, as ploughing, sovving, reap <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng, or gathering in, and that even in Seed time and Harvest; and so fishing, going of mills, &amp;c. vvhen these are not done for the very preserving of life, because they are not necessary out of that case; neither is there any thing here of an extraordinary dispensation that maketh them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, the vveather depending on an ordinary providence, or ordinarily depending on providence, vvhich is to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced: Hence though the vveather and season be rainy, yet it is not lavvful to cut dovvn or gather in Corn on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, their hazard in this case being common and from an ordinary immediate providence; yet suppose that a River vvere carrying avvay Corn, or that Winds vvere like to blovv them into the Sea, it vvere lavvful in such a case to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent that, and preserve them; because 1. that cometh by some more then ordinary dispensation of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the vveather, and affecteth and putteth in hazard this Corn more then others: 2. Because there is no probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of recovering these in an ordinary vvay, though the vveather should alter, but there is hope of gathering in of such as are in the fields vvithout that reach of hazard, if the Lord alter the season.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as are for carnal pleasure or civil ends, thus play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gaming, much laughing, &amp;c. being our ovvn vvorks, more especially our ovvn pleasure, are unlavvful on that day.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:55484:172"/>5. Consider that all things are prohibited vvhich marr the end of the day, and are not consistent vvith the duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; such are buying, selling, &amp;c. out of the cases of pressing necessity; folks cannot be spiritually taken up, and vvith these also; so playing and gaming is no less consistent vvith praying, reading, conferring, &amp;c. then ploughing or such like, yea, is much more indisposing for it, and so vve do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily thereby incapacitate our selves for the duties of the day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All things are forbidden vvhich consist not vvith this rest and the duties of vvorship called for from our selves and others; thus unnecessary journeying, vvalking, even sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose one could or should be exercised in meditation, is not resting as is required, much less is gadding in companies, in the street, or fields, to the neglect of secret and family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>In a vvord, vvhatever is not religious and spiritual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, or furthering or helping unto vvhat is so, out of the excepted cases; much more vvhatever is sinful, scandalous, or unsutable on other dayes, or doth divert from, or indispose for the duties of holiness, and the vvorship of God on that day, is inconsistent vvith this rest, and so prohibited: for, This rest is not primarily commanded and required for it self, but as conducing and subordinate unto the performing of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties in it; therefore our rest is to be regulated, so as may best contribute to that scope, and vvhatever marreth that, though it should not be vvork strictly, but idleness, carnalness, or playing, and gaming, and sporting, yet it's a breach of this rest: for 1. That is no religious duty; nor 2. tending as a necessary help to it; nor 3. is rest commanded that vve should play in it, but that vve should sanctifie it; and 4. playing or sporting cannot be called sanctifying the day; othervvayes vve might have mo Sabbaths then one, and the prophanest vvould love them hest; 5. playing separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the Sabbath from other days, more then vvork doeth; for men play in all; 6. playing is neither a religious duty, it being amongst the most irreligious and prophane; nor a duty of necessity for easing of vveariness, vvhich doth not here come by any bodily toyl and labour, but (if there be any)


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55484:172"/>
from being exercised in spiritual duties; which, therefore, change and variety will through Gods blessing do, so as the person may be born out in them; nor is there any place for it, except some duty be neglected, therefore it's inconsistent with this.</p>
               <p>We come to the second way of considering the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required here, and that is by comparing it with that strictness called for from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to which they were tyed.</p>
               <p>We speak not here of Ceremonials (for so their whole ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice might be more burdensom then ours, and particularly their Sabbath-Services, because they were doubled on that day) but of Moral Duties; and in that respect we say, that the tye and obligation unto the sanctification of this day is equal and alike unto us with them, which is clear in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, for 1. It tyeth us now to as long time, to wit, a natural day of twenty four hours, as it did them then. 2. It restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from work and requireth holy rest now, as much as then; for whatever work then struck against the Letter or purpose and scope of the command, and marred holy Duties, doth so still. 3. It requireth positive sanctification by holy Duties, as preaching, prayer, meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alloweth not Idleness, nor indulgeth time to other unnecessary works. 4. It requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as spiritual a manner and as spiritual a frame in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them now as then.</p>
               <p>For 1. If the command be moral, then is there no change in moral duties, for it is the same command to us, that it was to them, save in ceremonial things: 2. If the same things were allowed to them which are allowed to us, and if no more be allowed to be done by us, then was allowed to be done by them on the Sabbath, then the observation in it's strictness is equal, but the first is true, for works of piety, mercy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, are allowed to us, and so were they to them, as by Christs reasoning against them (as being here superstitious) may appear: yea, 3. our allowances are taken from the practise of Christ and his reasonings with the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who in these disputes aimed not to shew that more was lawful by his coming then was before, but to shew what then was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though they ignorantly or wilfully misunderstood the


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55484:173"/>
command, for even then God allowed mercy rather then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which places most clearly vvarrant us in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise. 4. The Service we have now is as spiritual, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt the promise of the spirit, for keeping up in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties as large as formerly, and therefore our improving of it should be no less.</p>
               <p>Before vve proceed there are some Scriptures which seem to thwart vvith, and to be cross to this, to vvhich vve vvould speak a little for clearing of them; as namely <hi>Exod</hi> 16.23, 29. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.3. vvhere it vvould seem that going out of the place, dressing of meat, and kindling of fire vvere forbidden, vvhich are allowed to us: To vvhich vve say 1. That vve speak of the meaning of this fourth command; if any more vvas forbidden them by peculiar judicial Laws, that contradicteth not our assertion, these may be abrogated, vvhile this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand standeth. But 2. We conceive that as to these things, gathering of sticks, kindling of fire, dressing meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no more is allowed unto us then unto them, that is, all unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary labour in, and about, these is unlawful to us now, and all necessary labour in, and about, them vvas allowed unto, and lawful for, them; as may be gathered from Christs practice, and his reasoning with the Jews, and from the allowance vvhich vvas to their Beasts. In the third place then, vve say that these Scriptures cannot be literally and universally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, for it cannot be thought that they vvent not out of the place, kindled no fire, dressed no meat in any case; yea the allowance for their necessity, and Christs going in and partaking, vvhen invited, on the Sabbath day, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. It's like to somewhat that was prepared that day vvith his defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Disciples practise in plucking ears of Corn, and rubbing them, as it is <hi>Luke</hi> 6.1.

               <p>But to the third way, if any should inquire what more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is called for, or can be win at, on the Sabbath then a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is called unto on other days, he being called to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be perfectly holy every day. <hi>I Answ</hi> Although he be called to be perfectly holy, yet not in the holiness of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Worship throughout every day: He is to be perfectly holy on other days, according to the duties and imployments of these dayes; but on the Lords day he is called to be holy according to the imployments of that day and its duties; The Lords people of old were indeed called to perfect Holiness all the week over, but singularly to sanctifie the Sabbath as a part of their universal Holiness. 2. Though all the parts of every day should be spent holily, yet some parts more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as what parts are spent in Prayer, Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and somewhat more is required of these, who are called to it on a Fasting day, then on other days, even so on the Sabbath. 3. There is a difference betwixt a person living holily in the general, and a person who is holy in sanctifying the <hi>Lords day,</hi> though a man should be holy every day, yet is he not to sanctifie every day which is required on this day, whereof we shall now speak.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>This days sanctification then, we conceive to consist in these,</l>
               </q>
               <p n="1">1. That there is more abstractedness not only from sinful things, but even from lawful temporal things, required on that day then on other days, a spiritual frame of heart, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and setting apart a man from ordinary thoughts; Hence we may say, that as the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, signifyeth unclean as well as common, so a common or every day-frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, will be found unclean for the Sabbath; there must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be another frame of heart, different from an ilk a day-frame and suited to that day.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:55484:174"/>2. This day is to be sanctifyed in respect of the Exercises  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> beyond other days, and that necessarily; whereas on some other days we may be taken up in some duties of worship ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily, but here necessarily: And men may, and ought, to be holy on other days, in their plowing, and other works, but there their Holiness is to be in immediate worship to God, in some thing relating to that alway, such as praying, reading, hearing, conferring, meditating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The sanctification of this day lyeth in this, that it must be wholly sanctified, but parts of other days are ordinarily used in religious Service, but this whole day is to be used so, a man should be this whole day throughout, as in the time of praying on other days.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Duties would be multiplyed that day, more secret and private Prayer, Reading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and more publick Worship; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as there were double Sacrifices that day under the Law, though there were Sacrifices all days.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There would be in the duties of this day more intense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Spirit, and a further degree of Spiritual affections, then in these duties of other days; because this day is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely set apart for that end; and by continuance in Duties we may attain to more of a spiritual frame, and because not only the Exercises of worship praying, reading and hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> call to Holiness on this day, as they do on other days, but even the very day it self doth call to it; even as on a solemn day of humiliation men ought to be more affected and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled then on other days (though daily they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be humbled) because that day is solemnly set apart for it; so ought our worship to be more intense and solemn this day suitable unto it, wherein we are, as it were, dyeted for insisting and persisting in duties of worship; whereas these duties in this respect, and in comparison, are on other days, but as starts, worship is here some way the only work of that day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There would be more heavenliness and spiritual sence breathed after that day in the frame of the heart; it would be near God, and the work of the day would be delightsome and sweet, the Sabbath would, as it is <hi>Isaiah</hi> 58. be called a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and we would endeavour as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. to enter into


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55484:174"/>
his rest, to pass through the outward rest into his, to be within his chambers, yea even in his arms, as it were, all that day.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There would be that day more divineness in our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (to speak so) a sort of Majesty by ordinary in our walk, looking like the Sabbath, and like the God of the Sabbath: There would be an exalting in God that day, we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to have our hearts in a special manner warm in the Exercise of love to him, and to be much in praising of him; our whole worship would more absolutely and immediately be aimed and levelled at the honour and glory of God, as the end of it, then on other ordinary days, wherein our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and other pieces of worship may more immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect our own Case and need; but on this day Gods Honour as the end more immediately whatever our own Case be, and that both in heart within and in the nature of our Exercises without; this is to call the Sabbath of the Lord <hi>honourable,</hi> to honour and glorifie him therein, as it is <hi>Is.</hi> 58. a special Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty being in that days worship by levelling it with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary singleness at Gods praise, even as his name is hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or sanctified in Heaven by Angels and perfected Saints. Hence <hi>It's good to give thanks unto thy Name,</hi> &amp;c. beginneth that Psalm of Praise for the Sabbath-day, to wit, the 92. These Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then that further his praise are more especially for that day.</p>
               <p n="8">8. All these reach both words and thoughts, nothing to the hindrance of these is to be admitted in either; there are  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>one of our words and thoughts that day, but they would in a special manner be Gods, and in it we should be spent as his, and endeavour to be within view of Heaven, to make some Essay of glorified Saints exercise there, and to have the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath as a little preludy of that everlasting Sabbath and rest in the bosom of God.</p>
               <p>The Fourth way of considering this sanctification is posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, to wit, as to the Duties, wherein the Sabbath is to be spent, which are shortly, all duties of immediate worship, whether they be inward, as meditation, self-examination, heart-prayer, either e <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>culatory or more continued, heart-sorrow for sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or outward, as vocal prayer and singing of


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55484:175"/>
Psalms, reading the Scriptures and other pious Books, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or whether they be secret which may be both inward and outward, or private in Families, as reading of the word, conserring on it, repeating Sermons, praying together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or publick; as joyning with the Congregation in prayers and praises, hearing the vvord read, and the sense given, hearing of Sermons, participating of the Sacraments, when dispensed, joyning in solemn humiliations and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, vvhen they fall necessarily or more conveniently to be on the Sabbath; All vvhich and such like are proper duties for that day; to vvhich liberal laying up, and giving for the relief of the poor according to ability, and as God blesseth every man vvould be added as a suitable duty of it, though it be no duty of immediate vvorship.</p>
               <p>The fifth way is to consider the sanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath complexly, before it come, vvhen it's come, and after it's past.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then the night before (not secluding a suitable remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance throughout the week) remember it 1. by timous leaving of vvorldly business, it's a great incroachment on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, though too too usual to continue longer at vvork the night before, then any other night of the vveek, as if folks vvould gain the day of rest, out of Saturnsdays night and Mondays morning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By not suffering this little times leaving of vvork, to be idly spent, but being taken up vvith endeavours, 1. To ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract the mind from other vvorks as vvell as the hand, and to have the heart put in a lively frame. 2. To mind the vvork of the day vvhich is coming, and to have a sutableness to it. If ye ask vvhat sutableness should vve have to it? <hi>Answ.</hi> Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour 1. to be as if ye vvere about to meet God, to tryst, as if it vvere, visibly vvith him, and solemnly to treat and enter in marriage vvith him. 2. To be like Heaven, and in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner in some sort to imitate God, as if ye vvere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready entered into his rest, and had rested from your ovvn vvorks. 3. To be as if ye vvere to dye, and to step into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, for this resting should mind us of that, and vvas, and is still, specially appointed (though yet no Ceremony)  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o mind us of Gods separating of us from others for himself, that vve may rest eternally vvith him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:55484:175"/>Then 3. for furthering of this, look back on the Week past, and endeavour to have things clear before the Sabbath come, and all by-gone quarrels removed, that there may be no standing controversies against you to begin the Sabbath vvith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pray vvith special solemn seriousness in reference to that day, that ye may have peace for vvhat is past, that ye may be in a right frame for the day; that the Minister may be helped to speak as it becometh; that others may be sitted to hear and joyn; that the Word and other Ordinances may be richly blest of God; and that the mercy of having the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances may be minded, vvith praise to the gracious giver of them, and suitably improved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the morning of that sweet and desirable day co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth (after we have fallen asleep in a special manner, as it were in the Lords arms, the night before, and left our selves there) 1. We would timely begin the work, and beware that either carnal thoughts get in, or the time be idly slipped over, but I say we would begin the work early; for it's for that end appointed, and sinful thoughts will not be kept out, but by filling the room otherwayes with what is spiritually profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Shew forth Gods loving kindness in the morning,</hi> saith the Psalm for the Sabbath, to wit, the 92. Let therefore the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of somewhat of these, or such like, begin with us, even when we are making ready, 1. somewhat of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whose day it is; 2. of heaven, and that happiness that is there; 3. of the works of God, who gave us and all the world  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> being, and who only preserveth the same; 4. of Christs redemption, and as closed and perfected on this day; which especially should be minded; that so thinking of our many and great obligations, and of the misery we had been in, had not that work of Redemption intervened, we may begin the day with a due impression of Gods greatness and goodness; of our own sinfulness, weakness, and misery; and of this bl <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssed remedy and out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>gate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We would address our selves to solemn prayer in secret, and that at greater length then on other dayes, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting with special petitions relating to the day, with all the seriousness we may win it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:55484:176"/>3. We would take a view of our own hearts, to see how and where we left the night before, and endeavour to have clearness betwixt the Lord and us as to our state, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes maintained; and renewed if it was; or attained if it was not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Too much time would not be spent in adorning or busking of folks bodies, or in making other provisions for them, but as the whole of it would be taken up in duties of worship (as we have before shewed) so some part of it would be set apart for secret reading, yea, for secret praising, thanksgiving, and singing, an exercise not unbecoming that day, as that fore-cited Psalm for the Sabbath day shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If thou be the Head of a Family, or livest in fellowship with others, then the family is gravely to be brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every particular member is to joyn with the rest: And here also prayers and other religious duties are to be doubled according to the ceremonial doubling of Sacrifices on the Seventh-day-Sabbath under the Law; for in secret, in families, and in publick, there would be more that day then in other dayes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Care and inspection would be taken so far as men can reach, that by none in the Society, neither secret nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate duties be neglected, nor publick duties abstained from, but that each may stir up one another, and more especially those whose places lead them to it, to the sutable sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the day in all the duties of it, and withal, it would be looked to, that none of the family be suffered to stay at home unnecessarily from the publick worship, or to be absent from the family worship.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Timely (that ye be not by haste discomposed) come to publick, modestly apparrelled (it's a shame to see how gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some come to publick worship on the Lords day) grave in your walk, wary and circumspect in your words, that they be spiritually edifying and sutable; watch over your eyes, that carnal or worldly looks steal you not away, nor distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per your hearts, but especially over your hearts, that they wear not out of a spiritual frame.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When ye come to the place of publick worship, if it be


<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55484:176"/>
a while a beginning, be still watchful, and the nearer ye come to it the more watchful; for temptations will be very ready to divert or discompose; there would be a frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of ejaculatory prayers in reference to every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for attaining and intertaining this composed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When publick worship beginneth, study to be (as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.) present to joyn in prayer, and praise, to hear what God will say, to receive it, to l <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y it up in your hearts, to be sutably affected with it, and to resolve through grace to practice it; <hi>(for blessed are they only who hear the word and do it):</hi> and this would be with delight, aiming aright at the end of the Ordinances, whatever they be, whereof we spoke somewhat on the second Commandement.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When the publick worship is as to its first diet closed, let not your minds turn carnal, but depart reverently from it, chearing your selves in God, fixing the convictions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, directions, instructions, &amp;c. in your mind, as ye have met with them, and be ruminating rather on these, then beginning to gaze or discourse with others on subjects that are not spiritual, and to edification.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As soon as ye can win, go in secret, and seek to have these things fastned and riveted betwixt God and you, and let that be your first work, and let the little time that interveneth betwixt the diets of publick worship till you return, be spent sutable to the day and the end of the duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When all the publick vvo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then call your Families and come together after secret seeking of God, and 1. be inquiring of one another what is remembred, that all being put together, ye may be helpful by your memories one to another; 2. ye would do this, not as if it were enough to tell over the vvords, but that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and their Uses may be fixed, and ye affected vvith them; Therefore 3. ye vvould do this vvith other duties of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, singing, and spiritual conference, as the occasion of it shall offer, vvith prayer to God before and after, being thus exercised till ye go again in secret to close the day as ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>

               <p>We will find the weight of this command yet more fully, by considering its reasons how it's explicated and pressed: This is done 1. by laying down the equity and extent of it, <hi>v.</hi> 9.10. 2. by pressing it from God's example.</p>
               <p>As to the first, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Six dayes shalt thou labour and do all thy work:</hi> These words may be looked on 1. As an obliging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, which is indeed very liberal; as if the Lord had said, all dayes are mine, yet I have given thee Six to do all thy work and labour that thou hast to do, therefore give me the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth. It is but a small retribution for Six to return a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth. 2. As a restriction, thou shalt do whatever work thou hast to do within the Six dayes, but none of it on the Seventh. 3. As a command whereby God distributeth our time, and commandeth Six for our work, and the Seventh for his: And thus these words forbid idleness, and command lawful diligence in these Six dayes; which we conceive here to be implyed,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because God is not carving out what time we may be idle in, but what time we should imploy in our own lawful works as well as in his; for it cannot be thought that he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us Six to be idle on; It must therefore be to work on, seeing as our life should be taken up in doing either what more immediately concerneth our selves, or what more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerneth God; so the scope of this command being to proportion our time betwixt these two, what is allowed for either of them, must imply an improving of it for that very end. 2. The opposition also will confirm this; These Six dayes are to be applyed to our work, as the Seventh is to be applyed to Gods, which is more then a permission, and if the negative part be imperative, <hi>in it thou shalt not work,</hi> then the positive, <hi>Six dayes shalt thou work,</hi> may well be understood


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55484:178"/>
so also. 3. Gods example will press it, for we are to follow it, not only in resting on the Seventh, but also in working in the Six dayes as he did. 4. Working these Six dayes cometh in as a mean to further and fit for the sanctification of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, for so a man putteth by his business, and has the more freedom for the <hi>rest</hi> on the Seventh, whereas idleness often sinfully necessitateth to the breach of it, and to a desire that it may be gone, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. And thus idleness is reproved here, and diligence commanded under one consideration, to wit, as the remove of the former and practise of the later do capacitate us to give God his due on his own day when it cometh: Even as they are also included in the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Thou shalt not steal</hi>; for as idleness becometh a snare and temptation to a man to steal, and hindreth him from works of Charity and sutable diligence in the works of his lawful Calling, readily preventeth the one, and capacitateth for the other; So is it here, for it's not unusual that the same sin and duty may be forbidden and commanded in diverse commands upon diverse considerations; And this agreeth well both with the words and scope of this command. And 5. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the holy and wise oeconomy of Gods goodness, our labour may be commanded to make his rest to be to us the more relishing and refreshing.</p>
               <p>The tenth Verse containeth three things for explication, 1. The Lords claim of the Seventh day, as having reserved that to himself, it's his, it's to him, and by him, and for him separated from other dayes. 2. A consequent flowing from this; Therefore that day is not to be imployed to any of our own works, no not the least, <hi>No manner of work,</hi> no word, no thought nor deed of any such sort under whatsoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text beside the excepted cases. 3. It's extension as to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, so to all ranks, Parent and Child, Master and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, &amp;c. yea, It's <hi>thou</hi> for thy self, and for all thou hast the oversight and charge of, Sons, Servants, Strangers, yea, and Beasts, not that they are capable of sanctifying a day more then the Beasts in <hi>Nineveh</hi> were of religious fasting, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. yet this sheweth what ought to be the Masters care, it being for his use that Beasts are put to work; God injoyneth all  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayes of abstaining from every thing that is a mans own


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55484:178"/>
work on the Sabbath, and will have him solemn in it: In a word, <hi>All within thy gates,</hi> looketh not only to Masters and all in their families or within their doors, but to Magistrates and Governours, and all within their Jurisdiction (Gates being the place of Judgment, and used in Scripture to shew the extent as well as seat of power) that they should see to their sanctifying of this day; and the failing of any under them is their sin when they endeavour not to prevent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it: And thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> understood this command, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. when he put forth his power, not only in contending with the native Nobles, but even against Strangers, for restraining them from violating this day.</p>
               <p>Hence we gather 1 That idleness is a sin, and that they will hardly give God his due on the Seventh day, who are not diligent in the duties of some lawful calling and station for Gods honour and others good through the Six dayes of the Week; and indeed this is often seen, that such are lazie, and careless, and idle on that day, passing it over even as they do other dayes, without any difference at all, except it be that they come to Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We gather that humane, whether Ecclesiastick or Civil, appointment of ordinary fixed days for worship throughout the whole day, beside the Sabbath, will not agree with this command allowing men six for labour. It's true, God might Soveraignly limit men, but where he hath given liberty (if it were but by concession) who can restrain?</p>
               <p>Concerning dayes therefore, we lay down these four: 1. That there can be no solemn setting apart of any day to any creature; thus Saints dayes are unlawful: for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath or day of <hi>rest</hi> is to the Lord, and to none other, it being a peculiar piece of worship to him who hath divided time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his worship and our work. And although men should keep the day, and alter the worship, yet this is a taking of that which was once abused, and never enjoyned, for to apply it to God, and wanteth not offence; even as the retaining of other things in worship which have been abused, and are not necessary, is offensive. 2. No man can institute any day, even to the true God, as a part of worship, so as to bind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to it, or to equal it with this day: That is a part of


<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55484:179"/>
Gods royal prerogative, and a thing peculiar to him to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and bless a day. 3. Even those dayes which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be set apart to and for God, and yet not as a part of worship, cannot be imposed in a constant and ordinary way (as Anniversary dayes and feasts are) because by an ordinary rule God hath given to man Six dayes for work, except in extraordinary cases he shall please to call for some part of them again. 4. Yet extraordinarily upon occasions of Humiliation, or of Joy, and Thanksgiving dayes, for that time, may be set apart for God, without wronging this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, even as in extraordinary times we may work, and not rest on the Sabbath day, though ordinarily we may not: This proportioning of time therefore is for the ordinary rule, but yet admitteth of the exception of extraordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We gather that Masters and Parents ought to have a special oversight of their own Children and Families in the worshipping of God, and that especially in reference to the sanctifying of this day; and that there is a special commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in worshipping of God amongst the several relations of a Family.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We gather that Magistrates, and all who have power over others, ought to see to the restraining of Vice, and to the performing of outward duties, particularly such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the sanctification of the Sabbath (as well as to abstain from, and to do such and such things themselves in their own persons) in and by these over whom they have power; and that it's no less scandalous and sinful for a Magistrate not to see that sin be crushed, that the Sabbath be sanctified, and the Ordinances of Religion be entertained and received and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced in and by those over whom he hath charge, then if he committed such sins himself, then if he discountenanced the Ordinances and brake the Sabbath himself, or suffered his own family or himself to be without the worship of God: Why? because these are within <hi>his gates,</hi> and he is to account for them: He is to rule for God, and their good which is mainly spiritual; he is to be a terrour to evil doers, as well as to be an incouragement to them that do well; and men are according to their places and parts to be forth-coming for


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55484:179"/>
God and the good of others. And yet this cannot be called a constraining or forcing of Consciences, for a Magistrate or Master thus to restrain these who are under them; it's but the using of that power, vvhich God hath committed to them to make men to do their duty, and to abstain from dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, and the punishing of them, if they do other ways; in vvhich respect he beareth not the Sword in vain.</p>
               <p>The 2. and main reason followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 11. wherein this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is three way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(Whence by the way vve may gather, that not only all Creatures vvere made, Angels even these that since turned Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that they vvere made within the Six days of Creation, vvhen Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth, Sea and all that was in them was made) Therefore all our works that are necessary to be done in the six working days, vvould be done and ended, that we may rest on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as he did.</p>
               <p>The 2. way is by his blessing of it. <hi>God blessed the Sabbath day,</hi> which is to be understood not simply in respect of the day, vvhich is not properly capable of blessing, but in respect of the true observers of it, he blesseth it to them, and he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them in it, which may be in these three: 1. That the rest of that day shall not prejudg them in their weeks work, but that their labour shall be therefore blessed, so that they shall miss nothing by observing that day, as the Lord blessed the Seventh year, whereon they rested, and yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they vvere as vvell provided as vvhen they laboured, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.20, 21, 22: And it's like that if vve vvill compare such as make Conscience to sanctifie the Sabbath with others, who


<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55484:180"/>
think and seem to gain by breaking of it, this will be found at the years end to be verified. 2. That the Lord hath set a part that day for a Spiritual blessing, and the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to his people (so the Bread and Wine are blessed in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to be a mean of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spiritual blessings to the worthy receivers) <hi>Is.</hi> 56. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.3. That God vvill abundantly manifest his gracious presence, and multiply his spiritual blessings that day upon it's due observers, more then on other days vvherein he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sought; as there is this day a double worship both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Duty, and of the day vvhereon it's done, so there shall be a double blessing beyond what is on other days; in vvhich respect, even prayers in, and towards, the Temple (while it stood by divine appoin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble obedience to this command, in the tender sanctification of the Sabbath; and withall a reason, why so few make progress in godliness, even little keeping holy the Sabbath as they ought.</p>
               <p>The 3. way is by his hallowing it, <hi>wherefore he hallowed it</hi> or <hi>sanctified it,</hi> that is <hi>per modum destinandi,</hi> or by vvay of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of it for holy uses, and separating it from other days (as is said): The inference <hi>wherefore</hi> as to the hallowing point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the reason or end wherefore God did it, to vvit, that there might thereby be an excitement left to men, to imitate God; and that man might not only have Gods command, but his example also to bind this duty on him.</p>
               <p>If it be asked here, vvhy God vvill have a day set apart for holy Exercises beside other days? It may be answered, 1. It's meet that God be acknowledged Lord of our time, by this Tribute being reserved to himself. 2. Because man having but a finite understanding, beside the now corruption of it, cannot be intensely taken up with spiritual and heavenly things and with temporal and earthly things, both at once, o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:55484:180"/>
at the same instant; for even <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency could not do that, therefore the Lord hath graciously set apart a day for mans help in that. 3. It's to teach man that his chief end is to converse with God, and to live vvith him, and that he ought to care in his own affairs along the week, and order things so as the Sabbath may be duly sanct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fied, vvhen it shall come in that sweet soul reposing converse with him. 4. To shew man wherein his happiness consisteth, it's even in this, to vvalk and converse with God, and to be in his worship; this i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his rest. 5. To shew the excellency of Religion, and of the Works of Piety, or of Gods Worship, above mens Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in earthly and worldly things: It vvas a Sabbath to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in innocency to be abstracted from his labour for the worship of God; the one is mens toyl, the other is mens spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual rest and ease, far contrary to that which men in the vvorld ordinarily think and judge.</p>
               <p>We see now how great and grievous a sin it is to break this command, and vvith vvhat care this day should be hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's a Command of the first Table, and so the breach of it is, in some respect, more then murther, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Stealing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it's included in the first and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Amongst all the commands of the first Table, yea all the commands, this religious observance of the Sabbath, is most forcibly pressed vvith more reasons, and vvith more full and particular explication: Because 1. All the commands hang some vvay on this; and obedience is ordinarily given to them vvith the same readiness, as this day is employed in Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. 2. It keepeth life, as it vvere, in all the rest, and vvhen men are could in this, so are they in all the rest. 3. This try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men in their love to God best: If indeed his company and service be more delighted in, then the World: And is a notable indication of the frame of the soul; it maketh proof both of their state and frame, as men are usually and habitually on the Sabbath, so in effect are they, as to these.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No breach of any command hath more aggravations; for 1. It is against reason and equity, vvhen God hath given


<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55484:181"/>
us so many and so good reasons for it. 2. It's high Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the Sabbath being a Mercy; and a great Mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is to be priviledged vvith access to converse vvith God a vvhole day of every vveek in duties of vvorship. 3. It's against Love, God's Love hath instituted it, and our Love should in a special manner vent it self to him on it. 4. It's cruelty against our selves; for the Sabbath kept holy, is back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the promise of a special blessing, and we by this sin prejudge our selves of that; yea the Sabbath rightly spent is a mean both of holiness and of nearness to God, of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to him and of communion with him, it promoteth both: So that it is eminently verified here, that these who sin against this command,  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Yea,</hi> 5.

               <p>OUR Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. summeth up the whole Law in these two words, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the two great Commandements, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> the two leggs that Piety in practise walketh upon; the one comprehendeth our duty to God, which runneth through all the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but doth more eminently exert it self in the first Four, whereof we have spoken: The other containeth our duty to our Neighbour; which is set down more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the last Six Commands, whereof we are now to speak; and however many do ignorantly and wickedly look on du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to man as somewhat extrinsick to Religion, and duty to God, yet both have the same authority, both are put in one


<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55484:184"/>
sum of the Law, both are written on Tables of Stone with the Lords own finger, and put within the Ark: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought with a proportionable care to inquire what God requireth of us as duty to himself: And we should make no less conscience of obedience to the one then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Before we come particularly to the fifth Command, we shall speak a little to these two, 1. Why love to God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the first and great command, and love to our Neighbour the second, and only like to the first, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.38. 2. why hath the Lord carved out mens duty to others as vvell as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</p>
               <p>For the former of these, consider in the first place that the commands of the second Table are equal to the commands of the first, in respect of the authority that injoyneth them, he that saith, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods before me,</hi> saith also, <hi>Thou shalt not kill, &amp;c. Jam.</hi> 2.11. In vvhich respect it is said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.39. <hi>the second is like unto this.</hi> 2. If vve compare the tvvo Tables together as to the matter contained in them, and the immediate object of each duty commanded; the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the first Table are greater, and the duties of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table lesser; the one relating more immediately, the other more mediately to Rel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gion, in vvhich respect they express peculiarly our love to God, vvhich is called the first and great command; for the first four commands require that vvhich in its ovvn nature is vvorship, and  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As to the 2. Why the Lord hath in so short a sum particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly set down our duty to others, as well as to himself, and shewed how every one should carry towards another: We would speak to it the rather, that there are six commands in the second Table, and but  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as well as the Lord, in pressing holiness, do ordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the duties of the second Table, as <hi>Luke</hi> 10.26. <hi>What is written in the Law? how readest thou? M <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th.</hi> 5.27. <hi>thou shalt not commit Adultery, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 13.8, 9 10. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the reasons of it may be these: 1. To teach his people that it is his will, that they should be holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; therefore there is no piece of duty called for, but it is comprehended in a command, even the least thing, eating, drinking, and whatsoever they do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.15, 16. he would have them careful to be holy not only in the Church, but also in the Market, in the shop, at home, abroad, not only in prayer, but at the plough, &amp;c. 2. To hold out the great extent of holiness, or what holiness he requireth in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; It was a great mistake in the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that they placed the main part of Religion in the performance of external duties of the first Table; whereas the Lord layeth both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles together, to tell that they must march up together in our practise, and that it will not be Holiness in it's self, and in Gods account to perform the one without the other: 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord would have his Law a perfect Rule, that the man of God might be perfect, throughly furnished to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good word and work. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. therefore is the second Table given, that vve may know how to vvalk towards others as vvell as towards God, that Masters may know their duty, Servants theirs, &amp;c. and that none are left to an arbitrariness therein, but that all are tyed to a Rule: 4. Because men are ready to slight holiness in reference to the second Table; hence there vvill be some kind of awe of God on men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the duties of the first Table, so that they dare not altogether neglect prayer, hearing the word, &amp;c. and yet they will make little or no conscience of loving their neighbour, or of shewing mercy, as we see in the <hi>Pharisees:</hi> 5. Because it is no less necessary for Christians living together as to their Being and vvell-being and mutual thriving, that they do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one of them to another with respect to the command, then that they all do their duty to him; how else can folks live well together in a Family or other Societies, if each therein do not duty to another? the neglect of this makes them as a house divided against it self, which cannot stand: 6. That


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55484:185"/>
the Lord may have the more clear and convincing ground of challenge against such as slight these commands, and live in envy, malice, oppression, &amp;c. for none can say he knew not these to be sins, <hi>Mic.</hi> 67. <hi>The Lord hath shewed thee, O man, what is good, that thou do Justice, and love Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth at the Duties of the second Table, the more to stop their mouths: If they should say, they knew not tha <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they should be holy, or how to be holy in these, he had it to say, that he had told them: For these, and such like reasons, the Lord hath been so part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cular in, and hath added his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto, the commands of the second Table as well as to these of the first, that we may lay the greater weight on them.</p>
               <p>From the Connection of the two Tables, we may observe these three general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That it is a necessary part of Religion in respect of the command of God injoyning it, and in order to our thriving in holiness, to be conscientious in duties to others, as well as in immediate duties to God, who in his Law requireth both. 3. That where kindly and true Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is given to the first Table, Obedience will be given to the second also, where Conscience putteth to pray and keep the Sabbath, it will also put to do duty to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; he purposely putteth these together in the Gospel, when the <hi>Pharisees</hi> would separ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It may be here inquired: what it is to be religious in these common duties we owe to others? <hi>Answ.</hi> Though we cannot instance in any thing, wherein Religion hath not it's place; yet we shall pitch on a  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew things, that it more especially imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And 1. It is necessary that the matter of the duty be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and 2. That respect be had to the command in the doing of it, a man must not only provide for his Family, but he must do it religiously, a Master must not use his Servants, as he pleaseth, the Servant must not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the Masters simplicity, but obey in  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

&amp;c. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22. in which places the Apostle presseth Servants to look to these things, while many of them had Heathen Masters (and what is spoken to them may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all, in all Callings and Stations, and serve to direct how to be religious in common duties). And 1. As to the end, it is required, that they serve not men only, but the Lord, and so eye his glory, the adorning of the Gospel, the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, there being nothing we do, wherein we ought not to have an higher end then our selves or men. 2. That they have a religious Motive in their Service, implyed in these words, <hi>not with eye Service, as men pleasers,</hi> but as doing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Lord in obedience to him, and not to men; not so much because their Masters command, as because God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth; not for the fashion nor meerly for profit, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause commanded of God. 3. That for the manner it be in singleness of heart, chearfully and readily. 4. That respect be had to the promise as well as to the command, for their through bearing in their Service, and for their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Faith of their being accepted through Christ as it is <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3.24. else it were a sad thing for a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an servant to be in hard Service, and have no more to expect but a bitt of meat and a penny-hire from men, but Christian servants may eye the heavenly reward in sweeping the house, as well as in the religious duties of Gods immediate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>For helps to understand the commands of the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we may consider these four Scriptures, which will hold out so many rules for that end: The 1. and principal one is <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.39. <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there should be a warmness of affection in us to our neighbour opposite to hatred (<hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17, 18.) revenge, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, inward grudging; and no doubt this warmness of love, making a man measure his duty to others by the love he hath to himself, will notably help to understand and observe all the duties of the second Table. The 2. i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Mat</hi> 7.12 <hi>Therefore all things, whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,</hi> which is a rule of general equity and is opposite to partiality and self-love, which undermineth all the duties of the second Table; and this is of a general and universal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,


<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55484:186"/>
to all persons and things, such as buying and selling, to duties betwixt man and wife, neighbour and neighbour, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Servant, &amp;c. The 3. is <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effect of love, not only to wish well to our neighbours, but to seek and procure their good, and it is opposite to sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishness and regardlesness of the good of others, if we be well our selves. The 4. is <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Be kindly affectionate one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with brotherly love in honour preferring one another,</hi> be kindly to, and manifest your esteem of, your Neighbour, not in a complementing way, but really and heartily, which by <hi>James</hi> is called the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> and by the Apostle <hi>John, the old</hi> and <hi>new commandement,</hi> wherein there is more Religion then many are aware of, more then in knowledg, speculations and empty notions; but oh! How short are we in these more common duties, that lye, as it were, among our feet? We come now to the Fifth command, which is the first of the second Table, and it containeth 1. a precept. 2. a Promise, and so it is called by the Apostle <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.2. <hi>the first Command with promise,</hi> which must be upon one of these grounds, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther i. because it is the first command that hath a particular promise, that promise in the Second command being general and applicable (as it is actually applyed there) to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or 2, because this is the first command of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table; and often in the new Testament the commands are reckoned and instanced by that Table, especially when du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties betwixt man and man are pressed: And if it be said, that it is the only command of the second Table, that hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, it is answered, it is the only command that hath an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press promise: Beside it is not absurd to read it thus, it is the first command (<hi>i.e.</hi>) of the second Table; and to press it the more, the promise added to it is mentioned; so that to urge obedience to it the more strongly, it is not only the first Command, saith the Apostle of the second Table, but it hath a promise also added to it: And this certainly is the Apostles scope to press its observation.</p>
               <p>In the precept we are 1. To consider the Object, <hi>Father and Mother:</hi> 2. The Duty, <hi>honour.</hi> 1. Again, concerning the first, it is to be considered that this Command in its scope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55484:186"/>
the duty that we owe to all Relations, whether they be above us, inferiour to us, or equal with us: This is clear from Christs summing all the second Table, and consequently this command with the rest, in that comprehensive general. <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self</hi>; and therefore our Neighbour in general must be the object of this Command, as well as of the rest, and so it taketh in all the duties of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that every one oweth to another, whatever be their place; there is a duty of honour and respect called for from every one to every one: And so <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.22. it is pressed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wives toward their Husbands; and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. upon Husbands towards their Wives, which must be comprehended here: Thus Father and Mother are here to be largely and synecdo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cally understood, one sort of Relations being in a figurative manner put for all the rest. 2. Under them are comprehended all Superiours for place, in Church or Common-wealth, who in Scripture get the Title of Fathers, as Magistrates, Supreme and Subaltern, Ministers and all Church-Officers, Teachers, Overseers, and all in the place of Fathers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. yea, they who are to be esteemed, as such for gifts of Learning, Wisdom, Grace and Piety, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.2. or for their worldly means and outward estate, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.8. or for their age, and the reverence due to them on that account, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.12. in a word, any sort of em <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nencie putteth one in that roll of Fathers largely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, though they be not properly such. 3. We are called in the first place to look to the duties of this relation, as it is domestick, such as of a Master over the Servant, of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band over the Wife, &amp;c. and then cometh the carriage of one toward another in general, and though most properly the duties of Parents, mediate or immediate, over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Nephews, be here pointed at, which is most literal, yet the former also is included, all particulars of that kind being by a figure comprehended under one.</p>

in this, as well as in the disposition of the members of the body mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, and 24. the excellent attemperation of Gods wisdom is very conspicuous, by bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing the greater authority of the Father with the greater pains and care of the Mother, that the Childrens duty of love, honour, and gratitude, may return to both with a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table equality. 2. She is added to shew that it is not only the most eminent Superiour or Neighbour to whom honour is due, but even these who have more weakness, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Mother</hi>: Hence it is that alwayes almost in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, where duty to the Father is pressed, the Mother is also named with him, to shew that Children should not think that less respect is due to the Mother than to the Father; yea, sometimes the Mother is prefixed to the Father, as <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.3. <hi>Ye shall fear every man his Mother and his Father,</hi> which is done to meet with the humour of many who are ready to lessen their duty to their Mother, and therefore we are called to it even in her old age, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.22. and to guard against despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of her then, which is too readily and frequently inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Thus doth the Lord provide in his word against our corruption, which is ready to take advantage of debording and outbreaking at the weakest part.</p>
               <p>If it be further asked, Why all Superiours, yea all Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, are spoken of as <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers? Answ.</hi> These reasons are obvious from the scope: It is 1. to shew that the duties of this Command are mutual amongst all relations, it giveth Superiours their due, yet so as that it teacheth them also how to carry toward their Inferiours, that is, to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to them; and that the relation necessarily implyeth a mutual tye; therefore this Command doth not only direct inferiours in their duty towards Superiours, but also Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in their duty to their Inferiours. 2. They get this name to make their subjection to each other, and their mutual relations and duties the more sweet and kindly, when the subjection is to be given as by a Son to a Father, and when it is exacted and expected as by a Father from a Son; which consideration should be a kindly motive to all mutual duties, and also an inducement to hide infirmities, and to construct tenderly of failings. And thus the denomination of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural


<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55484:187"/>
relation seems to be borrowed, to establish and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the positive Relation, which of its self is not so binding of the Conscience by Nature's light. So much for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Duty.</p>
               <p>The Duty itself here called for, is <hi>honour,</hi> which is also largely to be understood, both as it taketh in the inward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of others in our heart, and also the evidencing of this in outward expressions in our conversation: For by this Command it appeareth that there is, 1. Some eminencie in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man; 2. That every one should observe that and honour it in another; What is it then to <hi>honour them</hi>? It is not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement them, and only seemingly to reverence them, but it consisteth especially in these, 1. In observing and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is eminent in any for nature, grace, station, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidental things, and if there appear no more in a man, yet as he beareth any thing of Gods Im <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ge, or is a Christian and Member of Christs Church, he is thus to be honoured. 2. There ought to be an esteem of him, and we should really have an honourable account of him, and that in some respect beyond our selves in some one thing or other. 3. It lyeth much in love, and kindly or affectionate reverence, as is hinted <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. 4. It taketh in obedience according to our stations, flowing from a disposition of heart to obey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 5. It reacheth both to the thought of the heart, and to our secret carriage, there should not be in our secret cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber any despising or wishing ill to him, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.20. 6. It comprehendeth a holy fear and awe that should be joyned with it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.3.</p>
               <p>Honour being thus fixed in the heart, it is to be expressed 1. In words, by respective and reverent speaking and giving answers, or making suits; <hi>Sarah</hi> called her Husband <hi>Lord,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. 2. It is expressed in gestures, by bowing, rising up, keeping silence sometimes before others, <hi>Job</hi> 29. not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering again, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9. saluting, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.15. 3 In deeds, by obedience and testifying respect that way which is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>gratitude,</hi> therefore obedience to Parents, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1. is dravvn from this Command, vvhich presseth obedience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men according to their relations. 4. In our means, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating thereof vvhen it is called for; so tribute to


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55484:188"/>
vvhom tribute is due, <hi>Rom</hi> 13.7. and double honour to the Elders that rule vvell. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. according to the acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of honour used in that precept, <hi>Honour the Lord with thy substance, Prov.</hi> 3.9. 5. In our Prayers for them, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. 6. In covering their infirmities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.21, 22.</p>
               <p>As the breaches of this Command may be easily gathered hence, as being opposite to these, so this rule is alvvayes to be carried along in practice, that this honour and obedience must be still <hi>in the Lord</hi>; that is, there must be a reserving to the Lord his due, for God is the supreme F <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

selves, importeth the kind and reality of our love, we are to love him no less truly then our selves (for we also come in here as the objects of our own love) but we are some way to honour him beyond our selves.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, How can that be? 1. That one should love all men? Should we love them all alike and equally? And 2. ought we to prefer every man to our selves?</p>
               <p>To the former we say 1. This Command requireth, as to the object, that we love all men, excluding none from our love, good or bad (while they are within the roll of men, capable to be prayed for) friend or enemy, for we should love them that hate us, and bless them that curse us. 2. As to the main things desired, or the subject matter of our wishes for them, our love should be alike toward all; our love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a willing of good to others, we should desire the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est good to all men, that is, peace with God, Christ, Heaven, Sanctification, Repentance, &amp;c. that lead to it, there is here no inequality, nor two Heavens, a gre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter and a lesser to be the subject matter of our wishes and desires. 3. If we consider our love as to the act of loving in the kind of it, it is equal, we being called to love sincerely, cordially, and with the whole heart, perfectly, every man.</p>
               <p>If ye ask then, Wherein is there any difference allowed? <hi>Answ.</hi> If we consider 1. The effects of this Love, they may and ought to be more manifested towards one then another; we are to pray more for one then another; to communicate and to distribute more to one then to another, according to the opportunities we have, and according to the particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and callings that God putteth us in; for beside our general relation to all men, we have particular relations to some beyond others; hence may a man do more for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and these of his own house, then for others; so may we pray for some men more and oftner, as their necessity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and as they may be more useful. 2. In respect of frequencie, our Love may and ought to vent it self more frequently towards some then others, and so it differeth from that general Love we owe to all. 3. In respect of sympathy, we are to be more touched with the hurt and hazard of some, and more sensibly desirous of their good then of that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55484:189"/>
and so our love ought to affect us more, and stir more sensibly in reference to some then others, as in the case of a woman toward her Child, and of one dear friend to another; such was the sympathy between <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who though they loved many others, yet was there a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar sympathy betwixt themselves as to all things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them, good and evil; this may arise from natural relations, particular obligations, mutual familiarity, and other special grounds. 4. According to the diversity of concurrent circumstances, we may sometimes wi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> temporal good to one, and sometimes temporal rods to another; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding alwayes it be out of a true desire of, and respect to their spiritual good. 5. In respect of compla <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>encie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light accompanying the act of loving there may be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for there may be much more delight and satisfaction in loving one then another, as there appeareth more of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in one then another; so godly men love even natural men, if of good parts, civil and friendly, more then others that a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e destitute of such qualifications; but if men be also gracious, they not only love them the more, but also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce the more, and have the greater complacencie in them on that account.</p>
               <p>If it be asked from whence these differences, as to the effects of our love do slow? <hi>Answ.</hi> They may arise 1. From natural relations; 2. From the d <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From favours, so men may love their benefactors more (in the forementioned sense) then others; 5. From civil relations and interests; 6. They may arise from a religious and christian interest and relation, so we are to love the godly, not only more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men in the world, but also we are to love them 1. on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account than we love others, to wit, because they are such, because they are true members of the same body, are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, and have his image shining in them: 2. With more delight and acquis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If it be asked then, How differeth love to the godly from common love? <hi>Answ.</hi> That there is a difference, is clear from the forec <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted Scriptures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. and from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. where brotherly kindness is distinguished from charity: In a word then, it differeth 1. In it's acquiescing complacencie, though there may be some sort of complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie comparatively in others, yet simply and properly it is to be exercised toward the godly. 2. It is on another account as is said, to wit, as they are loved of God, love to them run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in another channel, and hath another spring and rise, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> 3. It should be in a more high and intense degree, as to its exercise, because God is more concerned in them; and though good should be done to all, yet especially to this <hi>houshold of Faith.</hi> And the manifestation of our love even towards the godly may be less or more, according as less or more of God appeareth in them, or in their way.</p>
               <p>If it be further asked? How we can love wicked men, and if their being such should not marr our love to them? <hi>Answ.</hi> We speak not here of such as are debarred from the prayers of the people of God, and who are known to have sinned the sin which is against the Holy Ghost; nor do we speak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely of final enemies, these (according to all) being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from our love: But we say that other particular wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, as to their persons (whatever hatred we may bear to their evil deeds) are to be loved in the forementioned sense, yet their wickedness may 1. marr complacencie in them, that they cannot, nor ought not to be delighted in, nor with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure conversed with. 2. It may marr the effects of love in the evidences and manifestations of them, for that Christians may, yea, and sometimes should keep up all or most testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of it from some, is clear from the Apostles direction en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the <hi>noticing of some,</hi> that they may be ashamed, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.14. 3. It may marr love in ordering its exercises, yea, and occasion the seemingly contrary effects, as their wishing for, and doing of some things temporally adverse and cross to them, for their greater shame and humiliation, as is evident


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55484:190"/>
in the Psalmists prayer, <hi>Psalm</hi> 83.16. <hi>Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O Lord:</hi> so some out of love are to be corrected, yea punished temporally, yet with a desire of, and respect to their eternal welfare.</p>
               <p>If it be yet asked, If, and how, one is to love himself? <hi>Answ.</hi> Self-love is so connatural to us, that in effect it is the mediate result of our sense of life, and consequently the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry relish and endearment of all enjoyments, the spring of self-preservation, and the best measure pointed out by our Lord himself, of the love and duty that we owe to others, which as it is the mean whereby we taste and see that God is good, and how great his goodness is to us, so it ought prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to referr it self, and all its pleasing objects, to him as the fountain of all, who is indeed Love; but yet it is that wherein ordinarily men do much exceed, as especially these following wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They exceed in it when themselves are proposed as the end of their own actions, as it is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. when their own things sway more with them, and are sought more by them then 1. the things of God, to which the first place is alwayes due; and 2. then publick things, and the things of others, even in the cases wherein these do require the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it is terminated on the wrong object, as when they run out in the immoderate pursuit of bodily and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, caring more, if not only, for the body, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the better part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When it is laid out for the pleasing of corrupt self, and the making of provision for the Flesh to fulfil its Lusts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. Self-love under these considerations is corrupt, and  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Self-love, or love to our self, is allowable when qualified with the following properties. 1. When it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient and subordinate to higher ends, and can hazard it self, and deny it self for Gods honour, for a publick good, yea, and in some cases, out of respect to the good of others also, so a righteous man should, and when at himself, will do much, though with his own hazard, for a Christian friend, for the safety or edification of the Godly, or in defence of


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55484:190"/>
the interest of Christ. 2. When it is drawn out after spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, and it's on these mostly that pains are taken, as how to grow in grace, to have a good conscience, to have the soul saved, sin mortified, &amp;c. 3. When outward things are desired for the former ends, as when we pray, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> that we may promove these ends, being willing to want them when they may not stand with these ends, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring life, means, &amp;c. in so far only, as they may be useful for the attainment of them. As the first self-love marreth duties to God, and thwarteth with them; so the second advanceth them and sweyeth strongly, yet sweetly to them.</p>
               <p>Again, This Command is the first in order of the second Table, and is peculiarly backed with a promise, to shew the concernment of the duty called for, the scope of it being to regulate that respect which each one oweth to another, that they may give each other due honour as the first effect of love, and the great band of all the other commands and enjoyned duties of the second Table, God being pleased to provide for that respect and honour that is due from one man to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as well as for the security of their persons and estates, yea, in some respect he preferreth this Command, to wit, that one hurt not another in their honour and estimation to these other relating to their persons and estates, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he requireth honour in the first place, and afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth the duties of not <hi>killing,</hi> not <hi>stealing, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although every man doth love respect and estimation among others, yet there is nothing wherein more liberally and even prodigally men incroach upon one another, then by the neglect and denyal of this duty, and by the contrary sin, though it be most directly opposite to love, and that general equity commanded, whereby we should <hi>Do to others as we would have them to do to us.</hi> Therefore we conceive the Lord hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred this to the other five Commands, and hath so backed it with a promise, and also set it down positively, <hi>Honour thy Father, &amp;c.</hi> for this end, that we may know it is not enough not to despise them, if they be not also positively honoured by us, even as it is not enough, not to prophane the Lords day by common and unnecessary works, if we do not posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively sanctifie it: And it is not for nought that this duty is


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55484:191"/>
so much pressed, being a main bond of Christian and Civil Fellowship, keeping folks within the just bounds and limits which God hath set unto them.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, What this duty of honouring our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour doth include? <hi>Answ</hi> It doth include these five things; 1. Respect to our Neighbours person; 2. to his place; 3. to his qu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lifications, either as he is furnished with natural or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abilities, or as he is gracious; 4. to his accidental fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture in externals, as riches, credit with others, &amp;c. so <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> honoured <hi>Nabal</hi>; 5. in respect of mens actions as they deserve, or as they have done, or atchieved any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by good cometh, or may come to the Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. <hi>Honour</hi> includeth the giving respect to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in all these.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, If and how honour differeth from love? <hi>Answ.</hi> It differeth from love, in that love properly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men more generally, as they are capable of good, which we wish unto them: but this considereth them more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, as so and so qualified, and having such and such things in them deserving respect; for honour being a bearing of testimony to something worthy of respect in such a one, it doth first consider what is worthy of honour in the person, that so it may bear a testimony truly, according as it findeth ground.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, Whether outward expressive evidences of honour are alwayes to be given to the persons honoured? <hi>Answ.</hi> Although indeed in honouring of God there needeth not alwayes an external expressive evidence of it; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, a man may in the croud of company honour God by ejaculatory Prayer without such external expression, as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> did in the presence of the King and Queen, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4. yet honour given to others must not only have the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of something worthy of estimation within, that it degenerate not into distimulation, as the ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing strain doth, but must also have expressions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, to bear witness unto that which is within, in gesture, words, or otherwayes, as men are called to the giving of them.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, What honour doth import, and what may


<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55484:191"/>
be comprehended under it? <hi>Answ.</hi> Under honour are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, 1. Charitable constructions of mens actions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by what is doubtful is exponed to the best: It will not, nor ought not, I grant, determine a man to esteem every man gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious whom he knoweth not to be prophane, nor every thing to be truth spoken by him which he knoweth not to be false: But 1. it will keep a man from running into the extream of contrary judging of him as wicked, false, carnal, natural, graceless (a lamentable ill amongst even good people, too ready often to give such designations and epithets to their Neighbours, whether inferiour or superiour to them, on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little ground, and sometimes to persons, who, without breach of charity, may be supposed for true Religion, not to be much, if any thing at all, short of themselves) or such an one as some may call him, even though he know nothing of his goodn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, yet because he knoweth not his evil, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth to conclude so harshly of him. 2. It will make him live with him as (to him at least) negatively gracious, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of what he saith for truth, not knowing any thing to the contrary, in so far as Christian prudence will permit him; and thus far a charitable construction will lead us in reference to our Neighbour, for we are not bound positively without ground to determine a thing to be right or wrong, or a man gracious or wicked when we have not certain knowledge, and so may be deceived; but we ought to walk with men whose hypocrisie and dishonesty we know not, as with good and honest men, yea, even where some slips or escapes are to be found. 2. Honour comprehendeth and taketh in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity so far as it respecteth and relateth to a humble carriage amongst men, which is a grace moderating a man so, that he preferreth not himself inordinately to others, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of place or parts, or other such like grounds, which Christ commendeth in the Gospel, and enjoyneth that men should not love the uppermost rooms, or first salutations, but seek to prefer others, and be to their own honour as weaned children, or new-born babes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> readier to serve a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fame, that they may be accounted of, and be in good repute vvith others; endeavouring their vindication then most vvhen they are vvronged; seeing a <hi>good name</hi> is so essential a part of honour, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.1. 4. It taketh in praise vvhich is the commendation of a fact praise vvorthy, or of such and such laudable things, bestowed on the person by God. 5. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation and rejoycing at anothers good, as if it vvere our own. 6. It taketh in mercy and communication by vvay of charity to others.</p>
               <p>Now all these effects of honour are to be drawn forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the stations we are in, and the relations we su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain, and as we stand in reference to oth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> according to their stations and relations, of husband, wife, servant, master, son, father, friend, &amp;c. And no doubt more even of this outward respect would contribute not a little to our hearty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable living together.</p>
               <p>These being some of the commanded duties, the contrary vices are prohibited, as 1. <hi>Rash judging,</hi> taking up a prejudice upon unsure grounds that will not bear such a thing; and this may be either a weakness proceeding from ignorance, or a prejudice slowing from malice at the mans person, which is more readily inclined to construe so and so of such a man and his Actions then of another: The first may be removed, and the person faulty in it will be desirous to have it removed, and will esteem more of the person mistaken, when it is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as <hi>Eli</hi> did of <hi>Hannah</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.17. The second is hardly removed and admitteth not of the mean which may remove it, leaving no room for information, Apology, Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Presumption</hi> are condemned here, <hi>Pride</hi> whereby one with <hi>Diotrephes</hi> affecteth the preheminency, a higher office or precedency in the same office, the first saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the highest room at Table, &amp;c. <hi>Presumption,</hi> whereby a man is ready to undertake something above his ability, as if he were more fit and able for it then indeed he is; even as on the contrary Pusillanimity is a scarring to reach to, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon, what a man is able for, and called to. 3. <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>vain Glory,</hi> much blazing abroad our own good actions, or delighting to have them known to others, that they may blaze them. 4. <hi>Ostentation</hi> making shew of what good is in

us, and following what is good for that end, and in such a way as it may be taken notice of by men, as the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who only sought their own glory in their prayers and alms. 5. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> which is a grief and sadness for the honour of another, that such a good Turn should fall in his hand, or that he should be honoured, followed or respected, as if his being honoured and preferred did detract from their own credit and honour; it differeth from <hi>fear,</hi> which is a sadness that an Enemy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, because they may suffer and be in hazard from him; this Envy floweth principally from pride, whereby folks would monopolize all honour, and what is honourable unto themselves, and are grieved when it is not so, a manifest fruit of the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. and a prime and most destructive ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Graces, and yet very rife in this hypocritical age, and much incident to religious folks, especially to Ministers and persons of gifts; an ambitious humour, coveting to excel and darken all that are about them, when as it were much more Christian and congruous for a man to whom God may have given more then he hath done to others, selfdenyedly to vail, and studiously to obscure himself in some Cases, least he sadden or Eclipse others, or draw more Observation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. 6. <hi>Emulation,</hi> which is a seeking to go beyond another in esteem, not from any love of vertue, but only out of an envious desire of having the preheminence of such a person, of out-stripping him, and of bearing him down in his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; it followeth on the former. 7. <hi>Detraction,</hi> a vice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men underhand whisper what may be to the dishonour of another, even though it be a truth, using insinuations, and such a manner of seeming respect to the detracted, as may make the blot and infamy to stick, as when many commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are given  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and such like are plainly against this command and forbidden in it.</p>
               <p>There are some Questions that do arise from what is said:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Quest.</hi> If all men should be honoured? Yea, if even wicked men also?</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>h cannot be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as if they were gracious; neither can any place or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, meerly as such, have what is due and proper to grace at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it without guilt, the doing vvhereof vve conceive is that sin reproved by <hi>James cap.</hi> 2.1. to vvit, the accounting of rich men, that vvere vvicked to be more religous then others not so rich, and possibly there may be much guilt of this sin in Titles and Dedications of Books, vvhere the <hi>most religious, pious, &amp;c.</hi> are often unwarrantably put amongst the Styles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet there is a civil honour, vvhich they may get, and vve are called to give them upon several accounts, as 1. on the account of their place, if <hi>Magistrates, honour to whom honour is due,</hi> is in that respect enjoyned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. 2. Of their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they be <hi>Fathers, Mothers, &amp;c.</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.2. i <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.3. Of their other Qualifications and parts, or on other accounts, yea even on this general account, that they are men having immortal souls, capable of grace, and of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to Gods Image, our evidencing of honour to them is called for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Quest.</hi> If rich men should be honoured? <hi>Answ.</hi> Riches of themselves, and for themselves, are not honourable, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they make the Possessor such: But Riches may make one capable of doing more good, and of being more useful in Church and Commonwealth, and consequently of being deservedly honoured; and no doubt a rich man is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, as a steward intrusted vvith some thing to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the honour of God, and for the good of others; and r <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55484:193"/>
it self so grosly, there vvas no such honour due to him, nor given him.</p>
               <p>As to vvhat the Apostle <hi>James</hi> discourseth <hi>cap</hi> 2.1.2. certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he doth not there simply condemn all reverencing of rich men, but the doing of it, 1. On a religious account, and in religious things, 2. When there was only care taken for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating them in Assemblies, and no care at all for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating poor ones, as if because they were not rich they had been without all interest in the Gospel; the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the one and that joyntly with the contempt of the other made the fault. 3. It was condemned by him, because done for an evil end, <hi>viz.</hi> for flattering of rich men, these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by him for doing it, not being single, but selfish in what they did, seeking only their own advantage. 4. The prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of rich men as, and because, they are such, as more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious then poor ones, who it may be have much more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion then they, is the acceptation of persons condemned here by the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> to wit, when a rich man is preferred as more godly, and only because more rich, before a poor man, alike godly or more godly then he.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. Wherein consisteth the difference that is betwixt the respect, which is to be given to a good man, and that which is to be given to another, when both are alike in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It may be that in outward signs and evidences of respect there be no difference, the one may get as low cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies as the other. But 2. There is a heart Testimony and respect, such as <hi>Paul</hi> had in the consciences generally of all, but especially of his gracious hearers, that is, an Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he is worthy of honour, not only for the outward capacity he is in to do good, but for actual improving of it to that end, which is a far other thing then outward Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this there is a difference betwixt the respect given to the one, and that which is given to the other; in that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of gracious conformity to the Image of God, beside o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common commendable Qualifications, being discovered in the good man, he is (at least ought to be) with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency delighted in, then the natural man, though as


<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55484:194"/>
to outward things in the same Station with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Honour floweth more natively to the Godly, the object drawing it unto it in a native way.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, whether or not a man may seek his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and fame, and how? <hi>Answ.</hi> A man ought not to seek it, as men of the world do, to satisfie the lust of the pride of life, nor inordinately beyond his line, nor even in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, nor ever as his last end, and as the chief thing; for honor being the Testimony of excellency, and a good name, a Testimony of that vertue which is in a man, he is first to study vertue as the solid good, whereof the other is but the lustre, vertue being indeed the main thing to be sought after, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a good name (as to men) be seperate from it or not. 2. Yet may it be sought as a thing that is desirable and good (it being sought in a right manner and by way of concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) <hi>a good name being above great riches,</hi> Prov. 22.1. 3. It is ever to be sought in the way of vertue and well doing; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and crooked dealing being never warrantable, and in the following of Good, men are to walk through ill report as well as good report. 4. It is to be sought in things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Godliness, not in riches, or honor, or eloquence, or great learning, but honesty, faithfulness, holiness; thus <hi>Paul</hi> disclaimeth, seeking the applause of being a learned, or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent or wise man, he disdained these; seeking it only in the faithful, single and zealous discharge of his Ministry among the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> 5. This Testimony or Respect is to be sought after even with a piece of holy ambition in the Consciences of others, but not so much in the outward evidences and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of it: To be commended and approved in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of these we live among is desirable, and that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Paul</hi> himself aimed at. 6. This respect would be a step for an higher end, that so all our respect may be improved and made use of for the honour of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Quest.</hi> If it be asked how, and in what manner, are we to pursue or seek our own honour? <hi>Answ.</hi> See what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Them that honour me I will honour</hi>: And first the honouring of God is praise-worthy and honourable in it self; Gold hath not more its lustre, a Rubie or Diamond its beauty, nor the sun its light and glory, then godliness and


<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55484:194"/>
vertue, whereby God is honoured, are radiant to their own praise. 2. If after by reason of human infirmity, and other disadvantages, this radiancy be obscured, or through mens ignorance, folly or malignity, this worthiness not observed or not esteemed, the Lord undertakes for the former, and vindicates from the latter, telling us plainly, <hi>them that honour me, I will honour,</hi> and hence it is, that we so often find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, honour attributed to those things that are so low and mean in the eyes of men, as 1. To taking with Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.16 2. To yielding to Correction, even when unjust, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. 3. To Submission to parents, as in this command. 4. To humility and to passing of wrongs, and ceasing from strife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.3. In a word therefore the high-path way to honour, is by humility, the fear of the Lord, obedience, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and selfdenyedness: Whereby the Lord, as it were, to make honour the more honourable, will have it rather to be his pure gift, then either our study or purchase.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 6. If it be asked, how one can fulfill that part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, enjoyning us to prefer another to our selves? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is not to be universally and simply understood, as if we were called in every thing to do so, and to every person; for we may know that some are more ignorant and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane than we are in many practises, guilty of things we may be free of, and so we are not obliged to judge contrary to truth: Yet 2. in some one respect or other we may prefer them, as 1. In that they may have something beyond us, they are possibly more humble, more single, zealous, diligent, &amp;c. though inferiour to us in other things. 2. They may have much good we know not. 3. We certainly know, or at least may know, more evil in our selves than in them, and therefore are to prefer them to our selves. 4. We know more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of our own evils then of theirs; and therefore sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply we may without hypocrisie prefer men generally to our selves, though we in particulars could not do so, nor give unto every one in every thing the precedency.</p>
               <p>We come now to speak a little of the promise, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to stir up to the more serious Observation of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and as for the nature of it, it is a temporal one, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly applyed to <hi>Israel</hi> here, yet generally agreeing to all,


<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55484:195"/>
and so applyed as to the substance of it by the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.2.3. where he putteth <hi>earth for land,</hi> whereby he insinuateth that it is to be understood of any land wherein God shall please to cast a mans Lot to reside or inhabit as well as of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> so then,</p>
               <p>If it be asked, whether or not this promise is to be simply understood, and the accomplishment of it without any restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction expected or looked for? <hi>Answ.</hi> Although this promise seems to have a peculiar respect unto that Dispensation, wherein not only the Saints everlasting rest was prefigured by that temporal rest in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but also the more obscure manifestations of the life and immortality brought to light by the Gospel, supplyed as it were by more full and assuring promises of earthly blessings, yet seeing the Apostle, as we have touched, doth in the pressing of this command al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so accommodate to us, it's promise, we think it holds out that such, who through Grace are enabled to give obedience to the command, may by vertue of the promise annexed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from God even outward things, in so far as the having of them, shall be for their good and spiritual advantage. And 2. They may with confidence promise themselves, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have in the world, or how many or few days, soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they may have in it, yet all shall be with Gods blessing and peace: And 3. That their death shall never be untimely: And 4 What seeming defect soever may be in the performance as to length of days, here shall be abundantly made up by eternity hereafter in Heaven; what then vvill or can be the prejudice of few days on Earth?</p>
               <p>From the annexing of this promise to the command, these two thing clearly follow, 1. That there are temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made to Godliness. 2. That a Godly man hath that right which none other hath to inherit the earth.</p>
               <p>If it be asked here, Whether or not a wicked man hath a right to any thing in the world? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold right, the first is, a <hi>creature-right,</hi> whereby any of Gods creatures have a right to any thing in his creation that is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, when it is simply necessary, and not occupied by another under the like need; and after the similitude of this right, Crowes, and so of other living creatures, may take their


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:55484:195"/>
meat on the field of any man; thus a man starving, may for himself, or his brother (if in the like condition) when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per owner of any Corn cannot be gotten, put to his hand and take of them for preventing of death by hunger; and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes it may be in other things, all things being made for the use of man at the first, and committed to him; and the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dividing of mens lots and portions, having been but the better to further that end, and not to marr it, is not to take place when it thwarteth with it; thus the Disciples did pluck and eat the ears of Corn when they were an hungred, though the corn was not their own: God also, who hath the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dominion, hath so given to man a property, that he hath reserved a right to himself to make use of it (when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth) for the good of other creatures; thus he provideth for Crows, Ravens, &amp;c. out of one mans stock or other. 2. There is a positive or <hi>Civil right</hi> amongst men, so that one man hath right to such a piece of Land, another not; both these rights a wicked man may have, and both Land and such right to it good men may often want in particular cases? So that if there were a civil contest betwixt a good man and a wicked for some Land or other such thing, the qualifications of the persons would neither make the right of the one better, or more valid, nor of the other, worse or less valid, as we may see <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.15. 3. There is a right by grace which san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the former rights, and putteth a man in case not only warrantable before men, but also before God, to make use of the creatures, so th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They may pray for these things so far as they are needful, and may confidently expect them, and go to God for them by vertue of that right, ere they get them, so <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.11. It is our daily bread by allowance, and promised before we get it. 3. If a natural man abound, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not promise himself the continuance of meat till the end of his life; no, not so much as his dinner to morrow, nor life till then; but if a Believer live, he may expect the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of as much food as shall be necessary for him; if he have nothing, he may confidently promise himself both life and food to morrow, if either or both of them be needful more nor a wicked man that hath more wealth, health, and outward protection can do. 4. He may promise himself the blessing and the sanctified use of what he enjoyeth, which another cannot. 5. He may have peace, whether he have or want, in the injoyment of creatures, or in their scarcity, because he he hath a right to them, for it is not from want of right to creature comforts that scarcity of them cometh, but God, like a wise and skilful Physitian keepeth back meat for health where there is abundance in the right, and to be given also when needful; so that comparing him with a wicked man, whether he have or want, whether he enjoy more plentifully, or be in scarcity, he hath still the better of him by far; which should make us all love godliness the more, which hath so great an advantage as this attending it.</p>
               <p>Thus much in short of the promise annexed to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55484:196"/>
third and fourth Chapters of the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians</hi> (which the blest Author was then in his Sabbath afternoon. Sermons opening up to the same Congregation that heard him lecture on the Commands) and all of them being, too many at least, more known, then alass they are practised (though indeed we know no more in Gods account then we singly desire, design, and endeavour through grace to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, and they all, and they only having a good understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that keep his Commandements, <hi>John</hi> 13.17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 111.10.) and since withal, if the generals we have hinted at in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of this Command be well understood, seriously pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and consciensciously in the Lords strength, practically improved; they will not a little, through his blessing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute for helping us, sutably to acquit our selves in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all the particular duties of these several relations; we shall now forbear to be particular; and shall only say in the general of these station and relation duties, that, as, if a serious Christian and truly godly man be sought after, he is in a special manner to be found in them, so, when sanctifiedly, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably and seasonably performed, they in a special manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Doctrine of God, and keep it from being blasphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bear a very real and evident testimony to the truth and reality of Religion in the Professors of it, and withal are a notable mean of convincing men, and even of winning and gaining them who obey not the Word, as may be clearly gathered from <hi>Luke</hi> 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 <hi>v</hi> 13, 14, 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. compared together.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed further amongst many Questions that might arise here, one word to these two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether ought a Father to love his Son, or a Son to love his Father most? <hi>Answ.</hi> The Son ought to love his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most, as representing most of God; and the Father ought to love his Son most, as comprehending most of himself; such mutual respects may exceed one another on different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether is the Father or Magistrate most to be obeyed, if they command contrarily? <hi>Answ.</hi> If that which is commanded be a thing belonging to the Magistrates place to


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55484:197"/>
command in, as where such a one should live, what charge or office he should bear in the Common-wealth, and such like, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the Magistrate is to be obeyed, for these things are sought by the Magistrate from him not as a Son, but as a member of the Common-wealth, whose good principally should be eyed, and had respect to: but if it be a thing that belongeth to the Father, and not to the Magistrate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in, as what Husband or Wife a Child should marry, and such like, that belongeth to the Father as a Father, and so is to be obeyed, notwithstanding of the contrary command of the other.</p>
               <p>The scope of this Command being to moderate men in their excessive desires after honour, and to direct and regulate them in giving respect to others, and in seeking of it to themselves, and to inform us, that by no means we should wrong the estimation of others more then their persons and estates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ere we lay aside speaking of it, it will be meet to speak a little of <hi>humility,</hi> and the contraries and opposits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>That humility relateth to this Command, and is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under it, appeareth from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12 10. <hi>Phil</hi> 2.3. And is a grace so necessary and useful to Christians, that it ought especially to be headed and taken notice of. It may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a threefold respect, 1. In respect of God, this humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to be in reasonable creatures to God as their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, they being nothing, and less then nothing before him, an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> useful or gainful for nothing to him. 2. It may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as it respecteth others, and that not in a complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, but as it comprehendeth our humbling of our selves in our carriage towards them, and from the sense of our short-coming of them, and being inferiour to them in some things wherein we preferr them to our selves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. 3. It may be considered not only as it moderateth us in our common carriage towards God, or towards our Neighbour, but also as it concerneth our selves, for by it we are kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bounds, as to our thoughts of  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> selves, and what is ours, or in us, upon the discovery of many infirmities we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p>Humility considered the first way, is not properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55484:197"/>
under this Command,) but cometh in under the first Command of the first Table, but <hi>humility</hi> in the tvvo last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, as it moderateth our thoughts and esteem of our selves, and frameth our actions sutably, and according to right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in reference to others or our selves, cometh in here, and is enjoyned in this command; and concerning it these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things are to be observed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Humility of one man towards another differeth from Humility towards God, because of the great dispropor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion that is between God and Creatures, infinitely more than any that is amongst Creatures themselves. there is in nothing comparison to be made vvith God, neither is there any pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of profiting him, <hi>Job</hi> 35 7. but there may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and usefulness too, amongst Creatures which this humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity taketh not away, see <hi>Job</hi> 29. throughout the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Humility is not opposite to magnanimity, boldness and zeal, but is well consistent vvith these, as is clear in Christ, the Apostles and others of the Saints; for boldness and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity is an adventuring in Christs strength upon what one is called to according to warrantable grounds; &amp; humility, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it leadeth us to entertain due thoughts of our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, yet it moderateth us in that also according to right reason, so that the exercise of both being to be ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule of reason, as the call, occasion, object, and particular circumstances shall require; It is evident that there is no inconsistencie betwixt the two, but that they may very well be in one and the same persons, and at one and the same time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From this we may see, That Humility differeth from, and is somewhat else then fainting and despondencie of spirit or pensive pusillanimity, in not daring to follow a call in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to some seemingly difficult action; now humility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vertue acting according to reason, this is the excess without and against reason; and therefore as humility and zeal are commended, so this want of valiantness for truth, when called for, or baseness of spirit, is complained of as a sin, <hi>Jer</hi> 9.3. and <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 4.10, 14. and <hi>Jeremiah chap.</hi> 1.6. are reproved for some degree of it; for in every difficult


<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55484:198"/>
good which men would aim at (and the most desirable good things amongst men are often most difficult) there are two things considerable, 1. There is a <hi>bonum,</hi> or a good thing which is desirable; as for example, to do some exploit, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo some charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now men being bent to be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, covetous, rash, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to attain such a good, <hi>humility</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating their desires and designs according to their capacity and abilities, and bridling that excess upon the one hand, is of great advantage. There is again in the second place, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining such things, a difficulty, by which we are in hazard to be scared from, and fainted in following of duty, and zeal and magnanimity guard against this, sustaining the man, and keeping him from falling into discouragement, or pusilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous pensiveness, which is the defect upon the other hand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This humility, as a grace, differeth from civility and outward yielding to another, because 1. It proceedeth from a principle of conscience, and upon a conscientious account, <hi>viz.</hi> the inward sense and feeling of the defect of grace in our selves, and the impression of our Neighbours worth. 3. It is single, without any approved design of pleasing men, or any other consideration, but purely upon the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned account.</p>
               <p>This is the grace of <hi>humility,</hi> with which the best Moralists among the Heathen, were nothing acquainted; they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their moral vertues, as remaining sparks of natures light, and dark resemblances of some Gospel graces, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, wanting the principle of Faith, without which it is impossible to please God, and not being directed to the right end, the glory of God, could not be acceptable to him. But besides this imperfection and defectiveness in their wisdom and way, the Gospel having a far more high and noble design, then they could propose, hath also graces, that are wholly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it: The work and end of moral Philosophy, could be no other, then to moderate passions, and regulate manners, in such a conformity to reason, as might give unto a man, void of all sense of his distance and alienation from God, an in ward lying tranquility, and outward transient peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, the project and scope of the Gospel, is quite another


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55484:198"/>
thing, <hi>viz.</hi> to reconcile, and save lost sinners, through faith in Christ, and in him, to make them partakers of holiness here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and glory and happiness hereafter: Hence it is, that as the Gospel doth, by renewing and sanctifying, wholly change the old appearances of vertues into solid graces, flowing from Christ the fountain, and referred to God as their true end; so doth it also require and bestow its proper graces, such as, Repentance, Faith, Humility, and many other, unto which these Moralists were altogether strangers. And as to this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, it is certain, that the Gospel, by discovering unto us, the lost and wretched condition, whereinto sin had ruined us, and the free and wonderful love, whereby we are delivered out o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d Moralists, that it is not more proper to the spirit of the Gospel, then it's contrary pride, may be called their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristick, in as much as it is evident, that these self-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers of self, became also self-magnifiers, to that pitch of arrogancie, that <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> in the name of their most famous Sects, indeavoured by argument to extoll their vertuous man, even above their Gods; and the best of them would have accounted Christian humility an unworthy and base abjection of spirit; but neither are these the only men tainted with this evil; the sin of pride is so plainly the ruin of all that are without God, and the neck-break of all that seek after righteousness, otherwayes then by Faith, that we may well affirm, Humility to be Faiths inseparable compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: No wonder then that there is no grace more commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Christians, and more necessary; which might appear by considering, 1. The commands whereby it is pressed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: 2. The weightiness of the expressions in which it is holden forth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Humble your selves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly then he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. Philip.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let nothing be done through strife or vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. James</hi> 4.6, 10. <hi>But he giveth more grace: wherefore he


<pb n="338" facs="tcp:55484:199"/>
saith, God resisteth the proud; but giveth grace unto the humble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Humble your selves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</hi> 3. The many commendations of it, it maketh us, 1. like Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>John</hi> 13. from <hi>v.</hi> 4. to 18. and is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly taught by him; 2. It is an ornament which we ought to be cloathed with, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. 3. It fitteth for sutable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of duties, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. 4. It procureth the increase of Grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. 5. It is more then to command a City, for it maketh a man master of himself, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.17, 18, 19. 6. It hath many promises of exaltation throughout the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and of riches, honour, and long life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.3. Lastly, it preventeth many evils and vices that are incident even to Christians, and leadeth to the contrary vertues. 1. <hi>Humility</hi> moderateth a mans design, in pressing for honour, so it preventeth <hi>Ambition:</hi> 2. His pursuing inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately after riches, and so it suppresseth <hi>Covetousness:</hi> 3. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate seeking after knowledge, and so it guardeth against <hi>Curiosity:</hi> 4. It moderateth in reference to a mans esteem of himself, and so it shooteth out <hi>Self-confidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then if ye consider it with reference to a man of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts or station it preventeth, 1. <hi>Disdain</hi> in him of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inferiour to him; 2. It preventeth <hi>despising</hi> of others counsel, and his trusting to his own understanding; 3. It preventeth leaning to estate and riches, and so he preferreth not himself, as being the better, because of these.</p>
               <p>And in the last place, there is a pride whereby men having done any remarkable thing, are inclined either to seek ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, esteeming highly of what they have done, and seeking out their own glory, which <hi>Solomon</hi> saith is no glory, but is rather as, <hi>if a man should ea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For 1. it mindeth not high things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. Neither 2. vaunteth it self when it passeth by wrongs, and forgiveth them, or when it doth and suffereth any other thing commendable, it think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of it self above what is meet, but soberly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. 3. After acts of charity, the right hand knoweth not, as it


<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55484:199"/>
were, what the left hand hath given, it forgetteth good works, as to any self esteem of them (which pride remembreth and keepeth as it were a register of) but ascribeth all to Grace, <hi>Not I, but grace in me,</hi> saith the humble man with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</p>
               <p>In a word, this humility is extensive to every thing in a mans deportment as a man, and to all duties which concern him as a Christian, whether in reference to the worship of God, or the doing duty to men, even as on the contrary, pride, self-conceit, and presumption are very extensive, and immix themselves in all that a man doth, and are as the dead flies that make all to stink.</p>
               <p>And as it is commendable, likewayes it is very necessary as to many things; as 1. In external things, that relate to our conversing with others, it is necessary as to a mans credit and just reputation; the <hi>proud man</hi> is often in Gods righteous Judgment despised; Then it is necessary for things relating to our selves, as for our entertaining peace with God, for keeping us within bounds, for guarding against snairs, for keeping up communion with God, and for fitting to the sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table discharge of all duties called for; It would make us preach, and you hear more profitably; it would settle and establish against the railings that are in this time, that put many into a distemper, and a sort of spiritual distraction and madness, it is the <hi>humble that God giveth grace to, to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth his secret,</hi> who have largest promises and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us therefore learn to be humble and sober, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affecting to be wise above what is meet, this grace of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in the lively exercise of it, is in a special manner called for by the Lord at this time, of the reeling &amp; falling of many, the want whereof useth to precede and predispose for a fall.</p>
               <p>To close this we shall only add, That wherever there may be a <hi>pride,</hi> there is also an <hi>humility</hi> opposite to it. Man may be proud in respect of outward things, as of estate, riches, descent, employment, &amp;c. And also in respect of things of the mind, yea even of spiritual things: As, 1. of parts and gifts, as knowledge, quickness of wit, fruitfulness of invention, &amp;c. 2. Of Graces and holiness. 3. Of experiences, eminent manifestations, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual exercises, &amp;c. where with God may make some to shine very


<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55484:200"/>
far above and beyond others. 3. A man may be proud of some good deeds done by him, wherein possibly God hath made him somewhat more then ordinarily instrumental. 4. There is a proud curiosity leading to seek after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of secret thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Lastly, in what concerneth the inward frame of our hearts towards our own estate, and the estate of others. Com. 10.</p>
               <p>For understanding this Command, <hi>Thou shalt not kill</hi>; we may consider 1. It's Object: 2. It's act, to <hi>kill</hi>: 3. It's subject (to speak so) <hi>Thou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the first, this Command cannot be considered, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Beasts; as if they were not to be killed, because God gave man all the Beasts for his use to feed on them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.3. and we are to eat of whatever is sold in the shambles, by his allowance, whose is the earth and the fulness thereof, I

Beside man in all these Commands is properly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in reference to his Neighbour, and not to beasts: Yet I grant by striking a beast a man may offend, as 1. when that stroke wrongeth his Neighbour, to whom that beast belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 2. when in our striking there is 1. unreasonableness, as if we would require that capacity in a be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st, that is in reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, and so are ready to offend when they answer not our expectation. 2. when there is a breaking out into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and passion at brutes, as when a horse rydeth not well, a Dog runneth not well, a hawk flyeth not well, &amp;c. which speaketh an impotency in us, who are so easily mastered by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational passions, which will sometimes also seize upon us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in reference to senseless and lifeless Creatures, when they do not accommodate us to our mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 3. when there is bitterness and cruelty in <hi>striking:</hi> Something of this the Lord reproveth by making <hi>Balaams</hi> Ass speak and rebuke the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Prophet, who unreasonably smote the Ass, and wished he had had a Sword to kill her, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.29. whereas a just man pitieth his beast, and regardeth the life thereof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.10.</p>
               <p>But for the better Understanding of the Object of the Command, we shall proceed to speak to it, and the act of killing (vvhich is the second thing) complexedly, and if we consider killing in reference to a mans self, it is certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood here; for that being the sum of all the commands of the second Table, <hi>thou shalt love thy Neighbour, as thy self,</hi> it must be understood as repeated in each of them; as here, <hi>thou shalt not kill thy Neighbour more than thy self,</hi> or <hi>shalt preserve him as thy self,</hi> which supposeth that it is not free for a man to wrong himself more than to wrong others; and generally these reasons whereby the Lord restraineth us from killing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will also hold in restraining us from killing, and other ways wronging our selves; therefore there is no question, if it be a sin to wrong, hurt or torture others, whether in body or in their soul, as to the tranquillity and quiet frame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and any ways to procure or further their death, it will be no less so to do thus to our selves; because love to our selves is the pattern that we ought to walk by in loving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:55484:201"/>We may be guilty of the breach of this Command in reference to our selves by omissions as well as by commissions, as when things needful for entertainment and health of the body are, either designedly, or with an excessive misregard to health and life, omitted.</p>
               <p>We may further fall into the breach of this Command in reference to our selves, either directly, as purposing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending hurt to our own bodie, or indirectly, by casting our selves in unnecessary seeming dangers, by wilful or careless overusing of known unwholesome food, by excessive and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate toyl, by spending and wasting the body with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastness, by drunkenness and gluttony (vvhereby many more are destroyed then with the Sword, according to the common saying, <hi>plures gulâ quàm gladio pereunt</hi>) and many other vvays.</p>
               <p>If we consider this command vvith respect to others, vve may conceive it in reference to a threefold life, which vve should endeavour to preserve and promote in them, in any one of which a commission or omission will make a breach thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a life of the body; and vvhatever cometh from us that vvrongeth that, either directly, as stroaks, challenges or appeals, &amp;c. or indirectly, if it vvere but by keeping back something that is in our power to give vvhich might be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our neighbour in his need, that no doubt maketh guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this sin of killing in respect of this bodily life.

               <p n="2">2. There is a spiritual &amp; eternal life of the soul, thus <hi>sin</hi> dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and killeth men, and in this respect all vvho are unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to others in the matter of their souls, or vvho cause them to sin, or sinfully give them occasion of sin, become guilty of soul-murther, so <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.18. and 33.6. <hi>his blood will I require at thy hands,</hi> saith the Lord to the Prophet.</p>
               <p>Men become guilty of this not only 1. By commanding, as <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>Doeg</hi> to kill the Lords Priests, and <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Joab</hi> to cause <hi>Vriah</hi> to be slain, 2. By counselling and advising, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab</hi> did <hi>Amnon</hi> in reference to his sister <hi>Thamar,</hi> 3. By allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and downright tempting, as <hi>Tamar</hi> did <hi>Juda</hi>; 4. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the sin of others, or any vvise assisting, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing or incouraging them in it, as <hi>Saul</hi> vvas consenting to the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and vvas standing by keeping the cloaths of them that stoned him, and as men may be in reference to false Teachers 2 Epist. of <hi>John</hi> 10, 11. 5. By giving high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to others, and thereby stirring them up to sin such


<pb n="345" facs="tcp:55484:202"/>
as are reproaches, opprobrious speeches, chartallings and challenges to fight, &amp;c. but also 6. By evil example, as <hi>David</hi> vvas accessary to the sin of the Adversaries blasphemous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, by vvhat he did, and the Apostle often insinuateth Christians may be thus guilty by their insutable deportment in the several relations they sustain and stand under, this may also be by doing vvhat hath the appearance of evil, yea even by doing of things in themselves lawful but inexpedient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause unseasonable and vvith offence. Thus one Christian may be accessory to anothers stumbling, and may sinfully hazard the destroying of these for vvhom Christ dyed, as the Apostle discourseth concerning offences even in things not sinful in themselves: 7. By not warning faithfully before sin be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as is clear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.18. 8. By not reproving after the sin is committed, but suffering it to lye on our brother <hi>Lev</hi> 19.6. 9. By not suiting and proportioning the reproof to the greatness of the sin, but making it too soft and gentle, not shewing just indignation against it, which vvas <hi>Eli</hi> his guilt, who though he did not altogether neglect or omit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the prophanity and gross vvickedness of his Sons, yet did not reprove at that rate of holy severity, called for, and answerable to, their atrocious and villanous wickedness, he <hi>frowned</hi> not on them and dealt not roughly vvith them, as he should have done, as is clear by comparing 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.22, 23, 24, 25: with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13. 10. By rash putting men in Offices for vvhich they are not at all, or not competently qualified, and so cannot but in all probability sin much in them, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Office of the Ministry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. 11. By not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring by all suitable and lawful means within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of our power and calling to prevent the sin of others, and to restrain them from it, as <hi>Eli</hi> is on this account chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13. 12. By broaching, venting, teaching and spreading heresies and false doctrine; thus <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi> is notoriously and primely guilty of this sin of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther; as all false teachers and seducers are less or more according to the nature of the doctrine taught by them and their industry in propagating the same; and likewise all that tolerate and do not restrain them, whose Office obligeth them to it according to their power: All these and other


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:55484:203"/>
ways may men be accessory to other mens sins, and so make themselves guilty of this great and cruel sin of Soul-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This sort of murther aboundeth and is very rife, and yet is in an especial manner forbidden by this command, and the prevention of it accordingly called for, it being a greater evidence of love to our neighbour to be careful of his soul then of his body, the one being more pretious then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and however false Prophets, teachers and seducers, seem ordinarily to be most tender of mens persons, and most desirous to please them, yet are they in this sort horridly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their murther.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a life of contentment, consisting in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the mind, and the calm frame of a quiet spirit vvith comfort, joy and chearfulness; to this purpose saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.8. <hi>I live if ye stand fast in the Lord,</hi> and it is said of <hi>Jacob Gen.</hi> 45.27. when he heard that <hi>Joseph</hi> lived, <hi>his spirit revived,</hi> as if it had been dead before, because of his great heaviness, arising from the supposed death of his Son; thus we become guilty of this Sin of <hi>ki <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing,</hi> when vve obstruct or interrupt the spiritual comfort and joy, or the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of our neighbour by fear, heaviness, disquietness, discouragement, &amp;c. whereby his life is made bitter, and his tranquillity impaired, and so his hurt procured or furthered: As <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren did not only become guilty of his blood but of weighting their Father, and deadning, as it were, his spirit, which afterwards at the news of <hi>Josephs</hi> being alive revived, so people may be guilty against their Ministers, when they make them do their work not with joy but grief, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</p>
               <p>Again Murther, as it respecteth the bodily life of our Neighbour, is either immediate, as <hi>Cains</hi> was of <hi>Abel, Joabs</hi> of <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amasa,</hi> or mediate, as <hi>Sauls</hi> was of the Lords Priests, <hi>Davids</hi> of <hi>Vriah, and Achabs</hi> of <hi>Naboth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, killing may be considered either as purposed, such as <hi>Cain</hi>'s was of <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Joab</hi>'s of <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amasa,</hi> or not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; which again is twofold: 1. Innocent, which is even by the Law of God every way so, and is indeed no breach of this Command: as when a man, following his duty, doth that


<pb n="347" facs="tcp:55484:203"/>
which beside, and contrary to his intention, and without any previous neglect or oversight-in him, proveth the hurt and death of another. 2. Culpable, because although it do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed beyond the purpose of the person, yet it is occasioned and caused by a culpable negligence: As suppose one were hewing with an Axe, which he either knew, or might have known to be loose, and the head not well fastened to the helve, did not advertise those about him of it, if by flying off it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to wound or kill any person, he were not innocent, but if without any inadvertencie he either knew not that it vvere loose, or that any vvere about him, if then it should fall off and kill his Neighbour, in this case he is guiltless: So vvhen the Lord commanded those vvho built houses to build battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about the roofs of them, if any person fell vvhere the battlements vvere, the Master vvas free; if the battlements vvere not, he vvas guilty.</p>
               <p>Murther is also either to be considered, as committed after provocation, or vvithout all provocation, vvhich is a great aggravation of the sin, though the provocation maketh it not cease to be a sin. Further, it may be considered, as it is the murther of evil &amp; wicked men, or of good and religious men, and that on the account of their Religion, vvhich is a most horrid aggravation of the murther.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this murther, is either ordinary, as of meer equals, or inferiours; or extraordinary, aggredged by the quality of the person murthered, vvhether he be a superiour, as a Magistrate, a Parent; or vvhether he be of a near Relation, as a Brother, or Kinsman, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We come a little more particularly to consider the extent and nature of the sin forbidden here (vvhich is not certainly to be understood of taking the life by publick Justice, or in a lavvful or just War, or in necessary and pure self-defence) that vve may the better understand the contrary duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: It implyeth then a <hi>hurting,</hi> vvhich vve may consider 1. as in the heart, 2. as in the mouth or vvords, 3. as in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, 4. as in deeds; for vve take it for granted that it reacheth further then the gross outvvard act, as by Christs exposition of it in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. is incontrovertibly clear.</p>
               <p>The heart is the fountain, spring, and treasure of all evil,

in it breedeth all evil, and from it proceedeth this murther, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15 19. he that in heart hateth his brother is a murtherer, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. In a vvord, vvhatever is opposite to love in the heart, is a breach of this Command: As 1. <hi>hatred,</hi> vvhich is malitious, and simply vvisheth ill to our Neighbour, and only because vve love him not, vvithout any other reason, as one vvickedly said,
<q>
                     <l>Non amo te <hi>Zabidi,</hi> nec possum dicere quare,</l>
                     <l>Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo to.</l>
                  </q>
So <hi>Cain</hi> hated his Brother vvithout cause. 2. <hi>Anger,</hi> that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneth a pretended vvrong, and is desirous of revenge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of ingratitude, pretended injustice, &amp;c. 3. <hi>Envy,</hi> vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vve are grieved vvith the good of another, supposing, though groundless, that it obstructeth ours, and therefore vve seek to overturn it: <hi>Anger is cruel, and wrath outragious, but who can stand before Envy,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> There is often secret ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on this ground more irreconcileable, then vvhere many and grave reasons can be given. 4. <hi>Rage,</hi> vvhich presseth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge beyond vvhat is condign, though it follovv it lavvfully, as to outvvard means. 5. <hi>Saevitia,</hi> or <hi>Cruelty,</hi> that delighteth in the hurt and prejudice of another, all these and others of this kind go generally under the name of <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any ask here, Is there no anger lavvful? <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, for there is somevvhat of it natural, yea, and sometimes it lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully immixeth it self in duty, as in zeal, vvhen God is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, vvhich vvas in <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 32. And no doubt, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at vvicked men, in some cases, is lavvful, and also required. But carnal Anger is forbidden; vvhich, 1. Is a desire of revenge vvhere there hath no vvrong been done to us: 2. When the revenge desired is disproportioned to, and greater then the vvrong: 3. When it is preposterously desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vvithout intervening Justice: 4. When it is not desired for the right end, to wit, the mans gaining, but only for the satisfying of our carnal humour: 5. When it is immoderate and corrupt in the manner of it, so as the name of God is dishonoured by it. This unlawful Anger, when it is 1. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst


<pb n="349" facs="tcp:55484:205"/>
a Superiour, it is called <hi>grudge</hi>; 2. when against an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, <hi>rancour</hi>; 3. when against an Inferiour, <hi>disdain</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>; these two last follow ordinarily upon the first.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Command is broken by injurious words, as in that fifth Chapter of <hi>Matthew, He that shall say to his brother, thou fool, is guilty</hi>: O what guilt will there be found to have been in imprecations, cursings, wrathful wishes, disdainful and passionate speeches, when Christ will call men to an account for the breach of this Command?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is broken in gestures, such as high looks, fierce looks, gnashing with the teeth, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.54. foaming with the mouth, and such like, wherewith even our blessed Lord and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have been followed; and as there may be Adultery in looks, so there is also murther in them; such looks had <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is broken in deeds, even when death followeth, not as in wounding, smiting, oppressing, cruel withdrawing of the means of life, extortion, exaction, byting, injury, litigious wrangling, violent compulsion, raising and racking of Land or House-rents beyond the just value, and squeezing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting upon poor Labourers and Tenants, without any due regard to them or their labours; which last is a frequent sin, but little regarded, a crying sin, but little cared for; next, it is broken by withholding what might be useful and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as by neglecting the sick and distressed, want of hospitality, specially to the poor: All these are sinful breaches, whether directly or indirectly incurred, neither is it sufficient that we simply abstain from committing some of these, but we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so make conscience to practise all contrary duties.</p>
               <p>The last thing proposed to be spoken to, was the person <hi>thou</hi>; where, in a word, we are to distinguish private men from publick men, who are Magistrates and bear the Sword, whom this Command doth not restrain from executing of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; y <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Lord having spoken of such sins as do more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect mans being simply in the former Command, he cometh now to direct in those things that concern a man in his life, in the ordering of his conversation; and as it will be found one way or other, that by our passion, hatred, and anger, in one degree or other, the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is broken often, so this sin (that in the very name of it is abominable) is not so unfrequent, even amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as might in all reason be supposed and expected.</p>
               <p>The vile sin of inordinate Concupiscence and Lust entred into Mankind exceeding early after <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the bitter fruit of Original sin, and that pravity of our nature sooner kyeths, and did kyth, then in it: Hence is it that <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Evahs</hi> nakedness, and their being ashamed, is spoken of in Scripture, which implyeth a sinfulness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinateness in them, which formerly they were not tainted with; as also a shame or plague following upon it: and this corrupt nature being still in man, it is hard to speak of, or to hear these things holily; and therefore there is a necessity


<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55484:206"/>
both of holiness and wisdom here, left we break this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, even when speaking of it, and hearing it spoke of; yet the breach of it being a sin so rife, and the Spirit in Scripture thinking it needful to speak of it, yea, it being put in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and distinct Command by it self, and our most holy and blessed Lord Jesus having himself commented on it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. there is a necessity of saying somewhat of it, but so as to contain within the bounds of Scripture expressions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O! be therefore afraid of sinning in hearing; remember and consider that the Lord seeth, and in a special manner abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth such vile Imaginations as shall be irritated and excited even from his holy command enjoyning the contrary, which is indeed both an evidence and a part of the <hi>sinfulness of sin,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>To take therefore a view of it, let us consider the scope of the Command, which we conceive is in a special manner, and obviously holden forth in these few places of Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending holiness in respect of a mans person, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>uncleanness</hi> in all its branches. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 7. <hi>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from fornication, that every one of you should know how to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess his vessel in sanctification and honour, not in the lust of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, even as the Gentiles, which knew not God — for God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness,</hi> Ephes. 5.3, 4, 5. <hi>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named amongst you, as becometh Saints: Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jeasting, which are not convenient: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man who is an idolater, hath any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</hi> Galat. 5.19. <hi>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, adultery, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, uncleanness, lasciviousness.</hi> Rom. 13. v. 13. <hi>Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</hi> Coloss. 3. v. 5. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie therefore your members, which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness which is idolatry.</hi> In which places, as we see, the sin forbidden in this Command, held out under the most odious designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to wit, a <hi>work of the flesh, fornication, adultery, uncleanness,


<pb n="352" facs="tcp:55484:207"/>
lasciviousness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, &amp;c.</hi> bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this sin; and a decent walk commanded, as contrary to the same; so we may see from them the scope of this Seventh Command to be an honest, decent, shamefac't, chast, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and holy life, which being well considered, doth much illustrate the meaning and extent of it.</p>
               <p>If we might be particular, we could shew how there is no Command more pressed, more fully explained, and sorer plagued in the breach of it, then this, and set forth with more aggravating expressions, to make it so much more abominable. It wrongeth God, and the Society of men, it wrongeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; in particular, our children and our selves, <hi>both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, estate and name</hi>; it bringeth a blot on the soul here and hereafter, <hi>Job</hi> 31.12. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.33. It taketh away wit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, yea, and even the very heart, besotting men, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.11. compared with <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.3 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>For further clearing of this Command, consider 1. The <hi>Species</hi> or kinds of faults condemned in it, and the vertues or graces commended. 2. The manner of being guilty of the breach of it, which (because this Command will be found to be spiritual, as the other commands are) reacheth to the heart and affections as they do. 3. Consider the sin here forbidden in its incitements, foments, and other sins more implicitely comprehended under it, as <hi>idleness, gluttony, drunkenness, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, gaudiness and unchastness in apparel or nakedness, dancing,


<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55484:207"/>
singing of bawdy songs, loose company or fellowship,</hi> and every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of this ill, and what may lead to it, and dispose for it, or is an evidence of it. 4. See its opposite vertues, and the means useful for the subduing of it, as <hi>chastity, modesty, shamefacedness, temperance, lawful marriage,</hi> the remedy thereof, &amp;c. which are required in this Command, and are very useful for a holy life.</p>
               <p>That these things ought to be spoken of, none will deny; that they belong to one of the Commands, the perfection of the Law requireth it; and that they come in here under this Command, the nature of them, and their conjunction with, or influence upon the sin condemned, or duty commanded here, will make it evident; the sin of Adultery being a prime branch of the carnalness of our nature, under it the rest of that kind are comprehended for making of them the more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
               <p>Now in considering the act of vileness forbidden, we may 1. Look to these ills, that are simply unnatural, of which these that be guilty are called in the Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>the abominable,</hi> such are these 1. who prostitute themselves to the abomination <hi>of filthy Fellowship with Devils,</hi> as they suppose and imagine. 2. These who commit <hi>beastiality,</hi> a vileness most detestable in reasonable creatures, it is called <hi>confusion, Levit.</hi> 18.23. 3. These who abuse themselves with mankind spoken of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>0. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26, 27, called also in the Scripture <hi>Sodomy, going after strange flesh,</hi> having been the abominable practise of these miscreants, whom God set forth <hi>for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample suffering the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> when he rained, as it were, something of hell from heaven on them burning them quick, and frying them in a manner to death in their own skins, because of the lusts wherewith they burned. These are abominations against nature, against which the Laws both of God and men do severely animadvert, see <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. and 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The act of vileness inhibited taketh in these ills of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, that are in some respect against nature also, though not so obviously, nor so gross, such as are betwixt persons within degrees of consanguinity and affinity; this unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is called <hi>incest,</hi> such are reckoned up <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. and 20. and


<pb n="354" facs="tcp:55484:208"/>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. for this the <hi>Cananites</hi> were cast out, and it was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable even to Heathens, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. &amp;c. the evil of <hi>incest</hi> flows from the unnaturalness of mens confounding the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and degrees, that nature hath set men distinctly in; as for instance, nature hath made the fathers Wife a mother, to joyn therefore with her destroyeth that relation, and is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming that reverence and respect we owe to parents; hence this <hi>incest</hi> is alwaies either in a direct or oblique line, but not in the collateral, beyond the relations of brother and sister, which are indeed the very beginnings of the collateral lines, and, as it were, almost one in their common parents; thus conjunction with one of the furthest and most remote of a line that is direct is incest, which yet is not so with the very first after these excepted, of the line that is collateral; a man might not marry his fore-grandfathers wife, nor his sister, but may marry his Cousin German, and because man and wife become one flesh, it is incest which is within the degrees to the wife, as well as if it were within them to the husband himself, and it is also called confusion. <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.12. 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider it as it is against a tye or bond, called <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, Prov.</hi> 2.17. and this may be three vvays considered, 1. When both persons are married, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathsheba</hi> were, this is most abominable, and that which we call <hi>double adultery.</hi> 2. When the man is married, and the woman solute or free. 3. When the woman is married and the man free, these two last are both gross, yet the latter is accounted grosser, as having these Aggravations, of disturbing the peace of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours family, the corrupting his seed and <hi>offspring,</hi> and the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enating of his inheritance added unto it, therefore not only the first, but even the third hath been ordinarily punished by death amongst men; and certainly the guilt of the second, is little inferiour, if not equal, to either of them: for 1. It hath the same Wickedness of Adultery, with the other two, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the Covenant of God. 2. It is in like manner peccant against the remedy of uncleanness and disorder, for which the Lord did appoint marriage. 3. It doth no less di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the quiet and prosperity of Families, provoking jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie in the Wife, the more impotent, because the weaker

Vessel, alienating affections, and often hindering a lawful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, but continually marring the education of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lawfully begotten, and the Parents care of their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: Neither are these things to be restricted to the man, as if he were only therein criminal; the free Woman the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteress, by her manifest accession, doth evidently involve her self in the same guilt; if a free man lye with his Neighbours wife, the aggravations, flowing from her married estate, are all charged upon the man, and by the Law of God  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned as the Adulterer; doth not then the parity of reason, in the Case of a married man with a free Woman, equally transfer on her the Guilt of his Consequences? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any excuse for the Woman, that the man is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the temptor; because not only hath nature put the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans greater weakness, under the security of a far greater measure of modesty, but the Lords righteous Law is also binding upon both without distinction: so that I think, we may well understand all the three sorts of Adultery, to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the same laws, and under the same pains; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude with <hi>Job</hi> 31.9, 11. that Adultery, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction, <hi>is an iniquity to be punished by the Judge</hi> upon the man, as well as upon the woman.</p>
               <p>Of this sort also is <hi>Bigamy,</hi> the marrying of two Wives to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and <hi>Poligamy,</hi> the marrying of many Wives, and keeping Concubines with Wives: For God made but two at the beginning, one Male, and the other Female; and hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed every man to have his own Wife, and every woman to have her own Husband. And although many holy men have failed in this, yet can we not exempt them from sin; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we ascribe it to Gods particular <hi>dispensation</hi> to them, which we dare not make so common as that practise was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering especially what abuse it came to, as may be instanced in <hi>Solomon,</hi> and from whom it had its rise, to wit, <hi>Lamech,</hi> and what bitter fruits and sad effects it hath had following on it in Families and on Posterity, as may be seen on <hi>Abraham, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs, Samuels</hi> Father <hi>Helkanah,</hi> which made mens marriage a vexation to them, contrary to its ends: But now our Lord, by reducing marriage to its first institution, hath very expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abolished it in the New Testament.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:55484:209"/>4. Consider it in free and unmarried persons, and thus it is <hi>Fornication</hi>; if it be constrained or forced, it's death by Gods Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.23, &amp;c. only to the man; the other is free, and it is called a <hi>Rape</hi>; if it be continued in, it's <hi>whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and filthiness</hi>; if with one woman, it is <hi>Concubinatus,</hi> an unwarrantable abusing the ordinance of Marriage, and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it: if with sundry parties, it is <hi>Prostitution,</hi> and most abominable; and whatever way it be, it is abominable, <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the wrath of God, Ephes.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Not once to be named</hi> amongst the Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whether marriage follow or not, yet it is still sinful.</p>
               <p>It may have several aggravations, as 1. if it be in times of light; 2. if with persons unsutable to be conversed with; 3. if in Families professing godliness; especially in the 4<hi>th</hi> place, if the person be a great professor; 5. if it be in a time when God is quarrelling and contending with a whole Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Land, and threatning his Judgments against all: Now although this sin be at this time aggravated from all these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, yet, oh! how much doth it abound, and how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is it!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider this act of vileness inhibited, as it may be amongst and betwixt persons married and living in conjugal Society; for the use of the Marriage-bed is not left arbitrary more then the use of meat and drink; but is bounded by the Lord, both in the contracting and in the injoyment; and when these bounds which are set, are transgressed, the transgressours are guilty. Thus men and women may begin their marriage car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by wooing carnally, which will make them guilty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no more: Marrying with persons of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religion, or with other unsutable disparities, maketh guilty of the breach of this Command, that sort of marriage not being the lawful remedy of Fornication; or when we are sweyed more with temporal ends, and with respect to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of fleshly Lusts, then with conscientious respect to what God allows, and right reason requires, referring all to Gods glory; for this thwarteth with the end of marriage, and doth transchange marriage into a cloak for covering cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness or filthiness; and so before marriage there may be guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:55484:209"/>Thus also married persons may break this Command, if they do not possess and enjoy one another in <hi>holiness and honour,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.4, 5. and do not give to one another all <hi>due bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence:</hi> Thus men do sin in the defect, by not cohabiting, by withdrawing without consent one from another, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a snare one to another: The Apostle calleth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. <hi>defrauding</hi> of one another: And many pieces of unkindly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness amongst married persons, unbecoming the honour and respect that the one should have to the other, may be here comprehended. But men sin more and oftner in the excess, <hi>viz.</hi> by carnal living with their own lawful married Wives, and using marriage for lust, living in the lust of <hi>concupiscence,</hi> as the Apostle calleth it; and that as the Gentiles did even in their marriage stations, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4 5. And he calleth it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>inordinate affection</hi>; an affection which a man hath to his Wife as to an Whore, rather then what becometh a Wife: These things, when reproved, must not be offended at, but the Lord looked unto for the purging of this corrupt nature, of such filthiness, as is shameful even to mention.</p>
               <p>This inordinateness may be in respect of frequencie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonableness, carnalness in the manner; and what need is there to say more? It may also have place among married persons, when their conjugal fellowship hindereth them from setting apart any time for extraordinary Devotions, which yet they ought to do, as may be drawn from what the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. Though excess in this also is to be guarded against, but when there are times of trouble, and of private or publick calamity, wherein the Bridegroom is called to come out of his Chamber; in such times as these, married persons may be readily guilty of inordinateness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it is known that there were, upon some occasions, restraints under the Law when a man might not touch a woman, though his own Wife, to shew that in conjugal Society men should observe a purity, and that they have not unlimited liberty in this, more then in other things, as eating, drinking, &amp;c. For although all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in meat and drink be not unlawful, yet carnal sensualness is: So what is natural, sutable, and seasonable, here is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and inordinacie forbidden. Thus during the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-state, guilt may be contracted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:55484:210"/>Again, men may thus sin by unjust dissolving of Marriages, by <hi>deserting, divorcing</hi> without the just cause of it, <hi>extruding,</hi> and such like acts, contrary to the nature of that strictest bond and covenant. I grant it is not alwayes necessary to make divorce even where there is Adultery; the Lord is not offended with reconciliation, where the punishment of the sin is not executed by the Magistrate: But if the divorce be made, and the woman afterward married to another, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her first Husband, even after lawful dissolution of her second marriage, is an abomination and exceeding defiling, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. Thus in dissolving marriages there may be guilt.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this uncleanness may be considered as it is in a soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary person, when alone, in their actions of darkness and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable imaginations, which are to be loathed rather then named; yet these things which are done in secret are seen of God, though it be a shame to speak of them: see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.11, 12. This secret uncleanness, again, may be by a person, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther walking, or sleeping, mentioned <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. which confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly becometh men or womens guilt, according as they have drawn it on, or by unsutable imaginations disposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for it; yea, when it hath not <hi>ingrata recordatio,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savory and displeasing remembrance, and a holy horror <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thereupon, there is guilt: Of this we spoke somewhat in the Preface to the Commands.</p>
               <p>These abominations then are not restricted to the outward act, but are extended further, and many wayes men commit this wickedness: as 1. In heart, Christ calleth the <hi>lusting of a man after a woman a committing of Adultery in his heart, Matth.</hi> 5.28. This indeed hath degrees according to the length it cometh, and the entertainment it getteth, and other such like circumstances, but it is still accounted by God to be heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adultery, and it is called <hi>burning,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.27. and is exceeding loathsome to the Lord, and hurtful to the inner man, even when men neither resolve nor intend acting, yet by not abhorring these Imaginations, but suffering them to roll in their thoughts (O! beware of carnalness upon the thoughts of this) they become guilty, and that inward fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suffered to burn, often breaketh out into a visible flame;


<pb n="359" facs="tcp:55484:210"/>
How that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. differeth from the burning mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.27 we shall now forbear to mention. 2. Men are guilty of this wickedness, when they license their outward senses in the sinful pursuit of their objects: Thus <hi>eyes full of adultery</hi> are spoken of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.28. a <hi>lustful look</hi> is adultery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Job c.</hi> 31. saith, he will not <hi>look upon a maid.</hi> Thus also obscene pictures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, or other spectacles of that sort, cannot but defile the man: The ears are defiled by hearing of, and listning to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene and filthy discourses, to drunken, bawdy, or light wanton amorous Songs: the touch with embracings; and the mouth with kissings: Such are spoken of <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.13. <hi>She caught him and kissed him.</hi> To insist further here, is not sutable: but oh! there is much guilt contracted this way, and but little noticed, and mourned for. 3 Men may become guilty by <hi>gestures,</hi> as they are evidences of this vileness, or dispose to it, and postures undecent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming civility, and godliness. See what is spoken of a <hi>naughty person, Prov.</hi> 6.13, 14. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.16. &amp;c. this is opposite to <hi>honest walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> which is commended <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. and a <hi>carnal wantonness</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 4. Persons become exceeding guilty of this evil by <hi>scurril</hi> and <hi>obscene speeches,</hi> where as this sin should not be once named; by reading <hi>scurril, wanton, amorous ballads</hi> or <hi>books,</hi> which is, as if we were conferring on such a subject, by <hi>taunting and reproaching</hi> one another in such communication as corrupteth good manners; by <hi>jesting that is not convenient,</hi> especially if it be at one that hath fallen in some act of <hi>filthiness,</hi> or by whatever may be neer, or of a sinful sutableness to such an evil; see <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. and 5.3, 4, &amp;c. 5.

That it will be readily found to indispose for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of godliness, and so to be inconsistent, or at best, hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with either a pious and lively, or a sober frame of spirit. 3.

There is no lawful mean of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is useful for the health of the body, but is, and may, and should be, sanctified by the Word and Prayer, yet I suppose neither useth this to be so, neither would any think it very suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or well consistent with a praying frame; and can that which standeth not with the serious exercise of repentance, and a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disposition, or that which none would think a fit posture to meet death, or the Lords appearing with, be in reason thought consistent with a <hi>Christian walk?</hi> which should alwayes be with the loyns girded, and the lamps burning: It is somewhat like this, or less then this, which the Lord condemneth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.16. <hi>walking and mincing, or tripping, and making a tinkling with their feet</hi>; what is that but disdaining the grave way of walking, to affect an art in it? as many do now in our dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shall this be displeasing to the Lord, and not the other? seeing he loveth, and is best pleased with the native way of carrying the body. <hi>Junius</hi> and

               <p>Besides these things that are more general in folks carriage, there is somewhat further in our cloathing and diet, which is to be spoken to here, seeing in these we ought to be christian, sober, grave, &amp;c. and in nothing do our lightness, vanity (as we ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily use to call people vain from their apparel) pride, wantonness, and rioting appear more, then in vain garbs. Hence the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. joyneth modest apparel with shamefastness and sobriety or chastity, as also doth the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2, 3. and in <hi>Jezebel</hi> and others, <hi>decking</hi> and <hi>dressing</hi> to seek love, is ever accounted an high degree of loosness: It is a wonder that men should take pleasure to deboard in their cloathing, which is the badge of their persidiousness, and was at first appointed to cover their shame and nakedness.

It is strange, that sometimes the poorest and meanest for place, and often for qualifications, are finest this way, as if it were the best or only way to commend and set them out; and that some should have more in cloaths then in their stock, is utterly into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. 2. Strangeness in the ever-changing fashions, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant modes of apparel, while as the Lord by nature hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the shape of mens bodies to be the same; for what is meant else by <hi>strange apparel,</hi> so often forbidden in the Scripture, but that

which is commonly called <hi>the fashion,</hi> or <hi>new fashion,</hi> a new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth garb? And certainly mens minds are often infected with lascivious thoughts, and lustful inclinations, even by the use and sight of gaudy and vain cloathing, and we well see, light, loose, conceited minds discover themselves in nothing sooner then in their apparel, and fashions, and conceitedness in them. 3.

Affecting of, and having a lust after, brave cloathing, making our <hi>back</hi> our God, as some do their <hi>belly, Phil</hi> 3.19. and this may be where cloaths are but mean, yet the lust and appetite after them may be great. 2. Haughtiness and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in cloaths and dressings, when we think our selves better with them then without them, or esteem our selves, because of them above others, in other things superiour, or at least equal to us. 3. Excess in these, in their superfluity and costliness, as i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wantonness and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them, which is especially in nakedness, as to such and such parts of the body, which in modesty are to be hid; for women ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cloaths for a cover, ought to make use of them for that end, and it is more then probable, that, that <hi>walking with stretched out necks,</hi> there reproved, relateth to women, their making more of their necks, and their breasts bare, then should be, or is decent, they affected to discover and raise their gorgets, when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth modesty, and Nature is best pleased in its own unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freedom, yet they stretched them out: It is both a wonderful and sad thing, that women should need to be reproved for such things, which are in themselves, 1.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:55484:213"/>
in their shame; for nakedness hitherto was always looked upon as a reproach: We read of old of such as were grave, that they <hi>covered themselves with a vail:</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. married womens going abroad uncovered is looked on as unnatural; What would such say if they lived in our times; we are perswaded the gravest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst women are most averse from this evil, and the lightest are most prone and given to it: And seeing all women should be grave, it must import a disclaiming of that qualification where this lightness is delighted in: If therefore there be any shame, if there be any conscience, we will expect to prevail with some who are touched with the sense of gravity, that they may be good examples to the rest, and once indeavour effectually to bring gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and modest shamefastness in fashion again.</p>
               <p>There is in cloaths a base effeminateness amongst men (which some way emasculateth or unmanneth them) who delight in those things which women dote upon, as <hi>dressing of hair, powdrings, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> (when exceeded in) <hi>rings, jewels, &amp;c.</hi> which are spoken of, and reproved in the daughters of <hi>Zion, Isa.</hi> 3. and so must be much more unsutable to men. Also <hi>interchanging of apparel</hi> is condemned; men putting on womens, and women mens cloaths, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutable to that distinction of Sexes which the Lord hath made, and is condemned in the World as a <hi>confusion,</hi> an absurd, unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing, and an inlet to much wickedness.

to expone us, for we know that there are lawful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, nor are honesty and comliness in behaviour and apparel, blameable, but to be commended in their place: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would we have any think, that we suppose all such, who do the things above censured, to be incited to them from this principle of lust; but for clearing of the matter further, it would be considered, 1. That we speak of these things as they are abused, and particularly condemned in this Church. 2. We would consider the end of the things themselves, as they have been at first sinfully introduced, whatever may be the innocent intention of a particular user. 3. We vvould respect others, vvho may be offended and provoked to lust, by vvhat an actor is not provoked vvith, and also may be sinfully tempted to the like from that example; or if not so, yet may possibly be induced to judge them vain vvho vvalk so and so in apparel, light vvho dance, &amp;c. vvhich vve vvould prevent and guard against. 4. We vvould not only abstain from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but from all appearance of it; novv certainly all these things vve have spoken of, look like ill, and may breed mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constructions in others, even possibly beyond our ovvn mind and intention; vve may also consider the mind of very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in reference to these things, as also of <hi>Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,</hi> and the <hi>Divines</hi> vvhich are cited by <hi>Rivet</hi> and <hi>Martyr</hi> on this Command. The Councel <hi>Laod. Can.</hi> 53. <hi>apud Bals.</hi> hath these vvords, <hi>Let Christians, when they go to marriages, abstain from dancing, but dine or sup.</hi> And another saith, <hi>Nemo ferè saltat sobrius nisi forte insanit</hi>; no man almost danceth that is sober, unless perchance he be in a fit of distraction or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Neither doth <hi>Davids</hi> or <hi>Miriams</hi> dancing, being used by them as a part of vvorship in the occasions of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exultations, say any thing for the dancing that is novv in use, as their Songs of praise to God used in these their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings abundantly shevv: And beside, their dancing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beside, if the seeing of vain objects provoke to lust, the circumstances and incitements of dancing must do it much more; and vvhat men commonly say, <hi>Take away the promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuousness of dancing, and it self will fall</hi>: It doth confirm this, that dancing is not pleaded for or delighted in, as it is <hi>a recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative

motion,</hi> but as <hi>promiscuous</hi> vvith vvomen, vvhich, beside the great provocation to lust spoken of, occasioneth that both much time and expense is bestovved on learning this, vvhich is attended vvith no profit.</p>
               <p>What vve have said of these evils may also take in <hi>excess in sleeping, laziness, &amp;c.</hi> to be seen in <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. and also vain curiosity, as vvell as lasciviousness in singing and playing; too much vvhereof savours of <hi>wantonness</hi> and <hi>rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,</hi> as these vvords <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. are in their signification extended by some. Novv all these excesses spoken of, being opposite to sobriety and modesty, shamefastness and gravity, must come in under <hi>wantonness,</hi> and vvhat follovveth, doth come in under <hi>intemperance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture insisteth much in condemning the sin of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,</hi> vvhich vve conceive doth mainly consist in <hi>gluttony</hi> and <hi>drunkenness</hi>; and seeing these sins must belong to some one Command (although virtually and indirectly they break all) vve take them especially to be condemned here in this Command, vvhere temperance is commanded; and therefore vve shall find them in Scripture mentioned vvith a special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the sin of <hi>uncleanness,</hi> expresly forbidden here: <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of bread and gluttony</hi> is observed to have been <hi>Sodoms</hi> sin, and the rise and source of their filthiness, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49. <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is marked, especially as leading to this, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.31, 33. Therefore vve choose to speak a word to these tvvo evils here, vvhich are in themselves so abominable, and yet, alas! so frequent amongst those vvho are called Christians.</p>
               <p>It is true, there is both in eating and drinking, respect to be had, 1. To nature, vvhich in some requireth more, in some less: 2. To mens stations, vvhere, as to the kind or quality (as vve said of cloaths) there is more allovved to one then another: 3. To some occasions, vvherein more freedom and hilarity is permitted then at other times, vvhen more absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and a restraint upon these, even in themselves lavvful pleasures, is extraordinarily called for, so that vve cannot bound all persons, and at all times, vvith the same peremptory rules.</p>
               <p>There is also respect to be had to <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> vvhere, by Gods goodness, men have allovvance to make use of thèse


<pb n="377" facs="tcp:55484:215"/>
things, not only for necessity, but for refreshing also, and the vertue of temperance and sobriety (as all other vertues) doth not consist in an indivisible point, so that a man is to eat and drink so much, and neither less nor more, without any latitude; the Lord hath not so streightned the consciences of his people, but hath left bounds in sobriety, that we may come and go upon, providing these bounds be not exceeded. Neither is every satisfaction or delight in meat or drink to be condemned (seeing it is natural) but such as degenerateth and becometh carnal.</p>
               <p>We would therefore inquire into the sinfulness thereof, and because there is a great affinity betwixt these two evils of <hi>Gluttony</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> we may speak of them together for brevities sake.</p>
               <p>We suppose then, 1. That both <hi>gluttony</hi> and <hi>drunkenness</hi> are sinful; and that both in the use of meat and drink men may several wayes fail; the many prohibitions and commands that are in the Word, for ordering us in the use of meat and drink. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>But put ye on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.20. <hi>For meat, destroy not the work of God: all things indeed are pure, but is evil for that man who eateth with offence. Prov.</hi> 23.20, 21. <hi>Be not amongst wine-bibbers; amongst riotous eaters of flesh. For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</hi> The many reproofs that there are for exceeding in both; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 16.49. <hi>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister</hi> Sodom; <hi>Pride, fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. Luke</hi> 16.19. <hi>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linnen, and fared sumptuously every day</hi>: with several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. And the many sad Judgments which have been inflicted, as well as threatned, for them: <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.20. <hi>And they shall say unto the Elders of his City, This our Son is stubborn, and rebellious, he will not obey our voice, he is a glutton, and a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. Prov.</hi> 23.21. <hi>For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags:</hi> with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate effects following on them, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. v. 29, 32.


<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55484:216"/>

                     </gap> the last it biteth like a Serpent, and stingeth like an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> &amp;c. will put it out of question that they are not only sinful, but so in an high degree.</p>
               <p>Yea, if we consider the ends for which God hath given us the use of these creatures (which excess inverteth and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) to wit, his <hi>honour,</hi> and the <hi>good of our selves and others</hi>; the rules he hath given to regulate us in the use of them; the holy frame he calleth for from us at all times; the difference that should be betwixt his people and the men of the world if the use of these things; we vvill find this excess in the use on these enjoyments to be sinful, and no less contrary to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature and law of God, and to that holiness and sobriety that should be in a Christian, then fornication and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesses are; therefore there is no sin hath more woes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Holy Ghost against it, then drunkenness (a woe being ever almost joyned with it) nor more shame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, so that of old drunkards <hi>drank in the night,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. as being ashamed of it; though now alas! many are <hi>drunk</hi> in the day, and some in the morning, and even such as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to it, are with great difficulty recovered, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We suppose also that these sins may be, and sometimes are, separated and divided, for one may be guilty of excess in meat or of gluttony, who may be free of drunkenness, and contrarily: It is the saying of a holy man, <hi>Aug lib.</hi> 10. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Drunkenness, O Lord, is far from me, but gluttony hath often prevailed over me.</hi> And therefore we are not here to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our selves free when both these ills cannot be charged on us; it is often incident to men who think themselves sober to be much more watchful against drunkenness then glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; yea, and usual for some to excite and put others much more on to exceed in eating then they dare do in drinking; as if there were not that same hazard in the one that is in the other, and as if one and the same rule were not given for both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We do also suppose that there is not one way only whereby men may become guilty of both these sins, but there


<pb n="379" facs="tcp:55484:216"/>
are many wayes and also degrees thereof, and though all be not alike gross, yet all are sinful: Therefore we vvould 1. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these evils in divers respects: Then 2. lay down and fix some general limits, which we are not to pass: 3. Instance some slighted particulars.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Gluttony</hi> in general there is a Latin verse,
<q>
                     <l>Praepropere, laute, nimis, ardenter studiose.</l>
                  </q>
In which five words there are five wayes of being guilty of it; 1. By <hi>hasting,</hi> that is, desiring meat and drink before it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; thus eating and drinking in course, not for hunger or thirst, but for custome, good fellowship, carnal pleasure, &amp;c. is gluttony, and is cursed by the Holy Ghost, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>Woe to thee, O Land, &amp;c.</hi> here drinking and eating are tyed to <hi>their seasons.</hi> 2. By <hi>delicacie</hi> in the kind or quality; as when meat and drink are excessive for costliness or sine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, lavishly provided, as Feasts very ordinarily are, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. So of the rich glutton it is said, <hi>he faired delicately eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, Luke</hi> 16.19. 3. In the quantity, by <hi>too much,</hi> when eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is exceeded in, even to indisposition for the duties of our general Christian, and of our particular callings, not to the strengthening us for them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.17. 4. In the manner, <hi>viz. too ardently,</hi> when meat is desired with a sort of lust, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.3, 20, 21. 5. In the preparing of meat, <hi>viz. studiously,</hi> that is, when it is too riotously dressed, for pleasing mens car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appetite and taste, or pallat, by the fineness of it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther curiosities of that kind. More particularly, we may sin either in the <hi>excess</hi> of meat and drink, when we go without just bounds; or in the <hi>defect,</hi> which may as well marr the end, to wit, <hi>Gods glory and our fitness for duty,</hi> as <hi>excess</hi> may; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth <hi>Paul</hi> exhort <hi>Timothy</hi> to the use of a little wine, as needful for him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider the sin of Gluttony in the <hi>matter</hi> of that which we eat and drink; thus some may fail, as was just now said, by too much daintiness in their fair, as well as too great a quantity: And again in the <hi>manner,</hi> wherein many are very sensual and carnal, as being much given to satisfie their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, which <hi>Solomon</hi> speaketh of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so <hi>Isa.</hi> 5 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:55484:217"/>3. Consider it either in reference to a <hi>mans self,</hi> when he himself faileth, or consider it in reference <hi>to others,</hi> when he putteth them to eat or drink, and occasioneth their sin; either of the wayes is sinful, and the last is particularly cursed, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.15. although prophane men have often made, and do make a pastime of it; and some others that would seem more sober, are but little troubled with it, and many seem by their practice to think they cannot make others welcome to their houses, unless they put them to exceed this way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider it in the <hi>act,</hi> and in the <hi>lust</hi> to it, even as there is fornication in the act and in the lust, so is there also drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness and gluttony; and thus, as is said <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. the <hi>belly</hi> becometh a <hi>God,</hi> and mens great care is to satisfie it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25. So to <hi>be given to wine,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. and to <hi>look on it with delight,</hi> when it moveth it self aright in the cup, &amp;c. is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.31.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider failing here <hi>morally,</hi> which is not sutable to a <hi>man,</hi> and which even a Heathen will disallow, and failing <hi>spiritually,</hi> which is not sutable to a <hi>Christian;</hi> as when a mans eating and drinking is meerly governed by sensual, or at best only by physical injunctions and customary occasions, and not by Christian directions, and is not levelled towards the great end, the glory of God, to which Christians, even in eating and drinking, are obliged by Divine precept to have a due regard.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We may consider these sins as in the <hi>act,</hi> or as in the <hi>effects</hi>; the <hi>act</hi> is excessive use of meat and drink in it self, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil effects follow or not; the <hi>effects</hi> are these which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, either in distempering the man in himself, or making him fall out with others, the sin is properly in <hi>the act,</hi> (though the sinfulness of the <hi>effects</hi> be not so diminished by their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on drunkenness as many suppose) and there may be a sinful act, when there is no visible sinful effect in the mans carriage or distemper. Hence <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.22. there is a woe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against those <hi>who are strong to mingle or drink strong drink</hi>; the fault is not that they are strong, that is a property of nature; nor is it that they were drunken, but that being strong to bear much without being distempered, they took on more, lippening or trusting to that, and so abusing their


<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55484:217"/>
strength beyond the right end of it, and drinking more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were strong, then they durst have done if they had been weaker.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Consider eating and drinking in their <hi>circumstances,</hi> and so sometimes meat and drink somewhat beyond ordinary, and chearfulness in the use of them, are allowable: Sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain abstinencie is called for, and though no particular time be set for abstaining from meat and drink, or for fasting, but God hath left that to mens prudence; yet it cannot be denyed but when one will at no time want dinner nor supper, that he may have the more time, and be in a better frame for praying, furthering of mortification, sympathy with <hi>Josephs</hi> affliction, &amp;c. there is no doubt but he will be found guilty of this sin: See <hi>Isaiah</hi> 22.13, 14. where some are cursed for killing oxen and sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine; for certainly some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God calleth for a restraint upon the (at other times law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) use of creature-enjoyments.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Eating and drinking may be considered as to the <hi>expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> we bestow on what we eat and drink, and the affection we have to them, or delight in them, spoken of; as also in respect of the <hi>time</hi> we spend on them. Hence is the curse, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Woe to them that rise early, and tarry long at strong drink</hi>; much time spent this way, even when the grosser effects follow not, will bring a curse from God; for he hath given time for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends, and will have that no less tenderly minded then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, health, or any other benefit; and if we dare not spend, waste, or abuse these in eating or drinking for fear of sin, why should we take more liberty as to our precious time?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Consider eating and drinking as a mean seasonably made use of for its <hi>end,</hi> as <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>health,</hi> and the <hi>honour of God,</hi> or as an <hi>end it self,</hi> or without respect to another end: and thus it is sinful, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.16, 17. and the Land is cursed that hath Princes that keep not the bounds allowed; which imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the using of meat or drink, without respect to its <hi>end,</hi> and that in <hi>due season</hi> (as God giveth all things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.15. and as we should pray for all things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.) is a breach and excess.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Consider eating and drinking, either as going the length


<pb n="382" facs="tcp:55484:218"/>
of evil, or as having the appearance of evil, where either of these is, there is a breach, since we ought not only to abstain from evil, but from all appearances of it, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.11.</p>
               <p>What hath been said agreeth both to sins of drinking and eating: We shall now give some general rules, the observing whereof will further discover the sins that are in the use of meat and drink, either in the <hi>excess</hi> or <hi>defect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is, we should look to a <hi>right end,</hi> both in eating and drinking, which is threefold: 1. <hi>Supream, Eat and drink to the glory of God,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.30. thus vve may sin either in the <hi>defect</hi> or <hi>excess,</hi> by disinabling our selves for any duty of his worship, or by not adverting to this end; this rule therefore saith, we should be so swayed in <hi>quality, quantity, time,</hi> &amp;c. of our eating and drinking, as we may most glorifie God. 2. <hi>Subordinate,</hi> and so we ought to have a respect to others in all these; hence it is that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.20. there is a <hi>woe</hi> to him that eateth with <hi>offence</hi>: thus by frequenting <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,</hi> though we exceed not in drinking, we strengthen others to follow our example to a greater length; or it giveth them occasion to misjudge and misconstruct us; so also the using of unlawful enjoyments in a too carnal and joval a way, before carnal men give them occasion to think that we place some happiness in these things, as they do. 3. Our own <hi>strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening</hi> and <hi>refreshing</hi> is an end to be looked to in the use of meat and drink, and so when we weaken and indispose our selves by them, we sin against this end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider the act it self of eating and drinking, if it be excessive for the <hi>kind</hi> of meat or drink, as <hi>too delicate,</hi> &amp;c. or for the <hi>quantity, too much,</hi> or for the <hi>time</hi> that is spent, <hi>too long,</hi> &amp;c. it is sinful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider the manner, If creature enjoyments be with delight sought for, or excessively delighted in, and folks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come restless and anxious about them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25. and too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in pursuing these things, and too much taken up with them, so that the seeking after them marreth contentment and the quiet frame of the mind, then there is sinful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:55484:218"/>
eateth or drinketh beyond that which he may uphold, or his condition in the world will allow, and when his eating or drinking so, may make himself or his wife and children fast for it afterward, or to be much pinched. 2. In respect of his <hi>calling,</hi> if it divert a man from that, and marr the work in his hand, and make him break appointments set by him for finishing of other mens work, which he might otherwayes have kept, and much more if it indispose him for speaking of, or doing that which concerneth his calling, it is then sure in the excess. 3. In reference to his <hi>body,</hi> if it be weakned, dulled, or indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the excess of meat or drink: This is called <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.12. <hi>inflaming of them,</hi> and is not allowable. 4. Look to it as it affecteth folks <hi>reason,</hi> and in less or more indisposeth them to conceive or judge of things aright; much more when it rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a fury or madness, and maketh them as reasonless beasts in their carriage, it is excessive and to be eschewed no doubt. 5.

our corruptions of laziness, sensuality, and other lusts, when we feast our selves. 8. Look on it with respect to its opposite, <hi>sobriety</hi> and <hi>temperance</hi>; what is not sobriety, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and contrarily; and sobriety being not only no excess, but a denyed sober use of creatures, there must be excess when the mind, as well as the body, is not sober, in the use of these things. 9. Look on it with respect to its <hi>end</hi> (with which we began) when it leadeth not to, and fitteth not for <hi>honouring of God,</hi> when it marreth our being useful to our relations and others, either by taking up our time, or spending our means that we cannot provide for them, and supply them, or indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth us for duties, or hindereth a man from considering his own last end, thus it is sinfully excessive. 10. Look on it in reference to <hi>death</hi> and <hi>Christs second appearing,</hi> for certainly our frame and posture in every thing should be such as we may not be surprised with that: Hence is Christs warning, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed that ye be not overcharged with surfetting, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and that day come upon you unawares</hi>: where he maketh not only <hi>the coming of the Lord,</hi> an aw-band to keep from gross out-breaking into these sins; but joyning them with <hi>the cares of the world,</hi> he sheweth that there may be, and oft is, an indisposition for that day e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the inward frame of the mind, occasioned by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual inclinations and desires, when nothing doth outwardly appear.</p>
               <p>Now put what hath been said to tryal, and ye will find that it is not only he who by surcharging himself staggereth, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth, or hath no use of reason, who in Scripture is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guilty of these evils; but many more, as will be sadly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent when the Lord cometh to count with them; and if he should call many to this reckoning at the time of their eating or drinking, it would be a terrible surprisal to them: It is marked (<hi>Matth.</hi> 24.39.) as an evidence of the sensuality and security of the old world, that they continued eating and drinking, and knew not till the flood came; and it is more terrible and sad what the Lord saith afterward, <hi>So shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man.</hi> O! fear and think seriously of this when ye are at your cups, and after them, and do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that you are never guilty, but when you are like to beasts

void of reason; for the Scripture condemning drunkenness, comprehendeth under it all excess in drinking, and that which may indispose for going about what we are called to, though the exercise of our reason be not alwayes disturbed. Neither to constitute drunkenness is it needful, that the person wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and purposely intend drunkenness, it is enough that he willingly drink (and his will cannot be simply forced) although he be not desirous that these effects should follow; for it is the <hi>act</hi> and not the <hi>effect</hi> which is properly the sin, as is said: If there were any thing of the fear of God, or sense of duty, or shame of dishonesty, there would not need many motives to disswade from these evils; by committing of which most holy men have brought sad things on themselves, and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned sad curses to their children, as in <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> is clear; and therefore their examples and falls are so far from being to be imitated, or made use of to diminish from the account men ought to have of the greatness of the guilt, as they often alas are, that they are set up as beacons to scare and fright from them.</p>
               <p>What sort of persons it doth worst become, is not easie to determine, it being unbecoming to every person, yea even beastly and against nature, men being by it not only put for a time from the exercise of their reason (as it is in sleep) but incapacitate to act it, and put in a contrary beastly fury. How unbecoming is it for <hi>old men,</hi> that should be examples to others in sobriety? How unbecoming is it to <hi>young men,</hi> whose youth should be otherwayes exercised? How unbecoming for <hi>mean men,</hi> who ought to be sober? and how especially unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming is it for men of <hi>place</hi> and <hi>reputation</hi>? upon whom this sin bringeth disgrace, and particularly it is most unsutable for <hi>Ministers</hi> to be given to drink, or to their appetite, to whom the Lord 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. hath given special rules and directions in this matter; but most of all in <hi>women</hi> it is abominable, and was and is so even amongst Heathens; In sum, <hi>whoredom, wine, and new wine, Hosea</hi> 4.11. <hi>take away the heart</hi>; and men are unmanned and made effeminate by them, as was said; yea, are transformed as it were into beasts; of old, men were so ashamed of drunkenness, that such as were given to it, be took themselves ordinarily to the night (though

some indeed did rise early in the morning to follow strong drink, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.11.) And when folks will not keep at distance at the beginning from this sin of drunkenness, but will needs take a liberty and be chearful in it, it prevaileth sadly over them, and maketh them inslaved beasts ere long to it, and they become bewitched with it, so that they can hardly be got free from the fascinations and inveiglements of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> last.</p>
               <p>If it be asked here, Whether men or women, vvhen health requireth vomiting, may not drink excessively for provoking to it, in place of Physick?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That in some diseases there is more allowed of some sorts of drink then in health, cannot be denyed: Yes, 2. a difference is to be put betvvixt sorts of drinks; some are not inebriating, that is, the drinking of a great quantity of them vvill not disturb the use of reason; others are such that excess in them vvill not only indispose body and mind, but quite obstruct and remove the use of reason and judgment; she, first sort of drink (vvhich is more properly physical) may lavvfully be drunken; but in no case is it lavvful for a man to exceed in the use of that drink, vvhich bringeth vvith it the disturbance of his reason; the reason is, because this is sinful in it self, and expresly against Gods command, and defaceth his Image in us (vvhich is in <hi>knowledge</hi>) and is derogatory to it, therefore is it still reckoned a proper <hi>fruit of the flesh, Gal.</hi> 5.21. and it secludeth from the Kingdom of Heaven, as vvell as <hi>fornication, theft, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore can no more be lavvful under that pretext then the other are; see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11, 12. it is also opposed to <hi>an honest Christian walk,</hi> and to the <hi>putting on of Christ, Rom.</hi> 13.13. and that is alvvayes true vvhich vve have <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. <hi>that ill is not to be done that good may come of it,</hi> neither hath God made exception in drunkenness more then in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, for vvhich some such pretexts vvill not be vvanting vvith some to palliate that sin. Again, this is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of drink to procure vomit (I mean the forementioned sort of drink, vvhich none ever read of as approved); beside, it dravveth along vvith it many other sins, vvho can tell but vvhen they are in drunkenness, they may <hi>blaspheme, curse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, murther</hi> or such like? should they then actively


<pb n="387" facs="tcp:55484:220"/>
remove the use of their reason by a practise which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive to such abominations? yea, may not death then come? and should it not alwayes be looked for? and what a posture would a man be in, when in such a case, to meet death? moreover the distemper that followeth such drinking is not such as followeth Physick, which doth only make sick or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispose the body, and what influence it hath on the brain and reason, is but accidental and indirect, but it is otherwayes with that distemper that followeth drunkenness, which putteth the person in such a sort of fury and distraction that the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, unrenewed part doth most frequently get great advantage by it.</p>
               <p>If it be asked further, What is to be accounted of these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which are committed in drunkenness? <hi>Answ.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what was said of this on this on the first Command; but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we say, 1. Drunkenness being a voluntary act, it cannot excuse, but maketh the person doubly guilty, 1. by making the man guilty of such an act, 2. by drawing on that i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was once answered by one, who being desired to spare a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that had committed murther in his drunkenness, and to impute it to his wine; that he should so do, but he would <hi>hang up the flagon wherein the wine was</hi>; and seeing the man made himself so, his punishment was just, for had he not been the flagon of that vvine, that sin might have been prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

Again, 2. whereas every mans own appetite should rule his drinking, this maketh one man prescribe the quantity and quality to others, and so one man, or several men, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the measure, will, and appetite of another; which is unreasonable, it being contrary to nature that men should drink all at one time, and precisely so much, and of such drink. This even in <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> his Feast, <hi>Esther</hi> 1.8. was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Beside, what can be the use of drinking of healths? it cannot be the health of another whom we respect, because that is to be expected in the approved way of prayer, which is the mean that Christians ought to keep fellowship in for the health one of another, and we suppose they are readiest to drink healths who are least in prayer for such whom they pretend to respect. It was a notable saying of a great man (solicited belike to drink the Kings health) <hi>By your leave I will pray for the Kings health, and drink for my own</hi>: And certainly whatever it be in it self, yet the many ill consequents which have followed the drinking of healths, the many drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and quarrellings occasioned by it, the resentments that men will have if they seem to be slighted (as they account it) either when they are drinking themselves, or when their name is mentioned in the health to be drunk, do manifest that they who use it, esteem more to be in that way of drinking then in any other, and so alledge that if a man drink not as much as they, he respecteth them not. Again, men in company drinking healths, either take drink when it is necessary (and in that case, healths are but for the fashion) and do not press it on others, and even thus, though it be indifferent like, yet considering the abuse which hath been of it, the offence that


<pb n="391" facs="tcp:55484:222"/>
may flow from the maintaining of it, and that it often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the rise of more, and giveth occasion to others to follow it more, and to hold it on (even beyond the intention of the  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If vvhat vve have said be truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be in <hi>season for strength,</hi> as it is <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.16, 17. and for the <hi>honour of God,</hi> vve are persvvaded that it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth all these evils, as unbecoming Christians: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the truth of God, or your ovvn credit and esteem have place vvith you, let these things be forborn and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; are vve laying heavy burthens on you?

               <head>THE EIGHTH COMMAND.
<q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Exodus 20.15.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                     <p>Thou shalt not Steal.</p>
                  </q>
               </head>
               <p>WE come now to consider this Eighth Command, <hi>Thou shalt not steal:</hi> In the former the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained the <hi>lust of the flesh,</hi> and mens abusing of their bodies. In this he regulateth them in the use of their <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>estates,</hi> and setteth bounds to the <hi>lust of the eye,</hi> and the <hi>covetousness of the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The scope of the Command in general is, to regulate us in reference to the outward estate of our selves and others, that we fail not either in wronging, or in inordinate and excessive profiting them or our selves: And miscarriages of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are comprehended under this of <hi>stealing,</hi> to make them the more odious.</p>
               <p>From the general scope of the Command we may see, 1. That the Lord alloweth property amongst his people, otherwayes there could be no stealing. 2. That men have not liberty to manage these things of the world according to their meer pleasure and arbitrement, but there are rules set to them, by which they are to be governed in reference to them; and there

is religion in buying and selling, and such like, as well as there is in praying and hearing the word, though the things be of a different nature.</p>
               <p>For opening the Command, Consider 1. the sin forbidden, <hi>stealing,</hi> with the positive duty comprehended under it: 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider its extent as to the kinds of theft: 3. Consider how theft may be said to be committed: 4. You may consider more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly some particular sins prohibited, and duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and Questions that may be moved concerning them, as about <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>giving Alms, Vsury, making of bargains</hi> or <hi>contracts, pursuing of riches, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sum of this Command we may gather from <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.28. <hi>Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.6. <hi>That no man go beyond and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his brother in any matter; because that the Lord is the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. Lev.</hi> 19.11, 13, 35, 36. <hi>Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lie one to another.—Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him; the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night untill the morning.—Ye shall do no unrighteousness in Judgment, in mete-yard, in weight or in measure, just ballances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin shall ye have: I am the Lord your God which brought you out of the land of</hi> Egypt. <hi>Theft</hi> is most strictly defined to be <hi>the taking away of that which is anothers, he not knowing it, and that to his hurt</hi>; but more generally we take it to be <hi>any inordinateness in reference to riches, either by wronging our neighbour, or profiting our selves,</hi> and that whether it be in the attaining, retaining, or using of them; this, though in few words, yet comprehendeth much.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then we call that <hi>inordinateness,</hi> when men mistaking the right end for which, and the golden mediocrity according to which riches are to be employed; they do fail either in the excess, by transgressing the just bounds, or in the defect; or making use of wrong midesses for attaining the end: Hence <hi>the love of money,</hi> or of <hi>riches,</hi> being <hi>the root of all evil,</hi> becometh I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, when riches are made the ultimate end, and pursued and made use of only to satisfie the lust of the eye; or when this love of money is made subservient to some other lust, as


<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55484:226"/>
to the <hi>pride of life,</hi> thus the love of money is inordinate as to its <hi>end,</hi> when it is for an end without and beyond that which is convenient for us. 2. We may be <hi>inordinate</hi> by our being too vehement in our desires after riches, so that we <hi>will be rich,</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.9. we resolve it, and must be so by any means, as it were; which is most dangerous, and by being desirous of too much, keeping no proportionable measure, but being sometimes in the <hi>excess,</hi> spending our time in seeking more then is convenient, sometimes in the <hi>defect,</hi> trifling away much time in the lazy, careless, and negligent pursuit of what is convenient. 3. There may be <hi>inordinateness</hi> in the midesses made use of for attaining or retaining riches either by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful way of conquest simply, or by that which is such in some respects; as by unlawful callings and such like: All which unlawful wayes may be reduced to these three, <hi>rapina, furtum,</hi> and <hi>turpe lucrum, rapine, theft,</hi> and <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> of which more afterward.</p>
               <p>Again, this <hi>inordinateness</hi> we say is when either our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours estate, or our own, is wronged; his may be wronged when ours is not advantaged; as by <hi>destroying, firing,</hi> and the like, out of hatred and malice; yea, it may be wronged by our negligence, when possibly he and our selves are both wronged, yet this is condemned in Scripture; and <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.5. <hi>&amp; sequent.</hi> the Lord provideth Laws anent it. It may be also in reference to the profiting our selves or our neighbour, or bettering of our own estate or his, there is no doubt inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinateness in <hi>getting, keeping,</hi> and <hi>using</hi> that which belongs to us or to our neighbour, as when we get it without right, or its due price by anothers folly or negligence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To proceed a little, we shall consider the sin forbidden in this Command, as drawn to these three forementioned heads, <hi>rapina, furtum, turpe luerum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rapine</hi> includeth violence of all sorts, both by land, and that either by more petty parties, as <hi>robbers, plunderers, &amp;c.</hi> or such as are more strong and able to carry their point, as <hi>Conquerors, Generals of Armies, &amp;c.</hi> medling with that which is not theirs, which is robbery in the Lords account, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.6. And by Sea, this is called <hi>piracy:</hi> It was a true and sharp an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer which a Pirate did give to <hi>Alexander</hi> (as is recorded)


<pb n="398" facs="tcp:55484:227"/>
who being taken by him, and asked, How he could or durst live that way; replyed, He <hi>did only what he himself did; save that</hi> Alexander <hi>bereft men of kingdoms, he but of a little of their means; he with more strength on the land followed his point, he with less upon the sea.</hi> Of which Piracy, whether raping or robbing poor innocent Sea-faring-mens goods, as it is now used by many, I wish all Capers and their Confederates in all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kingdoms and Common-wealths, would seriously consider, and would to this purpose take notice of what the eminently learned <hi>Grotius</hi> saith in his Book <hi>de jure belli &amp; pacis, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. but more especially <hi>sect.</hi> 4. where he doth vvith much reason (whereof he vvas a great Master) and religion, assert, <hi>That when justice, strictly so called, is not hurt, yet a man may sin against that duty which consists in the loving of others, and more especially what the Christian law prescribes (which yet here is only corroborative of the moral law, that perfect and perpetually binding Rule of life and manners) so that if it be manifest that such raping, robbing, or spoyling, will chiefly hurt and indammage, not the whole body or generality of the Enemies, or of the King, or such as are of themselves guilty; but the Innocent, and that in such a measure, as will thrust them into the very greatest calamities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series; wherein to cast even such as are our private and proper debtors, were a merciless and cruel act: But if to all this it be added, that such spoyling or robbing is found to be of no considerable moment or importance, neither to put an end to the war, nor to cut short and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the publick and main force of the Enemy; then, and in that case, such gain ought to be accounted unworthy of a morally good man, and more especially of a Christian, as being made only of the calamity of the times.</hi> On vvhich account <hi>Plutarch</hi> blames <hi>Crassus,</hi> that he had made purchase of the most part of his riches by robbing and spoyling in times of fire and svvord, looking on the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of the times he lived in, as his greatest gain, <hi>Grot. annot. ad idem illud cap.</hi> 18. Whatever vvill be said for pressed men and other Subjects, vvho on the express call of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate go to Sea-sights, their non-obligation to inquire narrovvly and scrupulously into the justness of the War, vvhen it doth not appear to them unjust; yet unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably such persons as go a raping, and their Compartners, for a share of the gain, are obliged to a strict and accurate exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination


<pb n="399" facs="tcp:55484:227"/>
of the justness of the vvar, since they vvillingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves to such vvork, yea, seek for access to it as a special favour and priviledge; vvhich they may let alone if they please, and so in this case, ought, on the least scruple or ground of haesitation, to let it alone; and if they go on, and seek not satisfaction to their consciences to the yondmost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the justness of it, they make themselves as guilty in their station as the Prince, State, or Common-vvealth do, vvho ingage in an unjust War; since vvhatever is not done in faith and from a persvvasion of the vvarrantableness thereof, is sin: And though a War vvere uncontravertibly just, yet <hi>Grotius</hi> his grounds before laid dovvn, vvould be considered, by such especially, vvho out of a covetous humour and desire to make gain, though under the silly pretext of vveakning the Enemy, the least thing ordinarily intended by them, ingage themselves in this course, vvhich not only crusheth many poor Innocents, but is also often vvaited vvith bloodshed, and taking of mens lives; vvho (it vvill not it seems be readily denyed) may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves and their goods, the means of the livelyhood of themselves and their families, vvon vvith much toyl and hazard; and if they may endeavour the preservation of these goods, and defend themselves against such as vvould spoil and bereave them of them, then it's vvorthy of very grave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, if in this case the assailants vvounding, mutilating, or killing poor private men, quietly follovving their callings for their bread, in their ovvn lavvful (at least hitherto in this so circumstantiated case by <hi>Grotius,</hi> not judged and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unlavvful) defence, vvill be found altogether free (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the justness of the War be doubtful, or not conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously inquired into) of murther: And if the aggressors themselves should be vvounded or killed by these self-defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, vvhether they vvill be vvithout all culpable accession to their ovvn self-murther; and so vvhether they vvill not be involved in the guilt, not only of the breach of this Eighth, but also of the Sixth Command: And vvhether goods and an estate acquired or increased by such means, may be brooked and possessed vvith solid peace, and vvith the vvell-grounded expectation of Gods blessing, vvhich <hi>maketh rich, and addeth no sorrow therewith</hi>: This, I say, calls for grave consideration.


<pb n="400" facs="tcp:55484:228"/>
Beside that, it hath been observed, that such courses h <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve sometimes not only made these estates that were acquired by them, quickly to melt away, but also to have been a moth in the estates for the time bettered by them. Observable, and not altogether alien from this matter, is that christian and grave Act made against Prize-goods in the Town-Councel of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the head City of this Kingdom, in great Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> his dayes (as one blessed fruit of the Gospel amongst many others) <hi>May</hi> 10. <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1561. the very year after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick establishment of the reformed Protestant Religion in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The tenure whereof follows: <hi>It is ordained that no man within this Burgh buy any Prize-goods, under the pain of tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel of his freedom for ever, and punishment at the will of the Civil Magistrate, it being contrary to a good conscience, and that we are bound to deal with every Christian Brother as we would wish to be dealt with, and the Goods not to be sold by any godly man within this Burgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Rapine,</hi> again, having a sort of pretext, becometh <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> when a man by power, favour, or such like, outreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and goeth beyond his title, and indamageth the party with which he contendeth more then his right or title would warrant him to do; and this may be in great men over their inferiours, as Masters over Servants, of Landlords over Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, of Magistrates over People or Subjects; and in all these, who any way make use of greatness to distress others, or thrust at them, either to make them quit a right they have, or by retaining from them what is their due, or by exacting by their title what is really prejudicial to the others property, even though by oppression the person be made willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend. Thus also over-powering of others in <hi>Law-suits</hi> and <hi>Courts,</hi> and making use of moyen to bear them down in their right, is interpreted by God as <hi>Oppr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the second, to wit, <hi>Theft,</hi> more properly it looketh to all wayes, whereby, without pretext of violence, another is wronged: This is again divided in four, 1. If it be a wrong done to a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> it is called <hi>Peculatus,</hi> which in a large acceptation includeth not only private men, or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, stealing or robbing the publick treasure, but also Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, Questors, and others that are in such like offices, who,


<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55484:228"/>
when they intervert what belongeth to publick use, become guilty; and proportionably all such as are intrusted with the keeping and distributing of what belongeth to Corporations and Societies, and do intervert it, as <hi>Judas</hi> did in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, when he interverted what was committed to his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for uses not allowed, and therefore he is called a <hi>Thief,</hi> though his crime was also Sacriledge. 2. As it respecteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing appointed for pious uses, so it is called <hi>Sacriledge</hi>; see <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.2, 3. and though now we have nothing that is holy by such a consecration, yet what is appointed by Gods warrant for holy uses, cannot without sin be interverted; such are Churches or Houses built for Gods worship, stipends for maintaining of his Ministers and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, because these belong to the <hi>Church,</hi> as the other do to the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>; such also are the poors money, colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, &amp;c. for if there be an appropriation of these things for that use, then why should that property be incroached on, more then other properties? And if any should say these are the Magistrates gift, and he may use them as he pleaseth? <hi>Answ.</hi> I am not speaking now of what power the Magistrate may have in an extraordinary case of necessity, there being no doubt times, when particular mens property will not have place, but ought to cede to the publick good; but in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cases, I say, that the right which the Church hath in them, for these forementioned uses or ends, is no less then any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate mans in his own particular estate; beside that, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed given unto God: And therefore it is not in the Magistrates power to make what use of these he pleaseth, neither is it at his option to appoint them, and maintain and keep them up, or not, as he pleaseth, but it is his duty, and that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him to do so, as he would be found faithful in the discharge of his Office. 3. There is a gross kind of theft in <hi>men-stealing,</hi> not so much used now, as of old, when there were Slaves, of which men made advantage: This may be also in taking or inticing away of another man or womans servant, to their Masters or Mistress prejudice, which is clear theft, though often practised, and by many, little regarded: As likewise in seducing of Children to a false Religion, to a bad Marriage, to evil Company, to drinking, whoring, robbing,


<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55484:229"/>
&amp;c. to run away from their Parents out of the Country, without a just and necessary cause, &amp;c. this is condemned in the Law, and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. The 4. sort is <hi>single theft,</hi> or the wronging of a man in his private and personal estate; as when a mans money, cloaths, houshold-furniture, corn, horses, cows, sheep, merchant-wares, books, working-tools, &amp;c. are stollen, and privily taken from him. And here do come in the general heads of that <hi>theft</hi> formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turpe lucrum,</hi> or <hi>silthy lucre,</hi> is that gain which is acquired either by simply unlawful, or by dishonest, unworthy, and base wayes and means: As, 1. by niggardliness, when a man seeks to make great gain of the very least and smallest things, who useth to be called <gap reason="foreign">

By taking too large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and greedily when gifts are going, whether to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the giver, or of others standing in no less, or in more need, and of no less, or it may be, of greater deserving, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by incapacitating him to give to them. 3. By a mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting of himself, without all necessity, only to win the world, to base offices and imployments, disgracing his station, as for great men to turn to such, whereby they eat as it were the meat out of the mouths of poor men, who have all their dayes been bred up in, and followed such imployments. For Ministers of the Gospel, in a peaceable state of the Church, and without any necessity, to turn to, and deal in worldly Trades; or in a time of trouble to betake themselves to the very basest of them, when others would do as well, or well enough, for their necessary maintenance. 4. By vice and villany, as for gain to play the whore, to be a pimp or pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to keep a stew or bawdy-house, to forswear or bear false witness, willingly to sell drink till men drink to excess and be drunk, and to allure and sollicit them to it, if the drink may but so go away, and bring some advantage to the Vintner, &amp;c. 5. By squeezing, under colour of Law, as by biting Usury, forging of Writs, by moyen and buds prevailing in law to dwang a man from his right, for a man to buy Pleas; to deal in broken, crazed, or incumbered estates that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with, on design to make gain by defrauding Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,

               <p>Thus we have hinted the first distribution of inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in inquiring into <hi>rapine, theft,</hi> and <hi>unlawful</hi> or <hi>filthy gain.</hi> Consider it again, 1. As it wrongeth others only, or as it profiteth us also: 2. As being direct theft, or as being under pretext of Law: 3. As by acquiring donations, or by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al contracts or bargains: 4. When it is in respect of our selves, or others: 5. When it is in attaining, and then it is called <hi>avaritia, avarice</hi>; when in retaining, then it is <hi>tenacitas, tenacity, niggardliness,</hi> and <hi>sordid parcimony,</hi> in not spending with such a sutable proportionableness as is requisite, or not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving back what is unjustly purchased, or taken from any man, by false accusation or otherwayes, called <hi>restitution,</hi> whereof <hi>Zacheus</hi> speaketh, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. 6. When it is by an ill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as playing, gaming, &amp;c. or by the abuse of a lawful calling: 7. As it profusely wasteth what we have, and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth others of what we should bestow on them, or as it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in more then is meet, and so spoileth our selves of that comfort we might have in our estates, the one is by <hi>prodigality,</hi> the other by <hi>sordid parcimony,</hi> as we have said; see <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.24. 8. As the wrong may be done at first through ignorance, or continued in after folks come to the knowledge of it, in which case the thing is to be restored, and the amends is to be made, as is clear <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.15, 16. And in <hi>Abimelechs</hi> dealing with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> wife, whom, after he knew to be his wife, he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store again untouched.</p>
               <p>O! how doth mens addictedness to creatures make them find out many inventions to satisfie their lust with them! Hence is this Command so broad, that it is difficult to speak of it in all its particulars In further prosecuting whereof, we shall not astrict our selves to so precise a method, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to lay down the direct breaches of it by which the


<pb n="404" facs="tcp:55484:230"/>
positive part, and these duties that are required, will be the more easily discernable.</p>
               <p>Consider then its breach, 1. as it wrongeth others; 2 as it wrongeth our selves; 3. as it wrongfully seeketh to benefit our selves, or better our own estate.</p>
               <p>As to the first, Consider it first in the <hi>quantity,</hi> it is <hi>theft</hi> whether the matter be in little or much, if so be it be a real wronging of others in that which is theirs, even as a <hi>lye</hi> is a lye in any matter, in great things as well as lesser, and this theft in little or much will seclude from the kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. and as <hi>drunkenness</hi> may be in drink, that is, not the very greatest quantity of drink, nor in the finest drink, so may theft be in little or course things. Consider 2. as it looketh not only to the hand, but to the heart also, even as adultery and murther do; it is a piece of the <hi>evil treasure</hi> that Christ saith is in the heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35. and 15.18, 19. 3. It may be sometimes, when he that committeth it, knoweth it not, but supponeth such a thing to be just and due to him, as vvhen he useth not means to knovv, and vvhen he knovveth, doth not restore it. 4. It is sometimes vvholly so carried, as that he vvho is vvronged, knovveth nothing of it; as vvhen (for instance) such a right that vvould clear him in his business is to his prejudice kept up, and he made to believe that he hath no such right, although he quarrel it not, yet it is theft before God. 5. It is direct, vvhen, though one knovveth such a thing to be anothers, yet he vvill needs have it. 6. It is less or more, as there is a seeming necessity, or none at all in the person stealing; for if the thing be indeed necessary for life, it is not theft; so also if the thing have a general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon allovvance among men for its vvarrant, it is not theft, thus the Disciples plucked the ears of corn, vvhich vvas not theirs, and yet vvere not thieves: The sin is gross, vvhen in holy things, or publick things, or vvhen things are taken vvith violence and hazard of life, blood, &amp;c. or vvhen there is great prejudice follovving it to our neighbour, or vvhen it is more frequently gone about, or vvhen it is under trust, &amp;c. 7. It is in contracts or bargains to our neighbours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; as by too close sticking to clauses of Writs, beyond, it may be, the intention of the makers, and vvhen there is


<pb n="405" facs="tcp:55484:230"/>
some pretext of Lavv, this is against the end of Writs and Lavv. 8. It is in buying or selling; and so, 1. vve f <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll in the end, vvhen vve mind our ovvn good only, vvithout any regard to our neighbours; 2. In the <hi>matter,</hi> vvhen the thing is not good that is soll; as the refuse of vvheat that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.6. so vvhen ye sell a thing for better then it is, or in buying, vvill needs make a thing vvorse then it is, or pay the price in base money you are guilty of theft: 3. When the measure or vveight is scarce, and not so much as it should be; see <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. 4. In the manner, vvhen the buyer dispraiseth any thing belovv, and the seller commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it beyond and above its vvorth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.14. <hi>It is naught saith the buyer, &amp;c.</hi> vvhich although in some degree it be ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable, yet no doubt, vvhen on either hand it is vvittingly and designedly done, it is a fault. 9. It may be committed in the matter of just debts; As, 1. vvhen nothing is payed; 2. vvhen a part is only payed; 3. vvhen payment is made out of time, vvhich prejudiceth them vve ovve to, as much as if vve kept a part back; 4. vvhen means are used to get vvhat vve ovve diminished; 1. by dvvanging and constraining a man to quit some part of it; 2. by dealing indirectly to get some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dovvn of the sum vvhich vve ovve, 10. It is committed vvhen advantage is taken of anothers necessity, and so 1. vvhen they are constrained to sell cheaper, then vvithout loss they can; 2. when vve sell dearer to our neighbour, because vve see he must have it; 3. vvhen one is forced to unreasonable tearms, because he must have money; dealings of this nature are like to that, to sell <hi>the poor for a pair of shooes,</hi> vvhich is reproved <hi>Micah</hi> 8.5, 6, 7. and is a gross theft. It is true, in some cases, as for instance, vvhen others vvould not buy such things, and we need them not our selves, neither vvould buy them, vvere it not for our neighbours good, and if they be not so useful for us, an abatement in such a case may be lavvfully sought. 11. It may be by <hi>Law-suits,</hi> even vvhen L <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is a breach of it by wronging our neighbour under trust (which is a high degree of theft) As, 1. by g <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> in trade and bargainings are not faithful one to another; 4. When Servants, Factors, Treasurers, &amp;c. are not faithful, who, as <hi>Joseph,</hi> have all committed to them, and like the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Steward, can count up or down fifty for eighty, and eighty for fifty; 5. Especially here fail Tutors of Orphans and Fatherless Children, who having these committed to their trust, make it their work to prey upon their estates, if they can but do it handsomly, and without observation, this is <hi>theft, robbery, oppression,</hi> and <hi>deceitful dealing,</hi> in the highest degree. 13. There is a breach of it by <hi>bribery,</hi> when Judges suffer themselves to receive gifts, presents, buds or bribes, whether to the perverting of Judgment, or for doing right in Judgment which they are obliged to do without these. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever suffer themselves to be bribed for Judging right, may easily be tempted by a bribe to do wrong in Judgment; all such forget that the Judgment is the Lords, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.17. that they ought not to judge for men but for the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6. that they ought in a special manner to be fearers of God, men of truth, and haters of covetousness, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. that they should not respect persons in Judgment, but hear the small as well as the great, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.17. that they should not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty, but judge righteous Judgment, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.15. that they ought not to wrest Judgment, nor to take a gift (which blindeth the eyes even of the wise, and perverteth the words of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.8.) and that fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery, <hi>Job</hi> 15.34. the Lord doth highly resent, and will most severely punish the breach of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in such, because they do more immediately represent himself, as being placed in Judgment to supply his room. 14. There is a breach of it when there is inequality betwixt our advantage, and that which is expended by us for others, or when for what is not useful and needful, their money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed


<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55484:231"/>
on us is exhausted, or when we occasion them to spend money needlesly, upon any thing that is not useful, but rather hurtful, as in excessive <hi>drinking, feasting, cloathing,</hi> that is full of vanity, or in vain fashions of cloathing, playing at unlawful games, as <hi>cards</hi> and <hi>dice,</hi> or excessively at <hi>lawful games,</hi> or in <hi>dancing</hi> and <hi>fidling,</hi> and such like, which are amongst the lavish and profuse wayes of living, and whoever are accessory to make others follow these, or for these do procure money from others, become thieves. And thus all <hi>idle Vagabonds, Playsairs, Sporters, Minstrellers, Stage-players,</hi> and such like, livers on other folks charges, are guilty of the breach of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. 15. There is a wronging of our Neighbours estate by <hi>negligence, sloath, &amp;c.</hi> when that is not done which we ought to do for their good; this is done especially by Tutors, by Servants, and others, who stand in such relations to any, as that by vertue thereof they are obliged to have a care of what they are interested in. 16. We wrong others by ingaging them to be sureties for us, when we see not a way how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. The ingagers themselves also become guilty of the breach of this Command, except in such cases wherein equity and charity requireth their ingaging, and this way, many are stollen from their estates. 17. It is committed in retaining what is our neighbours; As, 1. when the payment of money or things borrowed is delayed beyond the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Pr.</hi> 3.28.2. When things borrowed are hurt or wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Lord giveth Laws for this, <hi>Ex.</hi> 22.14. 3. When pledges are lost by negligence, or interverted to our own use; 4. When our Neighbours beast is straying, and when seen by us, and not kept for him, as we would he should do to us; see <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.4. 5. When something is lost, and we keep it, as if finding gave us a right to it; it should be for the right owner, and if he cannot be found, publick signification should be made of it, as the Law requireth. 18. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obligeth us to restore, 1. What we have unjustly taken from, or gained of others any way, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. It is recorded of <hi>Selymus</hi> the Turkish Emperour, a most bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy man, that when he was a dying, one of his Bassaas desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to build an Hospital for relief of the poor, with the wealth taken from the <hi>Persian</hi> Merchants; he replyed thus,

                  </gap>hus, <hi>that I should bestow other mens goods wrongfully taken from them, on works of Charity and Devotion, for mine own vain glory and praise? assuredly I will never do it; nay, rather see they be bestowed on the right owners again.</hi> Which was done forthwith accordingly, to the great shame of many Christians, who mind nothing less then the restitution of ill gotten goods, whether by themselves, or by their Ancestours, but cull out some small fragments of a world of such ill-got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goods to bestow on some charitable or pious work, as they call it. <hi>Zacheus</hi> his penitent Proclamation here consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of two branches, to wit, <hi>restitution</hi> and <hi>destribution.</hi> 2. It obligeth even <hi>Children</hi> that have somewhat transmitted to them from their <hi>Parents,</hi> which they have unjustly conqueish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to restore it, otherwayes they make themselves guilty: And in all these we would distinguish <hi>the Court of the Lord,</hi> or <hi>of Conscience,</hi> from mens <hi>Civil Courts,</hi> and thus it will not warrant the Heir before God (though before men it may) to retain that which he possesseth, that the Father left him a right to what he unjustly purchased. It may be it is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this which maketh great estates melt away in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens hands, because it thus descended; the Lord hereby would have men know that they are not richest who have most left them, but who have it well conquieshed with Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. 19. Consider it as it doth not properly take from our neighbours, yet vvrongeth them and deteriorateth their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; so men may wrong the house they dwell in, the horse they ride on, or any thing which is set or given in loan to them; thus they may wrong the instruments that others win their living with; so also we wrong others when their time is taken up either by waiting idly on us, or by unnecessary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments put upon them, visits, and such like; or when weakness of body is occasioned to them by any of these, thus <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.19. the Lord will have reparation made for lost time, as well as for lost means. Many tiplers are thieves this way, to each other, and to themselves, which God will make them count for, how little soever they think of it. 20. There is a wronging of our neighbour without a <hi>compensation,</hi> and there is a wronging him with a pretended <hi>compensation,</hi> that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when the thing is not so good in it self, or not so good


<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55484:232"/>
to him; thus <hi>A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. was guilty in desiring <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, even though he offered him as good, yet it was not so good to <hi>Naboth,</hi> because this was his Fathers, and he esteemed it more: Thus also there is a stealing of another mans contentment, although that in which he placeth it may be a matter of very little or no worth at all, but yet if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath an interest of affection, as they call it, such as a man may have for some petty Jewel, a Hawk, a Hound, or the like, so that it please him, or delight him, the wronging of him in that, is not only a sin against the sixth Command, in grieving him, but against this in prejudicing him of his contentment, which as to him, in some respect, is a sorer wrong, then the taking from him of that which in it self were of far greater worth, would have been. 21. There is a failing by unskilfulness; as, when one taketh on him some office, and receiveth wages or hire for it, and is not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for, nor sutable to the place and employment; thus <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> often steal from men, through their ignorance: As also <hi>Ministers,</hi> who supply Charges they are unfit for, and consume that which should entertain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but this sin in Ministers is oftentimes more through unfaithfulness, when being sustained for the good of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they turn rather to be hurtful. Thus Christ, <hi>John</hi> 10.1. calleth <hi>false Prophets, Thieves</hi> and <hi>Robbers:</hi> And indeed it is the worst gain in the world, that utterly unskilful and unfaithful Ministers get by starving and murthering the immortal souls of men. 22. We wrong others when we communicate not to them when they are in need, and we in a capacity to help them, yea, when by idleness and prodigality we incapacitate our selves to communicate to the necessities of others, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi> 4.28. is clear. 23. Beside, there cometh in here all sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and buying of what should not be sold or bought, as publick places in Church or State; this first from <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Acts</hi> 8.18, 19. is called <hi>Simony,</hi> and is a sin of a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, making that saleable which the Lord will have free: and it taketh in not only giving money, but any other thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account to promove such and such persons, or receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to be sweyed so, and so whether it be <hi>munus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, linguae aut actionis,</hi> a gift of the hand, tongue, or action.

By a gift of action is understood, <hi>service, dependence, on waiting and courtesies</hi> (as they are called) made use of to procure anothers favour; and in all these three men may greatly sin, as when they hunt after, and are sweyed with any of them, and so covet them; as when Magistrates or Judges sell Justice for bribes, when men by lying and false-witness bearing, sell the truth; whereof Lawyers are chiefly guilty, who for fees plead ill causes wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly: or when one giveth them, that he may gain more really upon the other; as for instance, when men by any of these bribes buy Justice, and much more Injustice, and buy lies and false testimonies to prevent or pervert Justice. 24. There is a guilt in consenting too, incouraging in, conniving at, or justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of such as commit this sin, or are receivers or resetters of what is stollen, for their strengthening and incouragement; see <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10. 25. Seasing upon other folks goods sometimes under pretext of escheats, as Admirals doe upon <hi>Sea. wrack,</hi> and such like; when there is no just ground to take away the owners right, and this is reckoned open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence before God, and is a most cruel adding of affliction to the afflicted. This sin then of Theft, in reference to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, is fallen into by <hi>violence, deceit, negligence, unfaithfulness, ignorance, unskilfulness, &amp;c.</hi> And when all is said, a tender heart will still need its own examination and tryal of it self, there being as many wayes to break this Command, as there are wayes to prejudice our neighbours estate.</p>
               <p>We come novv to consider hovv a man is guilty in vvrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ovvn estate (for there is a skill and dexterity in the managing the <hi>unrighteous Mammon</hi>) vvhich vve consider tvvo vvayes; 1. As he vvrongeth and diminisheth his estate by not providently caring for its preservation and increase, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, vvhen he is not frugal, or not so frugal as he ought to be, but lazie and sloathful, he becometh guilty of the breach of this Command, because he incapacitateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for being useful to others, and putteth himself in hazard of poverty and vvant, vvhich is the proper snare of this sin of stealing, and disposeth for it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. This poverty


<pb n="411" facs="tcp:55484:233"/>
which is so ensnairing, is brought on 1. By sinful spending and debauching away of our estate and time, as the Prodigal did, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. By unnecessary waste in prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and lavishness, such as (though unjustly) <hi>Judas</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the woman, spoken of <hi>John</hi> 12.5. <hi>For much spending must have much to uphold it,</hi> and must have many wayes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it self according to the Proverb most ordinarily verified, <hi>Omnis Prodigus est avarus,</hi> every Prodigal man is greedy or covetous, to satisfie one lust he exerceth another; however, he being but a steward of what he possesseth, he by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, not only interverteth from the right end what means God hath given him to be otherwayes disposed of, but also draweth upon himself poverty. 3. By <hi>negligence, laziness, carelesness, &amp;c.</hi> in a lawful calling (for they that are <hi>given to sleep, or idleness, shall come to poverty,</hi> as the Wise man saith) or being without a calling altogether. When God giveth men ability of body or mind, it is sad that they should be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for nothing, nor active in any thing but to sin, and be snairs and reproaches unto Christians and Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as all idle persons, bearing the name of Christians, are, whoever they be, whether Gentlemen or others. It is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that both before the fall, and after the fall, God put that task of working in mans hand, commanding him to labour: many other such foolish wayes there are whereby a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto poverty, and becometh guilty of not providing for himself, or his family: Also by suretyship many are bowed and brought low, which although it is not simply to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, more then to give freely, yet it is to be well regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by charity and prudence, directing so to assist our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his present exigence, as we may also be sure of our after relief, lest for the debts of others, our own families be made to moan for want. 2. We may consider a mans failing in reference to this Command, as he wrongeth and stealeth from himself the free and comfortable use of his own estate; of this man <hi>Solomon</hi> speaketh, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4.6, 8. and 6.1, 2. and he stewardeth not the world well when he hath it, who cannot find in his heart to live on his own, and who liveth heartlesly as if he had nothing at all; in this respect a man wrongeth himself, and particularly these wayes: 1. By coveting too


<pb n="412" facs="tcp:55484:234"/>
great a measure of riches, so that he will not be content with enough, but he will and must be rich, this is <hi>avaritia,</hi> or <hi>greed,</hi> even though the means be lawful which he useth for acquiring of riches. 2. By the vexing anxious manner of seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter even what is necessary: Thus a man may be diffidently and vexingly solicitous for his to <hi>morrows dinner,</hi> and be vexed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, as it is <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.31. <hi>Caring for the morrow, what he shall eat or drink, or taking thought</hi> about it; this is <hi>carking careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> 3. There is a failing in keeping any thing of the world that we have gotten, when we cannot bestow it, cannot twin or part with it, for charitable, either publick or private, uses, nay, not for honest uses, this is <hi>niggardliness</hi>: And when it is universal, both in reference to our selves and others, it is <hi>Durities,</hi> or <hi>extream hardness.</hi> 4. Some may spend on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves liberally, but they can part with nothing for charitable supply of others, such a one was <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. and this is <hi>churlishness.</hi> 5. Some cannot even bestow on themselves what is sufficient, either for meat, drink, or cloathing, as we may see <hi>Eccles.</hi> 6.1, 2. and <hi>chap.</hi> 4.8. that the man hath much, and yet can neither sleep nor eat heartily, because the comfortable use of creature enjoyments is <hi>Gods gift,</hi> this is <hi>sordidness.</hi> Over all these persons the world prevaileth, it mastereth and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh them, and they do not master and overcome it as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians ought to do.</p>
               <p>If we would come to consider, in the next place, how a man should profit better, and improve his own estate, it will be hard to speak so of it as to pitch upon particulars; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God alloweth <hi>parsimonie,</hi> or sutable and due sparing, and <hi>frugalitie,</hi> as he disalloweth and discountenanceth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams in the <hi>defect</hi> and <hi>excess</hi>; we would then consider the midst, <hi>in quo stat virtus,</hi> as they use to say, and so speak of the positive part in these following questions. 1. If a man may aim and endeavour to increase his estate, how far? by what means? or how? and for what ends? 2. How we are to walk in merchandize and bargains? 3. How to walk in <hi>charity, alms,</hi> and <hi>distributing to others?</hi> 4. How to walk in managing of our estate, as to the gathering, keeping, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving and using of it? 5. What to judge of, and how to carry in <hi>Vsury</hi> (as it is called)? 6. What to account of the


<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55484:234"/>
punishment of theft in the Court of men? 7. How it came that the covetous have been so marked or noted in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.5. that they have been looked on as persons secluded from Heaven, and not worthy of Church fellowship? and what marks to know him by? where we may touch a little on the ill of that sin, and speak a word by way of disswasive from it.</p>
               <p>For the first, That one may lawfully increase his estate or goods, cannot be denyed, it being well qualified: <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 30.30. found it necessary to provide for his family; and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. it is a thing that nature it self teacheth a very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel. The great matter is to qualifie it rightly; 1. as to the end, 2. the measure, 3. the means, 4. the way and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the end, 1. The chief and last is <hi>Gods glory,</hi> that we may be serviceable to him with our substance, in our genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may be kept from stealing and lying, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8, 9. 2. <hi>Others good,</hi> that we may be helpful to them, for men may and should work for this end, although they had what were sufficient for themselves, see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.28. 3. <hi>Our selves</hi> are to be considered, and we are to look here, 1. to <hi>necessity,</hi> 2. to <hi>convenience,</hi> 3. to <hi>honesty.</hi> There is a threefold <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> 1. of providing for our selves, 2. for our family, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. 3. for our place and station, such as <hi>Nehemiah, cap.</hi> 5.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was apprehensive of, hence tribute is allowed to the Magistrate, being in so publick and eminent a station, and so useful for the people: In all these we should live, as far as may be, on our own, having an eye to that direction of the Wise man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.15. 2. <hi>Conveniencie</hi> requireth more then necessity, and is to be provided for, see <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. where <hi>Agur</hi> prayeth for that which is neither too much nor too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but convenient. 3. There is <hi>honesty,</hi> and this hath yet a farther reach then conveniency, and thus we are to provide <hi>things honest in the sight of all men,</hi> which may be lawfully aimed at; to be honest then, even before men, is commendable, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty being no pride, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the <hi>measure</hi> which is to be kept in the increasing of our goods, it is hard to determine it, yet sure folks are not left to gather as much as they may even by lawful means at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain


<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55484:235"/>
to, having no bound set to their desires, designs, and indeavours, but adding one thing to another, <hi>till they be, as it were, alone in the earth,</hi> which is reproved <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.9. This boundlesness, alas! haunteth and attendeth too many, and hath never satisfaction. <hi>Agur</hi> found there was an excess in riches to be prayed against, as vvell as poverty, otherwayes he durst not so have prayed: It is with riches as with meat and drink, competencie is good, but excess surfetteth and loadeth, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.6. We conceive these gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals may be laid dovvn here, 1. What may conduce for the ends aforesaid, and is necessary, convenient, and honest; that men may aim at, and no further is needful. 2. Riches not being promised, but only vvhat is convenient, and our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours being commanded only for things honest; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may be aimed at, but a man should not intend to attain to any thing beyond vvhat he hath a promise or command for: The promise is, <hi>he shall not want any good thing, Psal.</hi> 34.10. and 84.11. vvhich is indeed broad enough, and may in some respect be extended even to the command for things honest, vvhereof vve have spoken; see <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6. vvhere, in the Greek (to guard the hearts of the people of God against co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, and to fortifie against all fears of vvanting vvhat is necessary and competent) there is a five-fold negative in the promise, <hi>I will not, not, leave thee, neither, not, not, will I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—3. A man may aim and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be as rich as he may vvarrantably pray to be, but no more; and his prayers are guided partly by the promises, and by the commands, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread</hi>— and partly by the Saints approved examples, as that of <hi>Agurs, Give me neither poverty nor riches, Prov.</hi> 30.7, 8. 4. The measure may be judged of, and tryed by this general, to vvit, if the omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of such a thing hath the just ground of a challenge in it, a man must think it his duty to aim at that, and his sin, if he should not, and it is not his inclination or affection that must guide him here; novv men vvill be challenged in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for not aiming at <hi>competencie,</hi> but not for not seeking to <hi>be rich</hi>; only knovv there is not, nor can be one rule for the same measure to all persons, in this matter; men having different burthens and charges may seek more or less accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,


<pb n="415" facs="tcp:55484:235"/>
and therefore when <hi>Jacob</hi>'s family increased, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. he thought it time to provide for them, neither can there be a rule for the same measure, even for the same persons at all times, as is clear <hi>Jer.</hi> 45.5. in <hi>Baruch</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah, Neh.</hi> 5.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. men ought not to aim to be as others, but as is needful and competent for their rank, burthen, and stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neither 5. must we reckon in this matter by a mans suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; some there are who think they are exonered if they use but any means for providing for themselves, and they have a sort of peace in the endeavour, be it less or more: Others there are, who even by lawful means seek, and also attain to more then is convenient for them, and think they may do so, because they have success; but endeavours would be suted and proportioned to the foresaid ends, with dependence on Gods blessing, whatever be the success, <hi>Psal.</hi> 127.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It would be qualified by the right means, there would be righteousness in the way of purchasing or conqueishing our estate; and it supposeth, 1. That it be by a lawful occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which excludeth what is gained by <hi>cards, dice, wodding,</hi> or <hi>wagering, &amp;c.</hi> 2. By an occupation useful to others, as well as profitable to us, gain must not only nor chiefly sway; but, we should aim at that wherein we may be useful to Church or State in our Generation, then it is lawful to make gain, as the wages of that service. All Trades-men, and men in place, would be as Officers to Church or State, and upon that ground they have a right to make gain. These trading in wines, in such quantities at least, that wrong the Country, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things subservient to vanity, I know not well what to say of them, only I think I may say it had been good for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, some Trades had never been: It is the thing that is condemned <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13, 14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.23. 3. we would have a care that neither deceit, lying, or any other unlawful shift be used in a lawful calling, which may wrong it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to the <hi>manner,</hi> it would be qualified thus, 1. That it be in obedience to God, serving him in some measure in that Calling or Trade, as well as in Prayer; and acknowledging him in the particulars of our gain: 2. That it be by faith on him, waiting, as was just now said, for the blessing from


<pb n="416" facs="tcp:55484:236"/>
him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 127.1. 3. That it be by a Christian way in every thing, submitting to him when a cross cometh, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peremptoriness or anxiety, being quiet in praying, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. but not thoughtful: 4. That it be by trysting and ordering our care for our estate in the world, so as it may be most consistent with promoving our edification, and we not intangled with the affairs <hi>of this life,</hi> as it is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. nor so hedged up and straitned with them, as to have no time for other things more necessary: In sum, our manner would be such as the heart may be kept in a good frame for praying, praising, keeping communion with God, and even for dying in the midst of our endeavours of that kind, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes we may be surfetted, even in cares, about lawful things, and made also indisposed for spiritual duties, as a man is by gluttony and drunkenness.</p>
               <p>Let there be therefore moderation in all these respects, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes, as saith the Scripture, a man that <hi>will be rich,</hi> 1. <hi>He loadeth himself with a burthen of thick clay, Hab.</hi> 2.6. 2. He putteth himself amongst briers and thorns, for <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22. riches are compared to these: 3. He surfetteth himself as a drunken man doth, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. 4. He runneth himself in a snair, and draweth on <hi>many sorrows,</hi> nay pierceth himself through with them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. O! but many souls will cry out greatly one day of this evil of immoderate pursuing after riches: 5. He bringeth <hi>a wo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </hi> from God upon himself, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.8. 6. He will readily be high-minded and proud, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. 7. He is in eminent hazard to trust in these uncertain riches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8. He is in great danger to turn aside from the truth, and to embrace errour, which is strange, yet most true, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. 9. He is in great hazard to be an oppressor, <hi>James</hi> 2.6. and 5.4. 10. Riches immoderately sought after, do the man still evil that possesseth them, as in <hi>Agurs</hi> prayer, <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> experience, and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10, 11. is evident, where it is said they fall into many foolish and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lusts, which drown them in perdition and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The second thing is concerning <hi>trading</hi> and <hi>merchandize,</hi> whereof we shall say but little in particular; In general then, 1. Trading is lawful in it self, as a mean to the ends

There may be faults in buying and selling both, all men generally loving to buy within the worth, and to sell dear, as a Heathen once told a company what was in all their minds. 3. A Merchant-man and Trades-man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing his <hi>time, pains, estate</hi> in trading, may take gain as the wages of his pains, as a <hi>servant</hi> may do for his work, as <hi>Teash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>Physicians</hi> may do for their pains, because they cannot be wanted, and none can go about these employments without livelyhood, therefore is the <hi>workman worthy of his hire,</hi> but it must be such a work as is worthy. 4. Yet a mans rule in bargaining is not to take whatever he can get; nay not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as he bought, having, it may be, bought too dear, or these wares not being now in such esteem, nor as they were when bought by him; nor is the price alwayes to be hight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him as the wares grow more scarce, if so be they be not dearer to him. But folks vvould consider, 1. The vvorth of the thing in it self, and according to the necessary and just circumstances of his Calling and Trade; so that suppose they vvere buying it themselves, they vvould be content to give as much as they demand, and men should never offer less to others, then they vvould demand themselves, though their ordinary vvay is much contrary to this, as vve may see <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.14. 2. No shifts are to be used by the seller to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value or call his vvare better then it is, or by the buyer to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue and despise it, belovv vvhat vve think it to be, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.11. 3. We should never simply or only mind our ovvn advantage in selling and buying vvithout respect to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of others, but vvould so sell and buy as they might be also gainers; and thus vve see that charity regulateth us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4. 4. Neither vvould the buyer deceitfully hide vvhat may commend the price of vvares, nor the seller vvhat may make it less; as suppose one knevv such vvares or merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize vvould shortly grovv cheaper or dearer, and therefore he either selleth or buyeth purposely to put the loss on his neighbour, or at least to make gain to himself, vvithout any regard to his neighbours loss. 5. There vvould be ingenuity in buying and selling, that vvhich ye call <hi>prigging</hi> or <hi>cheapning,</hi>


                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:55484:237"/>
is not good; both buyer and seller should put a just value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vvares, and hold there; there is much jugling and falshood and lying vvhen it is othervvayes, see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.14. 6. There are ought to be no taking advantage of anothers necessity, ignorance, and simplicity. 7. In a vvord, vve vvould sell and buy and do to others as vve vvould have them do to us, and so vve vvould keep up no fault vve knovv, of the things vve sell, give good measure and good money, &amp;c. All these things come in under trading and merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and thus one just price should be kept, so far as may be.</p>
               <p>If it vvere asked here, hovv vve may pitch or settle on a just price? It is hard to ansvver this question to full convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and satisfaction; yet a man vvould consider, 1. What he himself, having knovvledge of the goods, vvould give for such and such, <hi>corn, cloath, beasts,</hi> or vvhatever it be, if he hath or had use for them, or vvere to buy them. 2. What men of knovvledge do judge such a thing to be vvorth, and vvhat may be the price of it (if the price be by Authority regulated, it setteth it self). 3. What such a thing doth generally cost amongst those that are judicious and conscientious. 4. What he vvould give for the like possibly again, vvhen this is avvay, allovving fit gain. In sum, there are three sorts of prices; the 1. Is <hi>rigid,</hi> vvhen men must have vvhat they vvill for their vvare: The 2. is <hi>easie,</hi> this is only at some times vvhen it is called for, but it is not alway necessary, and selling thus, in such cases, is an honest giving, which men are not alwayes at least obliged to. The 3. is <hi>pretium medium,</hi> or the middle or modest price, which is betwixt the two, and in no extream; yet when any question is, whether this much or that much is to be taken? It is safest carving on the side that lyeth next our selves. 5. A man would consider how he would proceed in that bargain, so as he might have peace, if he were just now to die, and what he durst adventure on in that case, let him do the same in all his bargains.</p>
               <p>Amongst the many and great uses of riches, some of them concern our selves, some of them others, and there lyeth no less necessity upon us to shew mercy for the supply of others, then to pay our debt, or supply our selves; and to a man in case for it, God hath not left the one indifferent more then


<pb n="419" facs="tcp:55484:237"/>
the other. For clearing of which, we would consider that God, who is the great owner and absolute proprietor of the Creatures, and who distributed them to men according to his pleasure, hath distributeth riches to some, as it were to Stewards, to be made use of for his houshold, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from <hi>Luke</hi> 16.10, 11, 12. Hence it is not left arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to men to give alms, or not, as they think meet, but it lyeth on them as an absolute duty: Hence also we may see what a sin it is to be altogether neglective of it, or deficient in it; 1. It is a stealing and theft, as is implyed <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.28. 2. It is per <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This giving of <hi>alms</hi> rightly qualified, is highly accounted of in Scripture, and assigned as the mark of a righteous man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.9. noticed and commended in a special manner at the day of Judgment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30. &amp;c. commanded as a duty, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.7, 11, 14, 21. and 26.11. &amp;c. and much pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and insisted on, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. and scarely will we find in all the Scripture one particular duty about which two whole Chapters together are spent, but this, which holdeth out the great complacency the Lord hath in the single and sutable practice of it, it being there deservedly set down and insisted upon as a sure evidence of the reality of our prosessed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Let us see then 1. wherein it consisteth? 2. who is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, 3. who is to give, 4. how for manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it is to be given? 1. <hi>Alms,</hi> is not every giving, for that may be of debt, or it may be to a rich man, or one that hath no need, out of pride, or for the fashion; but 1. there is a needy object from which we can expect nothing again, to this we are to give <hi>alms</hi>; 2. There is a doing it upon the account of the Command, as thereby honouring our maker, and testifying our love to Christ, which is to do it to a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>in the name of a Disciple, Matth.</hi> 10.41, 42. it taketh

in all supply, as meat, drink, visiting them, vindicating them, comforting them, by lending, giving, forgiving of any thing that is owing, &amp;c. 2. The object, <hi>neighbour,</hi> is large, but it is the needy one only that is to be looked to, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.28. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.11. And the poor ones, who may be considered, 1. As to the degree of their need three wayes, 1. Need that is <hi>common,</hi> and such as folks may fend with it; 2. that is <hi>pinching,</hi> when they fend with difficulty; 3. that is <hi>extream,</hi> when they cannot subsist; In the first case, men are to give out of <hi>their abundance</hi>

               <p>For general rules to direct in this matter, I propose these: 1. Lay by such a <hi>quota</hi> of your estate or gain, and let that be dedicated to the use of Charity, that ye may have it to bring forth vvhen particular occasions shall offer; men vvould not alvvayes stay till it be sought, but vvould have, as it vvere, a <hi>poors box,</hi> or a box for the poor by them; so the Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a certain Tythe under the Lavv for <hi>widows, father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, &amp;c.

vvhich he cannot do in particular occasions, because he knovveth them not; but in the general he may proportion vvhat he may spare to all in common, and thereafter subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide vvisely upon considerations and after-emergents; yet so, as vvhen necessity is extream, he go beyond that vvhich is his ordinary allovvance; this also vvould prevent all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations having any tendency to the dissvvading of us from any thing for that use, if somevvhat vvere set apart for it, and it vvould also ease the mind and conscience of such vvho vvere tender, if in some particulars they failed, to be clear that they did not hold it in for their ovvn advantage, but that they vvere forth-coming according to their ability.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Folks vvould not delay giving till the needy person seek; they are often the greater objects of charity vvho seek not; poverty is no reproach, but vagabond begging, and sloathful idleness, vvhen men are able to vvork, hath ever been so, and should not be tollerated amongst Christians; but these vvho are right objects of Charity should be provided for, and as it is in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.10. <hi>portions should be sent to them.</hi>

Hence there should be some vvise mutual vvay of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into folks necessities, and the fairest vvay taken of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying our Charity to them, such as may be least burthensom to their ingenuity, as <hi>Boaz</hi> did vvith <hi>Ruth,</hi> in private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Servants to let fall some handfuls; this some may do, vvho may have more access to, and dexterity in, doing things of that nature, then others; therefore friendly associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations for this end, that some might give, and others distribute, vvould be sutable.</p>
               <p>If it should be here more particularly inquired, What may be the <hi>quota</hi> of this that is to be bestovved? vvhich must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of ordinary cases (for extraordinary cannot be stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) It is hard to fix particular rules, because it must vary, 1. according to the givers estate, 2. according to their need vvho receive, 3. according to the several burthens of the


<pb n="423" facs="tcp:55484:240"/>
givers, who are to extend their Charity less or more accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; for it may be that they have their own poor children or friends, whom they must furnish, and so cannot give so much as others, who are free of the like burthens. Look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to these general Rules; 1. That Charity be liberal and in bounty, not in covetousness; too little is a fault, and too much also may be one, though not so great as the other; see 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. 2. Let it be by Christian prudence, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious deliberation determined, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. <hi>as every man purposeth in his heart, &amp;c.</hi> If a man will put it to a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious deliberation, he doth well, and it will not want fruits; I think many could not judge their way to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously charitable and communicative, if they would thus simply and unbyassedly put it to the tryal. 3. Folks would judge it by <hi>an equality,</hi> as it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13, 14. for one man cannot fully supply all. Now it is somewhat propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, if a man, considering the state of poor ones and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasions, can discern so much to be useful and needful to them, and that his part of that would come to this much, and accordingly to give (even as all gave their proportion of tythes under the Law) whatever others did, only this sayeth that men would even go beyond their power sometimes, when others fail. 4. Folks would set aside the half of their need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less superfluity, that they may be able to give out of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that is, when mens families are competently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of meat, cloathing, and estate, if there be still more, let there be as much laid aside to this use; For 1. this cannot burthen them; 2. Less cannot be admitted of before God, then to bestow as much on the necessities of others, as on our own superfluities; and 3. this would amount to much, if so much were bestowed on Charity as we bestow on the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of meat, wine, building of houses, houshold plenishing, vain apparel, laces, and other dressings of that sort. 5. The Lord in the Law stinted the people to a <hi>tenth,</hi> or thereby; for <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.21. there was one <hi>tenth</hi> to the Levites alone, who were to give the <hi>tenth</hi> of that to the Priests, this might be eaten any where. Again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.22. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. there was a second <hi>tenth</hi> to be eaten for two years before the Lord, by the man and his houshold, as well as by the Levit, fatherless and


<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55484:241"/>
widow, &amp;c. but every third year was for them only. Now (not to be peremptory) by this proportion it would seem that the Lord calleth for a considerable part, near or about, the tenth of our free rent or gain, which he would have us to employ thus, and this would be found no great burthen, and it might be waited with Gods blessing upon what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</p>
               <p>It is then, you see, no little part of wisdom to walk right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the things of the world, yet as <hi>holiness</hi> is no friend to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,</hi> so neither is it to <hi>prodigality,</hi> there is a midst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these two, which is called <hi>frugality,</hi> this is well consistent with <hi>piety,</hi> for it neither carkingly gathereth, nor carelesly neglecteth, nor prodigally wasteth or casteth away, but is a sparing and spending, a gaining and giving out according to right reason. But for the further explication of it, I shall put you in mind of these following Scriptures, which have so many properties, qualifications, evidences, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of frugality. 1. It provideth <hi>for things honest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and men,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17. 2. It maketh a man look well to his <hi>herds and flocks,</hi> and in a gainful sinless calling is diligent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.23. and not <hi>sloathful in business, Rom.</hi> 12.11. — 3. It is not vain and lordly, so a frugal woman is described, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.10. &amp;c. by being honest in her carriage, honest in her family, providing for her husband, children, and servants, cloaths, fare, &amp;c. yet not vain, she maketh her own cloath, and her family is provided for, in an honest thirsty way, without great cost. 4. It is provident, though not covetous, like the <hi>Ant laying up in Summer, Prov.</hi> 6.6. <hi>And the vertuous woman seeth and considereth a field, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaseth it, Prov.</hi> 31.16. 5. It is taken up about things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, not superfluous, <hi>John</hi> 13.29. the Disciples thought <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> had been sent out to <hi>buy what was necessary,</hi> not what was superfluous. 6. It putteth nothing to unthrifty uses, nor suffereth any thing needlesly to perish, according to that word of our Lords, <hi>John</hi> 6.12. <hi>Take up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</hi> 7. It moderateth its gifts, that they be neither of covetousness nor prodigality, but as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 112. <hi>The good man guideth his affairs with discretion.</hi> 8. The frugal man his conquest is in that which hurteth not others, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55484:241"/>
by his own industry then others simplicity; It lyeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his diligence and dexterity, then in his slight and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in duty to satisfie conscience, and not in sin to raise a challenge. It is in a word, a following of riches with Gods blessing, seeking them both together, it being, <hi>the blessing of the Lord which only maketh rich, Prov.</hi> 10.21. <hi>and he addeth no sorrow therewith</hi>; all other riches without this, have sorrows multiplyed on them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. the good man, and truly frugal, <hi>seeketh first the kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 6.33 and <hi>the one thing necessary,</hi> and alloweth not himself to be cumbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>many things,</hi> as <hi>Martha</hi> was, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.41. he chooseth the right time and season, and is not inordinately bent upon ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, he knoweth <hi>there is a time to scatter,</hi> as well as <hi>to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as it is <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.6. He knoweth when to be liberal, and carrieth Charity along with him, and wrongeth it not.</p>
               <p>Before we pass this Command, we may consider the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the breach of it, and that in a threefold conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; 1.

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:55484:242"/>
thing that may bring him gain, as of a trick of Law (and such like) even when it is rigid as to anothers hurt, or like the man that is cruel against others, taking them by the throat, saying, <hi>Pay me all that thou owest</hi>; distraining and distressing for little things, when he himself is not straitned, unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully treating others, when they are not able to stand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, as <hi>Laban</hi> did, in changing <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>wages ten times, Gen.</hi> 31.41. and many such characters are there, whereby the covetous may be tryed and discovered, as especially when they come to justifie and defend, and continue in these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned unseemly wayes of getting gain, and much more when unlawful shifts are used to gain by; It is like that in such cases covetous persons have been ecclesiastically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, or at least, there hath been a <hi>brotherly withdrawing from them</hi> to put a <hi>note</hi> on them, as was put on <hi>drunkards, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, &amp;c.</hi> as also 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.14. the Apostle command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth these persons, who were guilty of the opposit sin of <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> to be marked with a <hi>note</hi> of shame.</p>
               <p>And although it be hard to make out covetousness in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, where there is no sin in the matter; yet generally where there is a person that excessively is so, there will be both a common account of him to be such in his dealing, by those who can discern, and many complaints of all, almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and a hard disesteem of him: From the grounds that have been touched on, it is somewhat evident that such who generally are called, <hi>neer, hard, rigid</hi> men, though they be not properly unhonest, are guilty of this sin of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and consequently of the breach of this Command: But however, when covetousness cometh to be scandalous, so as it may be made out, it falleth within the compass of the object of Church-discipline: and certainly seeing covetousness, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when there is no direct theft or oppression, is often so scandalous and offensive; It would seem there must have been in the Apostles time some way to make it out, and that then upon such certain evidence of the scandal, brethren have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one to another about it, in which admonition if they did not acquiess, it proceeded further, and at last private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were to shun the familiar company of such for their shame, who thus walked disorderly, by pursuing and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>As to the 3. Consideration of the punishment of theft, what it may be in the <hi>Civil Courts of men,</hi> or by the Magistrate, we will not insist here without our sphear and line: But to speak here a little to the punishment of direct and plain theft, which is that commonly noticed and pu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ed among men, certainly <hi>Blasphemy, Adultery,</hi> and such other sins are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at least no less, if not more capital then this: And those who have observed the Laws and Customs of Nations assert, That in no place generally theft was punished with death, till <hi>Draco,</hi> that bloody Prince (whose Laws were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in blood) did it; certainly the Politick or Judicial Laws of <hi>Moses</hi> were for tenderness, as conscientious, for equity, as just, and for wisdom, as profitable, Laws to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as ever any since were, or could be, being immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Divine, yet find we not death ordained by them to be inflicted upon it, but restitution to be made double, fourfold, or fivefold, according as the thing was in worth, and as the neighbour was prejudged by the taking it away, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1, 2. It is true, if the man had nothing, then was he to be fold for his theft, to make up his neighbours loss, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22 3. And if in the night one had been smitten digging through a house, it was not to be accounted murther: If I say, it was in the night, or before Sun-rising, because that by these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it became a violation of mens common security, and the design of such an atrocious attempt might be presumed to be against the life or persons of men: And upon this ground, such Robbers as break the publick peace, that men through fear of them cannot travel, go about their affairs, or live at home; or whose robbery doth carry direct hazard to mens lives with it, these upon that account are worthy of death; but not so much for sinning against this Command as against the sixth; the Reason is, because there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a mans wronging another in his goods, and the losing of his life, and in justice, where circumstances do not highly aggredge the crime, and bring it under some other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there should be a proportionableness betwixt the crime or hurt done, and the punishment and retribution thereof, as

                  </gap> that we should speak somewhat of <hi>Vsury</hi>; concerning which, as there are many words spent in dispute, so no question there are many sins in practise; by custom the name of <hi>Vsury</hi> is become odious, and may be taken for <hi>unlawful gain, gotten by the meer loan of money,</hi> and in that case the Scripture being so clear, there is no place left for questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of its sinfulness.</p>
               <p>If we abstract from the word, and consider the thing in it self, <hi>viz.</hi> if it be lawful for the meer loan of money to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact for some advantage, it will be another question: And here indeed, in respect of mens corruptions, who can keep no bounds, there is great hazard of miscarrying; yet we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in answer to it, there are two extreams to be shunned, so that we can neither say that simply it is lawful in all cases, nor simply unlawful: Not simply lawful, because there is some such sin committed, directly condemned in the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19. Nor simply unlawful, so as in no case it is to be allowed; for suppose one that is unable to labour, have only some money, and no land or other visible estate; or suppose men to have Orphan-childrens means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them; may not that person, or the tutors of these children lend the money to such as are in capacity to make gain by it, and receive some proportionable advantage for the loan of it? we conceive no ground can altogether condemn it as contrary either to the rules of equity or charity.</p>
               <p>It is not contrary to the rules of <hi>equity,</hi> that when one is so much benefited by the estate of another, that the person whose the estate is, should proportionably share of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, which without him and his money, the other had not reaped: Nor is it contrary to the rules of <hi>charity,</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Charity command us to lend for our neighbours <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi> yet not for <hi>his gain</hi> and the inriching of him; and it would seem strange that a man, having nothing but money,


<pb n="429" facs="tcp:55484:243"/>
should be obliged to lend it freely to rich men, who making conqueish thereby, should reap the benefit, and yet he get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The law of equity, <hi>That we should do to others, as we would have them do to us,</hi> will not infer, but that if a man, by possessing another mans money, did either make conqueish of so much rent by it, or did retain so much, which otherwayes he could not do, he is obliged to make the lender proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable sharer with him of the gain; for it is hard to say, that a man might buy such a piece of land with my money from another, and in buying of it gain so much, and yet by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him keep both my money and the land, I be warranted to ask nothing at all. Sure, were I the borrower and buyer, I should think otherwayes, and judge it equitable, that the lender should be a partaker of the profits arising, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, from his own money.</p>
               <p>If we will consider this of <hi>Vsury</hi> a little further, we will find 1. That all the Commands strike against the injury of exacting it from an object of mercy, such as the <hi>poor brother,</hi> or even a <hi>poor stranger,</hi> for in this case our money is to be lent freely, and sometimes we are obliged to give it freely, and neither to look for stock nor annual, as we may see <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 34, 35. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moreover, as the Command is not to exact <hi>usury from the poor brother,</hi> so it comm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The Lord allowed gain of lent money to be taken from <hi>strangers, Deut.</hi> 23.20. and yet it cannot be said that he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them any thing towards strangers, which is in it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Moral Law or light of Nature, or which is sinful in it self. It is true, as to <hi>poor strangers,</hi> God made one Law for his people and for them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.35, 36. and further he injoyned that the stranger should not be oppressed amongst them almost every where, and therefore this other allowing the taking of <hi>usury</hi> from strangers, if rich, is the more bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

to that part of the Divine Law which is commonly called Judicial, and in its direct authority only intended by the Lord for that people, and something common to all men, as flowing from the principles of equity and charity, held forth in the eighth Command; that which I conceive to be common, is the rule given for lending to the poor, which therefore we see is made binding by the Law of God, both toward an Israelite and a Stranger, and doth certainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that we should lend to such freely, without regard to our own profit, and only for their supply and relief in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, permitting a free use of our money; and as for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of our repayment, minding it with that fair temper of equity and moderation, which we our selves would expect if necessitated to borrow: Besides, the rule should also influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence our continuing and manner of exacting the debt, that all be done without rigour, and with that goodness, that even the loss of the principal, if so it should fall out, should be no grudge or disappointment. But the thing which I take to be peculiar to that people, is, that I think the trade of lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or lending for profit, was absolutely to them prohibited among themselves, which is clear from <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19. and the distinction there made betwixt an Israelite, from whom usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might not be taken, and a Stranger from whom profit is permitted. And the reasons of this Command might not only be the better prevention of rigorous loaning and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the stirring up of all to honest and diligent labour (from which the hope of borrowing, as well as the profit of lending doth often keep back) and other such considerations too much neglected in all States and Politics, but also it might flow from other things particular in their condition, such as the equal distribution of their Land, secured to perpetuity by the recourse of their Jubilees, and it may be that the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and conveniency of its situation for forreign traffique, with something peculiar in the rigid and covetous temper of that people, might also have occasioned this precept; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that this prohibition of the trade of loaning, and that Statute of the Seventh year of Release, have a manifest consonancy. But as to us, and all other people, to whom the Lord hath not so commanded, and who are clearly under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="431" facs="tcp:55484:244"/>
polity, and in many other different circumstances, I do not see why this loaning for profit in a righteous and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, should be accounted prohibit, and because that loaning of money for profit, and taking of profit for money in other forms of bargaining, are of their own nature very like, and by use much confounded: We shall speak to both, what may be pertinent and edifying, without observing any more curious then useful distinctions; and it is known that the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> from <hi>equity</hi> grant, that in some cases a man may make gain by lending his money; As 1. when it is <hi>lucrum cessans</hi> to him, that is, when by such a loan he prejudgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of some benefit he might make by it; 2. When there is <hi>damnum emergens,</hi> or any loss accresseth to him by it; Or 3. when his money proveth so much more useful at such a time to such a person, but it is to be estimate according to its present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiate case; 4. They suppose one to advance the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney before he actually receive the thing which he hath bought or purchased, and in that case they allow that the seller, in respect of his retention of the fruits, get a smaller price, and less advantage; or suppose the seller to lye out of his money so long after delivery of the thing sold, and they allow him to take the more; and what is that, but taking so much for want of their money? Again, some of them dispute, tha <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> though money in it self be not apt to increase (which is their great argument) yet considered as the instrument of trade and mean of negotiation, it is as apt to increase more money, as corn sown is to grow to a greater increase.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not for naught that our Lord useth the parable of the <hi>talents,</hi> wherein certainly he intendeth no unlawful way of trading, but that which was commendable in its proper circumstances.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In matter of communicating and charity, the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth an <hi>equality,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13, 14. and that one should not be burthened and another free: Now suppose one of a lesser e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state to have only money, shall he be obliged to the punishing and burthening of himself to lend more; and that freely (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of charity, for there is no other meant here) then a man of a greater estate is, because he hath it not in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, where is the equality?</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:55484:245"/>6. Right reason agreeable to Scripture will clear this; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose one gives another so much land for so much money, and the buyer desires to retain a part of the money, shall the sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler be incapacitated to receive now any thing less of his estate when in money, then formerly when it was in land? Is it not still his estate and of the same value? and therefore may it not yield that same equivalent by moderate usury or interest?</p>
               <p n="7">7. If it were absolutely denyed, then these absurdities would follow, 1. That some estates would be useless to their masters or owners, and others not: 2. That some, for instance, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, Orphans,</hi> and persons unable for trade, should be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated to make any use of their estates, or any provision for their families meerly on this account, because either they are in such stations, or have their estates in such a condition: 3. Then should one get no payment of money, no not the principal, suppose the person owing could not repay the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal without selling some part of his estate (seeing we ought not to seek in the <hi>principal debt</hi> more then its <hi>increase</hi> to his hurt) because then (according to their principles) we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not to lend freely. Then we ought not to turn our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state from money to land, because in doing so we disinable our selves to lend freely. Then also there needed not, nay there ought not to be any selling of land or buying amongst neighbours (as in some respect it was not amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to the year of Jubilee) because 1. If men get money freely, they might still, and no doubt would still keep their estates, and not pay their debts: 2. If men could not take any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease for money it self, then could not a man buy another mans possession, which can yield him afterwards that same principal sum, and also yearly so much more, for this doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an increase also: And beside, if this did hold true, then what rule were to be kept in lending? If it be said <hi>charity,</hi> that is granted, but so long as a mans estate is better then mine, can any say I am in charity obliged to give him, or lend him, and get nothing again? If any say <hi>equity</hi> should be the rule; none will say it is equity the borrower should possess his own estate, and mine also, and give nothing to me, when by my loan benefit accresseth to him: And if one may give money for land, and then exact rent, why may not one give


<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55484:245"/>
that same money to another, and suffer him to possess the land bought with it, and expect so much rent from him? when he accounteth the having of the money at such a rate of encrease and benefit, the land, possibly in his account, being beyond the rent or the worth of that money: And if there could not be any interest taken, men should never, nor could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect borrowing or lending for surthering their profit, but for meer necessity, and by that means the g <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t benefit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man trading would be interrupted.</p>
               <p>Add that men are called to equity and charity, not so much according to the quality of their estates, as to the quantity or value, that there may be an equality. And if a man that hath money be obliged to lend freely, is not a man that hath land obliged to sell it, that he also may be in a capacity to do it? Certainly when necessity so requireth, he is obliged to give, although he should sell his land for that end. And consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that money is so useful (for it <hi>answereth all things,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.19.) and that in reason it cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that a thrifty and frugal man will have a sum any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, but either by trading or buying land, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, he shall benefit himself by it, there is no such reason to cry out on the iniquity of this simply considered; yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that some have money, others have access to improve it, which they have not by dexterity, health, occupation, &amp;c. yet wanting money, the exercise of all these is impeded, it would seem that if the money of the one make the skill of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother profitable to him, that then the dexterity of that man should make the others money profitable to both, according to the due proportion; so that as the one could not use the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers labour vvithout him, so neither the other his money, that so there might be equality.</p>
               <p>It is questioned mainly, if one may covenant or contract for so much liquidat increase of his lent money? (seei <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That there may be such a contracting and covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be questioned, more then it can be in selling land or houses (though the money lent may possibly be trusted to the borrovver, vvithout any antecedent, contract, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,


<pb n="434" facs="tcp:55484:246"/>
and the increase thereafter proportioned to the gain of the borrower) it is true that this would be moderated, and within the gain that otherwise with hazard might be expected, because the lender is free of hazard, and we conceive the <hi>How much</hi> may by these rules be tryed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may covenant for as much as by a free bargain his money would otherwise yield him; as suppose one by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing that sum on land, would with as much certainty as can be in such matters, obtain so much land-rent, why may he not let his money for that, seeing it can be no filthy or dishonest gain; that being properly <hi>Vsury,</hi> that by lending gaineth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately, or more then lawfully, otherwise it might or would, and that to anothers prejudice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the party borrower hath certain gain by it, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if he do purchase so much more rent, or if he be ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to retain so much unsold, which without that money he could not do; he looseth nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When a man may without extraordinary sagacity or pains by trading, compass and make more gain then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion he payeth for the loan amounteth to, so that to make it certain he hath the hazard of so much more: Thus the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of five or six in the hundred <hi>por annum</hi> hath never been accounted <hi>Vsury,</hi> because any thrifty and frugal man may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it to more in a years space. As <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.19. there is a compensation to be given for time, which certainly must be so much as may be thought the loss of that time hath prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other of, or what in reason it might be thought he would have advantaged himself if he had had that time; the one goeth upon the ground of <hi>lucrum cessans</hi> (which School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men grant) the other of <hi>damnum emergens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But certainly the fault is much oftner and more ordinarily in the other extremity in taking <hi>too much,</hi> as the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of the Prophets, and the little conscience that is every way made of it, make evident: We would therefore take the pleaded for allowance, with these caveats, 1. That the gain never be beyond the allowed increase by the Law, we may, and sometimes should be below, or within it, but never above or without it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, 2. the rules of charity and equity are not to be broken as they are, when other the poor are not lent


<pb n="435" facs="tcp:55484:246"/>
unto for the supply of their necessity, or only on the same tearms with the rich, this is against the Law, <hi>Ex.</hi> 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. and what the Lord saith, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.34, 35. commanding to lend without expectation of any thing, when the borrowers case calleth for it. 3. No increase would be exacted from these that neither gain by increasing or retaining their own portion, but when what is gained is imployed for their necessary sustenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or when without their desire, and not by negligence, they are put to straits, or cannot command their ovvn, or their ovvn is but little, and vvill not bear their giving of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and sustain themselves too, in this case it is <hi>their life and bread,</hi> nothing is to be exacted, as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 4. Folks vvould not so empty their hands by lending to rich folks all (if they may spare any) as to be incapacitated to lend freely to the poor, for so men may frustrate the great end of this Command, and fail against the rules of Charity. 5. There is unlavvful <hi>Vsury,</hi> and to be guarded against, vvhen men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider not vvhat use the borrovver maketh of money, hovv he debaucheth and spendeth it, if so be their increase be sure, or consider not if by emergent providences the borrovver, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ovvn fault, lost much; for equity saith that conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ought to be here, and vve should not be svvayed only by our ovvn gain. 6. Folks vvould not make a trade of this ordinarily (vvhich is but for necessity) either to inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or to keep themselves idle, and to prejudge lavvful Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; It vvould be either vvhen anothers necessity calleth for it, or our inability othervvayes to trade, vvarranteth it, as if it be by vveakness, or under-age, and the like, as is that of Orphans, Widovvs, Ministers, and others, vvho by their stations are kept up from other tradings, and yet allovved to provide for their families; vvho may othervvayes do, may not, cannot so plead for exception. 7.

               <p>THE Lord having in the foregoing Commands dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted us how to walk with others in reference to their <hi>honour, life, chastity,</hi> and <hi>estate</hi>: Now because men and human Societies are greatly concerned in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of truth and ingenuity, he cometh in this Command to direct us how to be tender of this, that by us our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be not wronged in that respect, but that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all means may be used to preserve truth for his good, to prevent what may load his name, and to remove what lyeth on it. The scope of it is the preservation of verity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity amongst men, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3.9. <hi>lye not one to another. Ephes.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Speak every man the truth, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Speak the truth in love</hi>; because if otherwayes spoken, it is contrary to the scope of this Command, which is the preservation of our neighbours name from a principle of love: The sin forbidden here is expressed <hi>by false witness bearing,</hi> which is especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Judges, because that is the most palpable gross way of


<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55484:247"/>
venting an untruth, under which (as in other Commands) all the lesser are forbidden.</p>
               <p>Although there be many sorts of sins in words, whereby we wrong others, yet we think they are not all to be reduced to this Command, for injurious and angry words belong to the sixth Command, and filthy words to the seventh; but we take in here such words as are contrary to truth, and fall espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially under <hi>lying</hi> or wronging of our neighbours name: Now truth being an equality or conformity of mens words to the thing they speak, as it is indeed, and in it self: And lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opposit thereto, we may consider it two wayes, 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a mans mind, that is, that he speak as he thinketh in his heart, as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.2. this is the first rule whereby lying is discerned, if our speech be not answerable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conception which it pretendeth to express, and this is that which they call <hi>formale mendacium,</hi> or a formal lye, which is an expressing of a thing otherwayes then we think it to be, with a purpose to deceive. Then 2. there must be a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in this conception to the thing it self, and so men must be careful to have their thoughts of things sutable to the things themselves, that they may the more falsly express them, and thus when there is a disconformity between mens words and the thing they seem to express, it is that which they call <hi>materiale mendacium,</hi> or a material lye, and a breach of this Command that requireth truth in mens words, both as to matter and manner.</p>
               <p>That we may sum up this Command (which is broad) into some few particulars, we may consider it first, as it is broken, 1. in the heart, 2. in the gesture, 3. in right, 4. in word.</p>
               <p>First, in heart a man may fail, 1. By suspecting others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly, this is called <hi>evil surmizing,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4. or as it is in the original, <hi>evil suspition</hi>; which is when men are suspected of some evil without ground, as <hi>Potiphar</hi> suspected <hi>Joseph</hi>; or it is jealousie, when this suspition is mixed with fear of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to some interest we love, so <hi>Herod</hi> was jealous when Christ was born, and the neighbouring Kings when <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was a building. There is, I grant, a right suspition, such as <hi>Solomon</hi> had of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and wherein <hi>Gedaliah</hi> failed, in not crediting <hi>Johannans</hi> information anent <hi>Ismaels</hi> conspiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst


<pb n="438" facs="tcp:55484:248"/>
his life. 2. By rash judging and unjust concluding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a mans <hi>state,</hi> as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends did; or his <hi>actions,</hi> as <hi>Eli</hi> did of <hi>Hannah,</hi> saying, that <hi>she was drunk,</hi> because of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of her lips; or his <hi>end,</hi> as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he took wages, they said it was <hi>covetousness,</hi> and when he took not, they said it was <hi>want of love,</hi> see <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. &amp;c. 3. By <hi>hasty judging,</hi> too soon passing sentence in our mind from some seeming evidence of that which is only in the heart, and not in the outward practice, this is but to judge before the time, and hastily, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.1. 4. There is <hi>light judging,</hi> laying the weight of conclusions upon arguments or midses that will not bear it, as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends did, and as the <hi>Barbarians</hi> suspected <hi>Paul,</hi> when they saw the Viper on his hand, to be <hi>a murtherer, Acts</hi> 25.4. Thus the King <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> trusted <hi>Hamans</hi> calumny of the <hi>Jews</hi> too soon. 5. The breach of this Command in the heart may be when suspicion of our neighbours failing is kept up, and means not used to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied about it, contrary to that <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. <hi>If thy brother offend thee, &amp;c.</hi> and when we seek not to be satisfied, but rest on presumptions, when they seem probable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in <hi>gesture</hi> this Command may be broken, by nodding, winking, or such like (and even sometimes by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) when these import in our accustomed way some tacite sinistrous insinuation, especially when either they are purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for that end, or when others are known to mistake because of them, and we suffer them to continue under this mistake.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by <hi>writing</hi> this Command may be broken, as <hi>Ezra</hi> 5 6. <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.5. where calumniating Libels are written, and sent by their enemies against the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi>; in which respect many fail in these dayes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, but <hi>words</hi> are most properly the seat vvherein this sin is subjected, vvhether they be only or meerly vvords, or also put in vvriting, because in these our conformity or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity to truth doth most appear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Lies are commonly divided into three sorts, according to their ends: 1. There is <hi>mendacium perniciosum,</hi> a malitious or pernitious lye, vvhen it is hurtful to another, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, as vvere the lies of those that bare vvitness against <hi>Christ</hi> and of <hi>Ziba</hi> against <hi>Mephibosheth.</hi> 2. There is <hi>officiosum


<pb n="439" facs="tcp:55484:248"/>
mendacium,</hi> or an officious lye, vvhen it is for a good end, such  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vas the Midvvives lye, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.9. thus the denying of a thing to be, even vvhen the granting of it vvould infer hurt and damage to another, is contrary to truth, and vve ought not to do evil that good may come of it, and it overturneth the end for vvhich speaking vvas appointed, vvhen vve declare a thing othervvayes then vve knovv or think it to be; and as no man can lye for himself for his ovvn safety, so can he not for anothers; thus to lye even for God is a fault, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be talking deceitfully and vvickedly for him, vvhen to keep off vvhat vve account dishonourable to him, vve vvill assert that he may, or may not do such a thing, vvhen yet the contrary is true, <hi>Job</hi> 13.4, 7. 3. There is <hi>jocosum menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi> vvhen it is for sport to make others laugh and be merry, vvhich being sinful in it self can be no matter of lavvful sport to make others laugh. 4. We may add one more, and that is <hi>mendacium temerarium,</hi> vvhen men lye and have no end before them, but through inadvertency and customary loosness, speak othervvayes then the thing is, this is called the <hi>way of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Psal.</hi> 119.29. and is certainly sinful; as vvhen they told <hi>David</hi> vvhen <hi>Amnon</hi> vvas killed, <hi>that all the Kings sons were killed,</hi> being too hasty in concluding before they had tryed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider lyes or untruths, either in things <hi>doctrinal,</hi> or <hi>in matters of fact</hi>: In things <hi>doctrinal,</hi> so false Teachers and their followers are guilty, who teach &amp; believe lies, so such Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are said, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>to speak lyes,</hi> and so vvhen they foretel vain events, this is a high degree of leud lying on the Lord, to say he meaneth or sayeth another thing then ever he thought, or then ever came into his heart, and to pretend a commission from him vvhen he giveth no such commission. In <hi>matters of fact,</hi> men are guilty when things are said to be done when they are not done, or othervvayes done then they are done indeed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may consider this sin in mens practise, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God, so hypocrisie and unansvverableness to our profession is lying, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.36. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.13. or vve may consider it as betwixt man and man, which is more properly the scope here: Again, we may consider the vvronging of a man three vvayes, 1.

repeated in these vvords, <hi>Thou shalt not take up any witness</hi> (as it is in the original) <hi>against thy neighbour.</hi> 3. When the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are malicious, vvhether they be true or false, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for that end that our neighbour may lose his good name. Further, consider it in reference to the person guilty, either as he is 1. the raiser or carrier of a tail, true or false, yet tending to the prejudice of his neighbour; thus he is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of a lye: or 2. as he is a hearer or receiver of tales, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.4. thus he is to lying as a resetter is to theft, and vvould not men hear tales, fevv vvould carry them; vvhereas vvhen men vvill hearken to lyes, especially great men, all their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ordinarily become vvicked tale-bearers and vvhisperers: or 3. as he is the sufferer (albeit he be not the venter) of a lying tale to pass on his neighbour (so he loveth a lye, as it is <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.8.) or but faintly purgeth him of it, but, letteth it either lye on him, or possibly taketh it up and repeateth it again, vvhich is condemned <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.3. vvhere a man that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up an evil report of his neighbour, even vvhen others pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly have laid it dovvn, is looked upon as a person vvho shall never dvvell vvith God: Thus one inventeth a lye, another venteth and outeth it, and a third resetteth it, like coyners, spreaders and resetters of false money; for, that one said such a thing, vvill not vvarrant our repeating of it again.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We may consider vvrongs done to our neighbour by vvords, as unjust and vvithout all ground, and so a lye is a <hi>calumny,</hi> as vvas that of <hi>Ziba,</hi> made of his Master <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> this is in latin <hi>calumnia:</hi> or vvhen there is ground, yet vvhen they are spoken to his prejudice, this is <hi>convitium,</hi> if especially in this they suffer for the truths sake; or if after repentance, former faults be cast up to a person, as if one should have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Paul</hi> a blasphemer, still, even after his conversion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, of this vvas <hi>Shimei</hi> guilty by railing on <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Both these sorts of lies are either spoken or received, and not aftervvard rejected, as <hi>David</hi> too hastily received that false report made of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> by his servant <hi>Ziba,</hi> and thinking it not unlikely, because the reporter made it seem to be so, did therefore conclude it vvas truth, and did not reject it aftervvards; or vvhen at first received, yet after upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information it is rejected.</p>

Again, this wronging of our neighbour by words is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him when absent, and this is <hi>backbyting,</hi> which often is done under pretence of much respect (that the report may stick the faster) in such like words as these; <hi>He is one I wish well, and should be loath to have him evil r <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="9">9. Sometimes this reproaching and slandering of our neighbour is out of spleen against him, and is malicious; sometimes out of envy to raise and exalt ones self on the ruins of another (this is <hi>grassari in famam proximi</hi>) sometimes it is out of design, thereby to insinuate upon them whom we speak unto, as to signifie our freedom unto them, to please them, or praise them, by crying down another, that is to serve the itching humour of such who love the praise of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when it may be we know mo faults of those we speak to, yet never open our mouth to them of one of these, nor are we free with them anent them if the things be true.</p>

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:55484:253"/>
what followeth: For, 1. this concupiscence or lust looketh not only to the Seventh and Eighth, but to the Fifth and Sixth and Ninth Commands, there being an inordinate affection towards thy Neighbours life and honour, or estimation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; and it is instanced in these two, because they are more discernible and common: This then sheweth that God t <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>keth in this inordinateness of the heart, under one Command, in reference to whatsomever object it be, otherwayes we beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to say that either the Commands are defective, or that there is no such inordinateness to other objects of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands (which is absurd) or by the same reason we must multiply commands for them also, which yet the adversaries themselves do not. 2. The Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth all inordinateness of heart towards whatsomever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it be in that Command, <hi>Thou shalt not lust,</hi> which is, as <hi>Thou shalt not desire his wife,</hi> so nothing <hi>else what is thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> 3. The inverting the order which is here, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.21. where the <hi>wife</hi> is put first, not the <hi>house,</hi> sheweth that the Command is one, otherwayes what is Ninth in the one would be Tenth in the other, and contrarily, and so the order of these <hi>ten words</hi> (as they are called by the Lord) would be confounded. But the great thing we are mainly to inquire into, is the meaning of this Command; in which Papists being loath to acknowledge corrupt natures case to be so desperate as it is, and designing to maintain perfection of inherent righteousness and justification by works, do make this sin of Lust, forbidden in this Command, a very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing, and all of us ordinarily are apt to think light of this sin.</p>

               <p n="2">2. We say there is a twofold consideration of this sinful Concupiscence, 1.

The more actual stirrings of it are to be considered, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their first risings, when they are either not adverted into and without direct excitation, or actual and formal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; or as they are checked and rejected, as <hi>Paul</hi> did his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3, or as they are delighted in, though there be not a formal consent, yet such a thing in the very mind is someway complyed with, as desirable and pursued after, this is called <hi>morosa delectatio</hi>; or as they are resolved on to be acted, and when men seek means and wayes how to get the sin committed, after that inwardly approving complacency and liking of the thing hath prevailed to engage the mind, to conquish, (for instance) such an estate unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or to compass and accomplish the act of filthiness with such a woman.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be considered in general, either as the thoughts are upon riches, or covetousness, or filthiness, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to any particular thing or person, or as they go out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in particulars.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Under this Command vve take in habitual Lust, even as it disposeth and inclineth to ill in the root of it, though not principally, yet consequently; because its streams and branches that do flovv from, and clear this to be the fountain and root, are primarily understood; and the reasons vvhy it must be taken in here, are 1. Because habitual Lust in the root is sin (for so it conceiveth sin, <hi>James</hi> 1.14, 15.) and if it be sin, it must be against some of these Commands, vvhich are the substance and matter of the Covenant of Works, vvhich prescribeth all duty, and forbiddeth all sin. 2. If this Lavv require absolute purity, then that inclination must be condemned by it, but it requireth absolute purity and exact holiness, even according to Gods Image; therefore that inclination inconsistent vvith it must be condemned here, seeing in the other Commandements, acts that are resolved and fully consented to in the heart, are forbidden. 3.

Add our blessed Lord Jesus in his utter vvant of, and freedom from, all corruption vvas conformed to the Lavv, and it vvas a part of his conformity to it, and to this Command rather then to any other, that the Devil had nothing in him, no, not so much as a <hi>motus primo primus</hi> (as they call it) to sin, nor any root from vvhich it should spring.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, 1. That this Lust is in men antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not only to any formal vvill of their ovvn, but to all povver and ability to help it, or so much as not to vvill it, and so cannot be supposed to be forbidden to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There are many things forbidden them, vvhich novv after the fall is not in their povver to prevent. 2. This Lavv is to be looked on as given to man in his innocency, vvhich therefore required of him the keeping intire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defaced the Image of God, according to vvhich he vvas created; and novv condemneth him for the vvant of it, the scope of the Lavv being to point out perfect holiness, vvithout respect to a mans ability, or his present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to his <hi>duty,</hi> for the performing of vvhich he got a povver from God at first, but through voluntary transgression of the Lavv lost it, and none vvill deny but if it be a sin to have such a polluted nature, the Lavv must require it to be othervvayes.</p>

Answ.</hi> It is true it is not <hi>deliberate,</hi> but voluntary it is, as having its seat and rise in the will, as well as in other faculties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the will cannot be thought free.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it be said that this sin is greater then any sin forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in any other of the Commands, therefore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand forbidding it ought not to have been last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In some respect it is greater, to wit, in it self, yet in respect of its palpableness and obviousness it is less; also this Command forbidding it, presseth a further degree and step into all that goeth before, and therefore is well sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We comprehend under this Command all first motions rising from that habitual Lust, in reference to more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat acts, although they be instantly checked and choaked, and that whether they be in reference to particular objects, or whether they be vaging unsetled motions of any Lust in it self sinful; and that whether there be a delectation or staying on that forbidden object or not, or consenting to it, or resolution to follow it or not, as is evident in <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. For, 1. such motions are the births of a sinful mother, <hi>habitual lust:</hi> 2. They have sinful effects and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, they are incitements to sins: 3. They are sinful in their nature, as being disconformed to the holy Law of God, and though they should presently be strangled, yet it is supposed that once they were; and if they were, they were either good or ill; if good, they should not have been strangled; if evil, then they had this inordinateness here forbidden, and that from our own hearts or inventions that gave them being, and therefore they must leave a guilt behind them. 4. Otherwayes these evils forbidden here, would not differ from the spiritual ills forbidden in other Commands that forbid <hi>Lust with consent and delight.</hi> 5. Our blessed Lord Jesus could be capable of none of these, and therefore the having of them must be unsuitable to his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, who was like us in all things except sin. 6. <hi>Paul</hi>'s assertion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. that he had not known this sin of Lust but by the Law, maketh it evident that the Command speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Lust not easily discernable (yea, that he himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

Ah! what discontents with providences, grudgings, vain wishings, &amp;c. are there? and although all these, as they reflect on God, are against the first Command; yet as they imply discontentment in us with our lot, or as they are risings of heart to evil (though wrestled against, and wherein the Spirit getteth the victory) they are against this Command; so that not only vain Imaginations that are formed with delight, but even those that are scarce suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to breath, yet having once a being, are against this Command, and sinful: For, 1. they break a Law, and are disconformed to that which we should be: 2.

They marr communion with God, who should have the <hi>all</hi> of the soul, heart and mind; and sure, if he had his due, there would be no place for these, as there will be none for them among the spirits of the just men made perfect: 9.

Its pretexts and cloaks to hide it self are many, and sometimes specious, so that men are seldom challenged for it, if it come not to the length of being consented to, or at least of a delectation; Hovv often are there vvishes in our mouths, and oftner in our hearts, that break this Commandement vvhich vve observe not? especially if they be for knovvledge or some good thing in another, or some good thing done by another vvhich commendeth him; for then, <hi>O if we had it!</hi> or, <hi>O if we had done it!</hi>  
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> often the language of the heart; and so there is a secret discontent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Neighbour, which often runneth to envy, or at least to a discontent that it is not so vvith us, and that vve are behind in that; but especially in spiritual things vve take liberty for these discontented vvishes, also grudgings, that another is free and vve are crossed, come in under the sin here forbidden; as also that vvhich is spoken of <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.12. <hi>of much reading and making many books,</hi> vvhen one is desirous inordinately, either to have, or to make many books to vent his knovvledge by, especially vvhen it levelleth at vvhat others have done.</p>
               <p>This inordinacie that is in the motions of the heart, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth much, 1. In the beginnings and stirrings of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and discontent vvhich often never come abroad, but yet are deep breaches of this Command, either as marring that loving and kindly frame vvhich vve ought to carry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards others, or as inconsistent vvith that invvard sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and tranquility that vve should conserve in our selves, that dumpishness (vvhich is ordinarily to be seen in passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate


<pb n="459" facs="tcp:55484:258"/>
and discontented persons) often proceeding from, or tending to one of these tvvo, <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>discontent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It appeareth in bargains, as vvhen vve hear of a good bargain or good marriage vvhich another hath gotten, or some good event or issue he hath had in such or such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, there is a secret grudge that vve have not got it, or that vve have not had such success.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That thoughtiness and anxious carefulness vvhich of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is in bargains making, hovv they may be sure and most for our advantage, is vve conceive especially pointed at here, there is a sutable carefulness, vvhich simply, and in it self is consistent vvith lavvful diligence, but this anxiety sinfully accompanieth it through our inordinacie in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It shevveth it self in those many ruings and repentings vvhich often are after things are done, and vvishings they had not been done, vvhich are not simply sinful vvhen there is reason for them, but as they are carking and inordinate, as for most part they are in us. We ought to grieve vvith after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grief and sorrovvful sharp reflection for the sin of vvhat vve do in all these abovesaid, and others such like; but it's repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against God, and his infinitely vvise government, to grudge at dispensations, events, and consequents, vvhich are meer providences.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This inordinacie of heart-motions doth much appear in the vexing after-thoughts of, and reflections upon any thing vve have done, not so much because of its sinfulness, as because of its bringing shame upon us, or because of its unsutableness to vvhat our humour aimed at; and upon this account vve are discontented, and have an inordinate and unsatisfied desire of having it othervvayes done, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content is the proof and evidence of this Lust, discovering it vvhere it is, for because our desire (though possibly it be confused and for <hi>any good,</hi> as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.6.) is not fulfilled, therefore is heaviness and discontent, vvhereas if it vvere sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, there vvould be quietness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:55484:259"/>So then we conceive this Command, as to its positive part, doth 1. Require love to our Neighbour, and complacency in his prosperous condition, and all such motions as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with it, are here forbidden, though they never come to act, and being such as we would not have any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers entertaining towards us. 2. <hi>Contentment,</hi> so that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, discouragement, fainting heaviness, anxiety, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness and not resting satisfied with our own lot, which is forbidden <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. are condemned here. 3. A holy frame of heart, a delight in the Law of God, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. Hence these motions are counted opposite to it which were in <hi>Paul</hi> (although he wrestled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, as was said) and are the Imaginations of mens hearts, but the serenity and tranquil composure of the heart having every thing subject and subordinate to the Law of God, is called for here. 4. It requireth compleat confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law of God, and exact and perfect love to, and delight in him. Thus this Command is broken, when there is any stirring of heart inconsistent with perfect love to him and his Law: But obedience is given to it when we <hi>put off the old man, and put on the new man created after God, &amp;c. Col.</hi> 3.9, 10. and attain unto a stayed, composed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, and sixed heart, so much commended in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For the difference of this Command from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Commands, is not in the object, but in the act <hi>lust,</hi> for determinate lust, for instance, looketh to the seventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but here a sort of vaging unsetledness in the thought that cannot be called adultery, as not partaking of that name, yet really is Lust, is forbidden, and so also vain wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings upon <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>notions</hi> come in here under the name of Lust, and are sinful, being inconsistent with a composed frame of heart.</p>
               <p>To close up all, let us consider a little these words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet:</hi> I shall only premit this one word, that it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar to this Command, that men in nature come not the length of taking it up, <hi>Paul</hi> before conversion knew that the consented-to desire of an unlawful thing was sin, but he knew not this narrow bounding of men to be intended in this Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:55484:259"/>In the words then you may take up these three, 1. That there is a great sinfulness and inordinacie in folks hearts, even in the least things, which oft-times they take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of 2. That generally men in nature do not advert to this, and are never throughly humbled under it. 3. That there is such an indwelling lust as this, which is spoken of here even in the heart of the believer, and obedience to this Command will be as seriously aimed at by him, and he will be as much troubled and affected with the breach of it, as of any of the other Commands.</p>
               <p>As to the first, I shall first interrogate you a few things, 1. How often is your mind stirring and reeling like the raging Sea? 2. How often, or rather how seldom, can ye say that these motions and stirrings are conform to the Law of God, or consisting with true love to God, and delight in him and in his Law? Are there not in your hearts wonderful swarms of vain Imaginations that ye cannot give a reason for, and cannot tell how they come in, nor how they go out? which yet are all breaches of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. 3. How often do ye take notice of them, or are suitably affected with them? 2. For further conviction of the sinfulness of this, consider the extent of the Command, 1. A man by the breaking of this Command may be guilty of the breach of all the rest: 2. It's extensive, in respect of the occasions a man hath to break it, his eye will look to nothing but this lust will take occasion from it to sin, the hearing of such and such a thing, will by means of this waken a desire to be at it, though the impossibility of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may impede his determination: 3. It is extensive in respect of the continual bad posture the heart is in, so that hardly can a person take a look of it, but he will find this sin of inordinacie in the thoughts in it, and some plagues as effects following on it. 3. For yet further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, consider the greatness of the sin, 1. In that it not only runneth after particular objects, the coveting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is against the other Commands, but foreseeth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth objects in the brain, and so this Lust is broader then a man hath existent objects to it, as when he desireth to be rich, but knoweth not how: 2. We may gather the


<pb n="462" facs="tcp:55484:260"/>
greatness of this sin, partly from the nature of it, called in Scripture, <hi>enmity against God, Rom.</hi> 8.7. partly from the brude and product of it, called <hi>the fruit of the flesh,</hi> partly from the fruit that it bringeth forth, and that is <hi>death,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth other sins, not only by indisposing to duty, but by actual inclining and disposing to evil, so that when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil cometh to tempt, he hath no more to do but to blow up this fire of Lust that is within, and needeth not bring new fire to kindle it. Our scope in all this is to bring you to know that such a thing as this inordinate Lust is in you, and that it is exceeding sinful; ye cannot deny but the Devil and Lust stirreth as much in you as it did in regenerate and eminently holy <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet how is it that ye are as quiet as if it were not in you at all? such serious and sensible souls as have rightly seen this, will loath themselves, as being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of it, most polluted and unclean, and will cry out, <hi>Oh! we are vile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the second thing in the words, folks may be a long time ere they take up this sin, and generally men in nature do not know it: there are many vile sins in the heart that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were deliberate, nor yet fully consented to, when this sin is discovered to <hi>Paul,</hi> he getteth another sight of the nature of sin then he would have believed formerly he could have had; folks are rarely affected with <hi>Original sin,</hi> that thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with, and is contrary to the Law of God, and seldom burthened with this <hi>habitual Lust,</hi> that stirreth even in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, because but renewed in part, and so it is but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in part; and it is a great and gross mistake to think that grace altogether expelleth it here, and it is sometimes their guilt that they fret and are discontented and discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not so much because of the sinfulness of the sin, as that it should be in their lot; for it is one thing to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously wrestling against this Lust, and bemoaning it, and another thing to have a perplexedness about it; as when there is a fretting that such a thing is not better done, and yet no serious sorrow, because of the wrong doing of it simply, and in it self considered; and there is an inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness wherein the  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lesh prevaileth, even in complaints of sin, and in desiring good: And so this Command regulateth our


<pb n="463" facs="tcp:55484:260"/>
desire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only in reference to the object, but as to the way and manner of pursuing it.</p>
               <p>As to the third thing in the words, that this Lust or Concupiscence is in the Believer (as we have just now said) it is uncontrovertibly clear from what the Apostle asserteth of himself, and most bitterly bemoaneth in that Chapter; and from the universal experience of the Saints, so that we need say nothing more particularly of it then we have said; only it may be asked if there be such a Concupiscence in the Believer, how doth it differ from that which is in Natural men? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Sin not only <hi>dwelleth,</hi> but <hi>commandeth</hi> and <hi>reigneth</hi> in the Natural man; but though Corruption dwell in the Believer, and many sometimes take him captive, yet he doth not with the bensel of his sould yield to it. 2. A Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man is wholly one, or if there be any warring or dissention, it is but one lust striving with another, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is <hi>tuosome</hi> (as they use to say) he hath two parties or sides, and when corruption prevaileth, grace will be say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O that it were otherwayes.</hi> 3. The Believer discerneth his lusts far better nor he did while unregenerate, and seeth them as so many evil spirits dancing and reeling within him, 4. This indwelling corruption is one of his greatest weights, yea, it is exceeding weighty, and his most grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, heavier not only then all outward afflictions, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in some respect, then actual transgressions, for he findeth that he is never sooner off his watch, but his evil inclination setteth on him, this is his exercise, this marreth his peace, and maketh him loath himself, when the world seeth nothing in his conversation reproveable: This did much more pinch and afflict <hi>Paul</hi> then his persecution, and maketh him cry out, <hi>What shall I do, O wretched, O mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> All the outward afflictions and tribulations that he met with, drew never such a word from him; he could through grace, rejoyce, yea, glory in the midst of them, but this maketh him cry out of himself as miserable, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed the thing, that in it self, and in the esteem of the Child of God, when at himself, maketh him beyond


<pb n="464" facs="tcp:55484:261"/>
all things in the world look at himself as wretched and miserable, and if Faith in Christ were not kept up, the Believer in this case would despair and give it over; but it is neither the Natural mans exercise, nor yet his burthen. 5. The Natural man hath not a spiritual sense to savour and relish the things of God, and as little inward feeling of his corruption that is opposite to the grace of God, but outward things are only or most sweet to him: The Believer relisheth spiritual things; but remaining corruption mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his satisfaction even in outward things, and the more he finds that he is satisfied with them, he is therefore the worse satisfied with himself; if he take a glut of satisfaction in them, with more pain he vomits it up again, and it troubleth his stomach, as it were, till he get it cast out; Gods people get not leave to drink with full satisfaction of the things of the World, as Natural men do; for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever having two parties in him, Grace and Corruption, whereof, while out of heaven, he is constituted; what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth the one can never content the other: but the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man having but only one party, and being wholly constituted of Corruption, he hath more delight, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in sinful things, but also in worldly things then the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
               <p>The scope of all is to discover your superficialness and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verliness in examining your selves, to put you to be more serious in that necessary and useful exercise, and to teach you by what Command ye should most examine your selves, even by this Tenth Command, as being that which will make the clearest and most throughly searching discovery of your selves to your selves, and will best rid marches betwixt you and hypocrites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to put you in thankfulness to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and with admiration to adore the exceeding great goodness of God, in providing and giving a Mediator on whom he hath laid all these innumerable Iniquities of all his people, which would have sunk them eternally under the unsupportable weight of them; to let you see how abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary, how unspeakably useful, and stedable he is to so many wayes, and so deeply guilty sinners;


<pb n="465" facs="tcp:55484:261"/>
and withal to lead you to improve and make use of him for doing them away, both as to the guilt and filth of them; which when God shall, for Christs sake, be graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do, will not every believing soul have reason to say and sing to the commendation of his Grace, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity? Bless the Lord, O my soul, who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases; to him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, be glory and dominion for ever. Amen.</hi>
