         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>ABOUT the Year of Our Lord 1218. at <hi>Paris</hi> in a Synod or <hi>Convocation of the Clergy</hi>; one that was appointed to <hi>Clerum,</hi> or preach the <hi>Convocation-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was put to his <hi>Trumps,</hi> and much troubled in his <hi>Guizard</hi> what to say, or what <hi>Subject</hi> to insist upon:</p>
            <p>Whereupon the <hi>Devil</hi> who always watches to take Men napping, and observing the Preacher, to be <hi>melancholly and perplext in mind</hi>) appears to him <hi>as he sat in a brown-study,</hi> and ask'd him why he was so careful what to preach? say thus — quoth the Devil — The <hi>Princes of Hell salute You, Oh the Princes and Prelates of the Church, and gladly give you thanks, because that through your default and negligence all Souls go to Hell, &amp;c.</hi> And Preacher added he was inforced by <hi>the Command of God</hi> to declare the same; yea, and a <hi>certain Token</hi> was given him <hi>for a sign,</hi> whereby the <hi>Convocation</hi> might <hi>evidently see</hi> that he did <hi>not lye. Ex. Catal. Illyr fol.</hi> 546.</p>
            <p>This is somewhat like that Story that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> mentions in his <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi>; of a Letter in the Name of <hi>Lucifer</hi>; (for so were the first words of the Letter) <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Prince of Darkness, &amp;c.</hi> To the persecuting <hi>Prelates of England, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the true words of the Letter <hi>verbatim,</hi> (as it was transcribed out of the Register of the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> (as some think) by <hi>William Swinderby,</hi> a Protestant Martyr in <hi>Rich.</hi> 2ds. Time, has these very words, namely —</p>

            <p>GOD grant that this <hi>Mushrom</hi> be not like <hi>Ionas</hi> (his) <hi>Goard,</hi> that <hi>sprung up in a night</hi> and perished <hi>in a night—. Mushroom</hi>'s though they spring up in a night, yet (<hi>well drest and Cook'd</hi>) are served up, for <hi>Daintyes,</hi> and last <hi>long,</hi> notwithstanding their <hi>hasty Birth</hi>— like this, far from the Authors Library, his <hi>Notes,</hi> and <hi>his Books.</hi> And if any man <hi>think or say</hi> that it is a <hi>wonder,</hi> if this Book and Verses were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and writ in <hi>One Day,</hi> and sent to the Press, since it would employ the <hi>Pen of a ready Writer,</hi> or, nimble Scrivener, <hi>to Coppy</hi> this Book <hi>in a Day</hi> (it may be so.)</p>
            <p>But <hi>it is a Truth as certain</hi> and stable as <hi>the Sun</hi> in the Firmament, and which <hi>(if need be)</hi> the Bookseller, Printer, and others <hi>Worthy Citizens,</hi> that are privy to it, can <hi>avouch,</hi> for an <hi>Infallible Truth—Deo soli Gloria</hi>— When a <hi>Divine Hand</hi> assists, one (of <hi>Despicable, dull,</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable Parts and Learning</hi>) may do <hi>wonders,</hi> which God <hi>usually performs</hi> by most <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>unlikely Instruments</hi>— Take the advice, <hi>(if you be wise)</hi> of the great Privy Counsellor, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.34, 35, 36.37, 38, 39, 40. But (some may say) why <hi>was not more time</hi> and <hi>more Pains</hi> bestowed upon so <hi>excellent an Argument?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer— That this <hi>is enough in answer to a foolish Libel</hi>; and <hi>besides,</hi> my Pen is <hi>better employed,</hi> upon the <hi>like Subject</hi> and <hi>Argument,</hi> upon <hi>another</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as the world will perceive <hi>very speedily,</hi> I had <hi>much adoe,</hi> to perswade my fancy to <hi>throw away</hi> or <hi>spare</hi> a Day upon such an <hi>Idle</hi> occasion; and with such a <hi>Trifler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Poetry</hi> (like a <hi>Miss</hi>) is pleasant and <hi>delicious now,</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> (in some <hi>mens wanton</hi> Fancy) but as <hi>nauseous as a Wife</hi> (is to their liquorish Humours) <hi>when</hi> made a practise, a Trade, and of <hi>constant use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Aiery Poetry</hi> interlac't <hi>here and there</hi> with <hi>weightier matter</hi> in Prose, does with the <hi>diversity</hi> and <hi>Lard,</hi> willingly charm and bewitch the Readers Eye (like <hi>Landskips</hi> of <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Dales, Woods</hi> and <hi>Plains</hi>) <hi>lovely through va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis <hi>dull,</hi> when made a Trade off, and a <hi>poor dull Trade,</hi> a Rhimer? <hi>Tick-Tock, Knock-Block,</hi> a meer Chimer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59882:10"/>And therefore though in <hi>Poetick Heat,</hi> I seem to threaten <hi>Dryd</hi>—s Laurel, Let him not fear; for none but a <hi>Foolish Courtier or some Poor Poet</hi> envys this bloaty, swoln, self-conceited, puft up, windy and (therefore) empty <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not make a practise of contending with him,— I am none of those <hi>Hackney-Rhimers,</hi> that (like the <hi>Beggars</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> and our <hi>English Wassals</hi>) get Bread by <hi>canting Verses</hi>; or, like the <hi>Ballad-singers,</hi> that live by <hi>Rhimes</hi>; or, like the <hi>Fidlers,</hi> and <hi>Singing-Boys</hi> (in Cathedrals) that <hi>sing to eat</hi>; or like Country-Fellows at Christmas, that sing a Carol for a Christmas Pye; or like the <hi>Gypsees,</hi> that <hi>Pick mens Pockets</hi> with <hi>Canting</hi>; nor shall I (perhaps) <hi>hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> heed him: But, (when he does (<hi>being Hired</hi>) abuse the <hi>Worthies of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (because <hi>they are so</hi>) I shall answer him (as <hi>they do</hi>) only <hi>with contempt</hi> and <hi>neglect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, True-bred Lyons <hi>stalk and walk on</hi> their own way, <hi>not</hi> heeding nor <hi>minding</hi> the little <hi>Currs</hi> that <hi>yelp and bark</hi> though <hi>(Greater) hearten them</hi> (or, set them) on.</p>
            <p>Surely a <hi>Politician and a Divine</hi> are scarce Commodities, when we <hi>fly for Refuge</hi> to <hi>Hackney Poets</hi> and <hi>Hireling Pamphleteers,</hi> with their Juniper-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of <hi>Politicks and Divinity,</hi> to instruct the <hi>Tantivy Clergy,</hi> every Week, against the time that Sunday comes, and to Tutor the <hi>Corporations</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Iustices,</hi> and Country <hi>Commission-Officers!</hi>
