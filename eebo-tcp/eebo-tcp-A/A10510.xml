            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

heat of the subjacent parts, raising it up. The externall efficient cause is the externall coldnes, partly of the aire, partly of the skin it selfe: It is engendered even as the thin skin in milk, and fat broths: It is hardly separate from the skin with a knife; but easily in living creatures, by a vesicatory, and in dead persons by fire, or scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hot water.</p>
               <p>1. The use of it is to defend the skin, which is of an equisit sense, from externall immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, either heat, or cold.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16110:20"/>

               <p>Thirdly, to stay the ichorous substance from issuing from the veines and arteries; for this we see when the <hi>cuticula</hi> is rubbed off by any meanes.</p>

               <p>The skin in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and sides it is thin, thinner yet in the palme of the hand, but thinnest of all in the lips and cods. In the head, back, and under the heele it is thickest. Under the heele, the <hi>cuticula</hi> in some will be as thick as a barley corne.</p>

               <p>THis is the opinion of all the ancient and moderne Writers, concerning the mesen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and the mesarai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, if you except <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par Asellius,</hi> who by his diligence found these veins, which hee calleth <hi>lacteas,</hi> because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">Why so called.</note> a white juice, which is nothing else but the <hi>chylus</hi> elaborate, which they carry from the smal guts to the liver.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16110:56"/>
lacteae,</hi> discharge their impurities before they carry the <hi>chylus</hi> to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the <hi>Pancreas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the small guts,<note place="margin">Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.</note> and have nothing to doe with the stomack. They passe into the capacity of the guts, and end in the wrinkled crust, with the which the internall membrane of the guts is lined with their spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious heads like to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by the which they draw to themselves the <hi>chylus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the small guts<note place="margin">Their progress.</note> they march between the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16110:56"/>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16110:57"/>
and so it is most likely that sanguification is performed by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the liver, and not by the veins: the grosser part of it being sent to the branches of <hi>vena porta,</hi> and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillest to the branches of <hi>vena cava</hi>;</p>

               <p>First, in bignesse, for these are bigger, but those are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for they are twice as many: for more <hi>chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> must bee sent to the liver to make blood of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16110:57"/>
for the nourishment of the whole body, than blood for the nourishing of the inward parts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the values<note place="margin">Their values.</note> which are seene about the endings of these, are placed from without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but of those from within outwards. The reason of this diversitie is this: the <hi>venae lacteae</hi> suck the <hi>chylus</hi> from the guts which ought not to returne, but the ordinary mesaraicall send blood, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excrementitious humours, which ought
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16110:58"/>
not to come back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>If you would finde<note place="margin">How to find them out.</note> out these veins, you must feed a dogge with milke, and five or six houres afterward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect his belly; then by stretching the mesente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie you shall perceive them.</p>
               <p>That the ancients did<note place="margin">Why the Ancients did not find these out.</note> not find out these veins, the cause is, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they dissected beasts after they were dead, or after that the <hi>chylus</hi> was distributed, or they did presently take a view of the mesentery;

but made some stay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the inspection of some other part.</p>
               <p>They have no trunck,<note place="margin">Why they have no trunck.</note> because they were to end in the liver, and to go no further.

               <p>The substance of the

               <p>It is bigger in man than any other living<note place="margin">Its bignesse.</note> creature, if you consider the proportion of his body; for it was fit so to bee, seeing man was to have greatest store of bloud, lest spirits should faile in performing the

               <p>It is covered with a very thin membrane, which springeth from the second ligament of the liver, which cleaveth firmly to the substance of the liver.

               <p>The use of the spleen, as also of the liver,<note place="margin">The use of the spleene.</note> is to further the elaboration and concoction of the <hi>Chylus:</hi> for it is a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard liver according to

               <p>The left is somewhat higher, as also the left kidney; but the right is somewhat longer. It

it may easily bee flead from the <hi>tunica vaginalis</hi>; by the ancients it was called <hi>erithroides:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it appeareth to be red be reason of the fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shy fibres wherewith it is enterlaced.</p>
               <p>This ariseth from the <hi>membrana carnosa</hi>; which here is more thin and subtile than else where, and stored with veins and arteries.</p>
               <p>The third is <hi>elythroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> or <hi>vaginalis:</hi> because it containeth the stone as a sheath. It is a thick and strong membrane, having many veins. In

the outside it is uneven, by reason of the fibres, by the which it is tyed to the <hi>dartos</hi>; but in the inner side it is smooth. This is nothing else but the production of the <hi>peritonaeum.</hi>

               <p>This muscle is nothing else but the lower part of the oblique muscle, ascending neere to <hi>os pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> which outwardly wrapping the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>peritonaeum,</hi> is caried to the stone.</p>

               <p>The uses of the stones are three:</p>
               <p>The first is to elaborate the seed by reason of the seminificall faculty resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the <hi>parenchyma</hi> of the stones; for they turne the bloud, which is brought by the <hi>vasa praeparantia</hi> into seed, for the most part; the rest they reserve for their owne nutrition.</p>
               <p>The second is, they adde heat, strength and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16110:114"/>
courage to the body, as gelding doth manifest; by the which all these are empaired.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they receive the superfluous humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the seed, by reason of their glandulous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>

               <p>They are loose and soft, that they might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit dilatation with the matrix, when a woman is with child, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction when she is not.</p>
               <p>These carry the <hi>vasa praeparantia</hi> and <hi>deferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> to the matrix, and lap up the stones: they represent the wings of a bat, or the sayles of a ship spred abroad. These keepe the matrix steady in its own place, that it

neither ascend not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend.</p>
               <p>The two lower liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are nervous, round, and hollow; they spring from the sides of the bottom of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, neere to the <hi>vasa de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentia,</hi> which they touch; they go down to the groynes, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> strengthned by glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules: And being dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like a membrane, they bestow one part upon the <hi>clytoris:</hi> The residue passeth to the knee, in the inside of the thigh by the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana

               <p>These ligaments ferve not onely to stay the matrix, but because they are hollow, by them noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some humours of the genitals are sent to the glandules of the groines.

               <p>OF these there are foure: the Heart, the Lungs, the Wind-pipe, and part of the Gullet. In the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart; First, the Swadler is to bee considered, and then the

substance of the heart it selfe.</p>
               <p>The Swadler, called <hi>Pericardium</hi> or <hi>Capsula cordis,</hi> is a membrane wrapping in the whole heart, having the figure of the same, having such distance from the heart, and to containe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trish humour. It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forat in five places for the comming in, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the <hi>vena cava,</hi> and for egresse of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it is thicke and firme. The outer super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies is fibrous; but the inner, smooth and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:16110:187"/>
It is tyed to the <hi>Mediastinum,</hi> and adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts by sundry fibres. It doth cleave firmly to the sinewy circle of the midrife; but not so in dogs.</p>
               <p>It hath its beginning from the tunicles, which compasse the vessels which proceed from the <hi>pleura</hi>; for between the heart and the <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardium,</hi> the membrane from the <hi>pleura</hi> is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

The heart hath two motions, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole, and Systole. In Diastole or dilatation of the heart, the <hi>conus</hi> is drawne from the <hi>basis,</hi> to draw bloud by the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> to the right ventricle, and aire by <hi>arteria veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> to the left ventricle. In Systole or contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:16110:188"/>
on, the <hi>conus</hi> is drawne to the <hi>basis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, that the vitall spirit may be thrust from the left ventricle of the heart into the <hi>aorta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall bloud may bee thrust into the lungs, by <hi>arteria venalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the bloud may bee pressed to the lungs, in the right ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle by <hi>vena arterialis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The parts of the heart are either, externall or internall. The externall are the eares.</p>
               <p>The eares are anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed

to the firme sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the heart about the <hi>basis</hi> of it, before the mouths of the vessels. They are of a nervous substance for strength, yet thin and soft, for the easier contraction and dilatation: the left is thicker than the right. When they are disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they are smooth; but being contracted they are wrinckled.</p>
               <p>They are storehouses of the heart: for they first receive the aire and bloud, lest they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly rushing into the heart might offend it,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:16110:189"/>
and they strengthen the vessels. These eares are two in number: the right which is greatest, this is before the <hi>vena cava,</hi> and the left the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, before the <hi>arteria ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are called eares not from the office of hearing, but from the likenesse; they represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the figure of an eare. Death approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, when the heart is immoveable, they move; so we see that a small gale of wind, which moveth not the tree moveth the leaves.</p>

                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:16110:190"/>The internall parts of the heart are the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles or cavities, and the <hi>septum.</hi>

               <p>The right is larger than the left, yet the left hath thicker sides, and within is more unequall than the right.</p>
               <p>The right ventricle receiveth bloud from the <hi>vena cava,</hi> to be sent by <hi>vena arteriosa</hi> to the lungs, and reacheth not to the <hi>conus.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>septum,</hi> so called because it separateth the right ventricle from the left, is that thick and fleshy substance set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two cavities.</p>

               <p>When the lungs are blowne up, they fill the whole cavity of the brest.</p>
               <p>In figure they are like to an Oxes hoofe. The outer part is gibbous; the inward hollow: the lungs are divided into

the right and left part, each of these hath two lobes, seldome three, with the which as with fingers they embrace the heart. Nature hath ordained this division, that if one side of the lungs should be hurt, the other might discharge the office.</p>

               <p>The parts under the skull contained, are the meninges, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, which wrap the braine, and the braine it selfe.</p>

               <head>CAP III. Of the seven paires of sinewes.</head>
               <p>BEfore I set downe these paires, I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise you of one thing: that all the sinewes of the body spring from the <hi>spinalis medulla</hi> as it is rooted within the skull, or extended to the <hi>spina,</hi> and not from the braine.</p>
               <p>The first paire is made up by those which are called <hi>optici</hi> or <hi>visorii:</hi> so called because they
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:16110:218"/>
bring the opticke spirits to the eye. They spring from the <hi>nates,</hi> they meet about the sell of <hi>os sphaenoides:</hi> not by simple touching or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersection, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and mutuall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration. Then being divided, they passe to the center of the eye: these are big, thick, and soft.</p>
               <p>The second paire is framed of those called <hi>motorii oculorum,</hi> this paire springeth from the innermost part of the beginning of the prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:16110:219"/>
of the <hi>spinalis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla.</hi> In the beginning it is like to one cord: which is the cause that when one eye moveth, the other moveth also. This paire is lesser and harder than the <hi>visorii</hi>: It accompanieth them. This together with one branch of the third paire which passeth to the jaw, passeth thorow the long hole, not the round; and is inserted into the muscles of the eye and eye-lids.</p>
               <p>The third paire is made up by those called <hi>gustatorii,</hi> because the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:16110:219"/>
twigs of this paire being carried to the membran of the tongue, cause the sense of tasting. This paire proceedet from the root of <hi>spinalis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla.</hi> As it ariseth it is divided into two large branches, whereof one is carryed to the orbit of the eye, by the hole of the second: The other being carryed out of the skull, by the holes of the lower jaw bestoweth twigs upon the muscles of the lower lip, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tooth.</p>
               <p>The fourth conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beginneth about
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:16110:220"/>
the place of the former but being lesse and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, accompanying the other, and passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the same hole, is implanted into the membrane of the palat of the mouth; this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth also for tasting.</p>
               <p>The first conjugation, the <hi>auditorii</hi> make up: this paire beginning somewhat below the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it marcheth by the sides of the <hi>basis</hi> of the braine, and entring into <hi>os petrosum,</hi> is divided into two branches; the greater being inserted into the end of <hi>cochlea</hi> or
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:16110:220"/>
the hole of hearing, is the instrument of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The lesser being carried downe to the first and second <hi>vertebra</hi> of the neck, it sendeth twigs to the proper mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scles of the <hi>larynx</hi>: from hence ariseth a dry cough somtimes when we pick our eares somewhat deeply.</p>
               <p>The sixt paire is called <hi>vagum,</hi> because it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth branches to sundry parts: &amp; amongst the rest to all the parts of the belly, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire sense. For these being soft parts, did not
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:16110:221"/>
require hard sinewe from the <hi>spinalis medulla.</hi> It riseth a little below the former, each filure being straitwayes uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; it passeth out of the <hi>cranium,</hi> by the hole of the backe part of the head, by the which the internall jugular ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: then going down by the sides of the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, above the throat it is divided into two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereof the one is bestowed upon the upper muscles of the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx,</hi> the bone of the tongue and throat. The other marching further,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:16110:221"/>
is separat into two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to wit, the right and the left; each of these have branches; the <hi>Recurrens</hi> and <hi>Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The recurrent are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led also <hi>reversivi</hi> or <hi>recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivi,</hi> and <hi>vocales,</hi> because they descend and ascend againe, and being cut, hinder the voyce.</p>
               <p>The right is winded about the axillar artery, as about a pully: The left about the trunke of 2the <hi>aorta</hi> descending, afterwards doth mount up to the beginning of the muscles of the <hi>larynx.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:16110:222"/>The seventh conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which moveth the tongue, is the hardest of all: it hath it beginning, where the <hi>cerebellum</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and the <hi>spinalis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla</hi> beginneth. In its beginning it hath divers sprigs, which afterward are united, and passing thorow it owne oblique hole, is annexed to the former paire; not ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by strong membrans for safety. Then being severed it sendeth most of its twigges to the tongue; but fewest to the muscles of the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:16110:222"/>To these 7. two more may be added.</p>
               <p>The first of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the side of the beginning of the <hi>spinalis medulla</hi> by a smal twig, marcheth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards betweene the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by the hole of the second conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; on passeth to the orbit of the eye, and is spent upon the muscles which draw the eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>The second conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be called <hi>Olfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria,</hi> the cause of smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The finews of this
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:16110:223"/>
paire slip out of the braine about the cell of <hi>os sphaenoides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then to these are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed <hi>processus mammil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares</hi> or <hi>papillares,</hi> teat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like processes: They are in number two, and are white, soft, broad, and long, bigger in beasts of exquisit smelling than in man, as dogs.

grape, which is smooth without, and rough within. This is of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry colours, that it might represent to the crystallinal colours. The inner side is very black, that a weake light might the better bee seene by the crystallin humour: for light in a dark place shineth more brightly. This blacknesse is onely the excrement of bloud. This membrane cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the whole eye, as <hi>cornea</hi> doth; but being hollow in the forepart, doth make the <hi>pupilla,</hi> so called from <hi>pupula</hi>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

               <p>5. Is <hi>tunica cristaloides,</hi> which is nothing else but a membranous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation, covering the forepart of the crystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line humour: It is very thin and bright as a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>6.

These filaments being by incision much separated, the vitreous humour runneth as thin water.</p>

               <p>THe humours of the eye are in number three.</p>
               <p>1. Is <hi>Humor aqueus,</hi> the watrish humour. It is not onely set before the crystallin humour; but it compasseth also the vitreous humour round about: for if you cut the eye in the hinder part, it runneth out no other wayes, than if the forepart were incised.
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:16110:234"/>
Where it is placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the crystallin hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, it is a defence to it, to weaken the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the externall light by hindering the suddaine entering of it. And it is as a spectacle to it, to represent to the crystallin the <hi>species visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles.</hi> Although it be a spermaticke part, yet part of it in man may be let out (as we see in the cowching of a cataract) without any great hurt to the sight. In a chicken if it be let out by prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will bee repaired in fifteene daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:16110:234"/>2. Is <hi>Humor Crystalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the crystall-like hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: it is of a compact watrish substance, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what plaine before, that some space might be for the receiving of objects; but round behind where it sticketh in the vitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humour. It is seated neerer to the <hi>pupilla,</hi> that the sight might be more cleere and full.</p>
               <p>3. Is <hi>Humor vitreus,</hi> so called, because it is like to moulten glasse. In quantity it doth exceed the other two: that it might afford nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the crystallin,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:16110:235"/>
the chiefe instrument of the sight.</p>
               <p>First, it is like a soft pillow to the crystallin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it staieth the visible formers which might escape the crystallin, and so it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced hindermost.</p>
               <p>Last of all the vessels of the eye are to bee tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: The veins exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall appointed for the nourishment of the eye, proceed from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall jugulars: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall from <hi>plexus cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roides.</hi> The arteries ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall spring from the externall branches of

the ligament of the eare is inserted in the root of the eare, to pull it back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The last proper part of the eare, is the cartilage. If it had been bony it had been subject to breaking; if fleshy, it had not beene so sit to beat back the sound: this cartilage is tyed to <hi>os pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosum,</hi> by a strong liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which riseth from the <hi>pericranium,</hi> towards <hi>os mammillare,</hi> to stay it up: in man the ligament is but one and continual; but in beasts there bee two or three, according to the bignesse of the

                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:16110:238"/>The first is called <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus auditorius,</hi> the passage for hearing. It hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to hinder the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rushing in of any thing to the <hi>tympanum.</hi> It is oblique, that the vehemercy of a strong sound might bee mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat: It is lastly narrow to hinder the going in of small creatures.

out: it endeth at the <hi>tympanum.</hi> This mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is very dry, that it might give the better sound. It is thin and cleare, that the sounds may the more readily be sent to the internall ayre. It is strong, that it might be the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to resist externall violence. It hath a cord, for strength and stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no other wayes than the military drum.</p>
               <p>The second cavity, is called by <hi>Vesalius pelvis,</hi> the tunnel of the eare; and by <hi>Fallopius concha,</hi> the perwinkle from its

figure. The furniture of this cavity serveth for three purposes: for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for transmission of the sounds, and for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For motion the three little bones, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament, and muscles do service. The three lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bones are these, <hi>mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leolus, incus, stapes,</hi> having their names from the likenesse of other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things.</p>

               <p>3. That these bones being shaken and beaten against the drum, might frame the diversities of sounds, as the teeth, the distinction of words and letters.</p>
               <p>These bones have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cartilage nor mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>

They are paced up by a ligament the second instrument for motion, that being shaken by the internall aire moved by the externall, the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sound might be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: of the instruments appointed for motion, the muscles are the last.</p>
               <p>Whereof the one is without the drum above in <hi>meatus auditorius,</hi> whose tendon is inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the center of

the <hi>tympanum,</hi> against the which, the <hi>malleolus</hi> is inserted, to draw it outward together with the hammer.

Neere the <hi>tympanum</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, a narrow hole ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, which is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance to a cave, having many partitions not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the hony combes. This is full of internall aire. About the end of this cavity directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>tympanum,</hi> there are two perforati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:16110:242"/>
called <hi>fenestellae,</hi> or little windowes: wherof the one is ovall, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the labyrinth: the other lesser, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>cochlea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Last of all, there is in this cavity a small carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous passage from the eare to the <hi>palatum</hi>: to purifie the internall aire. This cavity hath a value, that there might be egresse, but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse.</p>
               <p>The third cavity is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>labyrinthus,</hi> having sundry windings, from whence it hath its name: all which returue to this
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:16110:242"/>
same cavity. There are six semi-circles in this cavity. The end of these windings is to cause the aire passing thorow nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row slreits to make the greater sound, or to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the sound, which was redoubled within the <hi>pelvis</hi> as an Eccho, by passing thorow these circulations.</p>
               <p>The fourth cavity is called <hi>cochlea,</hi> or the wilke of the eare, from the figure: because it hath three, sometimes foure wreathings; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these there is a chinke by the which the sound
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:16110:243"/>
passeth to the braine and the bilious excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment falleth into the eare.</p>
               <p>Hearing is thus caused. First, the aire received in the first cavity, doth gently move the <hi>tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> which being shaken tosseth the three small bones joyned to it; then the kind of sound is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed into the internall aire, which having the quality of the sound, and circular by the windings of the labyrinth, to make it pure is conveighed thorow the <hi>cochlea,</hi> and delivered to <hi>nervus audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi>

               <p>2. The teeth, which are bony, both to chew the meat, and to fashion the speech: each tooth
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:16110:247"/>
hath two parts; one without the gum, called <hi>Basis</hi>; the other within, called <hi>Radix,</hi> or the root. The root below recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a little veine, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and nerve.</p>
               <p>The <hi>incisores</hi> and <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini</hi> have but one fang: The lower <hi>molares</hi> have two fangs; but the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>molares,</hi> three. In children from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth moneth, untill two yeeres be compleat, twenty teeth come out, now one, then another. Of these teeth some are called <hi>incisores</hi>; the first fore teeth in number

foure in each gum: some <hi>canini</hi> adjacent to these, on each side one. The rest are called <hi>molares.</hi>

               <p>3. The third internall part of the mouth is <hi>palatum,</hi> or the roofe of the mouth: It is vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the aire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repercussed the voice should be the sharper. It is wrinckled and rough above the bone, that it might more firmly cleave to it, and it might the better keepe the meat, while it is a chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>6. Of the internall parts is the tongue, in Latine called <hi>Lingua à lingendo,</hi> from licking.</p>
               <p>The flesh of it is spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, that it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the qualities of the sapors, and judge of them. In figure it is py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramidall. The tunicle with the which it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, proceedeth from the <hi>dura mater.</hi> Veins it hath from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall jugulars. Under the tongue they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>ranulares,</hi> from their colour. The arteries
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:16110:249"/>
come from the <hi>carotides.</hi> Sinews it hath from the third and seventh paire. The muscles which move it are six. It is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts by a line going along it, and so in <hi>hemiplegia,</hi> onely one halfe may bee affected. Of the ligaments, the lower is called <hi>fraenum,</hi> and <hi>franulum.</hi> If it bee extended to the top of the tongue, it hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth sucking in children: and from this they are said to be tongue-tyed. In this case the ligament is to be cut. The tongue hath foure uses.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="473" facs="tcp:16110:249"/>1. It is the instrument of tasting. 2. It uttereth the speech. 3.

               <p>FOure causes concurre to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of a bone. First, the efficient cause is the ossifick fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the spirit; unto
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:16110:267"/>
whom the naturall heat ministreth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cause is twofold; the one is of generation, the other of nutrition. The matter of generation is the seed, which doth consist of a thick humor and the spirit. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of nutrition is double, the remote is bloud, with the which all parts of the body are nourished: The imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat cause is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowy juice in the spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious bones, and the marrow it selfe, which is contained in the cavities
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:16110:267"/>
of big bones. In the small cavities of the smaller bones, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is white; but red in the ample cavities of the large bones. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is not covered with a membrane, as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the back: and therefore it is unsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contrary to <hi>Parrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the small holes in the ends of the bones, the veins and arteries enter, but no nerves: for they onely feele by the<note place="margin">How bones feele.</note> benefit of the <hi>periostium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the forme of<note place="margin">3</note>the bone is twofold, the essentiall is its dry and
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:16110:268"/>
cold temperature. The accidentall is its figure, which for the most part is round or flat.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the finall cause is double: The generall is that which serveth the whole body, &amp; it is threefold. 1. Is to establish the soft parts. 2. Is to give figure to the parts. 3. Is to further the motion of the body. The speciall is that which is proper to every particular bone.</p>
               <p>Of the premisses such a description of a bone may be gathered.</p>
               <p>A bone is a similary<note place="margin">The description.</note>
                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:16110:268"/>
part most dry and cold, unflexible, compacted of the thickest part of the seed by the spirit; the naturall heat concurring to afford stablenesse, and figure to the whole body.</p>

<pb n="517" facs="tcp:16110:273"/>
have but one fang, and so easily fall out. These first make way out of the gums; because the tops of them are shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest.</p>
               <p>Those in the second ranke are called <hi>canini</hi> or dogs teeth, from their length above the rest, hardnesse, and sharpnes. In each jaw there are but two, on each side of the grinders one. They are called <hi>oculares,</hi> or eye-teeth, not that they reach to the orbit of the eye: for they mount not higher than the nostrils; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:16110:274"/>
sprigs of the nerves, which move the eyes, are carried to them.</p>
               <p>These in the third rank are called <hi>molares,</hi> grinders, because like milles they grind the meat. Most commonly they are twenty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, five in each side of every jaw. Of these the two hindermost are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>genuini,</hi> and <hi>denta sapientiae,</hi> because they shew not themselves untill man come to the yeares of discretion, to wit, the 28, 30, yea even to old age it selfe.

some they never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Those of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per jaw have more fangs than those of the lower. First, because they hang. Secondly, because the substance of the upper jaw is not so firme, as that of the lower.</p>
               <p>The teeth come out in man the seventh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and sometimes more slowly, but in beasts sooner, because they are to eat solid meat. Of these teeth ten in each gum, to wit, the foure grinders, the two dogs teeth, and foure grinders, doe cast. The

fore teeth cast the foure, five, and six yeare of the age, the hinder flower.

               <p>As concerning the feeling of the teeth, first of all, they rather receive the impression of the first qualities, to wit, heat and cold, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of cold than heat,

contrary to the fleshy parts. Secondly, not the whole tooth; but the inner part towards the root, which is more soft by reason of the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in the cavity of it, and the membrane. The hard outer part is insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>

               <p>Of the ligaments some are membranous (such are those who inviron
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:16110:296"/>
the joynts;) some carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagineous, as those which are betweene the joynts, as is seene in the articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the thigh-bone with the <hi>coxendix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ligaments are to bee found in divers parts of the body.</p>
               <p>1. The bone of the tongue hath two strong ligaments, one on each side. Besides on each side it hath round ones by the which it is tyed to the adjacent parts to stay it in the middle of the mouth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the tongue hath a strong membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:16110:296"/>
ligament in the lower part about the middle of it. About the end of it the <hi>fraenum</hi> is to be seene, which if it come to the fore-teeth, it hindereth the motion of the tongue and speech. Children being so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, are said to bee tongue-tyed, and must have it cut.</p>
               <p>3. The ligaments which tye the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the brest and loynes, the ribs with the <hi>verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae,</hi> and the ribs with the brest-bone, are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous.</p>
               <p>4. Sundry are to bee
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:16110:297"/>
seene in the belly. The first tyeth the <hi>os ilium</hi> to <hi>os sacrum.</hi> The second tyeth the <hi>os sacrum</hi> to the <hi>coxendix.</hi> The third joyneth the share bones, and is cartilaginous. The fourth compasseth them circularly, and is membranous. The fift compasseth the hole of <hi>os pubis,</hi> and is membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
               <p>5. In the arme these appeare. 1. Five tye the <hi>adjutorium</hi> to the shoulder blade. 2. The bones of the elbow, <hi>ulna</hi> and <hi>radius,</hi> are tyed first one to another, secondly
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:16110:297"/>
to the shoulder-bone, and thirdly to the wrest, by membranous liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 3. There are two annular ligaments, which being transverse, direct the tendons which passe to the fingers. They are two. One in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side for the tendons of the extending muscles; the other in the inner side, for the tendons of the contracting muscles. 4. The bones of the wrest, back of the hand, and fingers, have mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous ligaments. 5. In the leg these may be found out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="566" facs="tcp:16110:298"/>First, the thigh-bone is tyed to the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> by two ligaments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the lower end of it is tyed to <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula</hi> by six liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Tibia</hi> is joyned to the <hi>Fibula,</hi> by a membranous liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>tibia</hi> and <hi>fibula</hi> are joyned to the ankley by three liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the ankley is tyed with the bones of the foot by five liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the bones of
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:16110:298"/>
the instep and toes are tyed with such liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as those are which are seene in the hand.</p>
