         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
OBSERVATOR
DEFENDED
IN
A modeſt Reply to the late Animadverſions upon thoſe
Notes the Obſervator publiſhed upon the ſeven
Doctrines and Poſitions which the King
by way of Recapitulation layes
open ſo offenſive.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Animadverſor hath attacht the Obſervator,
juſt like a weak and degenerous enemie, that
durſt not encounter his adverſary in open field,
but lodgeth himſelf in ſome obſcure and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
paſſage, to attempt at leaſt upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere-guard,
not being able to pierce into his
main body. The ingenious peruſer of both, I doubt not, may
diſcern that the Obſervator in the concluſion of his Treatiſe
only recapitulated ſeven Reſults out of His Majeſties papers, in
contradiction to his Antecedent diſquiſition, &amp; the Parliaments
proceedings, that ſo one might compendiouſly view the ſubject
of his diſcourſe, and as it were by an Index find out the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of His Majeſties poſitions, by the fore-going Arguments
of the book, which the Animadverſor very cautelouſly is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
never to take notice of in the whole Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>1. In the firſt poſition, the Animadverſor grants the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
Arguments for the declarative power of Parliament in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the ſafe reſidence of that power in the boſome of the
Jutelary Aſſembly; But with this reſtriction, <q rend="inline margQuotes">That he ſhould
have allowed the King his place in Parliament, and not have
named a Parliament without him.</q> But how could the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
without affronting impudence ſpeak otherwiſe? ſeeing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123761:2"/>
His Majeſtie in preſent is pleaſed actually to have his reſidence
out of Parliament, and will not allow himſelfe a place in it; but
in ſtead of concurrence with it, ſeeks the remoteſt diſtances from
it. The better therefore to ſee how the King and Parliament
are in parts, we will firſt negatively and then poſitively open
the preſent Controverſie betwixt them, which is the cauſe of
their disjunction. Which in the firſt place is not this which
moſt men conceive, That when His Majeſtie ſhall agree, and
the Parliament likewiſe agree, for eſtabliſhing ſome new Law,
or interpreting ſome old, which may be for the particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
of ſome conditions of men onely, in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
Whether then the King ought to declare this or that
to be Law excluſively of the Parliament, or the Parliament doe
the ſame excluſively of the King: But poſitively it is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When
there is viſibly a danger readie to confound the whole common-wealth,
and conſequently all particular commodities and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Whether the State if then convened, may not lawfully of
it ſelf provide for its preſervation, eſpecially if the King either
ſee not the danger, or ſeeing it, will not provide for it in ſuch
manner as may give beſt ſecuritie to Himſelf and Common-wealth:
When therfore ſuch a Queſtion ſhall juſtly ariſe betwixt
King and common-wealth (which collectively is that we call a
Parliament) it being of publike intereſt of State, and ſo <hi>De jure
publico,</hi> it cannot fall under the examination of any inferiour
judicature (with which thoſe ſo known voted Lawes, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſor
ſpeakes of, are to be found.) For that is furniſht only
with rules of particular (not univerſall) juſtice, for the deciſion of
particular differences betwixt this or that man, for this or that
thing. Which rules being too narrow for ſo capacious a ſubject,
we muſt recurre to thoſe that the originall Laws of Nature and
policy hold out to us, which muſt needes be ſuperiour to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The chiefeſt rule of that is, <hi>Ne quovis modo periclitetur reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica,</hi>
That by all means publike ſafety be ſecured: And every
State muſt principally endeavour to hold faſt and ſure our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſociable Incorporations one with another from publike di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123761:2"/>
calamities and deſtructions, which may ariſe from our
ſelves or other forraign Kingdoms: And whileſt that is done
according as Natures Lawes and policy preſcribes in Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
juſtice, they may well in the mean time proceed to make or
revile Lawes of particular juſtice, which is of particular things,
whereby we may commutatively encreaſe our fortunes and
eſtates one by another, or by forraign commerce. But if thoſe
that fit at the head of the common-wealth ſhall let looſe the
helm of it, and ſo let it float at all hazards, or elſe unadviſedly
ſteere it directly towards rockes and ſhelves, it ſelfe is bound by
thoſe originall Lawes (which ſurely may be ſome meanes) to
ſave it ſelf from a wrack: And how the King is not invaded or
wronged by having himſelfe and his Kingdome preſerved from
imminent danger, and how it is poſſible a King may ruine his
Kingdom, follow in its juſt place. In the meane time from theſe
premiſſes we prove that the Parliaments method is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
For in the firſt place it endevours to ſecure the being of the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth now floating at hazard; And afterwards to apply
its ſelf to quicken particular Laws for our wel-being. <hi>Now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fundamentall Law which the Animadverſor ſo hotly cals for,
&amp; the Parliament ſquares by is not ſuch a one as (ſome ſay) was never
known before it was broken; Nor (as he ſaies) lies mentally or parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
in the wals of the Parliament Houſe to be produced upon
any emergent occaſion:</hi> But is ſuch a one as is coucht radically in
Nature it ſelf (and ſo becomes the very pin of law and ſociety)
and is written and enacted irrepealably in her <hi>Magna charta,</hi>
which we are not beholden to any ſublunary power for, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to us as we are living and ſociable creatures. And no
knowne act of particular Juſtice or right to this or that petty
thing, can claſh with this, but muſt in equitie vail to it, as to its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent.
For what can thoſe particular Acts of Law, which
are to encreaſe our private and domeſtick profit advantage us?
when its doubtfull in ſo great dangers whether we may enjoy
our lives at all, or no. It is therefore notoriouſly calumnious
and inconſequent which the Animadverſor from hence affirms,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123761:3"/>
               <hi>That the Parliament affects an arbitrary power,</hi> or the particular rights in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe of Juſtice, as alſo the ſafety of King and people muſt at all times
totally depend on their Votes excluſively of the King: Which in the following
Poſition comes to be more fully diſproved: Which power we confeſſe with
him can never be ſafe either for King or people, nor is preſidentable.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Poſit.</hi> Parliaments are not bound to preſidents (ſaith the Obſervator) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
not to Statutes, <hi>viz.</hi> Abſolutely; For the cauſe both of the one and the
other is not permanent: And tis true therefore which the Animadverſor ſaith,
<hi>that they are durable, till they be repealed,</hi> which had been to good purpoſe
had he ever denied it, For he rightly attributes no more power to Statutes
then to other particular Lawes, which (as is proved in the firſt Poſition, and
further ſhall be in this) cannot in his caſe ſtand in equitie, nor act beyond
their power, and that contrary to the Legiſlative intent, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a violation
of ſome more ſoveraigne good introduceable, or ſome extreme and generall
evil avoidable; which evil otherwiſe might ſwallow not onely Statutes, but
all other ſanctions what ever. And thus in reſpect of the effect, they may be
ſaid in ſome ſort to Repeal themſelves. For really in ſuch a caſe they become
mortified, and can doe no more for us. For the Parliaments caſe and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
(which the Animadverſor ſtill forgets to be of preſerving the whole
Kingdome, and ſo, <hi>De jure publico</hi>) is of ſo tranſcendent a nature, "<hi>de facto,</hi>
it may not, and <hi>de jure</hi> it ought not to be reſtrained by pettie and mortified
Statutes or Lawes, in acting ſo much good for us. <hi>But how ſhould Preſidents</hi>
(as the Animadverſo ſaith) <hi>be best warrants? or how ſhould they be in the like
degree limiting or binding that Oaths are?</hi> Conſider the conſequence, Such or
ſuch a Parliament did not or durſt not doe this or that, therefore may no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
do it? Some Parliaments, not comparable to the Worthies of this) have
omitted ſome good out of ſupineneſſe, difficulty, or to avoid a greater evill,
which might be valuable with the good deſired; ſome perhaps hath done ill
which the integritie and worth of this abhors to think of; ſo that neither King
nor Parliament have reaſon to plead ſo ſtrongly for coherents to Preſidents.
But both have better rules if they will not deceive them, which are, To direct
all by the intereſt of State (which is never accuſable of Injuſtice) And by Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which we may call a generall Law: and though it be variable according
to the ſubject matter and circummſtances, yet it is that only, which will not let
<hi>ſummum jus</hi> be <hi>ſumma injuria,</hi> which is the ſupremeſt right that can be done
us. And it remains to be wiſht that the Animadverſor would have ſhown us
in this main buſineſſe, wherein the Parliament hath gone croſſe, either to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Intereſt of State or Equitie. <hi>To ſay</hi> (as the Animadverſor doth) <hi>that this
ſingle and extraordinary caſe excludes the King from Supremacy (even above
particulars) and diveſts him to the naked priority onely of Place and Title,</hi> is
that which blaſts it ſelf, unleſſe the Animadverſor, be able to prove the Kings
exerciſe of his former power totally intercepted, and the more now then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123761:3"/>
Parliaments of the like circumſtances, or that he is ruin'd by having his
Kingdome preſerved. <hi>But Serjeant Major Skippon (who is a particular) was
not permitted to obey the Kings ſummons of him, therefore the King</hi> (ſaith the
Animadverſor) <hi>is denied a power even above particulars.</hi> But we anſwer that
his caſe reports to that of the Parliaments, and muſt ſtand or fall with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of that. In the mean time he is ſo imployed, that he could not have been
in any more redounding to His Majeſties ſolid happineſſe, which (rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood)
would have prodnced rather an excuſe than an accuſation. <hi>For the
Parliaments diſcharging of their truſt</hi> (which the Animadverſor fears ſo much)
It is ſo notorious to all uncorrupted and unbiaſt judgements, that we have
reaſon to pray, that thoſe who ſo adviſedly elected them in a time of leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Kingdome, than this preſent is, be not more diſloyall to them, than
they are to their chuſers. What they have actually effected with the Kings
concurrence, the Animadverſor I hope will not except againſt; and what they
deſire further to effect (wherein they ſo humbly and pariently have attended
his Majeſties concurrence) is onely for the happier continuation of that other
to us, and is to be reputed good or ill, in order to that. Where then is the evill
for which the Parliament muſt be ſo ſcourged by all ſort of hands? why did we
engage them ſo ſtudiouſly to wipe off that Ruſt, which began to eate ſo deep
into the letter of our lawes, and all our poſſeſſions? and to make new purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
for us of all our eſtates? if now being aſſembled they cannot diſcerne what
and where thoſe lawes are to be found, by the luſter and power of which they
they ſhould act all this for us. We have bleſſings plentifully in ſtore for his
Majeſty, but deſire he would not reduce the ultimate reſolution and reſerch of
the Law (our bleſſing) to be in his own boſome, more than in that of the
Parliament, leſt when God in his anger ſhall deprive us of ſo great a bleſſing as
is his life and government, that dye with him. I ſhall not multiply on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſors
Arguments; <hi>Of the poſſibility of the Parliaments erring, and not
rightly diſcharging their truſts:</hi> all which might be more powerfully urged on
one man confiding in his own ſingularity. He might have knowne them to
have been unanſwerably refuted and kild before their birth. But ſince he will
<q rend="inline margQuotes">have the Parliament ſo great practitioners of Popiſh policy,</q> in reſpect of
ſome infallibilitie, which he ſaies, and they never arrogated; ſave onely a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie
of leſſe erring in that queſtion betwixt his Majeſty and themſelves;
let me, I ſay, nakedly recite what the learned, and yet unanſwered Divine in
this matter (which the Animadverſor ſo triumphs in) hath urged againſt the
Papiſts,<note place="margin">Chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </note> whom it moſt concerns, ſo to leave the Reader to aſſume what ſhall
ſeem moſt deduceable to himſelf; His words are theſe. * He that would uſnrp
an abſolute tyranny and lordſhip over any people, need not put himſelf to the
trouble and difficulty of abrogating his Laws, made to maintain the common
liberty, for he may fruſtrate their intent and compaſſe his deſign as well, if he
can get the power and authority to interpret them as he pleaſes, and have his
interpretarions ſtand for Laws. I ſhall not need to recapitulate the condition of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123761:4"/>
our Lawes before the Parliament, nor yet what interpretations they received;
Which interpretation were held ſo Authentique, that they made the Law but
a noſe of waxe, to wring ſometimes this way for Ship money, and for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of it, as to make the King likewiſe the ſole Iudge and redreſſer of all
publike dangers, ſometimes another way for legall monopolies, &amp;c. Let the
world then iudge who arrogate moſt infallibilitie, or have more made uſe of
Papiſts or Popiſh policy.</p>
            <p>3. The Obſervator ſaith that the Parliament deſerted by the King in the
whole Kingdomes diſtreſſe may relieve it and the King. Here is aſſerted the
publike Intereſt of State, which can fall under no notion of any inferior Court
to examine. But the Animadverſor draws this conſequence from thence;
<hi>That then every mans eſtate may be wrested from his propriety and poſſeſſion:
Quàm urceus exit.</hi> Here he doth moſt palpably diſcover the looſeneſſe of his
Logick and cauſe, and how little he holds to his premiſſes, and ſtate of the
Controverſie betwixt King and Parliament, which I ſo oft noted before, and
ſhewed the caſe to be <hi>De Iure publico,</hi> and ſo politicall.</p>
            <p>Commutative therefore and Diſtributive Iuſtice being of inferior matters
have their inferiour Courts, and the apparant letter of the Law to decide, and
power to actuate what is rightly decided. But this Controverſie being <hi>De iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
publico,</hi> of a publike right, it fals under the notion of another ſort of Iuſtice,
whereas particular proprieties and poſſeſſions fall under thoſe two inferiour
ſorts of Iuſtice, as hath beene proved in the concluſion of the firſt Poſition,
which together with this ſhew the ſandineſſe and incoherence of the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſors
conſequence. Here therefore we will onely note, that even in a common
diſtreſſe (which is leſſe then a publique) without a Vote of Parliament, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
any other diſpenſation of Right, a particular propriety may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
by a Community to preſerve it ſelf: as when the Sea breaks in upon a
County, a bank may be made of and on this or that mans ground whether he
pleaſe or no; And when our Neighbour <hi>Vcalygons</hi> houſe blazes, frequently
we ſee ſome houſes pluckt down (where the fire actually broke not out) leſt
it ſhould conſume the whole ſtreet. And 'twas equitie (before Poeſie) that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the propinquitie of the danger, we are ſuppoſed to be even in the danger it
ſpect ſelf; and that the houſe ſo pluckt down, is not ſuppoſed ſo much to be
dilapidated as burnt. <hi>Tum tuares agitur paries cum proximus ardet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I wonder by what Act or Declaration the Parliament hath denyed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
to the ſufferer in that kind, as the Queſtion now ſtands?</hi> If all men did
not know that the Parliament hath ſo provided for the indemnity of thoſe at
<hi>Hull,</hi> perhaps the Animadverſor might have gained the credit of ſome mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
in averring, That <hi>the Parliament upholds publike good with private miſery.</hi>
With the like grace alſo, and with ſufficient confidence doth he tell us, That
<hi>if there be a great distreſſe in the Kingdome, it is cauſed by the Parliament clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that power which cannot conſist with the Royall estate of his Maieſty.</hi> 'Tis
prodigious to all honeſt underſtandings, that the near engagements of warre
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:123761:4"/>
the <hi>Scots</hi> twice meerly upon miſunderſtanding; That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of ſtrangling the Parliament as ſoon as born (for proof of
which the Parliament preſumes to have had too much ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency)
having the bloudieſt and true Papiſticall war in <hi>Ireland</hi>
rayſed againſt our Nation, and that againſt the Parliament
eſpecially (in the walls of whoſe houſe they haac already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
a breach, <hi>J am perlucente ruina</hi>) That even now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our ſelves we ſee ſome, who with more alacrity are
ready to imploy themſelves againſt that ſacred Aſſembly,
than againſt thoſe unchriſtian Rebels, and yet that all this
ſhould be too little to evince the Realitie (as the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
ſaith) of a diſtreſſed kingdome; and who is yet more
tranſcendent, That all this ſhould be cauſed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which aimes at nothing but the extirpation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
root and branch, and of which ſome part of it (<hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Scots</hi> troubles) had being long before the Parliament had
any; and then I pray, how could it be the cauſe of it? How
the King is head and we the body, and how the King cannot
be inſulted over by having his Kingdome and Selfe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from ruine, is proved at large by the Obſerver, beyond
the capacity of any his animadverſions. Whether the people
<q rend="inline margQuotes">may revoke all they actually have tranſacted to their King,</q>
is a Queſtion very impertinently inſerted by the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
in reſpect of any thing that the Obſervator hath in the
Parliaments caſe; which is ſuch, That when the King ſhall
have endeavoured his utmoſt, he will find, that he ſhall not
be able to preſerve the Kingdome in extremitie of diſtreſſe,
without the aſſiſtance of the Kingdome it ſelf. However this
the Obſervator denies, that the people could make ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of power to their Kings, as might prove deſtructive
of humanitie: So that much of the Animadvertors Divinity
might have been husbanded for an apter occaſion. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> in the 13. of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> tells us not what
power is the higheſt, but that that power which is the higheſt
ought to be obeyed. Againe as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks firſt of a few
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123761:5"/>
particular diſperſt men, and thoſe again in a primitive condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
who had no means to provide for their preſervation.
Moreover it is very obſervable that S<hi rend="sup">n</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> in the 3. verſe
ſpeaks of a Ruler, as our Law ſpeaks of our King, <hi>viz. That
he is not a terrour to good but to evill works:</hi> The Law like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſaith, <hi>The King can doe no injustice.</hi> The interpretation
of the one muſt ſquare with the other, and that muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the diſtinction of Fact and Right. For according
to Fact, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> Ruler may be a terror to good, and a cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to evill works; but by Right he ought not to be ſo. Our
Law ſaith, Our King rather ought noi in Right, than that <hi>de
facto</hi> he cannot doe injuſtice; For we know there have been
both unjuſt Kings and ill Rulers. But leaſt there ſhould be
ſuch, Scripture it ſelf as well as our Parliament doth endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to binde them from exerciſing ill. As <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. ver. 18
19. 20. The King ſhall have a book to learn to keep the Law,
and doe according to it, leſt his heart be lifted up above his
Brethren. And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 18. The Prince may not take of the
peoples inheritance by oppreſſion, and thruſt them out of it,
but ſhall be content with his own poſſeſſion, leſt other men be
ſcattered from their poſſeſſions. Wherein then hath the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
denyed the King that due which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> allows his
Ruler? Who he ſaith, (as is very obſervable through the
whole Chapter) that he may be a Miniſter to us onely for
good: And to keep the Parliament even with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> What
elſe doth it hazard it ſelf for, but for refuſing to favour the
King in an uncircumſcribed power of doing ill? Which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
he vindicates to himſelf irreſtrainably, And that by vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue
of ſome Right and enlargement of Law and Religion,
even to doe all manner of ill, if ſo be he ſhall ever be pleaſed
ſo to doe. Moreover S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath not, nor could any where
repeale the lawes of nature, ſo that if the Parliament in its
caſe hath neither declined them, nor our own Originall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
nor the preſent intereſt of State, nor S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Then I
hope, it hath kept it ſelf conſonantly to Law and Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:123761:5"/>
Out of all this (with what followes in the ſixth Poſition) wee
<hi rend="margQuotes">may eaſily anſwer to the Anymadverſors Objection of Reſiſtance.</hi>
For out of thoſe premiſes it appeares. That in the King there are
two things onely; firſt, His Perſon; Secondly, His Office, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
or as St. <hi>Paul</hi> cals it, his Power: for his Perſon we hold it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
inviolable: For his Power or Office, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
it reſpects us onely for good, its very reaſonable that we apply our
ſelves in obedience to that for our owne ſakes as well as for his. But
the Court Paraſites they are not content with this diſtribution, but
adde to the perſon and power, or office of a Prince, that which
they call, The will or pleaſure of a Prince; or rather they marry
the power or office of a Prince to his Will: and ſo by that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
conjunction they proving them all one (<hi>Quia omnis poteſtas eſt
voluntatis</hi>) then they aske us the Queſtion, Whether we are not
equally bound to obey the one in all latitudes as well as the other?
As if we had contracted for the evill as well as the good, and that,
as it ſhould ſeem beſt to the Prince we contracted with. But to
that we clearelier anſwer, That becauſe the will lies under an
indifferencie of commanding the ill, as well as the good, we
may lawfully embrace that part and power onely of his good,
(as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) which indeede is the very eſſence of his power,
and makes him a King: and we may reiect the other, which
makes him a bloody Tyrant: Yet not ſo as to violate his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in any caſe (no more than <hi>David</hi> would King <hi>Saul</hi>) but preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively
to thruſt as farre from us as wee are able all other blood-ſuckers,
who are forward to execute on us his ruining commands;
becauſe in ſuch a caſe he contracts his owne ruine as well as ours, and
is ſuppoſed to be in a diſtemper, and in ſtead of a wholſome potion
to call for poyſon, which I thinke no good or honeſt Phyſitian
would obey, but rather reſiſt thoſe that would obey him. Wherefore
in theſe conſiderations, it is not here as the Animadverſor ſaith of
the Parliament; <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare ſuper nos;</hi> but <hi>Nolumus hos
deſtruere no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> But of this in the ſixth Poſition. And for this hath
beene aſſerted, I know I quote our owne Gracious Prince, who
hath beene pleaſed thus to indoctrinate us in his ſeverall Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of ventring his owne life to preſerve us in the fruition of our
due liberties of Subiects; which we are ſure we cannot enioy from
him, if by that Proteſtation he intended to force upon us, a duty and
allegiance of embracing all thoſe tormentors whom he ſhould ſend
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:123761:6"/>
to us at any time, on any occaſion (lawfull or not lawfull) to ſpoyle
us either of our lives or ſubſiſtance; If ſo be ſo much evill ſhould
poſſibly hereafter enter into his Maieſties ſecret thoughts and will,
Of which therefore ſeeing there is never a knowne Law of the land,
and that it hath no analogie with the true Proteſtant Religion, and
our own iuſt liberties of Subiects, we will preſume that his Maieſtie
abhorrs the thought of chaining us to ſuch a ſlavery for his owne
part, both in Fact and Right; though alas he cannot promiſe us that
all his Succeſſors ſhall doe the like. Wherefore the Animadverſor
doth plainely abuſe his Maieſtie in this Argument, and doth deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
corrupt his preſent cauſe. Thus wee ſee what evils wee may
thruſt from us, and how we are bound to preſerve the Kings power
or office, together with his perſon as much as our owne. But the
Animadverſor, together with his Tribe, preach another kinde of
doctrine, from whence they know how to raiſe better uſes for their
ends, than the King can doe any; and that is, That in ſtead of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the worſt of thoſe evills which by a Kings bare pleaſure may be
that we ſhould ſuffer by the hands of other perſons, that we ſhould, I
ſay, ſimply betake our ſelves to flight, leaving all that we have in
this world, but our lives, to the Kings diſpoſall, and to be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to thoſe whom he ſhall thinke better worthy of them than our
ſelves, But in the Parliaments caſe it hath beene obſerved, that as it
is impoſſible (in a manner) for a whole Kingdome to flie, ſo ſurely
cannot that be required of it: This caſe is not as <hi>Davids</hi> (a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
mans) was, who being in the right, yet in danger, fled indeed,
but it was from one place to ſtand better on his guard in another.</p>
            <p>4. No Member of Parliament ought to bee troubled for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
upon ſuſpition only; eſpecially I ſay, in ſuch a caſe, whereof not
only the whole Houſe, but the whole Kingdome knows it ſelfe to be
alike culpable. And that the accuſed were in ſafe cuſtody, is not to
be doubted of by the Animadverſor, if the ingagement of a whole
Kingdome can give ſecurity: which is ſufficient enough for five
men, for ought the Animadverſor hath to the contrary.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Becauſe the Parliament to ſave a whole Kingdome once from
ruine, hath uſed ſome power which is communicable to a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in ſuch an extraordinary caſe; Therefore it may (ſaith the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſor)
uſurpe it in ordinary caſes; becauſe it may declare the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
what it will at pleaſure, and it is not infallible.</hi> As this conſequence
of the Animadverſor is the ſame with that of the third Poſition, ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:123761:6"/>
may the anſwer of that be applyed to this, to which I ſhall refer the
Reader. This only will I adde, That there is no need to create an
Infallibility in the Parliament to diſcerne matters of Fact within e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mans cognizance; but to afford it only a probability of leſſe
erring, or being leſſe deceived rather than a particular Individuall;
And that its common intereſt joyned with its indirectneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
(of which the extraordinary exact chooſing of the Members
at the beginning, it is an extraordinary proofe) may bee a forcible
Improbability of its ever uſurping ſuch a power in ordinary caſes,
which as it cannot be ſerviceable any way to us (becauſe ordinary
caſes have their moſt convenient courſes certainly regulated) ſo can
it not be but extreamly dangerous to themſelves alone, and no waies
advantagious; Becauſe in ſuch caſes we participate all of us of the
like conveniences. This Poſition the Animadverſor is pleaſed to
conclude with a Riddle; <hi>That the ruines which the Parliament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to ſave the Kingdome from, is to ſave it from Monarchy.—Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
teneatis amici?</hi> Are we ſo overgrowne with that government,
which our Laws are lockt and cabenetted in, in ſuch manner, that the
wounding of the one is the bleeding of the other? Or is it true
which the Biſhops have ſo long pulpited at Court, that the razeſing
of their power muſt be the Ecclipſe of the other? although we know,
and all the world with us, That Monarchy was of a more extended
latitude and abſoluteneſſe before Chriſtianity was profeſt by any
Monarch, then ever it was ſince: Or more coherently to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſors
own words; Can there be no abuſes or Cobwebs in
Church or Common-wealth, but they muſt needs be ſpun out of the
bowels of Monarchy? ſo that the reforming &amp; ſweeping away of the
one, muſt needs be the ſweeping away of the other? For our owne
part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, we will not make them ſo much Son and Father, although the
Animadverſor bee pleaſed to doe his Majeſty this good ſervice.
What then, the too too true ruine of the Kingdome is conceived to
be, is ſet down in the third Poſition; And what Connexion there is
in making Monarchy the ſame with that, let the refinedſt and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Logick collect.</p>
            <p>6 7. <hi>Whether levying of Forces againſt the perſonall Commands of
the King, though accompanied with his preſence, be to war againſt the
King,</hi> is largely diſcourſed by the Obſervator beyond any force of
reaſon which the Animadverſor hath uſed to enforce the contrary.
His Majeſty acknowledged much of this to the <hi>Scots,</hi> whoſe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123761:7"/>
were in all reſpects like ours, and which his Majeſty found
to be <hi>Non tam contra quam praeter authoritatem Regis,</hi> after hee had
preſt the Animadverſors arguments as warmly, as now he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
other of his good Subjects, though yet ſuffering under the
great calamity of his Royall diſpleaſure. But to ſay little of that
which is ſo notorious to us all of this Kingdome; Let us look over
to <hi>France,</hi> and there we may ſee thoſe who were as much Proteſtants
as we, that levyed armes againſt their Kings commands, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his preſence, and yet our King never thought them the worſe
Chriſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns or Subjects for that, and therefore made himſelfe a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan
with them in their very cauſe; ſo clearely was the piety and
lawfulneſſe of ſuch an act at that time reconciled to his Majeſties
conſcience and underſtanding. All which the Animadverſor muſt
needs confeſſe, unleſſe he will own the preſent Declarations of the
<hi>Rochelers,</hi> who with execrations of us ſay (upon the event of their
war) that the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> deſign was to deſtroy and eate
them up; and that they had preſerved their liberties and Religion
from any adulterate mixture of Popery, had they never ſeen him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But according to the Animadverſor, It is impoſſible a King ſhould
ruine his Kingdome, becauſe he ſhall alwaies have the Major part with
him.</hi> But modern miſeries ſhew us the contrary, witneſſe the neare
depopulated Principalities of <hi>Germany.</hi> But to anſwer the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with like reaſon, I ſay, that after a King ſhall have deſtroyed
the Minor part of his Kingdome with his Major, why may he not
then, by ſome differences in the Major part, be a cauſe even to bring
that to deſtruction too? But without ſuppoſing ſuch a Fate, why may
he not, <hi>Nero</hi> like, for pleaſure ſake, deſire that all the heads of the
Major part ſtood but upon one neck, that ſo he might chop them off
at a blow? Seeing then ſuch a King may ruine his Kingdome, (by
lamentable diſtreſſes and depopulations) and if a Parliament hath
the power to hinder it, it doth that which it is bound to doe, and
which is neither againſt the perſon, or genuine authority of the King,
unleſſe we can apprehend a Kings authority without a Kingdome
(which is the object it extends to, and acts in, and which wee have
proved he may deſtroy) and without which the Animadverſor muſt
needs reduce ſuch a King to a barer Title, then he ſaid our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would reduce our King to.</p>
