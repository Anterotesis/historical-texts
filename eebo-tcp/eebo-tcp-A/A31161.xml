            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> who in obedience to the Laws, make all their Works both of Gold and Silver, up to the Standard goodneſs.</head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly offered to the Conſideration of both Houſes of Parliament.</head>
            <p n="1">1. That great numbers of his Majeſties Subjects are Imployed, and have their Livelihood by making and ſelling the Works of Gold and Silver, whereby vaſt quantities are now in uſe amongſt us, which if honeſtly made of the Standard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goodneſs, it may be truly accounted one great part of the Ornament and Riches of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That upon conſideration thereof, the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> of <hi>London</hi> have been of old, and now are, or ought all to be of one Incorporation; and the Wardens of that Company are intruſted by their Charter and the ſeveral Statutes of the 28 <hi>Edw.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. and 37 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. and 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and 18 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 15. to inſpect, view and try all Gold and Silver Works throughout <hi>England:</hi> But by reaſon of ſome defects in thoſe Laws, in the Powers thereby given for Searching and Seizing all Works made courſer then the Standard thereby appointed, and the great temptation of the Gains by Adulterating thoſe Wares, great Evils do enſue: (to wit)</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the evil-diſpoſed <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and throughout this Kingdom, do preſume to make great quantities of moſt ſorts of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Works of a very baſe Allay, not worth 3 <hi>s.</hi> the ounce, and of Gold not worth 3 <hi>l.</hi> the ounce, and ſell the ſame as Standerd-Gold and Sterling-Silver; the value of which Deceit was (at a late hearing before his Majeſty in Councel, of a Complaint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſaid Wardens, and the well-diſpoſed working-<hi>Goldſmiths</hi> of <hi>London</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be about 20000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> which no Perſon there did contradict.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the ſaid well-diſpoſed <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> did then before His Majeſty alledge, (as in truth it is) their condition to be very lamentable; For if they, in obedience to the Laws, (and the Oath impoſed on them by the ſaid Wardens at their making Free) make all their Works of the Standard-goodneſs, they ſhall loſe their Trades, and ſo be brought to extreme poverty, by the evil-diſpoſed <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> making their Works of a very baſe Allay, and ſelling cheaper, yet do get near double the Profit the honeſt <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> get, in every ounce of Work: And if the well diſpoſed <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths,</hi> by the great neceſſity of their Livelihoods, are forc'd to fall to Cheating and Cozening, by putting Braſs or Copper in their Gold and Silver Works, they not only go againſt their ſaid Oaths, and ſo diſquiet their Conſciences by ſo great a Sin, but are expoſed to reproach and ſhame, by follwing a Trade ſupported by Fraud, which the evil-diſpoſed <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> make no ſcruple at, but uſe all the artifices imaginable to all in Authority, to prevent an honeſt Reformation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Upon hearing the Premiſſes at the Councel-Board, and the Allegations of the ſaid Wardens, (by their Councel) that they had not power to ſuppreſs theſe Deceits; his Majeſty was then pleaſed to direct, that Endeavours be forthwith uſed to obtain an Act of Parliament, for effectually ſuppreſſing the ſaid Frauds, which will be to the great Honour of this Kingdom, encouragement of Trade, and a creditable Subſiſtance and Livelyhood to ſeveral thouſands of his Majeſties Subjects, and amongſt which, to the honeſt diſpoſed <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> aforeſaid, who are impatient to ſee our Nation out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the <hi>French,</hi> in the fineneſs of all their Gold and Silver in Works, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as good and ſometimes better than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Standard aforeſaid.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, That all Perſons may be more fully convinced of the neceſſity of relief in the Premiſſes by Parliament, ſee a full Diſcovery of the ſeveral and ſubtil Frauds in the Gold and Silver Works, and all the Laws now in force for redreſs thereof, comprized in a late Treatiſe entituled, <hi>A Touchstone for Gold and Silver Wares,</hi> the 2 <hi>d.</hi> Edition, compoſed by a well-diſpoſed <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> on purpoſe to procure a Reformation in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
