         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The generall REMONSTRANCE or
DECLARATION of the SEA-MEN which inhabit
in <hi>London</hi> and thereabouts, dated <date>the 31, of <hi>Ian,</hi> 1641.</date>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas wee of the true Proteſtant Religion and the maintainer of the Goſpell
under our gracious King and Parliament, and have beene continually loving and
faithfull Subjects to his Sacred Majeſty, and notwithſtanding the generall and
hard oppreſſions ſuffered by ſubordinate Governours, to the Ruine of our
lives, if it had not beene prevented by the providence of God, and the good
care of our King and Parliament, to prevent their deſignes before it came to
perfection, yet having all liberty of the true Religion from his Majeſty out
of the effluence of his Princely care to us, and wee waying no Corporall loſſe
in reſpect of that great Immunity of the Soule, we are inviolably reſolved to infix our ſelves in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
and pure Allegiance forever to his Sacred Majeſty, and his Succeſſors, for the maintenance of
the Goſpell under them, and to ſubdue all thoſe which doth oppoſe it, if his Majeſty would be pleaſed
out of his Princely care, and providence, to give us leave.</p>
            <p>So it is, that if his Majeſty and this Honourable Parliament, would bee pleaſed to give unto Us
and the Owners of theſe Ships the Priviledges to have Letters of Marts and free paſſage into the Seas,
by the providence of the Almighty GOD, wee ſhall in a ſhort time ſubdue all theſe Rebels and any
that doth oppoſe his Majeſty, or this Kingdome, or other Kingdomes for the maintenance of the
Goſpell which doth belong to his Majeſty: and knowing none to bee ſo deſirous to maintaine it but
the true Proteſtants, and none more readier then wee that doth belong to the Sea, and thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the generall good of his Majeſty and this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But wee the ſaid Sea-men and true Proteſtants, and loyall Subjects to his Majeſty; doe hereby
proffer our ſelves and Lives for the maintenance of it, touching our Religion in which wee were
Baptized in and under the Faith of our Saviour JESVS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>But likewiſe, if his Majeſty and this Parliament would bee pleaſed to let us bee ſupported there,
for to raiſe the name of the true Proteſtants heere in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſeeing this ſurpriſe ſo
dangerous, tending abſolutely to the overthrow of the Liberty of our Conſciences and Countrey, if it
bee not prevented in time; and alſo our gracious Kings Power and Priviledges forced from him, in
which, and in whoſe prudent Care have formerly beene over Us and the Goſpell, our ſole quiet, and
comfort conſiſted, and without the which, the feare of our preſent Ruines did preſcribe opinion and
premoniſh us to ſave our ſelves; Wee therefore as well to regaine his Excellent Majeſties ſaid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
it being onely due to Him and his Succeſſours, and being the eſſence and life of Monarchy,
hoping thereby to Confirme a ſtrong and invincible Unity betweene his Royall and ever happie Love
unto us and our faithfull Duty, and Loyaltie to his incomparable Majeſtie. And the Rebels having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up Armes, and poſſeſſed themſelves of the beſt and ſtrongeſt Forts of the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> to
oppoſe his Majeſty, and all thoſe which doth maintaine the Goſpell, the which wee doe hope that the
Almighty God, will ſave and defend us from the tyrannous reſolution of our Enemies, and this in our
Conſciences as we doe wiſh the Peace of the ſame to our ſelves and poſterity, is the pretence and true
cauſe that doth make us to declare our ſelves to God and the World for the reliefe of theſe our poore
diſtreſſed Brethren in <hi>Jreland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee doe declare unto God and the World, that what we doe is for the maintenance of our King
and our Religion, and to defend our Brethren by our reliefe at Sea.</p>
            <p>Wee doe deſire that the Government of that Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> might bee put into the hands of
ſome godly and Religious man, and not to have any Papiſts to inhabit there, nor within the Kingdome
of <hi>England,</hi> nor any Popiſh Lords to have place in this Honourable Court of Parliament, but to bee
utterly caſt out.</p>
            <p>Alſo wee doe deſire, that thoſe Commanders which are bound forth for that ſervice into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
ſhould take the Oath of alleagiance and Supremicie: ſo that they which doe goe under them may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
that they ſhall not be betrayed into the hands of the Rebels, but to ſtand to maintaine the Faith
and the Truth of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Wee taking it into our ſerious conſideration, doe for feare our Brethren ſhould be over-come of a
ſudden, and for the ſecurity of this Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> we have thought fit to have this our Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to be publiſhed, that his Majeſtie and this Honorable Parliament would be pleaſed to conſider
of it, and give us the Priviledges of Letters of Marts for to keepe theſe our Enemies in ſubjection.</p>
