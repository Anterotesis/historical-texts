         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I did not beginne this preſent Controverſie, ſo I doe not deſire to hold up the Ball of contention: yet having appeared in it (neither alone nor without a calling and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered) I hold it my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to vindicate the truth of Chriſt, the ſolemne League and Covenant, the Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and my ſelfe; for this end was I borne, and for this end came I into the world, that I might beare witneſſe to the truth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I am ſo much the more encouraged, becauſe it appeareth already in this debate, that <hi>magna eſt vis veritatis, great is the force of truth,</hi> and ſo great, that my Antagoniſts (though men of parts
<pb facs="tcp:113393:2"/>
and ſuch as could doe much for the truth, yet) while they have gone about to doe ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, they have mired themſelves in fowle errors; yea (ſo farre as in them lieth) have moſt dangerouſly ſhaken and endangered the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Magiſtrates, who are Gods Vice-gerents, and particularly the authority of Parliament, and of Parliamentary Ordinances; they have ſtumbled and fallen, and ſhall not be able to riſe, but by the acknowledgement of the truth.</p>
            <p>In this following Reply, I have not touched much of the argumentative part in Maſter <hi>Huſſey</hi> his <hi>plea for Chriſtian Magiſtracy,</hi> reſerving moſt of it to an other worke, unto which this is a <hi>Prodromus.</hi> (howbeit much of what he ſaith, is the ſame with what I did confute in my <hi>Nihil reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and his Booke comming forth a moneth after, takes no notice of that ſecond peece of mine, but ſpeaketh onely to the firſt) Meane while, let him not believe that his bigge-looking Title can like <hi>Gorgons</hi> head, blockify or ſtonify rationall men, ſo as they ſhall not perceive the want or weakeneſſe of Argument: It hath ever beene a trick of Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to calumniate the way of God and his Servants, as being againſt authoritie. But, I will by Gods
<pb facs="tcp:113393:2"/>
aſſiſtance) make it appeare to any intelligent man, that the Reverend Brother hath pleaded very much againſt Magiſtracy, and ſo hath fallen himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ditch which hee hath digged for others, whiles I withall eſcape.</p>
            <p>But now what may be the meaning of Maſter<note place="margin">Math. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius in lexi philol. Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico, malum loquor ſive juſte ſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria.</note> 
               <hi>Colemans</hi> Cabbaliſticall Title, <hi>male dicis male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis:</hi> Great philologs will tell him, that <hi>maledico</hi> is taken in a good ſenſe, as well as in a bad, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the difference of matter and circumſtances. If any kind of malediction be juſtifiable, it is <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledicere maledicis,</hi> to ſpeake evill to evill ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; for <hi>as he loved curſing, ſo let it come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: as he delighted not in bleſſing, ſo let it be farre from him.</hi> But, he doth worſe, and his Title with a tranſpoſition of letters, will more fitly reflect upon himſelfe <hi>male dicis de amicis:</hi> you Sir ſpeake evill of your friends, and of thoſe that never wronged you: For my part, I have not ſhared with him in evill ſpeaking, nor rendred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings for revilings. I am ſorry that he is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ill of hearing, as to take reaſon to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and good ſayings to be evill ſayings. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth to himſelfe the Apostles words, <hi>Being revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, we bleſſe.</hi> But where to finde theſe bleſſings of
<pb facs="tcp:113393:3"/>
his, thoſe unwritten verities, I know not. I am ſure he had ſpoken more truly, if he had ſaid, <hi>being not reviled, we doe revile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the matter and ſubſtance of his Reply, there are divers particulars in it which ſerve rather to be matter of Mirth, then of Argument, as, that a Parliament paraſite cannot be called an abuſer of the Parliament, and that paſſage; <hi>How can a clauſe delivered in a poſt ſcript concerning my opinion of my way, be abuſive to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?</hi> A great priviledge either of poſt-ſcripts, or of his opinions, that they can not be abuſive to the Parliament. Many paſſages are full of acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: many extravagant and not to the point in hand: many void of matter; concerning ſuch <hi>Lactantius</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib 2. c. 4.</note> gives me a good rule, <hi>otioſum eſt perſequi ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> It is an idle and improfitable thing to proſecute every particular. And much more I have in my eye the Apoſtles rule, <hi>let all things be done to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26</note> I have accordingly endeavoured to avoid vaine jangling, and ſuch debates as are unprofitable and unedifying, making choice of ſuch purpoſes as may edifie, and not abuſe the Reader.</p>
            <p>Peradventure ſome will think I might have wholly ſaved my ſelfe this labour; I confeſſe I doe
<pb facs="tcp:113393:3"/>
not looke upon that which I make Reply unto, as if it were like to weigh much with knowing men, yet the Apoſtle tells mee that ſome mens mouths muſt be ſtopped, and <hi>Hierome</hi> tells me, there is nothing<note place="margin">Hieron. Euſtochio.</note> written without skill, which will not find a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with as little ſkill to judge, and ſome men grow too wiſe in their owne eyes, when they paſſe unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Beſides all this, a vindication and clearing of ſuch things as I mentioned in the beginning, may by Gods bleſſing anticipate future and further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes. Reade therefore and conſider, and when thou haſt done, I truſt thou ſhalt not think, that I have loſt my labour. I pray the Lord that all our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies may end in a more cordiall union, for proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the ends expreſſed in the Covenant, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Reformation of Religion, according to the word of God, and the example of the beſt reformed Churches, and more particularly the practicall part of Reformation, that the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt may be kept from pollution, prophanneſſe and ſcandals ſhamed away, and pietie commended and magnified.</p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:113393:5"/>
Sir, you have ſpoken evil for your ſelf; you have made the ſelf-contradiction worſe. Will you acknowledge you own words in your Sermon, pag 25. <hi>Lay no more burthen of Government upon the ſhoulders of Ministers then Christ hath plainly laid upon them; have no more hand therein then the holy Ghoſt clearly gives them. The Miniſters have other work to do, &amp; ſuch as will take up the whole man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I fear an ambitious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnarement,</hi> &amp;c. and in your <hi>Re-examination,</hi> p. 14. <hi>He ſhould have ſaid, I adviſed the Parliament to lay no burthen of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them whom he this Commiſſioner thinks Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, then had he ſpoken true.</hi> Now let the Reverend Brother take heed to check-meat; and that three ſeveral wayes (but let him not grow angry as bad players uſe to do;) For 1. <hi>Eo ipſo,</hi> that he denies the Inſtitution, by his principles he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Prudence; For he that denieth the Inſtitution, and adviſeth the Parliament to lay no more burthen of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Miniſters then Chriſt hath plainly laid upon them, is againſt the ſetling of the thing in a prudential way, becauſe it is not inſtituted. But Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> denies the Inſtitution and adviſeth the Parliament to lay no more burthen of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon Miniſters then Chriſt hath plainly laid upon them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> is againſt the ſetling of the thing in a prudential way, becauſe it is not inſtituted. And how to reconcile this with his denying of the Inſtitution, and yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prudence, will require a more reconciling head then <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael Conciliator</hi> himſelf. 2. He that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth the Parliament to lay no burthen of Government upon Miniſters, becauſe they have other work to do which will take up the whole man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe of the fear of an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enſnarement, is againſt the laying of any burthen of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective Government upon Miniſters, ſo much as in a pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial way. But Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> adviſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The conſequence in the propoſition is neceſſary, unleſſe he will ſay that it is agreeable to the rules of Prudence, to lay upon them more work beſides that which will take up the whole man, or to commit that power unto them, which is like to prove an ambitious enſnarement. 3. He that adviſeth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113393:5"/>
the Parliament to lay no burthen at all of corrective Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Miniſters and other Officers joyned with them in Elderſhips, but to keep that power <hi>wholly</hi> in their own hands, is againſt the Prudence of the thing, as well as againſt the Inſtitution of it. But Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> adviſeth the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to lay no burthen at all of corrective Government upon theſe, but to keep that power <hi>wholly</hi> in their own hands. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Propoſition is proved by that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, The Parliament Votes look to Prudence. So that the Parliament having voted a power of Suſpenſion from the Sacrament, unto Elderſhips, for ſo many ſcandals as are enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate in the Ordinance (which power is a part of that which he calls <hi>corrective</hi>) he that is againſt this power in Elderſhips, is both againſt the Prudence and againſt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament. The Aſſumption I prove from his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination,</hi> pag. 14. where after his deniall of the power to thoſe whom we think Church-Officers, being charged with adviſing the Parliament to take Church-government <hi>wholly</hi> into their own hands, his anſwer was, <hi>If you mean the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective power, I do ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now after all this, I muſt tell the Reverend Brother that he might have ſaved himſelf much labour, had he in his Sermon to the Parliament declared himſelf (as now he doth) that he was onely againſt the <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> but not againſt their ſetling of the thing in a Parliamentary and prudential way. Did I not in my very firſt Examination of his Sermon pag. 32. remove this ſtumbling block?</p>
               <p>And withall, ſeeing he profeſſeth to deny the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of a Church-government differing from Magiſtracy, why doth he hold p. 19. that the Independents are not ſo much intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt his Principles as the Presbyterians? Did he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Independents are not ſo much for the <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of a Church-government and Church-cenſures as the Presbyterians? But, ſaith he, <hi>The Independents Church-power ſeems to me to be but doctrinall.</hi> But is their excommunication doctrinall? and do they not hold excommunication to be <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Divino?</hi> Either he had little skill in being perſwaded, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113393:6"/>
ſome others had great skill in perſwading him that the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents Church-power is but doctrinall, and that they are not ſo much intereſted againſt the Eraſtian Principles as the Presbyterians are, as if forſooth the Ordinance of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication (the thing which the Eraſtian way mainly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth) and a Church-government diſtinct from Magiſtracy, were not common to them both.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If the Reverend Brother deny the Inſtitution of Church-cenſures, but aſſent to the Prudence, Why doth he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Zurick</hi> Divines to be ſo much for him? <hi>Maledicis</hi> p. 23. for it was upon prudentiall grounds, and becauſe of the difficulty and (as they conceived) impoſſibility of the thing, that they were againſt it, ſtill acknowledging the Scripturall Warrants for excommunication, as I ſhall ſhew, yea have ſhewed already. So that if Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> will follow them, he muſt rather ſay, <hi>I aſſent to an Inſtitution, I deny a Prudence.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>A confutation of that which Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> hath ſaid againſt Church-government; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo that his laſt Reply is not more but leſſe ſatisfactory then the former, and for the moſt part is but a tergiverſation and fleeing from Arguments brought againſt him, and from making good his own Aſſertions and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, concerning the distinction of Civill and Church-government.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THe Reverend Brother ſaid in his Sermon, <hi>I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſee how two coordinate Governments exempt from ſuperiority and inferiority can be in one State.</hi> To overthrow
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113393:6"/>
this general <hi>Theſis,</hi> I brought ſome Inſtances to the contrary, as the Governments of a <hi>General</hi> and an <hi>Admiral,</hi> of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and a <hi>Father,</hi> of a <hi>Captain</hi> and a <hi>Maſter</hi> in a Ship. He being put to his Vindication, replyeth, <hi>The Commiſſioner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth he did not apply them to the Aſſembly</hi> (I ſaid the General Aſſembly) <hi>and Parliament; yet that was the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie in hand, Male dicis pag.</hi> 5. But by his favour, that was not the controverſie, for he was not ſpeaking particularly againſt the diſtinction of the Government of the General Aſſembly, and of the Government of the Parliament (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he one ſyllable to that purpoſe) but generally againſt the diſtinction of Church Government, and Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and particularly againſt Excommunication, in all which, he excluded Presbyteries as well as General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Wherefore he doth now recede not onely from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending his <hi>Theſis,</hi> but from applying it againſt the power of Presbyteries. And ſo far we are agreed.</p>
               <p>2. I having confuted his Argument grounded on <hi>Pſal. 33. 15. Prov.</hi> 27. 19. He ſhifteth the vindication of it, and ſtill tells me he grounded no Argument on thoſe places, but ſpake <hi>by way of alluſion, Male dicis p.</hi> 6. Now let the Reader judge. His words to the Parliament were theſe, <hi>Might I meaſure others by my ſelf, and I know not why I may not, (God faſhions mens hearts alike; and as in water, face anſwers face, ſo the heart of man to man:) I ingenuouſly profeſſe I have a heart that knows better how to be governed, then govern; I fear an ambitious enſnarement, &amp;c.</hi> This Argument there largely proſecuted, hath no other ground but the parentheſis uſing the words (though not quoting the places) of Scripture. And now forſooth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath ſerved the Parliament well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when being put to make good the ſole confirmation of his Argument, he tells it was but an alluſion. But this is not all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I confuted the whole Argument, drawn from his own heart to the hearts of others, and gave ſeveral Anſwers: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before nor now, hath he offered to make good his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>3. The Reverend Brother cited 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 33. to prove that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113393:7"/>
all Government is either, a Heatheniſh Government, or a Jewiſh Government, or a Church Government. This I denyed, <hi>Becauſe the Government of Generals, Admirals, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors, Sheriffs, is neither a Jewiſh Government, nor a Church Government, nor a Heatheniſh Government.</hi> What ſaith he to this? <hi>I deny it, a Jewiſh General is a Jewiſh Government, &amp;c. Male dicis p.</hi> 6. Deny it: No Sir, you muſt prove (becauſe you are the Affirmer) that a Chriſtian General, a Chriſtian Admiral, are Church Governments. For I deny it: You tell us <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. you are perſwaded it will trouble the whole world to bound Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, the one from the other. You ſhall have them bounded and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ere long, and the World not troubled neither. Mean while you have not made out your aſſertion from 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 33.</p>
               <p>4. The Reverend Brother had cited <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. to prove that the corrective part of Church Government belongs to the Chriſtian Magiſtrate. And now he brings in my Reply thus, that I ſaid he abuſeth the place, <hi>Becauſe ſpiritual cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures belong not to the Civil Magiſtrate:</hi> Which ſaith he, begs the Queſtion, <hi>Male dicis p.</hi> 7. I replyed no ſuch thing upon this Argument: Look my words again. How can the Brother anſwer it, to ſhape Anſwers of his own deviſing, as if they were mine. My Anſwer was, That the Punitive part <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. belongs to all Magiſtrates, whether Chriſtian or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, which he takes notice of in the ſecond place, and bids me prove <hi>That Scripture-Commands belong to Infidels:</hi> Not obſerving that the Queſtion is not of Scripture-Commands, but whether a Duty mentioned in this or that Scripture, may not belong to Infidels. There are two ſort of Duties in Scripture, Some which are duties by the Law of God, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in mans heart at his Creation, ſome Principles and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereof remain in the hearts of all Nations, even In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels by nature; Other Duties are ſuch by vertue of ſpecial Commands given to the Church, which are not contained in the Law of Nature. The firſt ſort (of which the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evil doers mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. is one) belongs to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113393:7"/>
thoſe that are without the Church, as well as thoſe within. The other onely to thoſe that are within.</p>
               <p>5. The Reverend Brother had ſaid in his Sermon; <hi>Of other Governments beſides Magiſtracy, I finde no Inſtitution.</hi> I cited 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 12. 1 Tim. 5. 17. Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17. to prove another Government (yea, the Inſtitution of another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) beſides Magiſtracy. And in my <hi>Nihil Respondes,</hi> I told he had laughed, but had not yet looſed the knot. Now hear his two Anſwers, <hi>Male dicis p. 8. First, for the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, for the Commiſſioner affirms ſo much. Had he ſaid that theſe Texts hold out an Office or Officer already inſtituted, the words would have bourn him out, &amp;c. But the Inſtitution in this place I cannot ſee.</hi> See the like in Maſter <hi>Huſſey, p.</hi> 19. 22. I thank them both. That Scripture which ſuppoſeth an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and holds out an office already inſtituted, ſhall to me (and I am confident to others alſo) prove an Inſtitution; for no Text of Scripture can ſuppoſe or hold out that which is not true: Nay, hath Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> forgotten that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf proved an Inſtitution of Magiſtracy from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2? Yet that Text doth but hold out the office of Magiſtracy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready inſtituted: But the Inſtitution it ſelf is not in that place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> anſwereth to all theſe three Texts. To that 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 12. Them which are over you in the Lord,</hi> he ſaith that theſe words prove not that it is not meant of Magiſtracy. But he takes not the ſtrength of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. My words were, <hi>Here are ſome who are no Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſet over the Theſſalonians in the Lord.</hi> This the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother muſt admit to be a good proof, or otherwiſe ſay, that the Civil Magiſtrates ſet over the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> though they were Heathens, yet were ſet over them in the Lord.</p>
               <p>For that of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. He ſaith it doth not hold out Ruling Elders: Whether it doth hold Ruling Elders or not, doth not at all belong to the preſent Queſtion. It is eaſie to anſwer ſomething, ſo that a man will not tie himſelf to ſpeak to the point. The place was brought by me to prove <hi>another
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113393:8"/>
Government beſide Magiſtracy,</hi> which he denyed. Now ſuppoſe the place to be meant onely of Preaching Elders, yet here is a Rule or Government, <hi>Elders that rule well;</hi> and theſe are no Civil Magiſtrates, but ſuch as <hi>labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> Come on now. <hi>But I will deal clearly,</hi> ſaith the Brother, <hi>theſe Officers are Miniſters, which are inſtituted not here but elſewhere, and theſe are the Rulers here mentioned. And ſo have I looſed the knot.</hi> Now Sir, you ſhall ſee I will not <hi>male dicere,</hi> but <hi>bene dicere.</hi> My bleſſing on you for it. You have at laſt looſed the knot ſo perfectly, that you are come to an agreement with me, in this great point: Which I thus demonſtrate. He that acknowledgeth Miniſters to be inſtituted Rulers, acknowledgeth another inſtituted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſide Magiſtracy. But Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> acknowledgeth Miniſters to be inſtituted Rulers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth another inſtituted Government beſide Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy.</p>
               <p>To the other Texts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. 17. He ſaith nothing againſt my Argument, onely expounds the Rulers to be guides, as Maſter <hi>Huſſey</hi> alſo doth, of which, more elſewhere. Mean while it is certain, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſually taken for a name of higheſt Authority, yea, given to Emperours, for which, ſee learned <hi>Salma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It muſt the rather be a name of Government, and Authority in this place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. becauſe ſubjection and obedience is required. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves.</hi> When the word ſignifieth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſen viae ducem</hi> (and it is very rarely ſo uſed by the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> but frequently and almoſt in innumerable places, they uſe it for a name of Rule and Authority) obedience and ſubjection is not due to ſuch a one <hi>qua talis;</hi> For obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection cannot be <hi>correlata</hi> to the leading of the way, when it is without Authority and Government.</p>
               <p>6. I having charged Maſter <hi>Colemans</hi> doctrine with this conſequence, <hi>That there ought to be neither Suspenſion from the Sacrament, nor Excommunication, nor Ordination, nor
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113393:8"/>
Depoſition of Miniſters, nor receiving of Appeals, except all theſe things be done by the Civil Magiſtrate:</hi> Which things I ſaid, <hi>are moſt of them corrective, and all of them more then Doctrinal.</hi> In ſtead of making anſwer, the Reverend Brother expreſſeth the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which I objected to him thus, <hi>That here are no Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> which is the <hi>Quaeſitum</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Male dicis, pag.</hi> 10. Here again he brings an imagination of his own, both for matter and words, in ſtead of that which I ſaid, and doth not take the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment right. If the Miniſters power be meerly Doctrinal, and Government wholly in the Magiſtrates hands, then all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars enumerated, for inſtance, Suſpenſion from the Sacrament, and the receiving of Appeals (which he muſt not bring under the <hi>Quaeſitum,</hi> except he bring the Ordinance of Parliament under the <hi>Quaeſitum</hi>) ſhall be wholly in the Magiſtrates hand, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhips may not ſuſpend from the Sacrament, Claſſes and Synods may not receive Appeals, which yet by the Ordinance they have power to do. One of the particulars (and but one) the Reverend Brother hath here touched, and it is thus; <hi>For Ordination of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, I ſay it is within the Commiſſion of Teaching, and ſo apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Doctrinal part.</hi> This is the effect of his zeal to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all Eccleſiaſtical Miniſterial power is meerly Doctrinal. But mark the conſequence of it. He that holds Ordination of Miniſters to be within the Commiſſion of Teaching, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the Doctrinal part, muſt hold by conſequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the power of Ordination is given <hi>uni</hi> as well as <hi>unitati,</hi> that is, That every ſingle Miniſter hath power to ordain, as well as the Claſſis. But Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> holds Ordination of Miniſters to be within the Commiſſion of Teaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is clear, becauſe the Commiſſion of Teaching belongs to every ſingle Miniſter; ſo that if the power of Ordination be within that Commiſſion, it muſt needs belong to every ſingle Miniſter, <hi>Quid Reſpondes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. The Reverend Brother having brought an odious Argument againſt me, which did conclude, the Magiſtrate to manage his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for and under the Divel, if not for and under Chriſt. I ſhew his Syllogiſm to have four terms, and therefore worthy to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded. I get now two Replies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This is an errour (if one) in Logick, not Divinity; is it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113393:9"/>
an errour in Divinity to make a Syllogiſm with four terms? Male dicis, pag.</hi> 15. See now if he be a fit man to call others to School, who puts an <hi>If</hi> in this buſineſſe. <hi>If one;</hi> Who did ever doubt of it? And if it be an errour in Divinity to be Fallacious, and to deceive, then it is an errour in Divinity to make a Syllogiſm with four terms, yea, as foul an errour as can be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He admitteth not my diſtinction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of thoſe words <hi>under Chriſt, and for Chriſt.</hi> I ſaid the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt, and for Chriſt, that is, he is ſerviceable to Chriſt: But he is not under Chriſt, nor for Chriſt, as Chriſts Vicegerent <hi>vice Christi,</hi> in Chriſts ſtead as Chriſt is Mediator. The Reverend Brother ſaith, He foreſaw that this would be ſaid (the greater fault it was to make his Argument ſo unclear and undiſtinct) but he rejecteth the diſtinction, as being <hi>diſtinctio ſine differentia. If a Magiſtrate,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be thru far a ſervant of Christ as Mediator, that he is to do his work, to take part with him, to be for his glory; then he doth it vice Chriſti:</hi> He addes the <hi>ſimile</hi> of a ſervant: Hence it follows, by the Reverend Brothers Principles, That the Kings Cook, becauſe he doth work and ſervice for the King, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth it <hi>vice Regis,</hi> and as the Kings Vicegerent: Likewiſe, that a ſervant who obeyeth his Maſters Wife, and executeth her commands, becauſe it is his Maſters will, and for his Maſters honour, doth therefore obey his Maſters Wife <hi>vice Domini,</hi> as his Maſters Vicegerent; and by conſequence, That the duty of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Wife, doth originally belong to the Husband; for the capacity of a Vicegerent, which he hath by his Vicegerentſhip, is primarily the capacity of him whoſe Vicegerent he is. Theſe and the like abſurd conſequences will unadvoidably follow, upon the Reverent Brothers Argumentation, That he who doth Chriſt ſervice, doth it <hi>vice Christi,</hi> as Chriſts Vicegerent; and that to be a mans Vicegerent, and to do a mans work or ſervice (which I made two different things) are all one. But further obſerve his Tergiverſation. I had <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. proved my diſtinction out of theſe words of his own. <hi>The Commiſſioner ſaith Magiſtracy is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Chriſt: I ſay, Magiſtracy is given to Chriſt to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his Kingdom. So that though the Commiſſioners Aſſertion be ſound (which in due place will be diſcuſſed) yet it infringeth nothing that I ſaid.</hi> I asked therefore, <hi>quâ fide</hi> he could confound in his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113393:9"/>
Argument brought againſt me, thoſe two things which himſelf had ſo carefully diſtinguiſhed. There is no Reply to this in <hi>Male dicis.</hi> When the Brother thought it for his advantage, he denied that the Magiſtrate his being ſerviceable to Chriſt, doth infer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of his power by a Commiſſion of Vicegerentſhip from Chriſt (for that was the derivation ſpoken of) and yeelded that the Magiſtrate may be ſaid to be ſerviceable to Chriſt, though his power be not derived from Chriſt. Now he denyeth the very ſame diſtinction for ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>8. Whereas the Reverend Brother had told the Parliament, that he ſeeth not in the whole Bible any one act of that Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which is now in controverſie. I brought ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inſtances againſt his Opinion, not loſing either the Argument from <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. (concerning which, he asketh what is become of it) or other Scriptural Arguments, which I intend by Gods aſſiſtance to proſecute elſewhere. Now hear what is replyed to the Inſtances which were given: Firſt to that 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 13. Put away that wicked perſon from among you;</hi> His anſwer is, <hi>I ſay, and it is ſufficient againſt the Commiſſioner, If this be a Church cenſure, then the whole Church joyntly, and every particular perſon hath power of Church cenſure, Male dicis pag.</hi> 10. I hope Sir, it is not ſufficient againſt me, that you ſay it, ſo long as you ſay nothing to prove it. I told you that Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> himſelf (who holds not that every particular perſon hath power of Church cenſure) acknowledgeth that Text to be a warrant for Excommunication. And when you ſay <hi>every particular perſon,</hi> you ſay more then the Independents ſay; and I am ſure, more then the Text will admit; for the Text ſaith, <hi>Put away from among you:</hi> Therefore this power was given not <hi>uni<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but <hi>unitati.</hi> And this <hi>unitas</hi> was the Presbytery of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the ſentence was inflicted <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>by many, 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 6, it is not ſaid <hi>by all.</hi> I might ſay much for this; but I will not now leave the Argument in hand; for it is enough againſt Maſter <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that the place prove an act of Church Government, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a power, not Civil, but Eccleſiaſtical. To whom the power belonged, is another Queſtion.</p>
               <p>To the next Inſtance from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. (which is coincident with the former) a puniſhment or cenſure inflicted by many. <hi>It is onely a reprehenſion,</hi> ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>which by all the places in the New

                     </gap>an amount no higher then to an objurgation, and ſo it Doctrinal. Anſw.</hi> 1. He made it even now an act of the whole Church joyntly, and of every particular perſon. Why did he not clear himſelf in this, How the whole Church, Men, Women, Children, and all did doctrinally reprehend him? 2. If the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurgation muſt be reſtricted, to whom? Not to a ſingle Miniſter (yet every ſingle Miniſter hath power of Doctrinal Objurgation) but to the Presbytery, it was an act of thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I ſpake of; and this is a ground for that diſtinction between Miniſterial and Presbyterial admonition which Maſter <hi>Coleman, pag.</hi> 22. doth not admit. 3. If it were granted that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this Text amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to no more but an Objurgation. Yet our Argument ſtands good; for the Apoſtle having in his firſt Epiſtle required the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> to put away from among them that wicked perſon, which they did accordingly reſolve to do (which makes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commend their obedience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.) No doubt either the Offender was at this time actually excommunicated and caſt out of the Church, or (as others think) they were about to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him, if the Apoſtle had not by his ſecond Epiſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them, and taken them off with this <hi>Sufficit;</hi> Such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of cenſure is enough, the party is penitent, go no higher. 4 When the Reverend Brother appealeth to all the places in the New Teſtament, he may take notice that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is no where found in the New Teſtament, except in this very Text. And if his meaning be concerning the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he may finde it uſed to expreſſe a Coercive power, as in Chriſts rebuking of the windes and waves, <hi>Matth. 8. 26. Mark</hi> 4. 39.

               </argument>
               <p>MAſter <hi>Colemans</hi> Doctrine was by me charged to be a violation of the ſolemne League and Covenant. This he acknowledged in his <hi>Re-examination,</hi> page 13. 17. to be a very grievous charge, and a greater fault in him then in divers others, if made out: and he deſired ſeriouſly, yea challenged it by the right of a Chriſtian, and by the right of a Miniſter, that I ſhould proſecute this charge; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I did in my <hi>Nihil Reſpondes</hi> proſecute it ſo farre, that by five ſtrong Arguments I did demonſtrate the repugnancy of his Doctrine to the Covenant. About a Moneth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comes out Maſter <hi>Huſſeys</hi> Booke, wherein the charge it ſelfe (before deſired to be proſecuted) is declined ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly by Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> in the few lines by him prefixed (which are ranked together with the <hi>Errata</hi>) in which he deſires that the argumentative part may be ſo proſecuted, as that the charge of Covenant-breaking may be laid aſide, which if it be taken up, he lets me know before-hand it ſhall be eſteemed by them a <hi>Nihil Reſpondes.</hi> It is alſo decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Mr. <hi>Huſſey,</hi> page 15. <hi>The Argument of the Covenant is too low to be thought on in this Diſcourſe: we are now in an higher region then the words of the Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113393:13"/>
my proofe of the charge, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> comes out with his <hi>Maledicis,</hi> and declines both the charge it ſelfe (which he calls An <hi>impertinent charge,</hi> pag. 22.) and my five Arguments too, without ſo much as taking notice of them, or offering replies to them; yea all that I ſaid in my <hi>Nihil Reſpondes,</hi> pag. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. in proſecution of this Argument concerning Covenant-breaking, the Reverend Brother hath skipped over <hi>ſicco pede</hi> in the halfe of one page, <hi>viz.</hi> pag. 23. all that followes is new and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein he did not minde his owne Anſwer to the learned Viewer, pag. 33. <hi>I will keepe you to the Lawes of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and will not anſwer but as it is to the matter in hand,</hi> I leave it to be Judged by men of knowledge and piety, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a one, doth not give them ſome ground to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that he is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is ſelf-judged, who firſt calleth ſo eagerly for making out a charge againſt him, and then when it is made out doth decline the charge, and not anſwer the Arguments; and ſuch as eſteeme the charge of Covenant-breaking to be a <hi>Nihil Reſpondes,</hi> and the Argument of the Covenant too low to be thought on in a controverſie about Church-Government, <hi>O my Soule, come not thou into their ſecret, unto their aſſembly, my glory, be not thou united.</hi> It is in vaine for them to palliat or ſhelter their Covenant-breaking, with appealing from the Covenant to the Scripture, for <hi>ſubordinata non pugnant.</hi> The Covenant is <hi>norma recta, a right rule,</hi> though the Scripture alone be <hi>nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma recti, the rule of right.</hi> If they hold the Covenant to be unlawfull, or to have any thing in it contrary to the Word of God, let them ſpeake out. But to profeſſe the breach of the Covenant to be a grievous and great fault, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a ſevere cenſure, and yet to decline the charge and proofes thereof, is a moſt horrible ſcandall; yea, be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed O yee Heavens at this, and give eare O Earth! how ſmall regard is had to the Oath of God, by men profeſſing the Name of God.</p>
               <p>As for that little which the reverend Brother hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto, Firſt he takes notice of a paſſage of his Sermon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113393:13"/>
at the taking of the Covenant, which I had put him in minde of, but he anſwereth onely to one particular, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning that clauſe, <hi>Doubtleſſe many materialls of Prelacy muſt of neceſſity be retained as abſolutely neceſſary.</hi> I asked what he underſtood by this clauſe? Now obſerve his anſwer. <hi>I anſwer ingenuouſly, as he deſires, and fully, as I conceive, theſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls of Prelacy are Ordination.</hi> Remember you ſaid, <hi>many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls of Prelacy.</hi> I beſeech you Sir, how many is Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Ordination, Ordination, Ordination; tell on till you thinke you have made many materialls; and withall tell us (if this be the meaning, that Ordination ſhould be retained without any power of Eccleſiaſticall Government in the Miniſtery:) how was it imaginable that he could hereby ſatiſfie that ſcruple which then he ſpoke to, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſcruple about the purging away of the exorbitancies of Prelacy, and retaining a regulated Prelacy? And after all this, I ſhall deſire him to expound that other clauſe (which I deſired before, but he hath not done it) <hi>taking away</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the exorbitancies, the remaining will be a new Government, and no Prelacy.</hi> Either he meanes this of a new Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſtinct from the Civill, ſo that the Miniſtery ſhould have new power of Government; or he meant it of the way which now he pleads for. If the former, I have what I would. Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> himſelfe as well as other men took the Covenant, with an intention to have an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Government diſtinct from the Civill. If the latter, then let him anſwer theſe two things. 1. What good ſence there was in applying ſuch an Anſwer to ſuch a Scruple, as if the Eraſtian way, or the appropriating of all Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction wholly to the civill Magiſtrate, could be the way to ſatisfie thoſe who ſcrupled the totall abolition of Prelacy. 2. How will he reconcile himſelfe with himſelfe, for here pag. 22. he ſaith, That his way was in practice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was borne, <hi>and the conſtant practice of</hi> England <hi>alwaies.</hi> This, as it is a moſt notorious untruth (for the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>England</hi> hath granted to the Clergy (as he calls them after the Popiſh Dialect) a power of Depoſition and

Excommunication, whereas his way denies all corrective power, or Church-cenſures to the Miniſtery) ſo if it were a truth, it is utrerly inconſiſtent with that which he ſaid of the remaining part, namely, that it will be a new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it be his way, how will he make it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of <hi>England</hi> alwaies, and a new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too?</p>
               <p>In the next place the Reverend Brother makes ſhort work of my five Arguments, to prove the repugnancy of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the ſolemne League and Covenant. They were too hot for him to be much touched upon, <hi>All is but this much,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>The Covenant mentioneth and ſuppoſeth a diſtinct Church-Government.</hi> It is hard when Arguments are neither repeated nor anſwered. He repeats a Point which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (and but a part of that) but not the proofes. And ſo he anſwereth (rather to the concluſion then to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the expreſſions in the Covenant are according to the generall apprehenſions of the times, which tooke ſuch a thing for granted; yet I beleeve Maſter</hi> Gilleſpie <hi>cannot make ſuch a ſuppoſition obligatory.</hi> Now you yeeld Sir what before you eagerly contended againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Covenant doth ſuppoſe a Church-Government. Remember your <hi>Simile</hi> of the Jury ſworne to enquire into the felony of a Priſoner, which Oath doth not ſuppoſe the Priſoner to be guilty of felony, but he is to be tried, Guilty or not Guilty. We are now ſo farre agreed, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth ſuppoſe a Church-Government diſtinct from the civill Government, and yet not meerly Doctrinall, for that was the point which I proved, and which here he yeelds. As for the obligation of an Oath ſworne upon ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, I anſwer. 1. It is more then ſuppoſed, the words and expreſſions of the Covenant doe plainly hold out the thing as I proved, and as the Reverend Brother ſeemes here to yeeld. 2. That which an Oath doth neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if the Oath be lawfull, and the thing ſuppoſed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is without all controverſie obligatory. Now the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>other doth acknowledge both the Covenant it ſelfe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113393:15"/>
to be a lawfull Oath, and that which the Covenant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, namely a Church-Government diſtinct from the Civill Government, and yet not meerly Doctrinall to be a lawfull thing, for he profeſſeth to yeeld it (though not <hi>Jure divino,</hi> yet) in prudence, which he cannot doe, if he make the thing unlawfull. 3. That which an Oath doth ſuppoſe is ſometimes ſuppoſed <hi>Vi materiae,</hi> or <hi>conſequentiae,</hi> that is, the words of the Oath doe neceſſarily imply ſuch a thing, though it be not intended by the ſwearer; and here I will tell Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> one Story of <hi>Alexander</hi> for another. When <hi>Alexander</hi> was comming againſt a Towne to deſtroy it, he met <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> who (as he underſtood) came to make interceſſion and ſupplication for ſparing the Towne, <hi>Alexander</hi> preventeth him with an Oath, that he would not doe that thing which <hi>Anaximenes</hi> ſhould make petition for, whereupon <hi>Anaximenes</hi> made Petition that he would deſtroy the Towne, <hi>Alexander</hi> found himſelfe bound by the plaine words of his Oath to doe what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and ſo did forbeare. And to adde a divine Story to an humane, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the Princes of Iſrael did ſweare to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> upon a ſuppoſition that was not true, yet they found themſelves tyed by their Oath. So he that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to his owne hurt muſt not change, the Oath being otherwiſe lawfull, Pſal. 15. 4. yet that ſelfe hurt which is wrapped up in the matter of his Oath was not intended in ſwearing. Sometimes againe, that which is ſuppoſed and implyed in an Oath lyeth alſo in the thoughts and intention of thoſe that ſweare. Now where thoſe two are co-incident; that is, where the thing ſuppoſed in an Oath is both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed neceſſarily in the words of the Oath, and is alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the apprehenſions of thoſe that ſweare (which is the caſe here in the Covenant, and is acknowledged by the Reverend Brother) I ſhould thinke it moſt ſtrange how any Divine can have the leaſt doubt concerning the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a thing, except he conceive the thing it ſelfe to be unlawfull.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Anſwer is this, <hi>In my way,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113393:16"/>
Civill and Eccleſiaſticall, are in the ſubject matter clearly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; When the Parliament handles matters of Warre it is a Military Court; when buſineſſe of State, it is a Civill Court; when matters of Religion, it is an Eccleſiaſticall Court.</hi> If this hold good, then it will follow. 1. That the Parliament when they deliberate about matters of Warre, or matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are not (at leaſt formally and properly) a Civill Court; elſe how makes he theſe ſo clearly diſtinct? 2. That Miniſters may be called Civill Officers; for conſider his words in his <hi>Re-examination, pag, 11. I doe not exclude Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, neither from Eccleſiaſticall nor Civill Government, in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall way, doctrinally and declaratively.</hi> Compare this with his preſent Anſwer, it will amount to thus much, That diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent denominations being taken from the different ſubject matter, Miniſters when they handle Doctrinally matters of Religion, are Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters; and when they han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Doctrinally matters of Civill Government, (which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alloweth them to doe,) they are Civill Miniſters. But now to apply his Anſwer to the Argument; How doth all this ſalve the repugnancy of his Doctrine to the Covenant? If he had examined my Arguments, he had found that moſt of them proove from the Covenant, a Church-Government diſtinct from Civill Government, <hi>Suctjective</hi> as well as <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> that is, another Government beſides Magiſtracy; diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Agents, as well as different Acts; different hands, as well as handling of different matters: I know the Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may and ought to have a great influence into matters of Religion; and whatſoever is due to him by the Word of God, or by the Doctrine either of the Antient or Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches; I doe not infringe, but doe maintaine and ſtrengthen it. But the point in hand is, That the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth undeniably ſuppoſe, and clearly hold forth a Government in the Church, diſtinct from Magiſtracy, which is proved by theſe Arguments; (which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they are not yet anſwered, ſo I will briefly apply them to the proofe of that point which now Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> ſticks at,) 1. The Church Government mentioned in the Covenant, is as diſtinct from
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113393:16"/>
the Priviledges of Parliament, as the firſt Article of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is diſtinct from the third Article. 2. The Church-Government in the firſt Article of the Covenant, the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation wherof we are to endeavour, differeth from Church-Government by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. mentioned in the ſecond Article, as much as a thing to be reformed differeth from a thing to be extirpated; ſo that the Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment formerly uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two waies in the Covenant, either <hi>qua</hi> Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo we ſweare to endeavour the Reformation of it, (which I hope was not meant of reforming that part of the Priviledges of Parliament, whereby they meddle with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in a Parliamentary way,) Or, <hi>qua</hi> Church-Government by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. and ſo we ſweare to endeavour the extirpation of it. This difference / betweene the firſt and ſecond Articles, between Reformation and Extirpation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that the Covenant doth ſuppoſe, that the Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment formerly uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in ſo far as it was a Church-Government, is not <hi>eatenus,</hi> to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but in ſo far as it was a corrupt Church-Government, that is, Prelaticall, 3. Church-Government in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is matched with Doctrine, Worſhip, and Catechiſing; Now theſe are ſubjectively different from Civill Government for the Civill Magiſtrate doth not act doctrinally nor cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſtically, neither can he diſpence the Word and Sacraments as Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> acknowledgeth. 4. In the firſt part of the firſt Article of the Covenant, concerning <hi>The preſervation of the Reformed Religion in the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>in Doctrine Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government,</hi> It is uncontroverted, that Diſcipline and Government are Eccleſiaſticall, and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively different from Civill Government, that is, though divers who have a hand in the Civill Government are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders; yet it is as true that divers Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inferiour Civill Courts, are not Church Officers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and of the Miniſtery none are Civill Governours, which makes the two Governments clearly diſtinct <hi>ſubjective.</hi> Now the ſecond part of that Article concerning <hi>the Reformation of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113393:17"/>

We did ſweare to <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Reformation of Religion in the Kingdomes of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches.</hi> Now the Word of God holds forth another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment beſides Magiſtracy; for Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> himſelfe hath acknowledged, that he findes in the New Teſtament Miniſters to be Rulers, yea inſtituted Rulers. And the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the beſt Reformed Churches (without all doubt) lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to an Eccleſiaſticall Government, different from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy. Neither hath the Reverend Brother ſo much as once adventured to alledge the contrary, except of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which as it heterogeneous, (being none of the Reformed Churches mentioned in the Covenant) ſo it ſhall be diſcuſſed in due place. From all which reaſons I conclude, that the wit of man cannot reconcile Maſter <hi>Colemans</hi> Doctrine with the Covenant. I adde, 6. A confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of him out of himſelfe thus. No ſuch Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> caſts upon an uncertainty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Word hold out any ſuch thing, can be by his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the power of Magiſtracy in things Eccleſiaſticall, but another Government beſide Magiſtracy. But the Church-Government mentioned in the firſt Article of the Covenant, is ſuch a Church-Government as Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> caſts upon an uncertainty, whether the Word hold out any ſuch thing. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church-Government mentioned in the firſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Covenant, cannot be by his Principles the power of Magiſtracy, but another Government beſide Magiſtracy;

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that ſame Epiſtle to the Parliament, pag. 4. he hath this paſſage; <hi>Will-worſhip is unlawfull, I meane in matters that are eſſentiall to Gods Worſhip, which are matters of duty, as for circumſtantials of time and place (except the Sabbath) which are matters of liberty, in theſe the Common-wealth may Vote, &amp;c, and this is your chriſtian liberty, that in matters of liberty yee make Rules and Lawes to your ſelves, not croſſing the ends that you are tyed to in duty.</hi> And is the Sabbath onely a circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall of time <hi>contra</hi>-diſtinct from matters of duty? It ſeemes he will cry downe not onely the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſures with the Eraſtians, but the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath with the Canterburians. And if Will-worſhip be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull onely in the eſſentialls of Gods Worſhip, why was the Argument of Will-worſhip ſo much toſſed, not onely between Prelates and Non-Conformiſts, but between Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Proteſtants, even in reference to Ceremonies? And whether hath not Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> here ingaged himſelfe to hold it free and lawfull to the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, yea to private Chriſtians (for he calls it Chriſtian liberty, not Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary liberty: now Chriſtian liberty belongs to all ſorts of Chriſtians) to make Lawes to themſelves for taking the Sacrament anniverſarily on Chriſtmaſſe, Good-Friday, and Eaſter, or to appoint a perpetuall Monethly Faſt, or Thankſgiving: yea another Parliament may (if ſo it ſhould ſeeme good to them) impoſe againe the Surplice and Croſſe in Baptiſme, Fonts, Railing of Communion Tables, the reading of divers paſſages of Apocrypha to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Doxologies, Anthems, Reſponſories, &amp;c. as heretofore they were uſed: or they may appoint all and every one to ſit in the Church with their faces toward the Eaſt, to ſtand up at the Epiſtles and Goſpels, &amp;c. yea what Ceremonies, Jewiſh, Popiſh, Heatheniſh, may they not impoſe, provided
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113393:18"/>
they onely hold the foundation, and keepe to thoſe eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials which he calls matters of duty: by reſtraining the unlawfulneſſe of Will-worſhip to the eſſentialls, he leaves men free to doe any thing in Religion, <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Huſſey,</hi> ibid. pag, 4. 5. ſaith, That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may require ſuch as they receive for Preachers of truth, <hi>to ſend out able men to ſupply the places, and that without any regard to the allowance or diſ-allowance of the people.</hi> Where in the firſt part of that which he ſaith, there is either a Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodoxie, or a controdiction. A heterodoxie, if he meane that Miniſters are to be ſent out without Ordination: a contradiction, if he meane that they muſt be Ordained; for then he gives Claſſes, a worke which is not meerly Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. But moſt ſtrange it is, that he ſo farre departeth from Proteſtant Divines in point of the Churches liberty in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Miniſters, He tells us, pag. 14. that Mr. <hi>Herle for want of skill and Theologicall Diſputations</hi> hath granted to people a right to chuſe their Miniſter. Maſter <hi>Herles</hi> skill both <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall</hi> and <hi>Theologicall</hi> is greater then it ſeemes he can well Judge of: neither can this bold arrogant cenſure of his derogate from Mr. <hi>Herles</hi> but from his owne reputation. For the matter it ſelfe, it is one and not the leaſt of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies between the Papiſts and Proteſtants, what right the Church hath in the Vocation of Miniſters, Read <hi>Bellarmine de cleric.</hi> and thoſe that writ againſt him, and ſee whether it be not ſo. The <hi>Helvetick</hi> confeſſion tells us that the right chuſing of Miniſters is by the conſent of the Church, and the <hi>Belgick</hi> confeſſion ſaith, <hi>We beleeve that the Miniſters, Seniors and Deacons, ought to be called to thoſe their Functions, and by the lawfull elections of the Church to be advanced into thoſe roomes.</hi> See both theſe in the <hi>Harmony of Confeſſions, Sect.</hi> 11. I might here (if it were requiſite) bring a heape of Teſtimonies from Proteſtant Writers, the leaſt thing which they can admit of is, that a Miniſter be not obtruded <hi>renitente Eccleſia, Factum valet, fieri non debet.</hi> It may be helped after it is done, without making <hi>null</hi> or void the Miniſtery:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113393:19"/>
but in a well conſtituted Church there ought to be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion into the Miniſtery, the Churches conſent is requiſite, for which alſo I might bring both Scripture and Antiquity: but that is not my preſent buſineſſe. One thing I muſt needs put Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> in minde of, that when the Prelates did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude Miniſters without any regard to the diſ-allowance of the people, it was cried out againſt as an oppreſſion and uſurpation: And we are often warned by Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> and by my ſelfe, to caſt away the Prelates uſurpation with themſelves. But who Lords it now over the Lords inheritance, the Presbyterians or the Eraſtians? Nay he who will have Miniſters put in churches <hi>without any regard to the allowance or diſ-allowance of people,</hi> falls farre ſhort of divers Prelaticall men, who did much commend the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient primitive forme of calling Miniſters, not without the churches conſent. See Dr. <hi>Field of the Church, lib. 5. cap. 54. Bilſon de gubern Eccl. cap. 15. pag.</hi> 417. The Author of <hi>the Hiſtory of Epic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Maſter <hi>Huſſey, Epiſt.</hi> pag. 7. ſaith, That upon further conſideration he found <hi>the Miniſter charged onely with Preaching, and Baptizing.</hi> The like he hath afterwards, pag. 39. <hi>Let any man prove that a Miniſter hath any more to doe from Chriſt then to teach and baptize.</hi> And againe, pag. 44. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this Quaere, <hi>Whether Chriſt gave any more Government,</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid any more to doe, for Preaching and Baptizing are not acts of Government) <hi>then is contained in Preaching and Baptizing,</hi> and he holds the negative. If only Preaching and Baptizing, then not praying, and reading in the Congregation, miniſtring the Lords Supper, viſiting the Sick and particular families.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He holdeth, pag. 20. that a Heathen Magiſtrate is unlawfull, <hi>and for his government, if ſinne be lawfull, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> A groſſe heterodoxie. The Apoſtle exhorteth to be ſubject even to Heathen Magiſtrates, Rom. 13. (for there were no other at that time) and to pray for them, 1 Tim. 2. ſo that by Mr. <hi>Hu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſeys</hi> Divinity the Apoſtle would have men to be ſubject untoa and to pray for an unlawfull Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is an An baptiſticall Tenent that an Heathen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is not from God: which <hi>Gerhard de Magiſtratu po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> pag. 498. 499. fully confutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:113393:19"/>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> he ſaith of Chriſt, pag. 40. <hi>He doth nothing as Mediator, which he doth not as God, or as man.</hi> It is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous miſtake; for take the worke of Mediation it ſelfe, he neither doth it as God, nor as man, but as God-man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He ſaith, pag. 35. <hi>Nothing can be ſaid of Chriſt as ſecond Perſon in Trinity in oppoſition to Mediator, but in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to man there may.</hi> So that he will not admit of this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; Chriſt as the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity is equall and conſubſtantiall to the Father, but as Mediator he is not equall to his Father, but leſſe then his Father, and ſubject and ſubordinate to his Father; a diſtinction uſed by our Divines againſt the Antitrinitarians and Socinians. Now by his not admitting of this diſtinction, he doth by conſequence myre himſelfe in Socinianiſme, for Chriſt as Mediator is the Fathers ſervant, Iſa 42. 1. and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater then he, Joh. 14. 28. and as the head of the man is Chriſt, ſo the head of Chriſt is God, 1 Cor. 11. 3. If therefore it cannot be ſaid of Chriſt as he is the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, that his Father is not greater then he, and that he is not ſubordinate to God as his head, then fare-well Anti-Socinianiſme. I dare boldly ſay, it is impoſſible to confute the Socinians, or to aſſert the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God-head of Jeſus Chriſt, except ſomewhat be affirmed of him as the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, which muſt be denied of him as he is Mediator, and ſomething be denied of him as he is the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, which muſt be affirmed of him as he is Mediator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> He ſaith, pag. 36. That Chriſt <hi>by his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath obtained from the Father that he ſhall not Judge any man according to rigor, but as they are in or out of Chriſt; all deferring of Judgement from the wicked is in and for Chriſt, which otherwiſe the Juſtice of God would not allow.</hi> Then Chriſt did thus farre make ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God in the behalfe of the wicked, and dye for them, that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be deferred from them: and thus farre performe Acts of Mediation for the Savages, and Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and for them that never heard the Goſpell, that by ſuch Mediation he hath obtained of the Father that they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113393:20"/>
ſhall be Judged not according to rigour, but by the Goſpel. Which intimateth that Chriſt hath taken away all their ſinnes againſt the Law, ſo that all men ſhall now goe upon a new ſcore, and none ſhall be condemned or Judged by the Law, but by the Goſpell onely; for if Chriſt have not taken away their ſinnes againſt the Law, the Juſtice of God will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udge them according to the rigour of the Law. Muſt not every jot of the Law be fulfilled? and is there not a neceſſity that every one underlye the cuſre and rigour of the Law, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e that the Mediator hath underlyed it for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> He propounds this <hi>Quere, pag. 44. Whether Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have any right to thoſe Priviledges which are given to the Church, more then another Chriſtian;</hi> and he holds the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. Now the Preaching of the Word, and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, the power of the Keyes are Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges given to the Church, that is for the Churches good, <hi>For all things are yours,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, &amp;c. c. 1 Cor. 3. 21, 22. Therefore by Mr. <hi>Huſſeys</hi> Divinity, any other Chriſtian hath as much right to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Word, Sacraments, Keys, as the Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Come on now to Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> errours in Divinity, not to repeat what was expreſſed in my <hi>Nihil Reſpondes,</hi> but to take off the <hi>Maledicis</hi> in the maine points.</p>
               <p>The <hi>tenth,</hi> Heterodoxie ſhall therefore be this, That whatſoever is given to Chriſt, he hath it not as the eternall Son of God. Into this ditch did Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> firſt fall, and then Mr. <hi>Huſſey,</hi> pag. 25. after him. I ſaid this Tenent lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to a blaſphemous Hereſie. For the better underſtanding whereof let it be remembred what I did premiſe in my <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil Reſpondes, pag.</hi> 11. in reply to his Propoſition, <hi>That which is given to Chriſt he hath it not as God. This</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>is in oppoſition to what I ſaid, pag. 45. concerning the Headſhip and Dignity of Chriſt, as the naturall Son of God, the Image of the inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> without taking the leaſt notice of that which I did purpoſely and plainly premiſe, begins
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113393:20"/>
to ſpeake of <hi>God eſſentially,</hi> and that if ſomething ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be given to Chriſt as God, then ſomething may be gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven to God, and then God is not abſolutely perfect, &amp;c <hi>Maledicis,</hi> pag. 13. 14. Thus he turneth over to the Eſſence and Nature of God, what I ſpake of the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, or of Chriſt as he is the eternall Son of God. Was not the Queſtion between him and me, Whether the Kingdome and Dominion over all things may be ſaid to be given to Chriſt, as he is the eternall Son of God? This is the point which he did argue againſt, becauſe it takes off his Argument firſt brought to prove that all Government even civill is given to Chriſt, as he is Mediator. And ſtill from the beginning I ſpake of Chriſt as the ſecond perſon in Trinity, or the eternall Sonne of God. Thus therefore the caſe ſtands; The Reverend Brother to prove that an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Soveraignty and Government over all things is given to Chriſt, as he is Mediator; and to confute my Aſſertion, that it is given to Chriſt as he is the eternall Sonne of God, doth frame this Argument againſt me, <hi>That which is given to Chriſt he hath it not as God. But here dignity is given to Chriſt. Therefore not here to be taken as God.</hi> Where there is more in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then in the Premiſſes, for the concluſion which naturally followes had been this, Therefore Chriſt hath not here dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as God. It ſeemes he was aſhamed of the concluſion, yet not of the premiſſes which inferre the concluſion. But this by the way. I ſpeake to his Propoſition; <hi>That which is given to Chriſt he hath it not as God.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>as God,</hi> either he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>perſonally,</hi> that is, either in regard of the nature and eſſence of God, which is common to the Sonne of God, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, and in reſpect whereof they three are one, or in regard of the perſon of the Word, as Chriſt is the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, and perſonally diſtinct from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt. If in the former ſenſe, then he muſt lay aſide his whole Argument, as utterly impertinent, and making nothing at all againſt my <hi>Theſes,</hi> which affirmed that an Univerſall Dominion and Kingdome over all things is given to Chriſt, not as he is Mediator, (in which capacity
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113393:21"/>
he is onely King of the Church,) but as he is the Eternall Sonne of God. In oppoſing of which Aſſertion, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother was before <hi>Nihil Reſpondens,</hi> ſo now he is twice nought. But if in the other ſenſe he underſtands his Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (which I muſt needs ſuppoſe he doth, it being in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to what I ſaid,) then I ſtill averre his Propoſition will inferre a blaſphemous hereſie, as I proved before by a cleare demonſtration. That which is given to Chriſt, he hath it not as God. But life, glory, &amp;c. is given to Chriſt; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt hath not life, glory, &amp;c. as God. The Reverend Brother ſaith, <hi>I acknowledge the concluſion unſound, and I deny not but that the Major is mine owne, and the Minor is the very Scripture.</hi> Yet he denies the concluſion, and cleares himſelfe by this <hi>ſimile, That which was given this poore man, he had not before, but a ſhilling was given this poore man:</hi> Ergo, <hi>He had not a ſhilling before. Where both Propoſitions are true, yet the concluſion is falſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the axiome, Ex veris nil niſi verum.</hi> You are extreamly out Sir, your Syllogiſme of the poore man is <hi>fallacia ab am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibolia.</hi> The Major of it is ambiguous, dubious, and fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and cannot be admitted without a diſtinction. But here you acknowledge the Major of my Argument to be your owne, and ſo not fallacious in your opinion. You acknowledge the Minor to be Scripture. You have not found foure termes in my Premiſſes, nor charged my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor or Minor with the leaſt fault in matter or forme, and yet forſooth you denie the Concluſion, and doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that uncontrovertible Maxime in Logick, <hi>Ex veris nil</hi>

                     </gap>uid be gathered from true Premiſſes.</hi> Now let us heare what he would ſay againſt my Concluſion; it is concerning the ſenſe of the word <hi>hath, For hath,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by me is uſed for receiving or having by vertue of the gift, but by him for having fundamentally, originally.</hi> You are ſtill out Sir; I take it juſt as you take it; for though the Sonne of God, as God eſſentially, or in reſpect of the nature and eſſence of God, which is common to all three Perſons in the bleſſed Trinity, hath originally of himſelfe a Kingdome
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113393:21"/>
and Dominion over all, yet as he is the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, begotten of, and diſtinct from the Father, he hath the Kingdome and Dominion over all, not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but by vertue of the gift of his Father. So that the Reverend Brother is ſtill <hi>Nihil Reſpondens,</hi> and therefore he ſhall be concluded in this Syllogiſme. He who holds that whatſoever is given to Chriſt, he hath it not by vertue of the gift, as he is the eternall Sonne of God, or ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity, but onely as Mediator; he holds by conſequence, that Chriſt hath not glory by vertue of his Fathers gift, as he is the eternall Sonne of God, or ſecond Perſon in the Trinity. But Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> holds the former, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> holds the latter. The conſequence in the Propoſition is proved from <hi>Joh. 7. 22. The glory which thou gaveſt me.</hi> The aſſumption he will owne, or elſe quit his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt my diſtinction of the double Kingdome gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt, as the eternall Sonne of God, and as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The concluſion which followes is hereticall; for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Nicen</hi> Creed ſaid that Chriſt in regard of his eternall generation, that he is <hi>Deus de Deo, Lumen de Lumine, God of God, Light of Light;</hi> Maſter <hi>Colemans</hi> argument will infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e that he is not onely <hi>ex ſeipſo Deus,</hi> but <hi>ex ſeipſo filius;</hi> and ſo denie the eternall generation of the Sonne of God, and the communication of the Godhead, and the Soveraignty, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Attributes thereof, from the Father to the Sonne. For if Chriſt, as he is the eternall Sonne of God, hath not glory by vertue of his Fathers Gift, then he hath it not by vertue of the eternall generation and communication, but fundamentally and originally of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>As for the other branch of Maſter <hi>Colemans</hi> Argument, tending to prove, that Chriſt as he is the eternall Sonne of God cannot be given, which he indeavours to vindicate, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. 15. I anſwer theſe two things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Granting all that he ſaith, he concludes nothing againſt me, for I did from the beginning expound thoſe words, <hi>Eph. 1. 22. And gave him to be the head over all things to the church,</hi> in this ſence, that Chriſt as Mediator is given on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Church, to be her head, but he that is given as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113393:22"/>
to the Church, is <hi>over all.</hi> So that the giving of Chriſt there ſpoken of, is as Mediator, and he is given to the Church only, which I cleared by the Syriak, <hi>And him who is over all, he gave to be the head to the church.</hi> But his being over all, there ſpoken of, if underſtood of glory, dignity, excellency over all, ſo Chriſt is over all as Mediator, (yea in regard of the exaltation of his humane nature,) and this helpeth not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Coleman,</hi> who intends to prove from that place, That all Government, even Civill, is given to Chriſt as Mediator. But if underſtood of a Kingdome and Government, over all, ſo he is over all as he is the eternall Sonne of God, or ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, and not as Mediator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Queſtion which the Reverend Brother fals upon, concerning the perſonall inhabitation of the Holy Ghoſt, will never follow from any thing which I ſaid, more then Gods giving of his Sonne to us, will inferre a perſonall inhabitation of the Sonne of God in us. That which I ſaid was to this intent, That both the Sonne of God and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt are given, not as God eſſentially; that is, in reſpect of the Godhead it ſelf, or as they are one in nature with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (for ſo the Father that giveth, and the Holy Ghoſt which is given, could not be diſtinguiſhed) but the Sonne is given as the Sonne proceeding from the Father; and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is given as the Holy Ghoſt proceeding and ſent from the Father and the Sonne; whether he be given to dwell perſonally in us, or by his gracious operations onely, is another queſtion, which hath nothing to doe with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent argument, and therefore I will not be led out of my way.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eleventh</hi> Heterodoxy is this, <hi>I ſee an abſurdity to hold that every man in authority is either Chriſts Vicegerent, or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velo Maledicis, pag.</hi> 16. Here I make this inference; Heathen and Infidell Magiſtrates, either they are not men in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or 2. They are Chriſts Vicegerents; or 3. They are the Divels <hi>Maledicis.</hi> If he ſay they are not men in authority, he ſhall contradict the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who cals them Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. and men in activity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. ſpeaking in reference even to the Magiſtrates of that time, which were
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113393:22"/>
Infidels. If he ſay they are Chriſts Vicegerents, Then 1. I muſt ſay, that Chriſt as Mediator reignes without the Church, and is a King to thoſe to whom he is neither Prieſt nor Prophet. 2. He muſt finde a Commiſſion given by Chriſt to the Infidell Magiſtrate. 3. Whom in authority will he make to be the Divels Vicegerents, if Infidell Magiſtrates be Chriſts Vicegerents? If he ſay that they are the Divels Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents, then it followes, 1. That they who reſiſt the Divels Vicegerent, reſiſt the Ordinance of God, for they that reſiſt an Infidell Magiſtrate and doe not ſubmit to his lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, (which his Infidelity takes not away,) is ſaid <hi>Rom. 13. v.</hi> 2. to reſiſt the Ordinance of God. 2. That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bade pray for the Divels Vicegerent, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. The Reverend Brother doth but more and more winde himſelfe into a lab erinth of errors, while he endeavours to take away the diſtinction of the two fold Kingdome, and the two fold Vicegerentſhip of God and of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>twelfth</hi> Heterodoxy followeth; <hi>Now it is true, that Chriſt being God as well as man, hath of himſelfe originally as God, whatſoever he hath by vertue of gift as Mediator Maledicis, pag.</hi> 13. Now ſubſume, Chriſt hath by vertue of gift, as Mediator, the Prieſtly office. <hi>Ergo,</hi> By Maſter <hi>Colemans</hi> Principles, Chriſt hath of himſelfe originally as God, the Prieſtly office. And if Chriſt hath it of himſelfe originally as God, then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt hath it alſo; ſo that by his Doctrine the Father and the Holy Ghoſt ſhall be the Prieſts of the Church as well as Chriſt, for Chriſt hath nothing of himſelf originally as God, which the Father and the Holy Ghoſt have not likewiſe.</p>
               <p>The thirdteenth &amp; laſt errour concerneth the office of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. Not onely a Widow but a Deacon is denyed to be a Church-Officer, or to have any warrant from Scripture. <hi>I hold not a Widow a Church-Officer,</hi> ſaith he: <hi>no more doe I a Deacon; both having a like foundation in Scripture, which truly is none at all. Maledicis,</hi> pag. 9. If this was his opinion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, why did he not in ſo maine a point enter his diſſent from the Votes of the Aſſembly concerning Deacons, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Reaſons? Well, his opinion is ſo now,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113393:23"/>
whereby he runneth contrary not onely to the reformed Churches (which it ſeemes weigh not much in his bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance) but to the plaine Scripture which ſpeakes of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Deacon, 1 Tim. 3. 10. and this could be no civill Office, but an Eccleſiaſticall Office, for the Deacons were choſen by the Church, were ordained with Prayer, and laying on of hands, and their charge was to take ſpeciall care of the poore, all which is cleare, Act. 6. If he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us the grounds of his Opinion, he ſhould have heard more againſt it.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> MAſter <hi>Coleman</hi> in his <hi>Re-examination,</hi> page 14 makes the Parliament to be Church-Governours, and Church-Officers to the whole Kingdome. It was an Argument uſed againſt the Prelates that Eccleſiaſticall and civill Government, Spirituall and Secular adminiſtrations are inconſiſtent in the ſame Perſons, either of which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the whole man. It was another exception againſt the Prelate that he aſſumed the power of Church-Government, and Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction over the whole Dioceſſe, which was much more then he could diſcharge. How will Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> avoid the involving the Parliament into Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall guiltineſſe, by his Principles, which we avoyd by ours?</p>
               <p>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Prelates ſought great things for themſelves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to purge the Church of ſcandalls. What other thing was it when Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> in his third Rule, inſtead of exhorting to the purging the Church, called onely for learning and competency, and told it out, that this will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113393:23"/>
                  <hi>get us an able Miniſtery, and procure us honour enough.</hi> Maſter <hi>Huſſey</hi> in his Epiſtle to my ſelfe tells me, that our attending on reading Exhortation and Doctrine (without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) will obtaine the Magiſtrates love, <hi>more honour, more maintenance:</hi> ſomething for ſhame he behooved to adde of the puniſhing of ſinne, (yet he will not have the Miniſter called from his Study to be troubled or to take any paines in Diſcipline) but behold the love of the Magiſtrate, more honour, and more maintenance are ſtrong ingredients in the Eraſtian Electuary.</p>
               <p>3 Maſter <hi>Huſſey</hi> will have Miniſters placed <hi>without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the allowance or diſ-all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>4 The Prelates were great enemies to ruling Elders. So are Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> who acknowledge no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Word of God for that calling, nor admit of any ruling Elders who are not Magiſtrates. A diſtinction which was uſed by <hi>Saravia</hi> and <hi>Bilſon</hi> in reference to the Jewiſh Elders, and by Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> in reference to the Elders of the ancient Church, who were not Preaching Elders. <hi>Aſſert. of Epiſcop. by divine right,</hi> pag. 208, 209, 221. And now forſooth Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Parliament doth earneſtly beſeech them to <hi>ſet up Claſſes conſiſting onely of Miniſters, whoſe worke ſhould be onely to Preach the Word, &amp;c.</hi> Such Claſſes I dare ſay the Prelates themſelves will admit of. Sure the Scottiſh Prelates, when they were at their higheſt yeelded as much.</p>
               <p>5 Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> hold that ruling Elders and a Church-Government diſtinct from the civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the times of Perſecution and under Pagan Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, can be no warrant for the like where the State is Chriſtian. This plea for Chriſtian Magiſtracy was Biſhop <hi>Whitgifts</hi> plea againſt the ruling Elders. <hi>Anſw. to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. pag.</hi> 114.</p>
               <p>6 Maſter <hi>Huſſey,</hi> pag. 22. ſaith, that granting the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Corinthian to be Excommunicated, <hi>the decree was</hi> Pauls, <hi>and not the Corinthians,</hi> and that it no way appertained to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113393:24"/>
them under the notion of a Church. This is <hi>Saravia</hi> his anſwer to <hi>Beza, De tripl. Epiſt. genere, pag.</hi> 42, 43: yea the Papiſts anſwer to Proteſtant Writers, by which they would hold up the Authority and ſole Juriſdiction of the Prelates (as the Apoſtles ſucceſſors) to Excommunicate.</p>
               <p>They doe not more agree with the Prelaticall Principles, then they differ from the Votes and Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the other point that I have here undertaken to diſcover; and I ſhall doe it by the particular inſtances following:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Ordinance of the Lords and Commons aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament for the calling of an Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines beginneth thus: <hi>Whereas among the infinite bleſſings of Almighty God upon this Nation, none is, or can be more deare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us then the purity of our Religion, and for that as yet many things remaine in the Liturgie, Diſcipline, and Government of the Church, which doe neceſſarily require a further and more perfect Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then as yet hath been attained: And whereas it hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and reſolved by the Lords and Commons aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>embled in Parliament, that the preſent Church-Government by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. is evill and juſtly offenſive, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that therefore they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the ſame ſhall be taken away, and that ſuch a Government ſhall be ſetled in the Church, as may be moſt agreeable to Gods holy Word, and moſt apt to procure and preſerve the peace of the Church at home, and nearer agreement with the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and other reformed Churches abroad.</hi> Afterward it was reſolved and Voted in both the Honourable Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and ſent as one of the Propoſitions to the Treaty at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge, That many particular Congregations ſhall be under one Presbyteriall Government.</hi> Now therefore what can be more contrary to the Votes and Ordinances of Parliament, then that which Mr: <hi>Coleman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> hold, that there ought to be no Eccleſiaſticall Government, beſide ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtracy, except we pleaſe to take Preaching and Baptiſme under the name of Government, as if forſooth the Parliament had meant by Presbyteriall Government, Parliamentary Government; or as if by the purity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in point of the Diſcipline of Government of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:113393:24"/>
Church they had intended nothing but their civill rights and priviledges, or as if the wiſe and Honourable Houſes had underſtood themſelves no better then to intend that for a nearer agreement with the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other reformed Churches, which is the wideſt difference from them, to wit, the Eraſtian way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the ſame Ordinance of Parliament for the calling of an Aſſembly of Divines, it is Ordained, that the Aſſembly after conferring and treating among themſelves touching the Lyturgie, Diſcipline, and Government of the Church, or vindication and clearing of the Doctrine of the ſame, ſhall deliver their opinions or advices of or touching the matters aforeſaid to both or either of the Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, yet Mr. <hi>Huſſey Epiſt. to the Parliament, pag.</hi> 3. 6. will not have Claſſes and Aſſemblies to put any thing to the Vote, but to hold on the Diſputes till all end in accord, and in unanimous conſent of the whole Clergy. But how can the Aſſembly after Diſputes, expreſſe their ſence, and deliver their opinions and advice to the Parliament, as they are required, except they doe it by putting to the Vote. Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> himſelfe hath conſented, yea ſometime called to put things to the Vote. And as for Claſſes, will any man imagine that when both Houſes of Parliament did Vote <hi>that many particular Congregations ſhall be under one Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> their meaning was that the Claſſicall Presbitery ſhall onely Schoole-wiſe Diſpute, and put nothing to the Vote: Or that the Claſſicall Presbitery ſhall in common diſpence the Word and Sacraments to many Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that either the Claſſicall Presbitery ſhall goe to the ſeverall Congregations ſucceſſively, or the many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations come to the Claſſicall Presbitery, for Preaching and Baptizing? I admire what opinion Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> can have of the Parliamentary Vote concerning Presbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Huſſey, Epist. to the Parliament, pag.</hi> 4, 5. will have Miniſters placed <hi>without any regard to the allowance and diſ-allowance of the people,</hi> yet the Ordinance of Parliament for giving power to Claſſicall Presbyteries to ordaine Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113393:25"/>
doth appoint that he who is examined and approved by the Presbitery ſhall be <hi>ſent to the Church or other place where he is to ſerve (if it may be done with ſafety and conveniency) there to Preach three ſeverall daies, and to converſe with the people, that they may have triall of his gifts for their edification, and may have time and leaſure to enquire into, and the better to know his life and converſation:</hi> after which the Ordinance appointeth publike notice to be given, and a day ſet to the Congregation, to put in what exceptions they have againſt him,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> in that Epiſtle to the Parliament, pag. 5. ſaith, <hi>Oh that this Honourable Court would haſten to ſet up Claſſes conſiſting onely of Miniſters, whoſe worke ſhould be onely to Preach the Word, and weekly meet in Schooles of Divinity.</hi> Here's a double contradiction to the Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for in the directions of the Lords and Commons for chuſing of ruling Elders, and ſpeedy ſetling of Presbyteriall Government, it is appointed that ruling Elders ſhall be Members both of Claſſes and Synodicall Aſſemblies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Miniſters of the Word. Againe, the Ordinance about ſuſpenſion of ſcandalous Perſons from the Sacrament appointeth other work to Claſſes, beſide Preaching and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, namely the receiving and judging of appeales from the Congregationall Elderſhip. Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> in <hi>Maledicis,</hi> pag. 12. profeſſeth that he excludeth ruling Elders from Church Government, yet he can hardly be ignorant that as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament hath Voted, <hi>That many particular Congregations ſhall be under one Presbyteriall Government;</hi> ſo their Votes doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that Government to Paſtors and ruling Elders jointly.</p>
               <p>I will not here repeat the particulars wherein I ſhewed in my <hi>Nihil Reſpondes</hi> that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> hath abuſed the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſes of Parliament, unto which particulars he hath anſwered as good as nothing. The Honourable Houſes in their wiſedome will ſoone obſerve, whether ſuch men, whoſe avou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He may remember the firſt accuſation was made by himſelf, when in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Parliament, he did flatly impute to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners from the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a great part of the fault of hindering Union in the Aſſembly of Divines, as having come byaſſed with a Nationall determination: his Doctrine alſo at that time being ſuch, as did not onely reflect upon the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but tend to the ſubverſion of the Covenant in one principall Point, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there can be ſmall or no hopes of attaining the other ends of the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Since that time he did in his <hi>Re-examination,</hi> and now again in his <hi>Maledicis</hi> fall foully upon the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not onely by groſſe miſtakes and miſrepreſentations of our way, but by moſt groundleſſe aſperſions, and moſt uncharitable and unjuſt calumnies. I am ſure I am not ſo much a ſtranger to his Doctrine as he is to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which notwithſtanding he boldly ſpeaks his pleaſure, in divers particulars which he will never be able to make good.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He hath aſperſed that Church in the Point of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous communicating. This I confuted in my <hi>Nihil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondes,</hi> and told him both of the order of the Church, and practice of conſcientious Miniſters to the contrary. Now
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113393:26"/>
what replieth he? <hi>Firſt, This refining work, I think, is not one yeer old in</hi> Scotland, <hi>or much more; I was lately informed that in</hi> Edinbrugh <hi>it is begun: whether anywhere elſe I know not. Maledicis</hi> pag. 20. Are not theſe now good grounds of cenſuring and aſperſing a Reformed Church, (whoſe name hath been as precious ointment among other Churches abroad) <hi>I think, I was informed, whether it be otherwiſe I know not?</hi> He will ſit in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> and tell the world what he imagines or hears of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth muſt be taken for a truth. Yet there was both Rules and Practice in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for debarring igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſcandalous perſons from the Sacrament, before he was born: though all was put out of courſe under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſaith the Reverend Brother, <hi>It is not a very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, ſin-cenſuring, and Church-refining Government, under which after fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Maledicis</hi> pag. 20. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is notoriouſly falſe that there hath been fourſcore yeers conſtant practice of Presbyteriall Government in <hi>Scotland:</hi> for the Prelats there, were above thirty yeers ſtanding. 2. <hi>Shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day, or ſhall a Nation be born at once?</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 8. It is no eaſie matter to get a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purged of ignorant and ſcandalous perſons. 3. He may take notice that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> almoſt in all his Epiſtles, maketh mention of ſcandalous perſons among thoſe to whom he wrote, warning them not to have fellowſhip with ſuch, to note them, to avoid them. If the Apoſtolick Churches were not free of ſuch, what great marvel if we be not? 4. Before he objected promiſcuous communicating. This being cleared to be a calumny, now he objecteth that there are ſuch as are unfit to communicate. But while he thus ſeeketh a quarrel againſt Church-government, he doth upon the matter quarrel the preaching of the Goſpel it ſelf. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e that imputeth it as a fault to the Church-government
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113393:26"/>
that there are ſtill divers thouſands, who by reaſon of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ſcandal, are unfit to communicate, doth by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, yea much more, impute it as a fault to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countreys, Switzerland, Swede, Poland,</hi> that in all theſe and other Reformed Churches after four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeers conſtant Preaching of the Goſpel (which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God to turn unconverted and unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God) there are not onely divers thouſands, but divers millions who by reaſon of ignorance or ſcandal, are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to communicate. If the Word do not open the eyes of the ignorant, and convert the ſcandalous, what marvel that Church-Government cannot do it? Church-Government is not an illuminating and regenerating Ordinance as the Word is. But this Church-Government can and will do, yea hath done where it is duly executed; It is a moſt bleſſed means for keeping the Ordinances from viſible and known pollution, which doth very much honour God, ſhame ſin, and commend piety. It putteth a viſible difference between the precious and the vile, the clean and the unclean, the ſilver and the droſſe; and may well be therefore called a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refining Ordinance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Calumny was this, <hi>I my ſelf,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>did hear the Presbytery of Edinbrugh cenſure a woman to be baniſhed one of the gates of the City.</hi> I anſwered him in his own language, <hi>It is at the best a moſt uncharitable ſlander.</hi> And told him, there is no baniſhment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but by the Civil Magiſtrate; and that he ought to have enquired and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf better.</p>
               <p>Now he doth neither adhere to his Calumny, or offer to make it good, nor yet quit it, or confeſſe he was miſtaken; but propoundeth three new <hi>Queres (Male dicis, pa.</hi> 21.) ſtill forgetting his own rule of keeping to the Laws of Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Matter in hand. For the particular in hand, he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith thus much, <hi>I did make enquiry, and from the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery it ſelf, I received information; but not ſatisfaction.</hi> He
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113393:27"/>
tells not what information he received. If he will ſay, that he received information that the baniſhment was by the Magiſtrate, how could he then report that it was by the Presbytery. If he ſay, that the information he had from the Presbytery gave him any ground for the report which he hath made, let him ſpeak it out, and the world ſhall know the untruth of it. He may remember withall, that by his principles an accuſation may not be received againſt an Elder (much leſſe againſt an Elderſhip) in reference either to the judgement of charity, or to miniſterial Conviction, except under two or three Witneſſes. If therefore he would have his accuſation beleeved, let him finde two or three Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas I had rectified a great miſtake of the Reverend Brother, when I told him <hi>It is accidental to the ruling Elder to be of the Nobility, or to Nobles to be ruling Elders; there are but ſome ſo, and many otherwiſe:</hi> He is not pleaſed to be rectified in this, but replyeth, <hi>I ſay, firſt, it is continually ſo. Secondly, The Kings Commiſſioner in the General Aſſembly, is his preſence accidental? Male dicis, pag.</hi> 10. See now here whether he underſtandeth what he ſaith, or whereof he affirmeth. That which he ſaith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſo, is almoſt continually otherwiſe, that is, there are continually ſome Ruling Elders who are not Nobles, and there are continually ſome Nobles who are not Ruling Elders: So that if any thing be accidental, this is accidental, that an Elder be of the Nobility, or Nobles be Elders; they are neither Nobles <hi>qua</hi> Elders, nor Elders <hi>qua</hi> Nobles. It is no leſſe accidental, that the Kings Commiſſioner be preſent in the General Aſſembly; for there have been General Aſſemblies in <hi>Scotland,</hi> both before the erection and ſince the laſt caſting out of Prelacy, in which there was no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner from the King. And when the King ſends a Commiſſioner, it is accidental that he be of the Nobility; for the King hath ſent Commiſſioners to General Aſſemblies, who were not of the Nobility.</p>
               <p>A fourth Injury, not to be paſſed in ſilence, is this, Maſter
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113393:27"/>
                  <hi>Coleman</hi> hath endeavoured to make the world beleeve, that the Commiſſioners from the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> came to the Aſſembly, byaſſed with ſomething adventitious from without, which he calls a National determination, and that we are not permitted by thoſe that ſent us, to receive any further light from the Word of God. I ſhall ſay no more of the byas, becauſe as I told him before, the ſtanders by ſee well enough which way the byas runs. But moſt ſtrange it is, that after I had confuted his Calumny, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from our Paper firſt preſented to the Grand Committee, but from the General Aſſemblies own Letter to the Aſſembly of Divines, ſhewing that they had ordered the laying aſide of ſome particular Cuſtomes in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the neerer uniformity with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo much endeared unto them; yet he ſtill adhereth to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Calumny (<hi>Male dicis, pag.</hi> 20.) without taking notice of the Evidence which I had given to the contrary. And not content with this, he ſtill qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>relleth with my allegation of certain parallel examples, which are by him ſo far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemed, that he hath not ſtuck to paſſe the very ſame cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the forrain Divines who came to the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> which the <hi>Arminians</hi> did: The ſame he ſaith of <hi>Alexander</hi> his coming to the Councel of <hi>Nice;</hi> and of <hi>Cyril</hi> his coming to the Councel of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> All theſe (I ſay) he ſtill involveth under the ſame Cenſure with us; for whereas he had alleaged that I juſtified the byas, this I denyed and called for his proof; his Reply now is thus, <hi>Is not the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of examples of the like doing, a juſtification of the act done? Male dicis, pag.</hi> 20. This Reply can have no other ſence but this, That I juſtified the thing which he thinks our byas, becauſe I juſtified thoſe other Divines who (as he holds) came alſo byaſſed in like manner. I am perſwaded this one particular, his joyning with the <hi>Arminians</hi> in their Exceptions againſt the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> would make all the Reformed Churches, if they could all ſpeak to him <hi>uno ore,</hi> to cry <hi>Male audis.</hi> And I am as firmly perſwaded, that the Confeſſion which I have extorted from him in this place,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113393:28"/>
That he knoweth no adventitious ingagements thoſe Divines had, makes him irreconcileably to contradict himſelf; for he made them but juſt now byaſſed in the ſame manner as he thinks us, and made my allegation of their examples to be a juſtification of the byas charged by him upon us: As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth moſt uncharitably, and untruly judge us to be byaſſed with adventitious engagements, ſo doth he judge of them. Neither can he aſſoil them, while he condemneth us; for the Articles concerning Predeſtination, the death of Chriſt, grace, freewill, and perſeverance, were determined before the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> by moſt (if not by all) of thoſe Reformed Churches who ſent Commiſſioners thither, as much as Presbyterial Government was determined in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before the Reverend Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines was called. And this Preingagement and Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of thoſe Reformed Churches, was the main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> againſt the forrain Divines who came to the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> To conclude this point, Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Reexamination, pag.</hi> 7. avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth roundly, That the forrain Divines came to <hi>Dort,</hi> not as Divines by diſpute and diſquiſition to finde out truth, but as Judges to cenſure all different Opinions as Erroneous.</p>

Yet I muſt needs take notice of ſome calumnies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In his Epiſtle pag. 8. he offereth it to be examined whether I was not beſide my Text, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2. when I preſſed from it Reformation by Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline? whether that refiners fire and fullers ſope, doth not point at another, and a nearer operation upon the ſouls and ſpirits of men by the Blood, Word, Spirit, and Grace of Chriſt? and whether ſuch handling of a ſimilitude in a Text be to preach the mind of God, or mens own fancy? It is no diſcontent to me but I ſhall rejoyce in it, that men of piety and judgement exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my Doctrine by the Word of God, and hold faſt what they finde agreeable to the Scriptures, and no more. But i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> this brotherly, or fair, or conſcionable dealing, to offer my Sermon to be examined under ſuch a notion, when he hath not onely ſaid nothing, to confute any of my Doctrines, as not ariſing from my Text, or any of my applications, as not ariſing from my Doctrines; but hath alſo untruely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented my Sermon, as coming ſhort of, or not expreſſing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113393:29"/>
that which indeed it hath moſt principally and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely in it? That of Reformation was but a part of my Sermon: and that of Church-cenſures againſt ſcandalous ſinners was but the leaſt part of that part. And why ſhould not the fullers ſope in the Houſe of God, take off thoſe ſpots in our feaſts? Why ſhould not the refiners fire purge away the wicked of the Earth like droſſe, ſo <hi>David</hi> calls them? That Reformation is one part of the holy Ghoſts intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Text, is <hi>Gualther</hi>'s opinion as well as mine, yet he thinks <hi>Gualther</hi> his own. Nay, I proved it from compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture with Scripture, which is the beſt way that I know to clear Scripture. Why did he not anſwer my proofes? But beſide all that I ſaid of Reformation, had I not other three Doctrines out of that Text, comprehending all that which Maſter <hi>Huſſey</hi> hinteth as omitted by me and yet intended in the text? Dare he ſay that I did not take in purgation by the Word? (though I confeſſe he doth not well prove it from the words which he citeth, <hi>Is not my word an hammer?</hi> but it is proved by the words which he citeth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Is not my word like as a fire?</hi>) Did I not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſay that Chriſt is to us as a refiners fire and as fullers ſope, three wayes, by reformation, by tribulation, by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification? Did I not handle the laſt two as well as the firſt? Oh let no more any ſuch groſſe calumnies be found among thoſe who profeſſe to be Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Maſter <hi>Huſſey</hi> in his Epiſtle to my ſelf gives it out that I ſay <hi>We have leave from the Civill Magistrate to preach the Goſpel,</hi> which he interprets, as if I denied that we preach the Word with Authority from Chriſt. It was <hi>de facto,</hi> not <hi>de Jure,</hi> that I ſpake it. The Magiſtrate hath power in his hand to hinder both Doctrine and Diſcipline, if he be an adverſary: though it be the will of Chriſt that there be both Doctrine and Diſcipline, and the Authority of both is from Chriſt. When the Magiſtrate aſſiſteth or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanceth, or ſo much as he doth not hinder the preaching of the Goſpel, then he gives leave to it.</p>

                     </gap>e Honourable Houſe of Parliament, Take you notice that you manage that great place of yours under Chriſt and for Chriſt: He is your head and you are his ſervants. And take you notice withall that Mr.</hi> Gilleſpy <hi>accounts this your reproach. Maledicis Maledicis,</hi> pag. 17. But O ye Honourable Houſe of Parliament, be pleaſed to take notice of my owne plaine expreſſion of my minde in my <hi>Nihil reſpondes,</hi> pag. 13. <hi>The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate manageth his Office under and for Chriſt, that is, ſo as to be ſerviceable for the Kingdome and Glory of Chriſt.</hi> And now judge whether it be ſutable to the ſincerity and candor of a Miniſter of the Goſpell, to endeavour to make me odious to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by imputing to me that which not onely I did not ſay, but the contrary whereof I did plainly expreſſe? The thing which I charged his doctrin with was this, that by holding all government to be given to Chriſt as Mediatour, and from him as Mediatour derived to the Magiſtrate as his Vicegerent, he ſhaketh the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Magiſtracy. I am ſure that which I hold, that all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Magiſtrates are Powers ordained by God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113393:30"/>
and obeyed as Gods Vicegerents, is a firme and ſtrong foundation for Magiſtracy. But that which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> hold, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Chriſtian Magiſtrate holdeth his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of, under, and for Chriſt as he is Mediator, and doth act <hi>vice Christi,</hi> as Chriſts Vicegerent, gives a moſt dangerous wound to Chriſtian Magiſtracy, which I can demonſtrate in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: I ſhall now give inſtance onely in theſe few. Firſt, They muſt prove from Scripture that Chriſt as Mediator hath given a Commiſſion of Vicegerentſhip to Chriſtian Magiſtrates, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them not onely to be ſeviceable to him and to doe his worke: (for that they muſt ſerve Chriſt, and be for his Glory, is not controverted, nay can never enough be commended to them) but alſo to governe <hi>vice Chriſti,</hi> in Chriſts ſtead, and that not only as he is God (which is not controverted neither,) but as he is Mediator. This (I ſay) they muſt prove, (which they will never be able to doe) or otherwiſe they doe by their doctrine leade the Magiſtrate into a ſnare; and leave him in it. For how ſhall he be acknowledged for a Vicegerent who can ſhew no Commiſſion nor warrant for his Vicegerentſhip? Secondly, Their doctrine tendeth to the altering of the ſureſt and beſt knowne tenure of Magiſtracy, which is from God: for they hold that God hath put all Government and all authority civill, and all into the hands of Chriſt as Mediatour; if the tenure from Chriſt faile, then by their doctrine the tenure from God ſhall faile too. Thirdly, The Vicegerent cannot act in that capacity nor aſſume that power which his Soveraigne whoſe Vicegerent he is, ought not to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume if he were perſonally preſent. So that by their principles it will follow that the Chriſtian Magiſtrate can act no further, nor aſſume any other power of Government, then Chriſt himſelfe might have aſſumed when he was on earth, or might now aſſume and exerciſe as Mediatour if he were on earth. But Chriſt himſelfe when he was on earth neither did exerciſe nor was ſent to exerciſe civill Judgement, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 14. and the temporall ſword. <hi>John</hi> 18. 36. nor externall obſervation and State. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 20, 21. and he declined to be an earthly King. <hi>John</hi> 6. 15. Therefore by their principles the Chriſtian Magiſtrate ought to forbeare and avoide all theſe.</p>
               <p>A <hi>fifth</hi> Calumny is this, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> deſcanting upon the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments</hi>

                           <p>It is a truth, and a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truth which I have delivered, and becauſe I ſee a Scripture truth hath given offence to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Surely if ſuch <hi>Orleance</hi> Gloſſes be admitted upon mens Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſigned with their hands; and if he who hath ſubſcribed himſelfe ſorry that he hath given offence in the delivery of ſuch a doctrine, ſhall be allowed to expound himſelfe thus; that he meant he was ſorry others had taken offence at a Scripture truth,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113393:31"/>
that is, he was ſorry for our fault not for his owne: I know not how men ſhall truſt one anothers Declarations: or how we can <hi>practically</hi> as well as <hi>doctrinally</hi> confute the Jeſuiticall aequivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and mentall reſervations. And if this muſt needes be the ſence which now the Reverend Brother gives; and was the ſence intended, Why ſaith he that he did publickly recall that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? He might make a revocation of it, in the ſence wherein I underſtood it: but how could he make a revocation of it, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe underſtood it, and as he faith the ſence muſt needes be? Was this his ſorrow for our taking offence at a Scripture truth, a ſorrow to be ſorrowed for? Why did hee not rather make a ſecond Declaration the next day, interpreting the former? And whereas he thinks that his Revocation ought to have beene mentioned together with his declaration, becauſe the whole truth is to be told as well as the truth, his owne heart knowes that he himſelfe hath not told the whole truth, for he could tell much more, if he pleaſed; how he was brought upon the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and particularly upon that Revocation. Why will he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge others for not telling the whole truth, when himſelfe doth it not? I ſhould have thought, that this Revocation was neither here nor there, as to the point of ſcandall, for proofe whereof his Declaration was brought: and that as it was not to the buſineſſe in hand, ſo it might rather, ſerve for impairing his credit then for any thing elſe. But ſeeing himſelfe thinks it more for his credit, to tell the world of his ſaying and unſaying, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and undeclaring, let him be doing.</p>
               <p>In the next place will you ſee how much violence he offereth to Divines whom he citeth? I had cited plaine and full Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the <hi>Zurick</hi> Divines, ſhewing that <hi>Gualther</hi> expounds I <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. all along of Excommunication: that <hi>Bullinger</hi> holds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication to be inſtituted by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. That <hi>Aretius</hi> ſaith God was the Author of excommunication in the Old Teſtament, and Chriſt in the New; all which ſee in <hi>Nihil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondes,</hi> pag. 32.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Brother notwithſtanding of their plaine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies ſpeaking for me and againſt him in the maine Controverſie betweene him and me, doth ſtill alledge that they are for him, not for me, <hi>Maledicis,</hi> pap. 23. yet he doth not ſo much as offer any anſwer to their Teſtimonies by me cited: onely he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113393:31"/>
bringeth three other paſſages of theirs, intimating that there may be a true Church without Excommunication: that they thought it not neceſſary where they lived: that they thought it hard yea impoſſible: <hi>arduum nec non impoſſible,</hi> to introduce Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in thoſe parts. By which citations the Brother hath proved nothing againſt me, but confirmed what I ſaid. Let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, firſt, he himſelfe makes the maine controverſie betweene him and me, about the Scripturall warrants of Church cenſures: now in that, they are clearely againſt him. Next <hi>Aretius</hi> who thought it hard, yea impoſſible, to bring in Excommunication at that time, ſaith alſo, <hi>dabit poſterior at as tractabili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I cited alſo other Teſtimonies to ſhew that the <hi>Zurick</hi> Divines did endeavour and long for the diſcipline of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, though as things ſtood then and there, they did prudentially ſuperſede the reſtoring of it where they lived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the difficulty and apprehended impoſſibility of the thing. If Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> will follow the <hi>Zurick</hi> Divines, he muſt change his tone, and quite alter the ſtate of the Queſtion, and make it thus: Whether as things now ſtand it be expedient to ſettle Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Now, if he make this the ſtate of the Queſtion, then he muſt make a Revocation of that word, <hi>I deny an Inſtitution, I aſſent to a Prudence.</hi> For the Tables were turned with the <hi>Zurick</hi> Divines: they aſſented to an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, they denyed a Prudence; they held an affirmative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for Excommunication, but that it doth not bind <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> that the thing is not at all times, nor in all places neceſſary; that weighty inconveniences may warrant the ſuperſeding of it.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Brother brings another Teſtimony out of <hi>Areti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> againſt Suſpenſion from the Sacrament; <hi>And further</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for this grand deſired power, Suſpenſion from Sacrament, theſe are his words, &amp;c.</hi> A Teſtimony three wayes falſified. 1. <hi>Aretius</hi> ſpeaks not at all in that place of the power or duty of Church-Officers, of which Suſpenſion is a part: but he ſpeakes of private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and what is incumbent to them. 2. He ſpeakes of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (not of Suſpenſion) from the Sacrament; that a man is not bound to withdraw and lie off from the Sacrament, becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
