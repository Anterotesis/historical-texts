            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Coll. <hi>Okey,</hi> and Coll. <hi>Alured,</hi> who being ready at hand were preſently brought to us, and after ſome <hi>expoſtulations,</hi> were ſo far convinced of our <hi>rude entertainment,</hi> that they cauſed the Door to be open, and let the reſt of us into the <hi>Lobby.</hi> Our next attempt was, <hi>to go into the Houſe;</hi> but then the ſaid <hi>Collonels deſired us to forbear:</hi> We asked, <hi>by what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant they kept us out whom they knew to be Members, they having ſworn obedience to the Parliament?</hi> they replyed, <hi>they had orders for what they did; we deſired a ſight of them, and we would retire, and trouble them no further;</hi> Col. <hi>Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> ſaid, <hi>that their Order was not about them:</hi> but ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and one <hi>Hage</hi> by name ſaid <hi>they had verbal Orders to keep us out;</hi> at length Col. <hi>Alured</hi> told us, <hi>if we would reſt our ſelves in the inner Lobby, he would by the Serjant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Houſe of our coming, and demand of admitance;</hi> and accordingly he went preſently to the Houſe door, and knocking, the <hi>Serjant</hi> came to the door to him, but at the opening of it, ſeeing ſome of us there, offering to come in, <hi>held the door almoſt ſhut;</hi> Whereupon Col. <hi>Alured</hi> told him, <hi>that the Members were come, and endeavoured to get into the Houſe, deſiring him to acquaint the Speaker, and houſe ſo much,</hi> (as ſome of the Members did alſo) which he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115449:4"/>
               <hi>promiſed,</hi> and immediately did, returning to the door, to tell us, <hi>that he had done ſo, and that the Houſe had thereupon taken up the debate of that buſineſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Turn-key</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took the key out of the door, to prevent any further attempt of going in. Col. <hi>Ingolsby,</hi> whilſt we were at the firſt door came in, who was the only ſitting Member that we ſaw, (for none came out whilſt we were there;) him we deſired to acquaint the Houſe with our attendance, and the force upon us, which he promiſed to do, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve did.</p>
            <p>Having attended above an hour, with more <hi>diſtance</hi> and <hi>ſtrangeneſſe,</hi> than ever we were uſed to, when we went on Meſſages to the <hi>Lords houſe,</hi> who uſually came many of them out, and diſcourſed very familiarly with us; whereas not one of theſe <hi>ſelf-made Lordlings</hi> (whether out of <hi>Pride, Guilt,</hi> or both, let others judge) vouchſafed to come neer us. We grew <hi>weary of waiting</hi> ſo long and <hi>Servilly</hi> upon thoſe who in their <hi>higheſt Capacity are but our equals,</hi> though we had born it thus ſar, <hi>to acquit our ſelves of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting no condeſcention, that might make way to the diſcharge of the Truſt we are in ſor our Country.</hi> And therefore we made Col. <hi>Alured</hi> acquainted, <hi>that we were reſolved to ſtay no longer, unleſs the Houſe declared they deſired we ſhould;</hi> Whereupon he went again to the Houſe door, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knock being opened, <hi>he acquainted the Serjant ſo much,</hi> willing him, <hi>to give notice thereof to the Speaker, and Members ſitting:</hi> which he preſently did, and within a ſhort time after, the <hi>Serjant</hi> came out to us, and having made a preamble, <hi>that he had no direction to come and tell us any thing, he told us of his own civility, that the Houſe had poſſed a vote in our buſineſs, which in effect was, the appointing the fifth of January, to take it into conſideration: Which we</hi> looked upon as their <hi>confirming,</hi> and <hi>owning this ſorcible excluſion of us,</hi> and ſo departed.</p>

            <p>So that it ſeems the whole number of the Houſe who have made this high <hi>breach of the privilege of Parliament</hi> were 42. which agrees with the entry of a diviſion the ſame morning in the Journal book, upon which there were 41. and 17. beſides the Tellers, making in the whole <note n="*" place="margin">Note, that of theſe 42. Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, 2. were Earls, uncapable of fitting as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners; 2. Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Execution, diſabled to ſit, whiles ſuch: 3. or 4. no Members of the old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſince the Kings death, by Writs from the Keepers of our Liberties; So as their Legal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was but 15. at moſt, and ſo no Houſe.</note> 42. As for the <hi>dilatory order</hi> it ſelf, (wherein they make themſelves alone our <hi>Judges,</hi> being now our <hi>Seeluders,)</hi> we ſhall need ſay little to it, ſince it ſounds forth its own <hi>emptineſs, injuſtice</hi> and <hi>deluſion;</hi> yet we cannot but take notice of the little ingenuity appears in it, to call us <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Members,</hi> whom they knew to be at the Door claiming our <hi>Right,</hi> and to talk of <hi>conſidering the caſes of all abſent Members,</hi> when they knew <hi>above two hundred</hi> of us have no other caſe to be conſidered, but that which hath had a lamentable influence upon the whole Kingdom, that is to ſay, our <q rend="inline margQuotes">forcible excluſion: which by the courſe of Parliamentary proceedings, they well knew, ought as the moſt fundamental privilege to be taken into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before all other matters, and not to be deferred to another day, much leſs for ten daies, when the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers excluded by force attended in crowds at the door, for a removal of the force.</q> But to ſay no more, we look upon it (as ſubtilly as it ſeems to be carried) as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery evident enough to diſcerning Spirits, of an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deprive double the major part of the Houſe of their liberty to fit, (notwithſtanding their undoubted right of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115449:6"/>
being Members, and Counſellors of the Kingdoms) and to contract our <hi>free</hi> and <hi>full Parliaments,</hi> in whoſe <hi>wiſedom</hi> and <hi>faithfullneſs</hi> we have been <hi>ſafe</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> for many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, to a <hi>ſcant, unſafe Oligarchy,</hi> though this muſt not be known till the <hi>yoak is ſitted for our necks,</hi> and a <hi>ſufficient force ſetled on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince we are now excluded by the <hi>Act of our Fellow-Members,</hi> we do expect (and doubt not but the Nation will do the ſame) ſome account of the grounds and reaſons (if there be any, other than bare <hi>power</hi> and <hi>will)</hi> why near three parts of four, yet living, of the Members of the Houſe of Commons, who are of known <hi>faithfullneſs to their Country,</hi> are thus debarred the liberty of diſcharging our Truſts for thoſe who have elected us, and ſuffer much by having none in publick Councils to repreſent them, or be ſenſible of their Grievances: And we hope whatever ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal impoſitions &amp; burthens ſhall be laid upon the people, or preſſures they do undergo during our <hi>inforced abſence,</hi> we ſhall in the ſight of God and man be clear from the blame of, though we make no further attempts to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>ours</hi> and the <hi>peoples rights</hi> in ſuch way of <hi>Addreſs,</hi> (to ſo few of our Fellows) as would ſet us below the <hi>dignity</hi> the Peoples <hi>free choyce</hi> hath placed us in.</p>
            <p>And though we do not arrogate to our ſelves <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi> or the name of a <hi>Parliament:</hi> nor with that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality uſed by our Fellow-Members now ſitting, publiſh our <hi>Reſolutions</hi> or <hi>Opinions</hi> to the Kingdoms, yet we doubt not the people of <hi>England,</hi> and the reſt of the Nations in Covenant with us, are now more quick-ſighted than ever (by the experience of many revolutions through male ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Government) to put a right eſteem upon <hi>tranſactions</hi> on all hands, and are by <hi>Solemn Oaths</hi> and <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> ſo ſufficiently &amp; clearly minded of <hi>their duty,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Right Conſtitution of Parliaments,</hi> that we ſhall have more need to perſwade them to a <hi>wiſe moderation</hi> and <hi>diſcreet zeal,</hi> than have occaſion to warn them of the <hi>danger</hi> they are in, to loſe the <hi>Liberties of Freemen and Parliaments</hi> for ever, and call upon them to aſſert thoſe rights, which,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115449:6"/>
though we will never <hi>betray</hi> nor <hi>yield</hi> up to any, yet we hold our ſelves obliged to let them know, we alone are not at preſent able to defend.</p>
            <p>We muſt not conclude, till we mind the people who have intruſted us, That in <hi>July</hi> 1647. when both Houſes were under but a ſudden, weak and tranſitory force, there was a judgement paſt in Parliament in <note n="*" place="margin">See the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Aug 20, 1647.</note> 
               <hi>August</hi> following, declaring the <hi>ſaid force to be treaſon, and all Votes, Orders and Reſolutions paſſed whilſt that force continued, to be null and void,</hi> for this only reaſon, <hi>becauſe the Parliament was under a force, and not free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to look further back, becauſe their order provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially reminds us, it may be remembred that the ſame 5. day of <hi>January</hi> in the year 1641. upon a ſmall breach of Privilege, in compariſon to this, made by the late <hi>King,</hi> in demanding only 5 <hi>Members</hi> of the Houſe of Commons, after a particular impeachment of high <hi>Treaſon,</hi> without ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any. It is declared by the Houſe <note n="*" place="margin">Exact Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 36, 37, 38, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>That the ſame is a high breach of the Rights and Privileges of Parliament, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſistent with the Liberty and Freedom thereof: and therefore this Houſe doth conceive, they cannot with the ſafety of their own Perſons, or the indempnity of the Rights and Privileges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, ſit there any longer, without a full Vindication of ſo high a breach and a ſufficient guard.</hi> And thereupon they adjourned into <hi>London,</hi> to ſit in a <hi>grand Committee,</hi> and made a high <hi>Declaration,</hi> touching the <hi>ſaid breach of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege;</hi> whereas above 200. of us living, ſtand ſtill ſecluded, without the leaſt offer of an <hi>impeachment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And which is a ſad circumſtance in the force, by which we are now ſecluded, ſome of them are <hi>actors</hi> in it, and now <hi>ſitting</hi> in the Houfe, or <hi>invited</hi> thither, who were very inſtrumental, in the late interruption, in <hi>October</hi> laſt, and in proceedings purſuant thereunto; as if all crimes in Members were <hi>Venial,</hi> but a faithfull <hi>adhearing to Oaths, Truſts, and Privileges of Parliament</hi> unpardonable, Charec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtical only of Perſons unfit to have a ſhare in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Intereſt and Judgement of thoſe that forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſecluded them, though called by the people to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115449:7"/>
To conclude, we know not what can be added, to make this Kingdom compleatly miſerable, but that as the <hi>Majority</hi> of the Commons being forcibly excluded, the door is barred againg them, by a <hi>few;</hi> ſo by the <hi>ſame power,</hi> ſuch qualifications and teſts may be impoſed upon the <hi>body of the people,</hi> as may by being ſubmitted to, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of <hi>free Parliaments</hi> for ever, and contract the <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages</hi> of the people, into the diſpoſure of a <hi>very few,</hi> to the <hi>ſmart</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> of <hi>all;</hi> which God in his mercy avert. For our parts, we ſhall have this comfort in the <hi>evil day;</hi> if God for the crying abominations of the 3. Kingdoms, ſhall bring it upon us, that we have with <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> given warning of the <hi>inundation,</hi> when the <hi>Cloud</hi> was but of the bigneſſe of a <hi>mans hand,</hi> and done what we could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
