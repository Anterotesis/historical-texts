            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROOEMIUM.</head>
            <p>FIrst, Every Science is made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect by these Four Parts,</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fore-knowledg.</item>
               <item>Precept.</item>
               <item>Rule. And</item>
               <item>Commentary.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These four Parts are diligently to be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in every Science (then not to be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:) According to these ought the Master to teach, and the Scholer to learn, orderly and by degrees: In these is no redundancy, and as little want.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:115407:12"/>
               <item>
                  <p>1. Foreknowledg is nothing else but the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Art anticipated, or the knowleg of the Nature of what you would learn.</p>
                  <p>For three things ought to be foreknown in every Art, be it Theorick, or Practick.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Theory,</hi> the <hi>Subject, Principles,</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Practick,</hi> the <hi>Subject, End,</hi> and <hi>Means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I leave the more exact description of this to such as study Logick, the Termes whereby they call it <hi>Synonymia, Paronymia,</hi> and <hi>Homonymia:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I do not write Logick here, but Phisick, and therfore come to the rest of the Notions.</p>
               </item>
               <item>2. Precepts which seem to be the only Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials to Discipline, are, The true Definitions, and congruous Distributions of things.</item>
               <item>3. The Rules of Definition and distribution contains their properties.</item>
               <item>4. A Commentary is that which makes both Fore-knowledg and Precept fit for use.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Amongst other things, It explains them what they be, and makes such things as are doubtful, cleer; answers all needful Questions; puts an end to controversies; quotes the examples and authorities both of ancient and Moderne writers, gives a Reason for every truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:115407:12"/>Thesé four beget a child called <hi>Method;</hi> or (if you please) make way both for Universal and Particular practise.</p>
            <p>This is the Reason <hi>Galen</hi> decreed upon it; That no Art could be learned without Method or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal Theorems; and exercised in perticular Examples; Thus you see Method consists in Univiersals, and Practise in particulars. Also <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (who was dead before <hi>Galen</hi> was born) seems to be of that opinion too.</p>
            <p>Method (which is Universal) cannot make a man an able Physitian with out much Practice. Also in another Book he saith, There are seven helps to find out a truth when it lyes most hid.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A ripe witted Nature.</item>
               <item>2. Good Education.</item>
               <item>3. An Ingenious Master.</item>
               <item>4. A diligent minde.</item>
               <item>5. A fervent desire after truth.</item>
               <item>6. Good Method.</item>
               <item>7. Continual Practise.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now then tis cleer from the consideration of these four which ought in every science to be observed, That our devision of this Book into four parts is very rational: of which,</p>
            <list>

                     <p>Experience is the mother of Physick; dayly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity administers ocasion for experience to work uopn: When a man is out of his way he inquires after it of every one that comes neer him: so doth a man that's out of his Health, require help of all his friends: This begot Practise, though peradventure accompanied with ignorance in the Principles. A Smith hath certain Rules to make a key, or somthing else of a peice of Iron, though he know neither the Nature of the Iron, nor the Original from whence it comes.</p>

               <p>Many contend stoutly and stubbornly too, That Physick is a sufficient body of it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Alchymie. And what a learned Argument do they bring to prove it think ye? <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> the two great Lights of Physick were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. A Cuckoos song is worth ten such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, They are far of another opinon whose Breasts <hi>Apollo</hi> inlightens with the light of nature; for. That without which Medicine cannot attain the end it was ordayned for; namely, To Cure the sick perfectly, and speedily: That is plainly necessary and ought in no wise to be wanting. But we cannot do this by common Medicines without Alchymie.</p>
               <p>Therefore Alchymie is very necessary, and ought in no wise to be wanting.</p>
               <p>The Assumption is thus proved,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115407:15"/>Although when you look upon one of <hi>Galens</hi> Apothecaries Shops, you see fine painted Boxes and curious pots, that it would dazle your eyes to look upon them, they are so finely pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That if there be a paradice upon Earth you would think it were there: yet in the inside is nothing but filth and the very Carkeises and Dung of all Medicines. Their common Medicines are grosse, crude bodyes, the vices of the simples are in, as well as their vertues, yea so many simples are in one Composition, that they hinder one anothers operation, and therefore how can they ease the sick without calling the help of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymist to resolve, seperate, and exhale what is obnoxious, thereby producing the hidden Natures of things for use (For God hath vayled the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most wonderful things, that so he may stir up man to search after them: else why did God hide the vertues of an Herb amongst his vices, seeing he would have all things made manifest) Also the Alchymist searcheth after the strength and Temperature of things, the Causes and Originall of their actions, and by Mediation of a certain pure body sets the very species and forms of things before your eyes: I could bring an infinite Examples of this: Opium is held to be cold, because it is stupefactive, but tis bitter, therfore according to <hi>Galens</hi> Hypothesis, hot: you see then, it contains in it self more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115407:16"/>
then one, which Alchymie teacheth artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to seperate from one another: Here then is no more doubt, then there is knots in a Rush, but that Alchymie is the Fountain of sound Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy the key of Wisdom, the soul and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of Physick, the Root of Medicine, and the Mark at which wise men shoot; therefore not to be separated from Medicine: Nay, we may say (and that truly too) That Physitians destiture of Chymical remedies, are like to Smiths that give you an Axe that is dull or broken in the middle, to cleave Loggs with: yet seeing the Theory of Alchymy as wel concerning things Naturall, as things not Naturall, and preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall is not yet sufficiently unfolded, and Methodically digested, and is pestered with variety of names and Opinions; Physitians fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the precepts of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> But O let us shake of this lazy life and learn the preparation of Medicines from <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and the Alchymists, which is far fitter, more pleasing, and more profitable, and let us use it to the glory of God, the health of our selves, and of our Neighbors.</p>
               <p>This is the Reason moved me to handle both in this book, That the Medicine both of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> and of Alchymy, might be a Rule for us, and that you may see the Sympathy, and Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:115407:16"/>The other two Sects, namely Empericks and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicks (if they be rightly understood), pertain to them both, for both embrace Experience, both strive after Reason and Method: Besides, they seek after the knowledge of the body of man, and conses that they search after the Elements, principles and Causes by which the body may be changed as very necessary, for stark naked Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if it be not joyned with Reason is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and to build upon Reason alone is very difficult and many times puzles the wisest Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: Neither do we approve of that ill favor'd fashion of scribbling Receipts, which most commonly, the Apothecaries either for want of learning do not understand, or for want of care alter, But we embrace that Manual, pleasant and effectual preparation of Medicines which Alchymie teacheth.</p>

few people look after it, and those few such whose hearts God hath touched: Therefore <hi>Alchymie</hi> was first damned to Cymmerian darkness; and being afterwards by som honest souls brought up once more to see the Light, up start all the haters of Truth, and labor with might and main to keep this hopeful plant from bearing fruit: when once they had brought men into darkness, who can blame them if they labor to keep them there; and to do so, they left never a ston unturn'd; but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored night and day even til they sweat again to exclud <hi>Alchymy</hi> from the society of men, nay they were come to that point of madness, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it, either no Art, or els an Art, vain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiching, invented by the Devil, and the Devils kitchin. And then the Bedlams run to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and Petition him to restrain Alchymists. But the soul of man furnished with the principles of Reason and instructed with the principles of Art, was quickly able to see the truth, through so slender a cobweb, and found it out to be the truest and most Ancient way, even almost as old as the world, although but latly revived from the dead.

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">THere are very many which suppose Medicine, and natural Philosophy to be synonimous, and their reasons were, first, because <hi>Aristotle</hi> thought so, when he wrote that Physick was to know the first principles of health and Sickness and that it ended in that which is called Medicine: And that the Physitian begins with those things that are Naturall: for as Plants have their Roots fixed in the earth by which they receive nourishment, yet they are conserved by the temperature of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115407:19"/>
Air about them, and flourish by the vitall Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Stars, so the Art of Curing men, takes it's Root and principles from Philosophicall meanes which are confirmed and illustrated by particular precepts: wherefore say they, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is nothing else, but a certain particular point of naturall Phylosophie, objected to the senses; for a Naturalist considereth all naturall bodyes universally, for knowledg sake; But a Physitian is conversant about the body of a man, not only that he may know his nature, but also that by knowing his nature, he may know the manner of Cure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because those things which are required to make up the, true and proper <hi>Synonymy</hi> of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enses, agree perfectly with the Comparation of <hi>Medicine</hi> and <hi>naturall Phylosophy:</hi> for the body of man which is the subject of Physick, is not drawn by difference of accidentalls, which is to be curable by Art; and the first principles of Medicine are shewed and handled in Physick: Therefore, as Law may be reduced to moral Phylosophy, and Divinity to Metaphysicks, so may Midicine to Naturall Phylosophy. But why I and others cannot close with this opinion, hear a little.</p>
                     <p>There ought to be two things habited in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Physitian: One by which he knows the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of medicine, and the things there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115407:20"/>
The other by which he operates well and readily, together with all the circumstances which concur to the perfecting of a Cure. That these two Habits are distinct, appears by this that one of them may be without the other: for very many learn the Science of Medicine in the Schools, and yet know not a whit what belongs to Use. On the contrary Many which are unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Science of Medicin by practice &amp; Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience become good Physitians. There is then this difference between these Habits, The first is goren by speculation, and may be taught with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any practise at all. The other is gotten only by Practise and Experience. Then, One is occupyed altogether about universals, the other about par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars also, although the one be imperfect without the other; yet the first can doe nothing without the second; the second little without the first: Both together make an able Physitian. Moreover That first Habit which is nothing else but the Science of Medcine, is devided in to two parts. The first containeth general Precepts, and Notions far enough off from Practise which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians call <hi>Speculative.</hi> The other toucheth upon the Practise and teacheth the way and meanes of Operation, and this they call Practick; These things thus premised, it is an easy matter to prove That Medicine is not synonymous with Natural Phylosophy; for this latter Habit is not synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115407:20"/>
Physick because it consists totally of Practise, and Practice is not synonymous with speculation seing they are things of a diverse order, and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially different. Now Doctrins synonymous cannot Essentially differ: for there are three things which Speculative Medicin chefly handles, First, the Body of Man. Secondly, Health and Sickness. Thirdly, Nourishment, and Medicament.</p>

                     <p>2. <hi>Alchymie is the Fountain of Sound Philosophy, the Key of wisdom. The soul and Marrow of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick. The Root of Medicine. and the mark all wise men Shoot at.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are some that are so simple as to affirm that Alchymie is also Sinonymous to Naturall Phylosophy. Al real things are of three sorts according to <hi>Aristotle.</hi> For either they are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to motion and mater; and of these is the Science of Natural Philosophie: Or joyned to matter, and separated by motion; and of these are the Mathamaticks: Or seperated from motion and matter, and of these are the Metaphysicks. Now Alchymy, seeing it is by a real being, joyned to motion and matter, must needs come under the head of Natural Phylosophy: But if part of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Phylosophy be Synonymous with Minerals and Mettals, it ought to have a certain matter of determination; and seeing the mater is one, and the determination altogether naturall, and not manifold; therefore of necessity, that same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115407:21"/>
matter must be like in the Art of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy, and not manifold; and although (say they) the manner of action &amp; direction and information of the Art be different from Natural Phylosophy as also the place, time, yet they tend all to one ultimate end: for as nature brings forth an Herb, or Gold, or other Mettal, out of that one matter for the use of man: so the Art of Alchymie takes the quintescence of that mettal or medicament out of that matter of the same use: Put case this be so; yet can I easily perswade my self that Alchymie is the fountain of Philosophy, and the soul of Physick: for (by their leaves) That Phylosopher never yet breathed which had the perfection of Alchymie but had also the knowledg not only of mettals but also of Vigetables and living creatures: therfore it was well said that Alchymie brought many hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things to light, found out many excellent medicines for the Physitian and many useful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations. Alchymy is then admirably profitable to search out the hidden things of nature so that a man can scarce be excellent in this world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of this Art: for what Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher can perform his duty more Nobly, more Happily, then he that is exercised in Alchymy: for it is not the proud Sophister that vapers with a few phylosophycal sentences, light conceits, and trivial Quirks that deserves the name of a good Physitian; but he that according to the rules
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115407:21"/>
of nature, makes his medicines honestly and faithsully, and applyes them wisely and studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Just so for all the world, neither is he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the name of a Philosopher that hath nothing in him but words, but he that hath been bred up in the School of Nature, and knows how to practise what he hath learned.</p>

                     <p>The internal end of Alchymie is to reduce Compounded bodyes into what they were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of: to clense, purifie, and take away their Milignant qualities, that so, either they may be fit for the Physitians use, or else trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted into other Mettals.

                     <p>1. <hi>THe principall Cause of Medicine is God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As all good Arts in generall have their fountain &amp; Original from God himself; So Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine also is a gift of God by his divine will granted to the sons of men: for the Art was never first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the wit of man, but came by demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God himself to man, becanse he belight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the sons of men. All Arts and Mystriees as well as the world that contains them have their Originall from God: Hence it came to pass that those ancient wise men, because they knew Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine was a divine thing; and they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what the true God was ascribed it unto their gods: God then is the Author of medicine, Nature the instrument of God, &amp; the Physitian is or should be the servant of them both: Hence it is that <hi>Herophylus</hi> said, That medicine was the band by which God healed the sick: if then the most high God be the Author of Medicine let not men despise it.</p>

                  <item>
                     <p>2. God is the principall cause of Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
                     <p>All true Medicine is the gift of the most high God; and he that will learn it, let him go to God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115407:25"/>
and not to the Ethicks. If you will learn wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom go to God, and not to the creatures, for they are as foolish as your self: God is the maker of all secrets, and hath distributed some of them to every creature; you can never learn them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dead letters but go to the living God from whom all knowledg flows to mortals, even as the trees bud by the heat of the sun: What knowledg hath man which he hath not from above even from that God which created knowledg, it's not an Accademie can furnish a man with the principls of knowledg, but'tis the grace and gift of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible God, if God inlighten your eys, the best Book of Physick is the Book of nature and there you may read it, and search for it, by Chyromancie and Physiognomie.</p>

                     <p>3. The less principal cause of Physick is either <hi>Impulsive</hi> or <hi>Instrumental.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Impulsive,</hi> is the want and defect of Human Nature joyned with a natural appetite to knowledg,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Instrumental,</hi> is that admirable Beauty and Hermony of Natural things.</p>

                  <item>
                     <p>4. The less principal causes of Alchymie are the same with those of Medicine.</p>
                     <p>The Impulsive cause is the dayly necessity of men.</p>
                     <p>The Instrumental cause is that stately light of nature, or the knowledg of the world in general
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115407:26"/>
without which ther is never a Physitian breathing can come to the exact knowledg either of the disease, or the body diseased.</p>
                     <p>For the Macrocosme, or world in generall, is the the Looking Glass and Theory in and by which man comes to the knowledg of him self; and the very principle which moved man to look after Physick.</p>

                  <item>
                     <p>5. The Instrumentall cause of medicine which Physitians use are Reason, Experience, and Speculation.</p>
                     <p>A Physitian in making a Medicine useth three principles of which the first is Invention, and done by experience. The Second Constitution per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by reason and experience: the third In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation done by natural speculation.</p>
                     <p>Expeirence is the first and most antient princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of invention, &amp; gave to Medicine it's denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, daily necessity gave occasion to experience. Reason and experience is the directing principle in the constitution of the Art. Natural specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the principle of interpretation and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. Experience therefore gave the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal both to Medicine and Alchymie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must needs take their beginnings from nature.</p>

               <p n="1">1. MEdicin takes his original from the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the world, &amp; was increased &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the most excellent Physitians in the succeeding Ages.</p>
               <p>There is no question to be made of it, but Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick had it's beginning when <hi>Adam</hi> had his, &amp; that it flourished in Egypt as well before as after the flood. That they learned it of <hi>Hermes Tresmegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos,</hi> and of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> who was his Scholer. <hi>Abraham</hi> also taught them much when he came thither out of Pheenicia: also <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> taught the Egiptains much Wisdom: At last <hi>Apollo</hi> who was afterwards worshiped for the god of Physick who flourished a long time before the <hi>Trojan War</hi> and added many famous things to that art, is said to have had the principls of it from the Egiptians. And though Egipt was the first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was so famous for this Art, yet they Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it of the Hebrews: <hi>Aesculapius</hi> added much to the Art and transported it from Aegipt into Greece, where he was worshipped as a god for his labor; because they thought he could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor dead men: thence came that in <hi>Virgil</hi> of <hi>Hyppolitus Poeoniis revocatum herbis:</hi> Neither were they only so sottish as to worship him for a god,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115407:27"/>
but they must worship his two daughters for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses; for he had two Daughters, of which the name of the one was <hi>Hygaea'</hi> and she they thought preserved them in health: the name of the other was <hi>Panacea,</hi> and she (they thought) frighted away diseases. Before <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> was <hi>Chyron</hi> the Centaure and his Scholers, as <hi>Petens, jason, Achilles</hi> and <hi>Thessalus,</hi> All these, used only the administration of Herbs, which they found out by Experience little other Method. Afterwards Medicine came in request among the Greeks, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines and Christians: Then, twas first brought into a Method; the Arabians and Jewes following none at all: Of these Sects <hi>Aeron Argentinus</hi> was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Empericks, who (a most terrible Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence raging in <hi>Sicillia</hi>) purged the Ayre by only making great fires about the streets. <hi>Themison</hi> was the first inventer of Methodicks: As for Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks they were used before the dayes of <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> by <hi>Machaon, Paeon</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi> but much amended by <hi>Hipprocrates,</hi> who deduced his Pedigree by his Fathers side from <hi>Aesculapius</hi> by his Mother from <hi>Hercules:</hi> Thus after <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> Physick was devided into Factions, Factions bred Contentions; and this continued til <hi>Galens</hi> time who about the year of Christ, one hundred and forty restored Physick to a settled Model: Him many Grecians followed, as <hi>Arateus, Aetius. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus, Orabasius, Cassianus, Dioscorides, Damascenus,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115407:27"/>
Theophilus, Philaretus, Dionyisius, Cassius:</hi> Amongst the Latin Physitians the first and cheifest is <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Celsus,</hi> their followed him <hi>Scribonus, Largus Quintus, Saronus, Coelius Aurelianius, Theodorus Marcellus, Priscianus, Constantinus, Apher, Johannes Fernelius, Fuchsius, Forsterus, Platerus, Bauhinus,</hi> &amp;c. The Arabian Physitians, neither much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Greeks nor Latines, got the glory to themselves, the others Libraries beeing spoyled after their Kings <hi>Porus; Mahomet, and Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,</hi> had erected two Schooles: Heare flourished very many, and very famous men, as <hi>Isaac, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apio, Averrois, Avicenna, Rhasis; Avezor, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.</hi> &amp;c. The Alchymists of our times oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to these, and will bee called Paracelsians from <hi>Paracelsus;</hi> of which more anon.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There is no question to be made but Alchymie is almost as old as the world. For, old Father Adam when he taught his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Phylosophie and other Arts; it is not very prob able that he left out Alchyme, which is the most excellent of all: such an assertion doth not sound like a truth. But tis most probable he distiled the principles of it into <hi>Tubal Cain</hi> who as we read Gen. 4. 22. was the first that wrought in Brass and Iron, and that out of question was the Reason why the Grecians worshipped Uulcan for a god: And I am so much the rather of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, because such as dealt in Mettals were the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115407:28"/>
first inventors of Alchymie. The first Alchymist that was heard of after the floud was <hi>Hermes Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smegistos,</hi> From him the Art is called Hermetical; the vessells belonging to the Art; Hermetical ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and from him comes the word Hermetical seal. The word <hi>Hermes</hi> signifies Mercurie; He was called <hi>Trismegistos</hi> because he was an High Preist, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, and king; or as others think because he was a king and a Prophet: What Countryman he was is uncertaine; There is a Table of Hermes now extant, caled <hi>Tabula Smaragdina,</hi> which the Alchymists prize as a great jewel; Some Say it was found in the valley of <hi>Hebron</hi> after the flood: others say, It was found by a woman in <hi>Hermes</hi> his Tomb: wher it was found it matters not much; this is certain, it contains in it the Fundamentals of Alchymie, and the way of making that universal Medicine which so many gape after, and so few catch. Also <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> calles Hermes the Root from which all the rest of the Phylosophers Spring; and if he Spake of the Phylosophers of our times he mist not a hayres breadth of the truth: Other Books are Fathered upon Hermes, as of The Secrets of the Phylosophers stone and many others, which although his name be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their Frontespeice yet many men, and those learned too, question whether they be his legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate children or not.</p>
               <p>Also a man had as good deny that the Sun is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115407:28"/>
up at Noone day, as deny that <hi>Moses</hi> both studyed and Practised <hi>Alchymie:</hi> How else could he burn the golden Calf which <hi>Aaron</hi> had made and grind it to pouder, which all the fire in the world was not able to doe without the Art of an Alchymist. Also <hi>Myriam Moses</hi> his sister was an Excellent Alchymist as some write and <hi>Synertus</hi> is one of them.</p>
               <p>Also <hi>Suidas</hi> reports, That the Golden Fleec which <hi>Jason</hi> stole, was nothing else but a Book in Parchment, which contayned the Art of making Gold; and that the golden Apples of the Hespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides were neither better nor worse than the very same: To let Passe other Fables, as that of <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> and <hi>Hipomanes,</hi> of <hi>Cadmus</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> of <hi>Argus</hi> his Eyes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After the Birth of Christ Alchymie flourisht much in Egipt: and Histories, this day to be had witnes, that they got that Treasure by Alchymie wherewith they defended themselves against all their enimyes: and relying vpon that only, was the reason of their so often vexing the Romans: Therfore as <hi>Suidas</hi> reports, when <hi>Dioclesian</hi> had conquered them he commanded all the Bookes of Alchymie, and Transmutation of Mettalls into Gold, of which Egipt had some store, to be sought out and burnt: lest the Egiptians making themselves rich by their Art should rebel againe. In after Ages the light of Alchymie shone
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115407:29"/>
brightest among the Arabians as he may se that takes but the pains to read <hi>Mesue,</hi> who desires such as are studious in Physick to be much conversant with Alchymists if by any meanes they might learn of them to seperate the hidden quality from the Concrete by the force of fire: And that it flourished many yeares amongst the Arabians appeares by their owne writers: as <hi>Geber, Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenna, Rhasis, Arnoldus de villa n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>va &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this latter age of the world, it turn'd Monk and was seldom seene out of a Monastarie: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which some were famous as <hi>Raymundus Lullius, Albertus Magnus, Johannes de Rupe feissa, Savanorola Morienus, Trithemius, Frier Bazil Valentine:</hi> and there it had dyed, had it not been for Paracelsus, who in the yeare 1493. by care and industry brought it again to the Light of the Sunne, which else had been suffocated in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starie. Him all the later writers follow. Thus you have the Original of Medecine and Alchymie.</p>

                     <p>For it is as true as what is truest That Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists have many singular precepts and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not only in their Operations but also in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring Physick contrary to the Opinion of the Dogmaticks: They can give you a true and exact Anatomie, not only of the Body of Man, but also of the whol world, As concerning their way of making the Phylosophers stone, they differ much and perhaps as much from the Truth as they do from one another.</p>

and of his medicine, are various and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
                     <p>For a Frugal and temperate Diet, preserves Health and amends sickness, maintaynes the body in vigour, which is the most excellent of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things: for what good doth the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hearbes bring to a man, or what delight? What doth a man get by his observation in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secting the body of a man? you can hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade a man there is any unless he find it by use and exercise: So then, As of the liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences Physick is one, the use of it makes it inferior to none.</p>

                     <p>VI. The proper effects of the Alchymist and his Alchymie are various and Excellent.</p>
                     <p>The cheife effect is the excellency of medicine; for although Nature gives us our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins whole, yet most commonly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of divers parts; nay somtimes in a whol pound of Medicaments you shall not find an Ounce of that spirit or Oyle you desire, or which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to the cure you intend: Nay more than this There is no whol medicament, but hath it's impurity. The Art of an Alchymist is to seperate this which nature hath mixed: As the Maseraick veynes seperate the pure Chyle from the impure dung in the body of man; So Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie seperates the spirits from the medicine, and rejects the impure dross; And who unless he be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115407:33"/>
a Madman but will easily grant, and that by the rules of nature that the Chymical preperation of a Medicine, the dros being cast away must needs bemore wholsom, more safe, more effectual in it's Operation than to give the whol Medicine dross and all as it growes out of the earth: There is indeed and in truth as much difference between them as there is between a Bushel of fine flower, and a bushell of Bran.</p>
                     <p>Besides in stubborn and lasting diseases, strong Medicines (stronger then any naturally grows out of the earth) must be given. And if Artificially Prepared may be given without any hurt or danger, Namly such as are made of Mineralls and Mettalls. To these I might add That an Alchymist hath the key of natures Secret Cabinet, and is able to produce all her hidden treasure to publick view: so that <hi>Mesue</hi> avows That scarse any deeper knowledg of Naturall things is given unto man, than what is given by Chymicall operations: by which the Sympathy and Antipathy of things is known; and thus much for the Cause and Effect of Medicine and Alchymie.

                     <p>II A Physitian cureth not only the body but the mind in some manner.</p>
                     <p>Pray tell me what there is in this whol Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, but may be delighted and refreshed, be it Mind or Body or what you wil. <hi>Opto tibi meus Sana in Corpore Sano</hi> said one. The whol Scope of a Physitian is that he might keep the Organs of the Mind and the understanding in a due temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature: for if they be out of tune, so is the natural State and Condition also: Take away the Organs of the Rational soul, and you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the soul it self; Restore the Organs, and you restore it: Besides the body and soul are knit together by a certain Sympathy or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and derive vertue and vice from one another, and if there be such a Harmony between them, the one must needs require help as well as the other: I know it is both douted, and called into
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115407:34"/>
Question by many; To which part of the Nature of man the disease is most hurtful and deadly: which although I confess I cannot easily answer yet would I have all men perswaded of this truth That the greatest part of all evills, comes from the soul, and the Internal spirits: for if the body being sickly be a burden to the soul, and deny it, it's operations, then comes the injury from the body: But if the body be subject to the Command of the Mind, and it be the duty of the Mind to keep Passions and affections in awe, and preserve all in a due decorum by the rule of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; then Licentious living, Idlenes Effeminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Luxurie &amp; almost what not; are al vices of the mind &amp; what worse diseases come to the body of man than by these and their likes: I pray you, is the fault in the body or the mind that people give themselves to gluttony, to lust, Drunkenness, Quarelling &amp;c? Is not the mind the seate of Temperance and Intemperance? and is not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance the cause of most diseases? Thus you se the point is clear enough, That the original of most diseases is in the mind, and is discernable to all unless such as are so blind they will not see.</p>

                     <p>For although Alchymie doe not beget a New
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115407:34"/>
Model of Phylosophy and Medicine as some would have it, because they have different Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem's and Hypotheses: yet because it is referred to the most excellent Part of Medicine which is the Rule of cure; it must needs have the same subject.</p>

                        <item>5. Let him use indications for his lawful and safe Method of Cure. Thus you see a Physitian ought not only to be of great integritie of life but also admirably well Skill'd in the knowledg of

                     <p>V. The generation of diseases is ended, and no new diseas happens to the body of man.</p>
                     <p>There are those that think, and stiffly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. That Diseases are more in Number, and more violent in quality, than they were in former ages; But ther's, ner'e a word on't true. Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents by long time hid in their Causes, and get strength by stealth, even insensibly; as the often dropping of water upon a stone makes it hollow: There are no new species in the power of Nature besides these that are already therfore there can be no new diseases: if Nature bred new, diseases, she must be turned out of her old course, But the one is impossible, therfore so is the other: t'is a new Essence, and not a new Accident that must make a new disease; There may be a difference in Diseases according to more or lesse, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and Novelty are two things; if there be then any new diseases, Rarietie or ignorance is the Mother of them. The Manner, species and the Cause of all diseases is the same; Now no disease can be without a Cause, because nothing is the maker of it selfe; neither can any thing worke against the Lawes of Nature, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can worke above it's strength, Diseases arise even of that very same thing by which we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115407:35"/>
live, Neither are there such things as peculiar seeds of diseases; but only they arise from our own vices, whereby we disturbe Nature; and all vices, though they have different Names, yet have they but one Nature.</p>

                     <p>There are a sort of men (and those no smal fools neither) that cry out, Medicine is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115407:36"/>
and therfore 'tis a thing ful of danger for a man to commit himselfe into the hands of a Physitian: And this they goe about to prove by an Argument such a one as 'tis; Because the whole Art of Physick is Conjecturall and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no certainty is to be expected of it: what a leane hungery Argument this is, I shall make evidently appear.</p>

                           <p>1. Because that is imputed to the Art which ought to be imputed to the Artist; for Medicine it selfe consists of most firme and undoubted principles; but the Physitian because he useth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Conjectures in his actions, doth not alwayes performe his Cure, with the same Dexterity nor felicity.</p>
                           <p>This comes to pass divers wayes.</p>

Somtimes the Patients are Impatient, and will not bee ruled, neither will they take the Medicine, or their case is desperat, or they are poore and want Necessaries: These and other things like them may hinder the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian in his cure, but they detract nothing at all from the Art it selfe.</item>

                        <item>2. The doubt lyes in the word Conjecture. For if you meane a bare and simple guess, that doth nothing at all: But if together with the Conjecture; you ad Demonstration as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion then 'tis no longer a Conjecture but a Demonstrative sign: you must make a difference between a bare guess and a Demonstrative sign, which Physitians call Indication: bare guesses infer no necessity, but probability; and that neither not alwayes, but most commonly; and is the usual practice of the Empericks.

'Tis the Divine Oracle of a mans life and the praise of it reacheth to the Skyes. Again, Would you know the Excellency of Physick? Consider it's Extent: It reacheth the natures not only of the highest star in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but to the meanest grass upon the Earth: it keeps the whol Creation in a due Decorum, which else would fall into a Rout.

               </p>
               <p>The Reasons are the same which we gave you before concerning Medicine.</p>

               </p>
               <p>First in respect of their Original; Because they are brought out of the Treasuries of the goodness of God himselfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard of théir Institution: Because they were ordayned of God to preserve man: and 'tis one part of the Worship of god to admire at his Creatures and gifts: and one part of the Will of God to search after his wonderful workes in the Creation. 7. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 35. Let it not greive thee to visit the sick, for that shall make thee to be beloved. And <hi>Paul</hi> tels you in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that the gift of healing is one of the gifts of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Also that great Physitian both of our bodies &amp; souls our Lord Jesus Christ, cured many diseases, as dropsies, palsies, leprosies, Issues of blood blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Feavers, and other desperate diseases by his wordalone. And God by his word alone, made al the Creatures, &amp; gave them vertues to do the like: <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians</hi> saith; <hi>Luke</hi> the beloved physitian greeteth you: And to <hi>Timothy</hi> he prescribes Physick himselfe, Drinke a little wine for thy stomaks sake. Damascus was once famous for Physitians, especially at that time when <hi>Johannes Mesut</hi> that excelent Physitian sone of <hi>Abdela</hi> king of Damascus taught Physick there: <hi>Suidas</hi> reports that king <hi>Solomon</hi> wrote a most singular volume of remedyes for diseases; the heads of which were engraven upon the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115407:43"/>
Temple gates. Whence it appeares that the Jewes kept the Copies of their Medicines in the Temple because of their Holines; and thence came that Blasphemous practise of the Heathen to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to their Gods; And though they were but men themselves yet they made their ablest Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians Gods, after they were dead and rotten; Witnes <hi>Aesculapius</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. <hi>Astrologie is not only agreeable to Medicine &amp; Alchyme, but also Exceeding necessary for the Physitian and Alchymist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Astrologie is that part of Natural Phylosophy which inquires after the Causes, properties, Natur, and Effects of the starres.</p>
               <p>If it be a part of Natural Phylosophie then it must needes be agreeable to Physick: The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Astrologie are drawne from Experience, which Experience is drawne from observations, which seldome fayle,</p>
               <p>It makes universal conclusions; and from the demonstration of one, shewes the Effect of another thing; so that from the starres it is able to give a Judgment of the Natures of Hearbes, Plants and Mineralls. And therfore he that doth not reckon it amongest the Liberall sciences as well as Physick, doth it a great deale of wrong. I am not ignorant that very many and those Learned, deny the Art of Atrologie to be an unniversal Art, and that only some few Particular Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115407:43"/>
happen true: But I shall easily prove they are beside the Cushion; and thus I begin.</p>
               <p>Neither Medicine cureth all Diseases, neither doth state Politicks remove all the troubles of a Common-wealth: And yet all will grant that they are grounded upon true and firme precepts and very necessary for the life and livelyhood of man: Is not the Art of Gunnerie good; because the Gunner doth not alwayes hit the Marke? So may the Art of Astrologie be both good and necessary though the Astrologer doe not alwayes predict the truth. He that would deny Astrologie to be one of the Liberall sciences must of Necessity deny the influences of the starres upon inferior bodyes. What if I should goe about to prove That all Physicall predictions are deduced from Astrologie? Ile try what I can doe.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever science teacheth the Effects the starres have upon Elements and mixt bodyes; The Temperament, alterations and Inclynations of all things below; That is the ground of all Predictions, and admirably useful for the life and well being of man.</p>

Actions both Healthful and unhealthful are caused in this lower world by the Influence of the starres.

And how can the Ayre doe it being a pure Element, without the Influence of the starres.</item>
                  <item>2. The various mixture of the starres, makes a various mixture of the Elements, which if it bee wholsome turnes to the Generation; if unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some turnes to the destruction of mankind: And therfore wellsayed <hi>Hypocrates</hi> when he said That the seed plot of Epidemicall diseases was an Ayre corrupted by Planitary influence. Our late Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians wil say God doth it; but how they know no more then a Hobby Horse, as though all Epidemicall diseases were Miracles: Others that think they are a little wiser say, it comes by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and the next time you heare one say so, ask him Who infected the first man that dyed of it.</item>

Although the Ayre bee the Medium by which the Influence of the Planets is dispersed through the sublunary world yet are not al places alike infected, and who but an Astrologer can give a reason of this: the Reason is from the hous or Sign of the Zodiack where the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction causing the Maladie happens: under each signe of the Zodiack are certain Clymats Kingdomes, and Provinces, and they are like to Suffer when others scape. Besides the age and sex of the Plannets is to bee considered, and Judgment to be Passed accordingly: Also the Nature of the Signes, for some are Humane and they indanger Men most, others the Signs of Beastes and they hurt Beastes most especially Some Specis of Beastes, Imagine Horses, Sheep, Hoggs &amp;c.

learned, and as honest, as learned, Gentle, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Fortunat a man that trusts in God and not in his owne Skill. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thus, A Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian ought to bee filled with the Deitie, he ought to be learned, good, and well Skill'd in his Art, Hee ought to know what hee would do, and bee able to put it in practise; for the Health and life of Mankind is commited into his hand: The Latins derive <hi>Medicus a Medio.</hi> A Physitian, from the Meanes by which hee Cures. And to speake <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he truth, A Physitian is a great imitater of Christ himselfe: for as Christ cures our spirituall wounds, so ought a Physitian our Naturall.</p>
               <p>Hee ought to deny himselfe, to bee mindfull of the Poore; He ought not to regard Gayne for that's the bane of the World. Hee ought to bee one that knowes what spirituall good Christ hath done him, that so at the same rate hee may do his Brother Temporal good freely without grumbling.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>An Alchymist is a person called of God himselfe, artificially to make profitable Medicines, of Plants, living Creatures, and Mineralls, as also (as much as is possible) to change base Mettalls into Noble, that so they may bee the more usefull unto Man kind which are his Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told you before that such as dealt in Mettalls gave the first occasion of finding out Alchymie; for they first found out how, what was mixed by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115407:48"/>
nature might be seperated by Art: And when they noted Gold to bee the most Noble Mettall, and found it mixed with much drosse, they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a hope of changing other Mettalls into Gold as well as Ore; and when they found that things were made more perfect by Distillation and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; they began to try whether the same might not bee don by Herbs and Plants: and by trying found it true; and their Operation to bee more perfect: And thus came the Art of Alchymy which before was purely Natural, to bee Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall; from beeing servile to Houshold uses; it became excellent to restore Health: for the Art of transmuting Ore into Mettall, begatt the Art of transmuting Mettall into Medicine: To which Doctor Reason adjoyning himself as a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for he loves ingenious wits) finding that Ore may bee separated from his drosse, and so become pure Mettall; presently gave order the same should bee tryed in Hearbs and plants; that so the drosse beeing separated from them, the Medicine might bee most pure: Just so it came to passe; And thus came the Art of an Alchymist to bee conversant upon all Naturall bodyes.</p>
               <p>The art of an Alchymist is to bee considered under a double notion.</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>Doctor Reason, and Doctor Experience are the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>two pillars upon which a Physitian stands: the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his knowledge are Drawn from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doctor Reason is his master, Doctor Experience his mistris, both of them Joyn together hand in hand to teach a Physitian how to cure a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease. What wonders can a Physitian do unless hee know such an Hearb Performes such an Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Hath he any more Skil in Physick without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in his Experience, and therfore Almighty God knowing the weakness of man hath given him two stringes to his bow. A Physitian ought First to consult with Reason, because hee is the elder brother, then hee ought to take counsel with Experience whether the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Reason bee true or not. Vertue is nothing else but the Rules of Reason made manifest by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, Oh what baser thing is there for what more unbeseeming to a Physitian then to build upon the Formes of other men, and yet every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world stinks of such Creatures at this day. If you look into the world of Physitians, good God How many Follow Doctor <hi>Galen,</hi> how few Dr. Reason and Dr. Experience. I confesse I desire to Joyne them both together in al my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>How notably spoke <hi>Calsus,</hi> It happens (saith he) just with our Physitians as it doth with Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, although they pretend they know al the Lawes, and teach them to others, yet when a brangling busines comes before them they are so uncertaine that they know not where to begin nor how to end, Neither shall yow scarce find two of them in one Opinion: Nay so contradictory they will bee in pleading, That if the Judge and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115407:49"/>
Jury were not either knaves or Fools, they would burst their hearts with laughing. Now if their Clyents would bee but ruled by Reason and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, they would agree, and never goe to Law, and in so doing would show themselves wiser than either their Lawyers or theire teachers.</p>
               <p>Just so for all the world it is with Physitians. An Ancient grave Physitian can sit in his Chay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and reason of all the parts of Physick, such as belong to the Diagnosticks of Diseases, and the Method of their cure, Hee can reason of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie of all parts; of the Historie of simples, and living Creatures, their Natures and Formes, their properties and vertues, he can quote <hi>Dioscori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> and say they were better men then himselfe: Hee can tell you how you must make up Antidotes and other Medicines, and for them hee can quote <hi>Mesue Nicholaus Myrepsus, and Nicholus Alexandrinus,</hi> and all this hee can utter Magnificently and stateliely: But if you call him to one that is sick of a Plurisie or a Feaver, a Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Flux, Dropsie, or a Falling sicknes, or any other disease 'tis no great matter whether it bee acute or Cronicall, Good God, in what an astonishment is my learned Physitian: Although hee feele the pulce and gaze upon the urine, hee scarce knowes what to doe for al <hi>Discorides, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharstes,</hi> and the rest of his Authors; Nay it may bee an old woman That stands by may teach
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115407:50"/>
him his Lesson a little better.</p>
               <p>Lastly. Our young Physitians which need a Master to instruct them in the Rules of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick and are minded to practise it, and use it well; I commend them to Doctor Reason and Doctor Experience, which two alone are necessary to this profession. Thus Celsus.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>The way wherby Alohymists come to learn, is by the light of Nature and Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee will not deny but <hi>Paracelsians</hi> make use of Reason and Expereince as well as other physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; but they soar a little higher, even to the light of Nature and Grace. That's the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, the other are but means how to use it. There is within a man an Internall Angel, and the Light of Nature; you need not ask What the Light of Nature is, the whole Creation shewes it every day; for as all Naturall bodyes grow out of the earth and are nourished from it, so is the mind of man nourished by the knowledg of Nature: By Nature Doth a wise man learne all his Arts and Factcultis as a tree hath i'es nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment from the earth: and hee that learnes Arts from Authors learnes them Just as a parrot learnes to spake. The Motion of the Creation is the Father of all Arts whatsoever Divinitie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for that's inspired into men by the spirit of God: And as Divine wisdom comes from the Divine spirit: so Naturall wisdom, comes from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115407:50"/>
the course of Nature. Authors may tell you, such a thing may be done in such a way; but what Accidents will come in the doing of it they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell you: The Light of Nature is that, and only that which teacheth true Phylosophie; yet is Divinitie the Foundation of true Wisdome; for God is the revealer of all secrets; and hee will reveale them to none but those that feare him. As for the Beauty of Medicine which wee spake of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wee shall speak of more by and by, when we come to the Oath prescribed to Physitians, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymists, and Apothecaries. It consists cheifly in Order and Honestie.</p>

of the Phylosophers; Or to speak more like a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, This is the Providence of God, which so knits the Creation together that one Part of it stands in continual need of another. I could easily prove (if it were my scope at present) That of Natural knowledges, Astrologie is most necessary for man in this World: But I am upon Physick, and therfore I say that it is most profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and necessary for a Physitian: How can you find out the Crisis of a Disease but by the course of the Moon? Or how can Diseases be better cured then by the knowledge of the Celestial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes by which they are caused? We reade in the Scripture, That Christ cured a man which was Lunitick, who often fell into the fire, and often into the water. If often, then not alwayes; If Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick, then according to the Course of the Moon. This <hi>Hermes Trismegistos</hi> in his Jathro Mathematicks (the word sounds nothing else but Medicine joyned with Astrologie) affirmes, That 'tis found out by Exreperince, and I my self have found it to be true, That the Egiptians could predict the disposition not only of the sick but also of the healthful by the Motions of the Moon: Therfore if you observe it, The Moon in the place of Mars in your Genesis stirres you up to Choller, but to the place of Saturn to Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholly; judg the like by the place of their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects in the Nativity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:115407:53"/>Imagine a man to be borne when the Fortunes were in Aries and the Infortunes in Taurus: This man when the Moon is in Aries, Cancer, Libra or Capricorne will doe well enough: Let him look sor his troubles when the Moon is in Taurus Leo, Scorpio, or Aquarie.</p>
                  <p>Also if his Diseases begin when the Moon is in Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, or Aquarie, they are like to proove dangerous, and strike at life. But if the Moon be in Aries; Cancer, Libra, or Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn they are easily cured: This not only the Physitians, (such as are Physitians indeed) and Astrologers; but also daylie Experience witness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be true: My self have found the truth of it oftner then once or twice.</p>
                  <p>By all this you see what exceeding need a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian hath to be an Astrologier. Because by the Motions of the Heavens, the Indications are so varied, and either moved forward or retarded: so that a Physitian that is ignorant of Astrologie, many times prescribes remedyes, Diets, and Chyrurgical observations in vaine. 'Twas a most notable speech of <hi>Galen</hi> to this purpose: He that is a Physitian, the same man is an Astrologer; thereby deriding those Physitians that denyed Astrologie to be necessary to Physick.</p>

                  <p>In Naturall Magick, Imagination bears a great
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115407:55"/>
sway not only in gausing, but also in curing disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: For proof of which we may let Phylosophie alone: Look but upon a woman great with child and you may see it without a paire of spectacles. Imagination is a knowing power; it acts potently upon other things beside it self; and although knowledg and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> concur to a Local Motion, yet are they not the first cause of Motion, neither can they work alteration or change in their own body, much lesse in another, But Knowledg is an act of the soul, and appetite alwayes followes it or alwayes should: Neither is the soul of man conversant only in it's own body, if it were, How could one man love another? And if the souls of men produce Mutuall Love, why not a Mutual help by the same Rule: Hence it comes to passe that many times a sick man is more cheered by the sight and Companie of one man, then he is by the help of another: It's in vayn to object That Humors and Spirits are immediately and directly moved by Imagination; for 'tis only Accidental: They are moved by the Attractive, Retentive, and Expulsive Faculties. Weconfesse a sudden fear will make a man tremble: though there be no reallity in it; so then the Humors and Spirits are the second cause of the chang of mans body, but the first and remote cause is Imagination.</p>
                  <p>You may see it clearly in all Epidemical diseases, who is sooner taken with them then they that fear
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115407:56"/>
them? Or I'le make it more clear by a simillitude; An Apple-tte is the second cause of bearing the Apple; but the first and remote cause is the sun which causeth the tree to spring and grow, blow and bear: But the first cause seldom produceth an act without the help of the second cause: For Example: In a Pestilential time Imagination it self will infect a man; but 'tis fear and terror caused by that Imagination which corrupts the Humors, and changeth them into the nature of the thing feared. Those that have read Physical Authors know what strang Imaginations a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Fancie will introduce into men; As one that conceited his Nose to be bigger then al his body: Another that he had no Head. A third that he was made of Butter; who being a Baker by Trade durst not come near his Oven lest he should be melted: Another that he had gotten a Fish in his blood; But to let passe others: My self the translator of this work. <hi>Anno</hi> 1642. had a Patient in Old street <hi>London,</hi> who being troubled with a Melancholly distemper, conceited himself only a man, and all others that came neer him Wild Beasts that came to devoure him: To see whether this Fancie might be removed or no, I perswaded him He was made of a black pot: This also wrought upon his Imagination; and then he durst let no body touch him for fear they should break him: until at last, his cure draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

neer, such vayn delusions vanish't.</p>
                  <p>To return to my Author.</p>
                  <p>The strongth of Imagination appeares in this; (to goe no further) In that Women with child, will not only desire, but also eat such things as are not fitting to be eaten; and their health is so far from being impayred, that it is much amended by so doing.</p>
                  <p>That the Imagination of one man will work upon another is very conspicuous by a Woman with child; the child bearing the mark upon it's body of what the Mother desired. Nay, if we doe but consider what Union there is between our Spirits and the Angels and Intelligences; nay (to reach a little higher) If man be united to God by the person of Jesus Christ, what wonder is it that one man should be united to another by Imagination? He that would know more of this, let him read Synertus his book of Alchymie.</p>

                  <p>Good God, to what Prid hath the fayned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie and deceitful pompe of this World brought Physitians too! Imagine they lived in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and there were sent for to visit a Sick partie, where neither Apothecarie nor Chirurgion were neer, as oftentimes it comes to passe: The disease also may be violent, and admits of no delay, but speedy help must be had: What will the Majesty of my venerable Doctor do in such a case? Will the disease be affrayd of his Prid? Must he not act somthing himself or else plainly and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly Murder the Sick? Doth such a famous fellow deserve the name of a Physitian? you see the folly of such as hold, it is the duty of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian to prescribe, and not to act.</p>
                  <p>To proced a little further.</p>
                  <p>Difference of Clymates, difference of places,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115407:59"/>
difference of parts of the body aflicted; difference of Complexion in the parties aflicted, require different formes, and different preperations of Medicines: Both matter and form is to be altered according to these circumstances, which cannot be done without long use and experience in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Medicins: which may indeed be disired, but cannot be so much as hoped for; much less expected from such titular Physitians as our times affords; whose sacred Majestie leads them to fill their own purses, and not to benefit the Sick. Antiquitie will lead them and us unto better maners if we had but Honesty enough to follow it. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> would have spit in that mans face that should have taken from him the power of making up his own Medicines: And the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents taught their Children and servants the way of doing it; and thought it as great a Sin to deny them that, as to deny them the use of Fire and water: and howsoever they boast themselves to be Galenists, and are ignorant in making up Medicines; what doe they else but brand the Name of dead <hi>Galen</hi> with a blot of Ignomy, who had more wit in his little Finger, then they have in all their bodyes?</p>
                  <p>Againe. That great writer of Physick <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> in his Epistle to Democritus writes: That a Physitian could never find out an absolute form of Medicine, that he durst say was perfect: and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115407:59"/>
we (and if we wil be honest) must ingeniously confess, That the Ancient Physitians were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant in some things, but also erred in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: What then shal we think of those that build their whol Practice upon the Prescripts of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients! We cannot chuse but admire what slavish Brains they are indued withal, who had rather err with the Ancients, than take the pains to find out a Truth themselves. Of how much better Opinion was <hi>Julius Scaliger;</hi> I have often (said he) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at the boldness and impudence of Mortal Men, who build their faith upon such errors of the Ancients, which they would have amended if they had lived; for it is not high base to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an Error, because it is the beginning of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but to cherish Errors is madness in the highest degree.</p>

                  <p>As much then as a Man excels other Creatures, so much doth he that is a Physitian indeed, excel other men; and as a man prizeth his Health, so let him prize the Physitian.

                  </head>
                  <p>Therfore the Roman Emperors, when they had observed any that were excellent in the Art of Phyfick, they gave them a yeerly Stipend, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintain them in a good Decorum, that so they might give Physick to the Vulgar freely, without any desire, or hope of reward: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis usual with people after they are cured by the great labor and diligence of the Physitian, to give him ingratitude for a recompence of his pains and care: Thence came that vulgar speech of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> Give thy Cook, ten Pound; thy Flatterer, five Talents; thy Physitian, a Groat; and the Phylosophers, three Farthings: Hence came that Proverb in use:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Exige dum dolor est, nam postquam pena recessit</l>

                  <p>But this is most base, and most dishonest; the Heathens shal rise up in judgment against such fellows and condemn them, who built Altars for <hi>Chyron, Machaon, Podalirius,</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and for their excellency in their Art honor'd them as gods: but enough of this, if not too much, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that I know, and am very wel vers'd in it, That the ultimate end of studying Arts, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and gain; but the finding out of the Truth, and the using of it to the glory of God, and the health of the sick, being found out. Riches are but the goods of Fortune, and wicked men have usually the greatest shares of them.</p>

                  <p>For although he that knows any thing, knows wel enough that a man may give Physick wel if he have it, whether he have Estate or not, and that the Estate of a Physitian conduceth not a whit to make him either the more knowing, or less know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but it enables him wherewithal to get fit Medicines to give: What good doth a mans knowledg do him unless he bring it into practice?
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115407:62"/>
So then a Physitian take him as a Student he needs no Estate, but take him as a Practitioner, he doth: Neither indeed is it convenient, That a man whom Nature hath enriched with knowledg, should want wherwithal to put it in practice. I could wish there were in this respect such a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between men as God hath made in the Creation: Therefore <hi>Cornelius Celsus</hi> said well, That a Physitian stood in as much need of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state to make up his Medicines, as a man in health did to buy him Bread: And <hi>Aristotle</hi> was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the point, Fools that know nothing, but are ignorant of the causes of things regarding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to get vast Estates; if they suffer in their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, let them impute it to themselves.

                  <p>And this is true enough; Confidence in the Physitian begets Hope, Hope begets Joy, Joy cheers the Spirits, Cheerfulness of the spirits helps to expel the Disease, and wonderfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the operation of the Medicine. On the contrary, If the sick abhor the Physitian, the sight of the Physitian terrifies him: Terrifying weakens the spirits, weakning of the spirits encroaseth the Disease, and makes way for Death.</p>

                  <p>That a Physitian may get confidence in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient by his own Nature, let him carry himself like a wise man, as wel as like an Artist: <hi>Cicero</hi> said true when he said, That in all Arts nothing memorable, or worthy of praise, could be done without Wisdom. If a Physitian carry himself ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly, and not respectively towards his Patients, he affrights them; if they like not his person, they wil like his Medicine much less: you may see this in Chyrurgions when they let people blood; If the sick be afraid, the blood retires, and he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom bleeds as he should do: But if he come cheerfully, and have good confidence in his Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, he bleeds wel: So if the party dislike the Medicine, either he vomits it up again, or retains it in his Body that it never operates. <hi>Cornelius Celsus</hi> was of opinion, That the prudence of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian did more good than his Art: and <hi>Socrates</hi> included al Vertues in this one word <hi>Prudence.</hi> And <hi>Celcus</hi> held, That a pratling Physitian was another Disease to the sick.</p>

neither ought such a thing to be amongst Christians, that a most excellent Art should be condemned because of the abuse of it: For as Mountebanks and old doting Women, detract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Splendor of true Medicine; so Ideots, and such as profess Alchymy without wit or reason, detract nothing from the dignity of true Alchymy: Neither are they worthy of the Name of Alchymists that spend al their time and means in trying Experiences, not knowing what Rule they go by, nor what end they drive at: as he said wel that said, They seek and find nothing, but seek after what they have found.

                  <p>A certain famous Alchymist at <hi>Rome,</hi> many looking on him, put only one scruple of pure Gold into two ounces of Quick-silver over a hot fire, and turned it al into most pure Gold; not without the admiration of the Beholders.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>HIppocrates</hi> his Definition is this: Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is an adding of things necessary and a substracting of things not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115407:71"/>
But this includes a Description of the Office of a Physitian: For al Diseases coming either of Emptiness or Fulness, the first is cured by Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the second by Substraction.</p>
                  <p>Others Define Medicine thus:</p>
                  <p>Medicine is a Knowledg restoring and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the health of the Body of Man.</p>
                  <p>Others thus:</p>
                  <p>Medicine is a knowledg, preserving Health, and expelling Diseases.</p>
                  <p>Others thus:</p>
                  <p>Medicine prescribes a right Diet to people in Health, and cures such as are sick. But never a one of these are true Definitions:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Because Medicine it self doth not this, but it appoints such things as do it, and that not alwaies neither.</item>
                     <item>2 Health is the Proposition of the Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, and its End is the obtaining of it; and it is necessary for a Physitian to know by what means Health may be maintained being present; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, being absent.</item>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Herophilus</hi> had another Definition.</p>
                  <p>Medicine is the Knowledg of things Healthful, not Healthful, and Neuters, between both.</p>
                  <p>Things are said to be Healthful or Unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, three waies:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 <hi>As a Body.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 <hi>As a Cause.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:115407:71"/>A Body is said to be Healthful when it is in health, Unhealthful when diseased.</p>
                  <p>A Cause is Healthful which causeth Health, Unhealthful which causeth Diseases.</p>
                  <p>The Sign is Healthful which shews Health a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; Unhealthful which shews encrease, or il end of the Disease.</p>
                  <p>The knowledg of Neuters is two-fold.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 In respect of Desidence, when any declines from the integrity of Action, and receives hurt thereby.</item>
                     <item>2 A Neuter of Recovery, when any first of al begin to mend of a Disease.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Hence others make another Definition of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which is this:</p>
                  <p>Medicine is an Art which conserveth sound Men in Health, restores the Sick, and preserveth Neuters from Diseases.</p>
                  <p>Or if you wil have it plainer thus:</p>
                  <p>Medicine is the Knowledg of things Natural, not Natural, and against Nature.</p>
                  <p>But this belongs to the Practice, and Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is only Theorical; whence it appears that they are imperfect. I shal satisfie my self with this short, yet compleat Definition.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1 Because by this means it is not divided into opposite parts.</item>

                     <item>4 Because, although some things which are handled in Medicine seem to belong to Theorical Discipline, yet because al of them are not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in respect of knowledg, but directed to some common operation or end, they are partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Subject, and partly to the End.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>We thought good to hold fast this Definition, not only because it is found in the Schools of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, but also confirmed by reason and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for both <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> confessed, A Physitian ought to be a Natural Phylosopher: And the words <hi>Naturallist,</hi> and <hi>Physitian</hi> are the

same: And that Natural Phylosophy is divided into Theorick and Practick, we prove by these Reasons:</p>

                     <item>
                        <p>1 Phylosophy, as the Ancients very wisely said, is a kind of Physick to cure the Diseases of the Mind.</p>
                        <p>The Diseases of the Mind may be divided into two Parts.</p>

                           <item>
                              <p>Secondly, Corruptions of Manners; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which, is, A vicious Life.</p>
                              <p>The Speculative part of Phylosophy is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for the first.</p>
                              <p>The Practical part for the last.</p>

                     <item>2 Because every Man naturally desires Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, both of those things which pertain to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions, which the Practice of Moral Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy wil amply instruct you in; as also of those things which make for the finding out of Truth; which knowledg Speculative Phylosophy wil bestow upon you.</item>
                     <item>3 Because the Subject of Knowledg is the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding which is two fold, <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Practick,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> wel teacheth in his Ethicks: Therfore Phylosophy must also be two fold, <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick</hi> and <hi>Speculative.</hi>

both Speculation and Practice, therefore Phylosophy is two fold, viz. Speculative and Practick.</item>
                     <item>5 Because every Learning tends to some good end: to attain which, is required Knowledg, which is the Speculative part; and Operation, which is the Practick.</item>
                     <item>6 All Learning was invented to direct those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Man which are in our own power, and so al viciated by the Fal of <hi>Adam.</hi> There are three sorts of Actions then, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Learning.</item>

                           <item>1 The Operations of the Understanding, which are rectified by Speculative Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</item>
                           <item>2 The Operations of Appetite both Rational and Sensitive, which are rectified by Moral Phylosophy.</item>
                           <item>3 Very many other operations of Man, either inherent in their Members, as Running and Leaping &amp;c. Or acted upon other things, as Building, Painting, &amp;c. And so both Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Arts as wel as Liberal, are rectified by Practick Phylosophy.</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>7 Because the Unity and Distinction of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, are taken from the Uniny and Distinction of the Object. But the Objects or Matters of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg are three; for they fall either under the Action, or Effect, or only under the Knowledg:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115407:74"/>
For whatsoever is only Speculative, was not made only to look upon, but to be produced to act or action. Hence you see that this division of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy into two parts, namely, <hi>Theorick</hi> and <hi>Practick,</hi> is very good: And if of Phylosophy, then of Physick, which indeed is but the putting of Phylosophy into practice, the one being Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial the other Remote.</item>

The truth is I could never see any at all; perhaps the Reason is, because I never wore Spectacles. 'Tis probable there may be two Muscles on the inside of the Ear; but those eight on the outside the Ear, came newly from <hi>Utopia,</hi> in the good Ship called the <hi>Ignorance.</hi> That Beasts move their Ears by a proper or voluntary motion is certain; but that Men do, unless they move Head and al I never yet saw, and as little beleeve.

But when Nature is not able to administer her Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as she ought to do the Disease takes Root in the Body, which brings forth fruit in its proper and appointed time. That which causeth these Diseases to take Root is Opportunity; for they search out a place where the Natural Balsom is weak, and the Spirits proper for the nourishing such an untoward Seed: as Hemlock and Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane grow neer the places where they empty Jakes, and Wormwood neer Iron works, because there both Earth and Air is convenient for them.</p>

such different effects in the Body of Man, as the Stone in one place, and the Gout in another.</p>

                     <p n="5">5 In the Preparation we are to consider the Composition and Preparation it self. Of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or Mixture of Medicines, we have told you before, what Opinion Alchymists have.</p>
                     <p>The Requisites of Composition are Measure and Dose.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 In Preparation consider the Cause and Effect. The Cause is Efficient or Final. The Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is acting or helping: Acting is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymist, who acteth by Solution and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Parts of Chymycal Operation are two, Solution and Coagulation, or if you please, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Generation.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Solution is the First part of Practical Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which takes a part the Compositions of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and attenuates them.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 It consists in Calcination, or Dissolution.</p>
                     <p>Calcination is done by Corroding or Burning.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Burning is done either by Combustion or Reverberation, Combustion is turning into ashes, or into Glass: Reverberation is either shut or open, which is done by the Fire of the Furnace.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Dissolution is when Bodies are dissolved; and it is either Subtil or Fusive.</p>
                     <p>Subtil is either Microcronical, or Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cronical
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:115407:183"/>
Microcronical, is either Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Descention. Elevation is Dry or Moist. Dry is called Sublimation, Moist Distillation.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 Distillation, is either Right or Oblique.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 Descension, is either Cold or Hot. Hot is that which is usually called Distillation by Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention. Cold Descention is either Deliquium or Filtration.</p>
                     <p>All things that are dissolved by Cold, are coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by Heat.</p>
                     <p n="14">14 Macrocronical, is Exaltation or Digestion. Exaltation is Circulation and Ablution. Ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Imbibition or Cohobation.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 Digestion is either Putrefaction or Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Putrefaction is to change the old Nature of a thing into a new.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 Fusion, or Liquefaction is Simple, or not Simple, and performs its Office either by Ashes or Antimony.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 Coagulation is the second part of Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which by privation of Moisture, reduceth moist Bodies into Solid.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 It is Cold or Hot. To Coagulation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Fermentation and Fixing.</p>
                     <p n="19">19 You have the Efficient Cause acting: The Helping follows, viz. Place and Fire.</p>
                     <p n="20">20 The Place, or the Subject of the Matter is, either that which receives the vessels, as a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace:

Or that which receives the Matter as ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>
                     <p n="21">21 In the Furnace are to be considered the Parts and Differences. The Parts of a Furnace are four.</p>
                     <p n="22">22 The Differences of Furnaces are various, according to their different Uses; of which, some are open, some shut.</p>
