            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

reason of our great transgressions, and hardnesse of heart. It was most just, O Lord, that thou didst lately threaten us with a pulling back and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all those Spirituall Graces and Temporall Blessings, wherewith this Island did flow and abound above all the nations of the earth: It was most just (and our sins did well deserve it) that thou, by withdrawing the Coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thy holy Spirit, shouldest suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Faith to grow weak and feeble, our Charity cold, our hope wavering and without foundation, our hearing of thy holy word, our partaking of thy blessed Sacraments, our Praying and Invocating of thy sacred Name, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in both Priest and People, for want of true Devotion and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward guidance of thy Spirit, but as it were so many outward Fashions, Forms, and Complements. And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially most agreeable it was unto all the Rules of thy Divine Justice, that from those in whom these Spirituall could not be found, thy Temporall blessings should be withdrawn: That our Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94234:2"/>
should be turned into Want and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, our Health into Sicknesses, Plagues, and Pestilences, and our long Peace (the Crown of all these blessings, and the Envie of all the Nations round about us) into the worst and most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable of all Wars, a Civil War, a War of Christian against Christian, Neighbours against Neighbours, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren against Brethren, a War of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> against <hi>Manasseh,</hi> of <hi>Manasseh</hi> against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and of both these against thy <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the more justly, O Lord, thou mightest have visited us in this thy fury and anger, the more are we, dust and ashes, worms &amp; no men, most wretched and miserable sinners, bound to praise and blesse thy holy Name for thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable goodnesse and mercies shewed unto us at this time: That it hath pleased thee, upon our weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy humiliation, to begin some small measure and degree of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us, to plant in our hearts some more sense and feeling of thy spirituall Graces, some more steadinesse of Faith,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94234:3"/>
fervencie of Love, assurance of Hope, Zeal in Prayer, Devotion in the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy holy Word, and in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and administring of those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Seals and Pledges of the same. And by and by after, as delighted with these green and raw fruits, which thine own hand had planted, to reward and crown them, unripned as they be, with great abundance of temporall blessings, with Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, with good times and seasons, with a shew rather then any showre of Diseases, which serve only to keep us awake, that we fall not into that former drowsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and forgetfulnes of our selves and thee.</p>
            <p>But especially, as a strong fence and hedge to compasse in and preserve all these outward Blessings, thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a speedy and a happy Union and Peace with all our Neighbours and Brethren of this Island, making us a multitude of one Heart and of one Soul, as thou hadst before made us a multitude of one Lord, one Faith, and one Baptisme.
