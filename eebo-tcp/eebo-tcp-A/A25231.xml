            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="13">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95763:3"/>13. There is an old Nurſe, to take care of all Sick and Weak Children, this Nurſe hath her Aſſiſtants if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p n="14">14. There are ſeveral Women to look after the Chambers, to Waſh and keep Clean all the Lodgings, make the Beds, and to do other neceſſary Work there.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Books are conſtantly made up every firſt <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> in every Month, and all Officers and Tradeſmen, and others, who are concerned in the Houſe, are cleared off.</p>
            <p n="16">16. There is alſo a Regiſter Book, kept to Regiſter the Names of all Worthy Perſons who ſhall be Benefactors to this good Work, and the ſame laid by for a time, to put the Children out with it, to Trades, as they grow fit; and the Juſtices of the Peace, once every year, at the Quarter Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, next after the Feaſt of the Birth of our Lord, yearly have conſtantly an Account thereof.</p>
            <div type="proposal">
               <head>A Propoſal for the better Education of Infants.</head>
               <p>ALtho many good Proviſions have been heretofore made by the Charity of well-diſpoſed Perſons, for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Education of Youth: Yet no Convenience or Education hath yet been thought on, or taken care of, for poor Infants, who can leaſt provide for themſelves, or be provided for.</p>
               <p>For want whereof, many great Evils and Inconveniences are daily found, by the wilful and careleſs cauſing, or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Infants to periſh, or to Suck in wicked and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Principles, to the Ruin, as 'tis to be feared, often of their Souls, as well as Bodies.</p>
               <p>Now for the remedying thereof, a General Nurſery, or Infantory, is recommended by His Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, at the Quarter Seſſions for <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95763:4"/>
to the Inhabitants therein, as by their Orders at their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seſſions may appear.</p>
               <p>And for that purpoſe, the Juſtices of the Peace of the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> have already diſpoſed of, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated a great publick Building, at <hi>Clerkenwell</hi> (whoſe good Examples, 'tis hop'd, will ſoon be followed by others) and ſuch Orders and Proviſions are there already made, that Infants ſhall be there Received and Provoided for, with all manner of Neceſſaries, and be Taught to Read and Write, and be bred up in true Religion and Virtue.</p>
               <p>And 'tis ſuppoſed, that when Perſons are ſatisfied of the great Conveniences and Advantages of this Infantory or Nurſery, many Charitable and Religious Perſons will be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Benefactors thereunto, whereby the Charge of the Maintenance and Education of the Poor may be at leaſt eas'd, if not wholly taken off.</p>
               <p>But the Children firſt brought in, muſt firſt be provided for, out of ſuch Charities.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who intend to give or leave any Sum of Money for the Proviſion of any Infant or Infants, may at the Houſe be very well ſatisfied of the Fund of Land for the ſecuring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and for the putting out of ſuch Children, or providing for them, when and in ſuch way as ſhall be thought for their Advantage, or according to ſuch Directions as the Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Benefactors ſhall direct.</p>
               <p>For 50 <hi>l.</hi> a Child will be wholly provided for, bred up, put forth Apprentice, and 10 <hi>l.</hi> given him, when out of his time, towards ſetting him up, beſides the benefit of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>For 120 <hi>l.</hi> a Child will be wholly provided for, bred up, put forth to a very good Trade, and have 100 <hi>l.</hi> given him to ſet up withal, when out of his Time.</p>
               <p>And according to the Sum or Sums of Money, that ſhall be given or left for, or toward ſuch Charity, the ſame being
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95763:4"/>
ſecured as above to their Satisfaction, the product ſhall be accounted for yearly, to the Juſtice of the Peace, in your <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Quarter Seſſions, if no other Perſon or Perſons be appointed by ſuch Benefactor, to Overſee, and take ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>
               <p>The great Conveniences and Advantages by this Nurſery will be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the Fatherleſs and Motherleſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Poor; the Trouble and Charge of Breeding up ſuch Infants, taking them much off from earning their Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To all ſuch whoſe Employments require, or cauſe their Abſence from their Dwellings, as Seafaring Men, uſers of Fairs and Markets.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And to all ſuch as would not otherwiſe keep Houſes, unleſs it were for the Looking after, and Breeding up their Children.</p>
               <p>It is alſo believed this Proviſion may prevent the great Trouble and Charge to all perſons, by Children left and laid in the ſeveral Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>Or that at leaſt it may eaſe the Pariſhes, and their Officers, in Providing for, and Breeding up of their Pariſh Children.</p>
               <p>And by this Education, we may be aſſured there will be better Subjects, better Maſters, and better Apprentices and Servants, for all perſons that ſhall need them.</p>
               <p>And as this good Work takes, many other Propoſals ſhall be made for the taking off, and wholly providing for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, for ſmall ſums of Money, which ſhall be ſecured by certain and ſufficient Funds.</p>
               <p>The Rates propos'd for ſuch Maintenance and Education are,</p>
               <p>Twenty Shillings Entrance, which is for new Cloaths and Bedding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95763:5"/>And 3 <hi>s.</hi> a Week, for Meat, Drink, Cloaths, and all other things, for the future.</p>
               <p>The Days to receive them, are <hi>Thurſdays</hi> weekly, from Nine till Noon, at the Nurſery or Infantory at <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But the Place and Accommodation being ſo much approved of by all that ſee it, and the Confluence of People thither on thoſe days being great, for the greater eaſe and diſpatch to the buſineſs, It is deſired that all Perſons approving of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, will come and bring in their Children on the <hi>Mondays</hi> before, and leave the Name and Age of the Child with the Officer, who is appointed to attend there on thoſe days to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That you may take the Child away at any time, when you have an Opportunity of a better Proviſion for it, and the new Cloaths with it.</p>

                  <hi>Midd. ſſ</hi> WE the Grand Jury ſworn for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> this preſent <hi>Midſummer</hi> Seſſions, do preſent, That the General Nurſery or Colledg of Infants, is one of the beſt and moſt charitable works that has for theſe many years been ſet on foot; and we find by what we now ſee, and by the Character which is every where given of it, That the Children are well educated in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Virtue, and provided for with all things neceſſary; and we are convinced that this way of Education will prevent many great evils which are now daily practiced by breeding up of youths; and we are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the Church-Wardens and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers cannot do a more Charitable deed with their publick money, than by ſending their Infants to that place; for incouragement whereof we humbly thank the Juſtices of Peace: And we deſire, That they will in their ſeveral Stations and Places order their Officers of their ſeveral Pariſhes to ſend their Infants to the ſaid Nurſery to be maintained at the publick Charge.</p>

think convenient to come before them, and examine the ſaid Officers and Perſons concerning the diſpoſal of the ſaid Pariſh Children for Seven years laſt paſt, and what is now become of them. And the ſaid Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices are hereby further deſired to make a Report to this Court, in Writing under their hands, how they ſhall find the true ſtate of the Premiſes, and how they ſhall find the Muſter-Roll of the Pariſh Children in the ſaid Pariſh, at the General Seſſions of the Peace to be held for this County, next after <hi>Hillary</hi> Term now next enſuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Report.</hi> Whereas by an Order made at laſt <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Quarter Seſſions, it was deſired and referred to Sir <hi>Thomas Rowe</hi> Knight, <hi>John Phelips</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and ſeveral other his Majeſties Juſtices for the ſaid County to Examine what Children the Pariſh of St. <hi>Clements Danes</hi> have had under their care for Seven years paſt, and how many of them have been put forth Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices; and what charge the Pariſh hath been at with the ſaid Children, and how many of them now are in being.</p>
               <p>We the ſaid Juſtices do Report as followeth, That we inſpected the ſaid Books, and do find that in the year 1679. there were then at the charge of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, 89 Children; of which 16 were Foundlings, all <hi>Clements</hi>: And we find there hath been added to the charge of the Pariſh 110 in the following Six years, in all 199. of which 51. are <hi>Clements,</hi> Children laid in the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>We find that of theſe 55. hath been put forth to Apprentice, and that there are now in being 32 of the ſaid 55. only.</p>
               <p>And we find that there now remains of Children at the charge of the Pariſh, 58. of which 13. are <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95763:11"/>And of the Apprentices living, 32, of which 3 are Clements. In all 90.</p>
               <p>We find that the Officers have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for Nurſing theſe Children, in the Seven years laſt paſt. 1943.l. 09.s. 0.d.</p>
               <p>And for Binding forth the Apprentices 0109.l. 08.s. 0.d.</p>
               <p>In all. 2052.l. 17.s. 0.d.</p>
               <p>And we further find that they have given away on Extraordinary Charges at their pleaſure, ſome of which are for the Children. 2708.l. 16.s. 05.d.</p>
               <p>All which we ſubmit to this honourable Court. <hi>Tho. Rowe. Jo. Phelips. Peter Lucy. Sim. Parry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Note that Seven years ago, the Pariſh had 89. Children; and that 110. have been ſince added, in all 199. of theſe Apprentices accounted in, there is but 90. left. So that 109 are loſt and dead, in the ſaid Seven years, or never were,</p>
               <p>Though payed for in their Books.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Note that of 55. bound out Apprentices in theſe Seven years laſt paſt, which coſt the Pariſh 109. <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>s.</hi> there is only left 32.</p>
               <p>And how many of the 32. will ſtay to ſerve out their Time, is to be enquired further off.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Note that 51. of the 110. were Foundlings, all <hi>Clements,</hi> laid in the Pariſh, in Six years laſt; and ſo take the name of <hi>Clement,</hi> from the Pariſh, and 16. were then there, in all 79. the firſt year of the Inſpection, in all 97. now only 3. are bound out Apprencies, and 13.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95763:12"/>
are left, the firſt number 16. and 51. all <hi>Clements</hi> add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are all loſt and dead; now the Pariſh-Books have been ſearched how many were Chriſtned of theſe Foundlings, or <hi>Clements,</hi> or buried; and very few ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon the Regiſter: It is queſtionable if they ever were all there, though payed for.</p>
               <p>It is much that 51 ſhould die out of 67. in Seven year.</p>
               <p>The particuler Money payed for Nurſing of theſe Children, is 1943. <hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>s.</hi> 0. <hi>d.</hi> in Seven year. Now judg if well diſpoſed.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95763:12"/>
places, it will take much time and expence to perform; it will be a great eaſe in the Charge, for theſe Children placed in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Nurſery, will be taken from the Pariſhes without charge, for their Education ſake; and the Pariſhes will ſave 3.4 or 5 <hi>l.</hi> a piece, by giving Money to Bind them Apprentices, and providing Cloathes for them, and by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Addition of Money when any are ſick, all which is by this Proviſion ſaved to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pariſhes; and we do for our ſelves and the whole County whom we repreſent, give our humble thanks to the Juſtices of Peace of this County, for their ſetting a foot ſo good a work; And we give our hearty thanks to Sir <hi>Thomas Rowe</hi> for his great care in the prudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement thereof, and deſire that they will encourage the ſame by ſending thither ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Pariſh Children as the Houſe can receive, for we conceive the Officers of the ſeveral Pariſhes cannot better provide for their poor Infant Children, nor can the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Money raiſed for that purpoſe, be better imployed, than by paying for their Infant-Children in that place.</p>

               <p>The advantages that all perſons will receive by this College of Infants.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By breeding the Pariſh Children in this way, they will be taken for Apprentices to very good Trades, or Servants for their Education ſake; and the Pariſhes ſave the Money they now give with them, and the Cloathes they provided.</p>

There is no accidental Charge, can be charged upon them by the Officers of the Pariſhes either for Sickneſs, Cloathes, or any other accident, the 3. <hi>s. per</hi> Week, being the whole charge in the College, and thereby the accidental Book of the Pariſh will be much leſſened.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No Child can be payed for, that is not, nor any longer than they are alive; and the Officers of the Pariſhes will with much more eaſe and ſatifaction adjuſt their Accounts when they produce an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Houſe for a Voucher.</p>

               <p>The Tradeſman may leave off Houſe-keeping, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving here provided for his Child, and may ſee it every Day without trouble or more charge.</p>
               <p>The dying man may be ſure of a Proviſion for his Child, for leaving 50 <hi>l.</hi> to the Houſe, his Child is taken care of, put forth Apprentice, and ſhall have 10 <hi>l.</hi> out of the 50 <hi>l.</hi> to ſet up withal; what more he leaves, is to be accounted for every year to the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at every <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Seſſions, if he by Will leaves no body elſe, and the Intereſt made Principal, and a good Fund in Land is now ſetled for the performance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and at the houſe they may be ſatisfied therein; and a man may find many perſons who will ſee this done, to whoſe care if the Money and Child were left, the Money might be loſt and ſpent, and the child come to the Pariſh.</p>
