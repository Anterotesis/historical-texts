            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAjor <hi>White,</hi> a Member of this Army, long ſince at <hi>Putney</hi> foretold, <hi>That ſhortly there would be no other power in</hi> England <hi>but the power of the Sword:</hi> and <hi>Will: Sedgwick</hi> in his Book called Juſtice upon the Armies Remonſtrance, ſaith, the Principle of this Army is, <hi>To break the Powers of the Earth to pieces:</hi> and <hi>John Lylburne</hi> in his Plea for Common Right, <hi>pag.</hi> 6. ſaith, <hi>The Army by theſe extraordinary proceedings, have overturned all the viſible Supream Authority of this Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, They have, and will, by ſeizing upon the Members of Parliament, diſſolving it, and ſetting up a new invented Repreſentative, and bring the KING to capitall puniſhment, and diſ-inheriting His Poſterity, ſubvert the Monarchicall Government, and Parliaments of this Kingdome; the Lawes and Liberties of the People, and ſo by bringing all to Anarchy and Confuſion, put the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Land under the Arbitrary power of the Sword.</p>
            <p>In order to which they have, and will overturn the Government of the City of <hi>London</hi> by a Lord Mayor and Aldermen; and Governe it by Commiſſioners, and a ſchiſmaticall Common Councell of Anabaptiſts, illegally choſen; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Charter of Incorporation and Franchiſes; and this ſhall be a leading caſe to all the Corporations of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their next deſigne is, to Plunder, and Diſ-arme the City of <hi>London,</hi> and all the Country round about; thereby to diſable them to riſe when the Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves, but not to the uſe of the Souldiers, (although they greedily expect the firſt week in <hi>February</hi> the time appointed) from whom they will redeeme the Plunder at an eaſie rate; and ſo ſell it in Bulk to the Jewes, whom they have lately admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſet up their bancks, and magazines of Trade amongſt us, contrary to an Act of Parliament for their baniſhment; and theſe ſhall be their Merchants to buy off for ready money, (to maintain ſuch wars as their violent proceedings will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably bring upon them) not only all Sequeſtred, and Plundred goods, but alſo the very bodies of Men, Women, and Children, whole Families taken Priſoners for ſale, of whom theſe Jewiſh merchants ſhall keep a conſtant traffique with the <hi>Turks, Moores,</hi> and other <hi>Mahometans;</hi> the <hi>Barbadus,</hi> and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already cloyed with <hi>Welch, Scottiſh, Colcheſter,</hi> and other Priſoners impoſed by way of ſale upon the Adventurers; and this is the meaning of <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> threat to the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, That if another War followed, they will ſpare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, Woman, nor Child: For the better carrying on of which Deſigne, the ſaid Caball, or Junto, keep a ſtrict correſpondency with <hi>Owen Roe Oneal,</hi> the bloudy Popiſh Antimonarchicall Rebell in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Popes Nuntio there. The Antimonarchicall Marqueſſe of <hi>Argyle</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> the <hi>Pariſian, Norman,</hi> and Picarde Rebels in <hi>France,</hi> and the Rebell King of <hi>Portugall.</hi> If danger be not held ſo cloſe to your eyes that you cannot diſcerne it, look about you <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But this Kingdome is not to be ſaved by men that will ſave themſelves: nothing but a Private hand, and a Publick ſpirit can redeeme it.</p>
