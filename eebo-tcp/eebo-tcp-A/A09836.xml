            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The whiche ſacrament trewely is more excellente, then other myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and lawes, in that it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned before them, ordeyned I ſay, not of the imagination and in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uention
<pb facs="tcp:4573:6"/>
of men, but of god, prynce of all, euen from the fyrſte begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of the worlde, before any ſynne, in the tyme of innocency, for the lauful offyce and propagation of mankynde. All other preceptes, commaundementes, and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that after the fal of man cam forth for the reparation, ſafegard, remedy, correction, and puniſſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were ſcaſely admytted of a fewe, when this ſacrament of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, through all partes of the worlde, and by the conſente of all men, was receiued and taken. And farther it was no leſſe ſtrengthned and maynteyned with the power of god, then it was by his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and wyſedome ordeyned. For god the maker of al thynges, wold this moſt holy bonde ſo to be knit with indiſſoluble glewe, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer,
<pb facs="tcp:4573:6"/>
that the huſbande in his wife, and the wife in her huſband, ſhuld alwayes bothe lyue and abyde, as a bone of bones, &amp; fleſhe of fleſhe. For this was the fyrſt commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of god, inſtitutynge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony: The man ſhall forſake <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> his father and mother, and ſhall cleaue vnto his wife, and they ſhal be two in oone fleſſhe. Whiche thynge we rede not only in the old teſtamente, but the ſelfe ſame is confyrmed in the goſpell, that by no diuerſitie of maners, by no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie or lothſomnes, not for age, barennes, or ſyckenes, nor for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, lepry, or any other conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſe diſeaſe, and briefely for no cryme of hereſy, nor by any mans power, that ſacrament at any time ought to be broken. When Chriſt commaundeth, that whom the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtye

power of god hath ones <note place="margin">Matth. 16. Marc. 20.</note> ioyned together, noo power ſhall preſume to ſeparate. Nor it can be laufull for any cauſe, the wyfe to forſake her huſbonde, or the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande his wyfe, bycauſe it is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for no manne to departe from him ſelfe, nor no man to leaue him ſelfe. For ſhe whiche is made of a mannes rybbe, of fleſſhe, the ſame fleſhe, and the ſame bone of bones for an helpe vnto the man: God neuer wold her to be ſeperate from the man, but for fornication: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che one onely cauſe, God dyd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte. But if for any other cauſe the ſtronge bonde, and vnytie of matrimony be louſed, yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones beinge ſeparate, be and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne manne and wyfe, nor they with whom they be coupled after theyr deuorſe, can be excuſed from

aduoutry. And therfore Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, ſayinge: He that after his <note place="margin">Matt. 16.</note> wife is dimiſſed for aduoutry, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth an other woman, commyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth aduoutry: and he that dothe mary her that is ſo letten go, is an aduoutrer.

            <p>¶ The fyrſt cauſe is taken, where god dydde inſtitute this holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterye vnder theſe wordes: It is <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> not good a man to be alone, let vs make for hym an helper lyke hym ſelfe.

For one rybbe at the begynnynge was turned in to one wyfe. And there <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> ſhal be ſaith god, two in one fleſhe. He ſayth not, three or mo. And in <note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> the arch of Noe god commaunded no mo women to be preſerued then men, that for one man there ſhuld be but one wyfe. For where a man
<pb facs="tcp:4573:9"/>
hath many wyues, or a womanne many huſbandes: there the vnitie of matrimony faylethe. Therfore her alone that a man hath taken to his wyfe, the ſame let hym kepe without violation of kyndeneſſe, to the laſt ende of his lyfe in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte loue and continuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. Let the father gyue place, the mother gyue place, the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the brothers and ſyſters, let al the heape of frendes gyue place to the ſwete beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and entier loue of man and wife, and that for great ſkyl. For the father, mother, chyldren, brethern, ſyſters, kynſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, be the frendes of nature, and workes of fortune: man and wyfe be the miſtery of god. And the man had a wyfe, &amp; the wyfe a huſband, before father, mother, brother, or chyldren. And therfore it was com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded <note place="margin">Gea. 2.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:4573:10"/>
to the man, to leaue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, ſyſters, brethern, and chyldren, and cleaue to his wyfe, that aboue all other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he ſhuld kepe to his liues end that thynge, whiche was fyrſte of all gyuen vnto hym: nor that one of them ſhuld at any tyme be with out the other, of whome the one was not made without the other. Wherfore the chyldren to departe from theyr parentes, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes to leaue theyr chyldren, no lawe forbyddeth, ſometyme neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie compelleth, profyte ſtyrreth, conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moueth, the children often tymes be dymiſſed from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie of theyr parentes, they ofte chalenge to them ſelfe lybertie by religion, often tymes in ſtraunge countreys they get they lyuynge, &amp; in other places ſeke theyr dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge:

but the wyfe from her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, or the husbande from his wyfe, no lawe, no neceſſitie, no pro fyte, no conſideration, no deuorſe, no religion, no licence, no abſence, dothe permytte to departe. For whiche of theym, that leaueth or neglecteth to kepe company toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſame as forſaken, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary alone, muſt of neceſſitie lede a lyfe moſte wretched, deſtitute of all gladneſſe and helpe, bycauſe the helpe that was made for hym of god, and the companion of ioye and gladnes to hym gyuen, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glectynge depyſeth to take, or con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temptuouſiy is bolde to leaue and forſake.</p>
            <p>¶ The ſeconde cauſe of matrymo ny, we ſhewed to be for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of chyldren, as it is red, where god bleſſed Adam and Eue, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge:
<pb facs="tcp:4573:11"/>
Encreaſe, and multiply, and <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> replenyſhe the earthe. Which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge after the floudde, was euen freſhe agayn renewed by the ſame wordes. The effect wherof is, that <note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> man ſhulde render to nature, that he had borowed of her, and to the image of god, ſhulde brynge forth and nouryſſhe chyldren lyke hym ſelfe, and reſtore the comon felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp of mankinde with a certayne ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to kepe it perpetual. which bleſſinge he that dyd not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, in the old lawe, was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all men curſed and moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, as it is wrytten: Curſed is ſhe, that hath not ſede in Iſraell, and bleſſed is he, whoſe ſede is in Syon. Whervpon Abraham for <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 15. 18.</note> the meryte of his fayth, was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his generation, and Sara beinge then olde, and paſt chylde
<pb facs="tcp:4573:11"/>
bearynge, dyd put awaye the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her barennes, with this bleſſing of generation. For in this ſacrament it is not the meryte of nature, to conceyue chyldren, but the bleſſynge of almyghtye God, and a miſtery far paſſynge the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytes of nature. Whiche thynge was not vnknowen to Jacob the Patriarch, the whiche when his wyfe Rachel thought that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companienge with her husbande, was to gyue chyldren, ſaid to him, Gyue me chyldren, or elles I am but deade, Jacob anſwered: Am <note place="margin">Gen. 30.</note> I then in goddes ſtede, which ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the fruite of thy wombe from the? And Iſaac made interceſſion <note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note> to god, for his wyfe, bycauſe ſhe was bareyn, whiche harde his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and made her to conceyue. For they knewe, that the frutes of
<pb facs="tcp:4573:12"/>
matrimony were of god, not of na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture. And of this the baſtarde chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be called naturall: but thoſe that come of matrimony, be onely laufull. And therfore he is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to holy orders, whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not knytte to his father by laufull copulation in this mooſte worthy ſacrament of matrimony, for a bond of perpetual felowſhip. For a baſtarde ſhall not enter into <note place="margin">Deut. 14.</note> the churche of god. Which baſtard alſo is ſtraytely prohybited, bothe by humayne lawes and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wyſe men, to be the heyre of temporal landes and goodes. For they haue no laufull heyre, whiche by neglectynge and deſpiſing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, at the wanton and enty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge luſte of the fleſhe, vnlauful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take theyr congreſſe. And it is the common ſentence and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:4573:12"/>
of lawiers, that he hathe an vncertayne father, and a naughty mother, whiche is not borne in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trimony. For he is baſe borne, and is the ſonne of the people, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſonne of no man, which is the chylde of a woman not lauful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maryed. But he is the true heir, and trewe ſonne, whoſe mother, without the infamy of ſinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the blame of kynsfolke, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the offence of god, to a certayn and well knowen father, with the dignite of matrimonye, and with fruite certayn is maried, and with out ſclander abydeth by hym con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynually. Therfore onely matry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony maketh chyldren to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, &amp; giueth vndoubtful heires it maketh honeſt the couplynge of nature, and for ſinne it giueth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte, it increaſeth the ſtocke and
<pb facs="tcp:4573:13"/>
out the conſent of eyther of theym that is coupled, the other without ſynne, maye not intende to prayer, if therby it myght chance the other to be defrauded, or lacke the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall duetie. For (as the Apoſtle ſayth) the woman hath not power <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> of her body, but the man: and like wyſe the man hath not power of his body, but the womanne. So great is the knotte of this bonde, that though for incontinency alon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly it be taken, yet if one of the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples afterward wold continually lyue continently, in no wyſe it can be done, but with the others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yea and though bothe do con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent, yet it can in no wyſe be taken, that the matrimonye is diſſolued. So he that for cauſe of bryngyng forth of chyldren maryeth, can not without ſynne put awaye his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<pb facs="tcp:4573:13"/>
wyfe, and mary an other, wher by he might haue chyldren. Which thyng alſo as wytneſſen Ualerius Maximus, Plutarch, and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius Halicarnaſſeus, was obſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued and kept amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Romains after the Citie was buylded, fyue hundreth and twenty yeres, to the tyme of Spurius Carbilius, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che fyrſte of all other preferrynge the deſyre to haue chyldren, aboue his fidelitie in wedlocke, not with out his greate blame, forſoke his wyfe for barenneſſe. But nowe I wyll retourne.</p>
            <p>¶ God the creator of all thynges, wolde this moſte holy bonde to be ſo faſte and indyſſoluble, that for what cauſe ſo euer it was ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne, by no power or ſtrength at any tyme it ſhoulde be dyſſolued. He wolde it to be ſo generall, and
<pb facs="tcp:4573:14"/>
throughout al the worlde, ſo pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all mennes myndes, that no man ſhulde auoyde this moſte ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt miſtery, without mooſte gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous offence, excepte he wolde vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forſake all humanytie. For he the fyrſte auctor of wedlocke, &amp; god before all matrymony (when he wold take on hym the nature of man) wolde his mother fyrſte to mary. And though without mans ſede he wold be borne of a virgin, yet he wold not be borne of her out of wedlocke, but of his mother ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried, thoughe not defoyled with man. For he wolde not his mother to be vnmaryed, that by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers example, he myghte exhorte vs to the very ſame.</p>
            <p>¶ Therfore what ſo euer they be that regarde not this mooſte aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and moſte holy ordinaunce,
<pb facs="tcp:4573:14"/>
as diſpiſers of goddes and mans lawes, ſhall be iuged to perpetual fyre, euen lyke the drye and baren trees. And therfore in the old law, they that in theyr rype age, did not mary a wyfe, were put forth of the temples, theyr offerynges were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, they were counted not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receyue herytages and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes, vnworthy of goddes and mannes helpe, whiche deſpyſynge goddes and mannes lawes, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take the helpe ordeyned for them of god, and ſtablyſhed by the lawes of man. Neuertheleſſe two kyndes of menne maye be excepte from contracting matrimony, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che for weakenes of nature, be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly not apt for it, as they that be colde of nature, bewyched and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted, madde perſonnes, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, feble perſons, and ſuche as
<pb facs="tcp:4573:15"/>
be gelded, and thoſe whiche being moued with the ſpirit of god haue choſen perpetuall chaſtytie. For this ſort, religion diſchargeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bonde of matrimony: and the other ſorte, by naturall impedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is excuſed. But who ſo euer be not of one of thoſe two kyndes, let them well knowe, that they are ſo bounden to contracte matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that if they leaue it, or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde it (except they be greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant) they are vnworthy of the kyngedome of god. yet for al that, no manne ſhulde be compelled by force, to contracte matrimony. For in as moche as this bond is made by onely conſent of loue, it oughte ſpecially to be free, for loue it ſelfe, is at no mannes commandement. For the gyftes of ryche menne bye not loue, no dignitie, nor yet nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb facs="tcp:4573:15"/>
counteruayleth loue, no thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges or vyolence of great men of power, can compell loue, which god him ſelfe doth not conſtraine, but from the begynnynge created it free. And there is no loue ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, and ſo ſtedfaſt as betwene the husband and the wyfe. There is nothynge of greatter force, then the tender loue of the wife, the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che no diſloyaltie corrupteth, noo misfortune cauſeth to ſlyde, noo ſtrang acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce withdraweth, no age, no proceſſe of tyme conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. And therfore by the coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement <note place="margin">Gen. 2. Matth. 19.</note> of god, the loue of the wife ſhoulde be preferred before father and mother, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, brothers and ſyhers, kynsfolke, alyaunce, and all other thynges. Wherfore they moſte greuouſly offende, what ſo euer they be, parentes, nere kyns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, maners, and ſpecyally of goddes commaundemente. And hereof at lengeth do ryſe betwene man and wyfe, fornication, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, debate, raylinge wordes, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinuall

And alſo other whyle poyſonynge, ſlaugher, and violent murther enſueth: that it maye be ſene, that it was not god but the dyuell, that coupled ſuche <note place="margin">Tobi. 6.</note> perſonnes to gether.</p>
            <p>¶ Furthermore in many places, certayne worldly prynces and lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome, the enemyes of god, blaſphemers of Jeſu Chriſt, defilers of holy thynges, preſump<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuouſely takynge vpon them that perteyneth to god, at theyr volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary wyl, yea and ſomtime at their expreſſe commaundement, compel theyr ſubiectes to mary. purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge moreouer to theyr cofers the dymes of dowryes, not without abominable ſacrilege, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing the aduouterers, they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhe

            <p>¶ There is alſo an other no leſſe damnable cuſtome, whiche hath taken place among many nations to ſpeake commonly euyll of them that mary the ſecond time. yea and moreouer they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne them that mary agayne in a certayne ſomme of money, and the ſame they ley vp for a knotte of good company, to make mery with, and they make Joſeph the husbande of the moſte bleſſed vyrgin Mary, the patrone of this ſo wicked ſclander againſt goddes miſterye. But the dyuell hath found theſe felowſhyps and brotherhed, and the anger of god, hath delyuered them into a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſence, that they reioyſynge at <note place="margin">Roma. 1.</note> adultery, horedome, and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

ſhulde rayle vppon ſeconde mariages, as who ſayth the grace of god is voyde in ſuch mariages, mockinge that ſacrament, to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che all honour, reuerence, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, is gyuen. But this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faſcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be taken away and plucked cleane out of the dommy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Fraunce: for trewely the ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers therof can not in any poynte do more ſeruice to god, &amp; profit the chryſten common welthe, then to do this, that is to ſaye, that good thynges maye be taught, and euel thynges maye be banyſſhed, not onely that perteine to the common ſocietie of men, but alſo to goddes religion.</p>
            <p>¶ Thou therfore, who ſoo euer thou arte, that wyll take a wyfe, let loue be the cauſe, not ſubſtance of goodes, choſe a wyfe, not a gar
<pb facs="tcp:4573:18"/>
ment, let thy wyfe be maryed vnto the, not her dowrye. With this mynde almighty god beinge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to called (whiche alone gyueth a trewe wyfe) and the conſent of the parentes alſo required, and dewe obedieuce ſhewed vnto them, al co uetouſneſſe, deſyre of honour, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, and feare, ſette a parte, with a temperate deliberation in thy ſelfe with conſent, free and feruent, but reaſonable and chaſt loue, ſo take thy wyfe, commytted and gyuen to the for euer by the hand of god, for thy continuall felowſhyp, not to ſeruice and bondage. Whome thou oughteſte to rule with thy wiſedome, with all fauour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence. And let not her be ſubiect vnto the, but let her be with the in all truſt and counſayle, &amp; let her be in thy houſe, not as a drudge, but
<pb facs="tcp:4573:18"/>
as maiſtreſſe of the houſe, in thy houſeholde not as a mayden, but a mother, &amp; a brynger vp of thoſe children that thou ſhalt begette of her, whiche ſhall be lordes of thy goodes, and repreſent thy name, to ſuch as ſhal come after the. And ſo thou canſte not choſe but haue a good wyfe, and good chyldren, for an euyll wyfe neuer happeneth but to an euyl husband. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wyfe, the name can not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, nor the progeny endure, nor the ſtock increace, nor a family be, nother a father of houſholde na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor a houſe called, nor a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welthe ſtand, nor any impire endure. This thynge the buylder of the Romayne impire ryght well dyd knowe, whiche (when he lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wiues for his ſubiectes) made a ſharpe and fierſe battayle with
<pb facs="tcp:4573:19"/>
the Sabinis, that denyed theyr doughters. For he knew very wel, that his impire coulde not conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, if wyues ſhuld be awaye. For ſeing that a citie ſtandeth of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the common welth of pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate thynges, and of rulynge of a houſholde, and family, the diſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyne to gouerne a common welth is ordeyned: howe ſhall he rule a citie, that hath not lerned to rule a houſe? howe ſhall he gouerne a common welthe, that neuer knewe his priuate and familiar buſines? Nereof Socrates teſtified, that he lerned morall philoſophy more of wyues, then naturall philoſophy, of Anaxagoras and Archelaus. For trewely matrimony gyueth a gret ererciſe to moral philoſophy. For it hath a certayne houſeholde common welth annexed, in ruling
<pb facs="tcp:4573:19"/>
the whiche a man maye ſone lerne and haue experyence of wiſedome, temperaunce, loue to god and his kynne, and all other vertues, by which in louyng his wyfe, in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge vp his children, in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge his famyly, in ſauynge his goodes, in ruling his littel houſe, in procreatynge and enlargynge his ſtocke, he may leade a life moſt happy. Furthermore to ſee before a mannes eyes, his well beloued wife, and by chyldren and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to haue his family and name extended, is great gladnes and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, it is the ſwete conſolation of trauayle. He that wanteth a wyfe, hath noo houſe, bycauſe he hath not ſetled a houſe, yea and if he haue, he taryeth in it as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in his mne. He that hath not a wyfe, though he be neuer ſo riche,
<pb facs="tcp:4573:20"/>
hath almoſte nothyng that is his, bycauſe he hath nothing ſafe from deceytes, nor he hath not to whom he myghte leaue, nor to whom he myghte truſte. He that hath not a wyſe, lacketh a famylye, lacketh his nye kynred, and without hope of ſucceſſion is alwayes left alone and forſaken. His ſeruantes ſteale from hym, his felowes bribe from hym, his neighbours deſpiſe him, his frendes regarde hym not, his nye kinred begile him, his baſtard chyldren if he haue any, be ſhame and rebuke to hym, and wytneſſe of his iniquitie, nor he can leaue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ryches, nor the name of his famyly, but as he taryeth in lyfe without maryage, ſoo beinge dead, his periſheth without name, nor in this lif he deſerueth to haue any beneuolence orloue, which is
<pb facs="tcp:4573:20"/>
greateſt comforte to man. But as a forſaker of mans nature, worthy of all calamitie, is moſte vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate counted of all men, and moſt worthy to be forſaken. And hereof Lycurgus made a lawe, that who at conuenient tyme did not regard to mary, they in the ſommer tyme ſhoulde be kepte backe from open plaies and ſportes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al paſtime, and mery ſyghtes: and in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhuld be led bare round about the market place, and vexed with mockes and ſcornes, abhored and cried out apon of all men, ſo that they ſhulde confeſſe that they dyd ryghtuouſely ſuffer, bycauſe they deſpiſed relygyon, obeyed not the lawes, offended agaynſte nature, and as moch as was in them, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that neyther common welthe, impire, nor religion coulde ſtande,
<pb facs="tcp:4573:21"/>
bycauſe they had not endeuoured them ſelues, to begette thoſe, by whom theſe thinges ſhuld be mein<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teined and vpholden. Plato in his lawes ordeyned, he that maryed not a wyfe ſhulde be put backe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al common office and honour, and ſhoulde be ouerate with common charges more greuous then other citizens were. And Auguſtus Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar made a lawe, that yonge men ſhulde mary wyues, and increaſe the people of Rome. whiche lawe many other afterward confirmed, And more ouer granted to be free from common offyce a yere. and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted out of the comon treaſure a rewarde to hym that maryed a wyfe a newe. Aduoutries euerye where in the old time always were greuouſly punyſſhed with mooſte ſharpe lawes, bycauſe that matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb facs="tcp:4573:21"/>
being ones violate, there is not onely wrong done to man, but to god hym ſelf. And hereof in the <note place="margin">Leuiti. 20. Deut. 22. Exod. 22.</note> olde lawe, who ſo euer with brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng matrimony, had committed aduoutry, was aduidged to be ſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to deathe. But he that toke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way other mennes goodes, and ſo commytted theft, was puniſhed in foure double and fyue double as moche. For this man vnlaufullye toke awaye mennes goodes, and worldly thynges, the other beſides the offence and hurt of his neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour yea being miuriouſe to god, doth diſhoneſt the godly thinges. The Romayne lawes condemne to deathe aduoutrers, and permit alſo vnto the husband without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iugement and without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to ſle thaduoutrer take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which lyberty is not gyuen to hym
<pb facs="tcp:4573:22"/>

For nature maketh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, a wyfe is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of god. &amp; I thinke that he can not be with ſufficient puniſhment vexed, which was ſo hardy to ſlee his helpe, comforte, and ſuccour, and his companion to lyue with, gyuen to hym by god. For he is cruell vpon the gyfte of god, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked agaynſte the holy, a defyler of nature, and miurious to god. And therfore alſo the lawes canon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beade hym the felowſhyp and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany of men, ſhut hym forth of the churche, forbeade and take awaye from hym ſeconde maryages, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye vnto hym the holy ſacrament, iudgynge hym vnworthye of the
