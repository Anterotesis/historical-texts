            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas long ſince, for eaſe of the People, both Houſes in a full and free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Voted the Disbanding of this Army: in oppoſition to which, ſome great Officers of the ſaid Army, (to continue their rich Commands) with ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of Commons, (who daily inrich themſelves by the troubles of the times) ſecretly mutinied the Army againſt the Parliament. And whereas, lately the farre major part of the Houſe of Commons, pitying the bleeding condition, and teares of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed People, Voted, and entred into a Perſonall Treaty with the <hi>King:</hi> without which (by the Armies own confeſſion in their Remonſtrance at St. <hi>Albons,</hi> pag. 64.) there can be no Peace; which the Army interrupted by obtruding upon the Commons a Treaſonable Remonſtrance, 20 <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1648. tending to deſtroy the King, and His Poſterity, and wholly to ſubvert all Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Religion, Lawes, and Liberties for ever; whereby the Commons in Parliament found it abſolutely neceſſary to prevent ſuch pernitious innovations, by concluding a ſafe Peace with His Majeſty; whereupon (after mature debate) the Houſe of Commons the 5 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1648. Voted, That <hi>the Kings Anſwer to the Propoſitions of both Houſes upon the Treaty, were a ground for the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to proceed to the ſettlement of a ſafe and well-grounded Peace:</hi> Upon which, the Generall, and Councell of Warre, Wedneſday morning 6 <hi>December</hi> 1648. Seized and Impriſoned 41 of the Members going to the Houſe of Commons to do their Duty, ſecluded above 160 other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, beſides 40 or 50 Members who voluntarily withdrew themſelves to avoid their violence; leaving only their own engaged party of 40 or 50 Members ſitting, who now paſſe Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, of the Houſe of Commons (as they call them) without the Lords; and comply with the ſaid Councell of Warre, to carry on their ſaid Remonſtrance: To which purpoſe this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remnant of the Commons have un-voted in a thinne Houſe, under the force of the Army, what was deliberately Voted in a full and free Houſe; whereas by their own Ordinance paſſed upon the Tumult of <hi>Apprentiſes,</hi> 20 <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1647. to null, and make void <hi>ab initio,</hi> all Acts, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Votes, &amp;c. paſſed under the ſaid force; This remaining Party ought not to ſit, act, nor take upon them the ſtyle of a Houſe, under ſo viſible, actuall, and horrid a Force.</p>

We doe farther De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and proteſt againſt this preſent Houſe of Commons illegall Acts, Order, or Ordinance, for erecting a High Court of Juſtice, and uſurping a Power, without any Law or preſident, to Try, Depoſe, and bring to capitall puniſhment the <hi>King,</hi> and to diſ-inherit His <hi>Poſterity,</hi> or any of them, and againſt the ſaid Generall Councell of Officers, aiding &amp; abetting them therein, as <hi>highly impious</hi> againſt the Law of God, Nations, &amp; the Proteſtant Profeſſion, <hi>Traitors</hi> againſt the Stat. of Treaſons, 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and againſt all Lawes &amp; our Statutes, <hi>Perjurious and perfidious,</hi> againſt the Oaths of Allegeance, Supremacy, Nationall Covenant, and Proteſtation; all the Parliaments Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Remonſtrances held forth to the world; their treaties and promiſes made to the <hi>Scots,</hi> when they delivered the Kings perſon into our hands; againſt our promiſes made to the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and other Nations, and againſt all the Profeſſions, Declarations, Remonſtrances, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſalls made by this Army, when they made their Addreſſes to the King at <hi>New-market, Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Court,</hi> and other places.</p>
