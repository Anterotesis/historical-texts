            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Wiſeſt of Kings tells us, that <note n="*" place="margin">Eccl. 7. 4.</note> 
               <hi>it is better to go to the Houſe of Mourning, than to that of Laughter;</hi> And thoſe who have well conſider'd the grounds he had for this his Judgment, will not by the Title of this Book (as melancholy as it appears) be affrighted from the peruſing it. I might indeed acquaint the <hi>Reader,</hi> that in the tranſlating thereof, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted nothing more than his pleaſure and diverſion (which he cannot miſs of, amidſt ſo great a variety of Relations, concerning the magnificence of <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,</hi> with other Honors beſtow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and manners of diſpoſing of the
<pb facs="tcp:44346:5"/> DEAD) but I will not inſiſt on this, my deſign being rather to profit, than delight; for elſe it would have been more proper for me to have uſher'd my <hi>Reader</hi> to a <hi>Theatre,</hi> than a <hi>Church-Yard</hi> among <hi>Graves</hi> and <hi>Charnel-Houſes.</hi> I must confeſs that a <hi>Skele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> how neatly ſoever hung and wir'd together, is not an Object ſo entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a <hi>Venus</hi> drawn by ſome Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly Hand; but withal it must be granted, that as much as <hi>Delight</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it on this ſide, ſo much does Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Knowledge</hi> over-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance it on the other; the <hi>one</hi> feeds our Vanity, the <hi>other</hi> compoſeth us to Sobriety, and teaches us the beſt of Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>To know our ſelves.</hi> What we read to have been, and ſtill to be the Cuſtom of ſome Nations, to make <hi>Sepulchres</hi> the Repoſitories of their greateſt Riches, is (I am ſure) univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true in a <hi>Moral</hi> ſenſe, however it may be thought in the <hi>Literal;</hi> there being never a <hi>Grave</hi> but what conceals a Treaſure, though all have not the Art to diſcover it. I do not
<pb facs="tcp:44346:5"/> here invite the covetous Miſer to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the <hi>Dead,</hi> who can frame no <hi>Idea</hi> of Treaſure diſtinct from Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but him who knows that <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> are the true and ſole <hi>Riches</hi> of Man, as he is an intelligent Creature, and the Image of his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creator. Is not Truth a Treaſure, think you? Which yet <hi>Democritus</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, is buried in a deep Pit or <hi>Grave;</hi> and he had reaſon; for whereas we meet elſewhere with nothing but paint and deceit, we no ſooner look down into a <hi>Grave,</hi> but Truth faceth us, and tells us our own. It was not by chance that the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> joyn'd their <hi>Coemeteries</hi> to their Temples, or Places of Divine Worſhip; they well underſtanding that the Inſtructions communicated to them through their Ears in the <hi>one,</hi> were enforced by thoſe they took-in from their Eyes in the <hi>other,</hi> and that both tended to the ſame bleſſed end, of rendring them Wiſe and Religious. Of which Truth <hi>Plato</hi> was ſo convinc'd, as to define <hi>Wiſdom</hi> the Meditation of <hi>Death;</hi> ratified by
<pb facs="tcp:44346:6"/> the Divine Oracle in that Pathetick Wiſh, <note n="*" place="margin">Deuter. 32. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Oh that they were wiſe, that they would conſider their latter end!</hi> And with no ſlight confirmation given it alſo by the Wiſeſt of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> even where the Libertine ſeems leaſt to apprehend it, namely, in his declaring <note n="‖" place="margin">Eccl. 9. 10</note> 
               <hi>no Wiſdom</hi> to remain <hi>in the Grave whereto we are going;</hi> for as much as in ſo cautioning us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a too late expectation of finding it (when <hi>dead</hi>) in our own, he directs us the more forcibly to the ſeeking for it (while <hi>living</hi>) in the <hi>Graves</hi> of others.</p>
            <p>WHICH having ſaid with regard to the valuableneſs of the Subject, I
ſhall only add, for the <hi>Reader</hi>'s fuller information, my having taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of retrenching one <hi>Chapter</hi> of this <hi>Book,</hi> under the Title of [The <hi>Funerals</hi> of <hi>Hereticks</hi>] as finding the

               <p>I DESIGNING to treat of the <hi>Funeral Rites of all Nations,</hi>
ſhall begin with thoſe of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> becauſe that People has always been acknowledged for the moſt ancient; and from whom <hi>Laws, Arts, Sciences</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were firſt deriv'd to other Countries. Aſſoon as any one was dead amongſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44346:8"/> them, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Diod. lib. 2. Hiſt.</hi> Officers employ'd by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> at their <hi>Funerals.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Funeral</hi> Officers, which were three, <hi>viz.</hi> the Clerk, the Anatomiſt, or Diſſector, and the Embalmer, preſented themſelves to the Kinſmen and Relations of the Departed, and after they had agreed upon the price (for according to the expence they were willing to be at, they diverſly treated the Corps) the Clerk ſet down upon a paper, or marked on the Body it ſelf, the Parts that were to be opened, <hi>viz.</hi> the Flanks on the left ſide. Then the Anatomiſt made the inciſion, and forthwith ran away; becauſe the ſtanders-by did moſt commonly fling ſtones at him, as abhorring to
ſee him exerciſe this ſeeming cruelty upon their Friend or Relation. At laſt the Embalmer drew forth all the Intrails, but the Heart and Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; and after he had waſht the Body very well, he inwardly anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with a compoſition of all ſorts of ſweet-ſcented drugs and ſpices, except Frankincenſe, becauſe that was by them conſecrated to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44346:8"/> Gods; and moſt commonly the chief ingredients of this ointment, were Myrrh and Caſſia. This done, he with an Iron-hook pull'd out all the brains through the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and fill'd up the void ſpace with Aromatical drugs.</p>
               <p>AS for the remaining Duties, they were perform'd by the kinſmen of the Deceaſed; who aſſoon as theſe <note n="*" place="margin">

ſpace of ſeventy days: at the end of which they waſhed it very carefully, and then neatly ſow'd up again the inciſion which the Anatomiſt had made; afterwards they anointed it outwardly all over with a certain Gum; wrapt it in ſwathing-bands of very fine linnen, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the foreſaid glutinous oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſtuck cloſe to the body; and
ſo they ſhut it up in carved and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wooden frames, which were made for that purpoſe.</p>

               <p>I HAD almoſt forgot to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in carrying the Body to the grave, both men and women made very <note n="‖" place="margin">Sixt.

ſtrokes. But theſe bewailings were far more extraordinary upon the Death of any of their Kings; <note place="margin">For their Kings.</note> the mourning continuing no leſs than
ſeventy two days, during which time all manner of rejoycings and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44346:9"/> feſtivals were forbidden; they all bedawbed their faces with mire and dirt; walked in troops together along the ſtreets, without any thing but a linnen-cloth wrapt about them, mixing the Name of their deceaſed Prince with their ſighs and out-cries: They abſtained from wine and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate meats; deny'd themſelves the uſe of baths and perfumes; they did not ſo much as make their beds, nor accompany with their Wives, and expreſs'd all the ſigns of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary affliction.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44346:10"/> For then they erected a ſumptuous Monument for him, or laid him in that which he had prepared for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whilſt yet alive; <note place="margin">Royal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres.</note> upon which monumental Structure they laviſh'd a prodigious treaſure, as the remains of their Pyramids do abundantly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie; which at this day are matter of aſtoniſhment to all that behold them, and were not without great reaſon by Antiquity reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Wonders of the World.</p>
               <p>INDEED they were ſuch Buildings as were never elſewhere to be found: Neither is it at all likely, that any King at this day could go to the charge of them;
ſince beſides three hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand men, who for the
ſpace of twenty years were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in building one of them, and eighteen hundred Talents ſpent only in Turnips and Onions, the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Engines whereby they hoiſted up ſo vaſt ſtones to ſuch an incredible and prodigious height is quite loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44346:10"/> MOST of theſe <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Mauſoleums,</hi> or coſtly and magnificent Structures, are made in the faſhion of Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids, and are no leſs admirable without, than within. There is one of them that is mounted by two hundred and eight ſteps, and is ſix hundred and fourſcore and two foot broad, and ſix hundred and twenty foot high: In a word, it is ſo high, that though the top of it be ſixteen foot ſquare, yet it does ſhew to thoſe that are beneath, as ſharp as the point of a needle. The entrance into it, is through a little door three foot and ſix inches high, and three foot and three inches broad: Next, you advance through a paſſage of the
ſame dimenſions, where firſt you meet with a deſcent of ſixty ſteps, and after that again an aſcent of about an hundred; at the end of which you enter into a little Gallery, and through that into a Hall, in the midſt of which ſtands the Tomb, all of one piece, and of a ſtone as fair to look upon, and as hard, as Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyre,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44346:11"/> the whole Hall being lined with the ſame. Theſe things might
ſeem incredible, were they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by all them that have travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into thoſe Parts. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that Country call theſe huge Buildings <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Mountains, by reaſon of their prodigious height; being no leſs wonderful for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſeneſs of their Bulk, than for the richneſs of the Matter of which they are made.</p>

                  <hi>HERODOT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> tells us that one of their Kings, <note n="*" place="margin">Herodot. l. 2. hiſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Micerin</hi> by name, caus'd a Tomb to be made for his Daughter, which was no leſs aſtoniſhing than the foregoing. He having no children but her, and
ſeeing himſelf by her death depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Heirs, ſpared nothing which might expreſs how ſenſibly he was touched with this loſs, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to immortalize her memory by the moſt ſuperb and ſumptuous
ſtructure he could poſſibly deviſe. Inſtead therefore of a Monument, he order'd a Palace to be erected for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44346:11"/> her, with a great Hall in the midſt of it, adorn'd with abundance of Figures and Statues, all beſpangled with precious ſtones: After this he cauſed her Corps to be laid up in a frame of incorruptible wood, faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned into the likeneſs of a Cow, which was covered all over with plates of Gold, and a Purple-mantle caſt over it. The figure of this Cow was kneeling, and had a Sun of maſſy gold between her horns, and was enlightned by a Lamp whoſe flames were fed with a moſt odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous oil, hanging before it, and round about the Hall nothing was
ſeen but perfuming pans and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, which continually caſt out clouds of ſweet ſcents and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes.</p>
               <p>BY theſe inſtances we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what honours the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of old were uſed to confer upon their Dead; and for concluſion of this Chapter I ſhall only further add, that there were <note place="margin">Three ſorts of Burials.</note> commonly three
ſorts of Buryings in uſe amongſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44346:12"/> them, which were diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſumptuous, indifferent, and mean or poor. The charges of the firſt were a Talent of Silver, and of the
ſecond twenty Mines; the expences of the laſt being very inconſiderable.</p>

                  </note> For at the firſt they uſed Burials, and after that, the cuſtom of Burning prevailed amongſt them: Of both which ways we have ſeveral inſtances from very credible Authors. <hi>Thucydides</hi> tells us, that <note n="*" place="margin">

A like account he gives of <hi>Braſidas, viz.</hi> That this brave Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral being dead of the wounds, which he received in the Victory by him obtained over the <hi>Athenians,</hi> at <hi>Eon,</hi> was publickly carried by

ſome time after, thoſe of <hi>Antibe</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd many Sacrifices at his Tomb; inſtituted Games in honour of him, and ranked him amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Gods. The ſame <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi> informs us, that they had a
ſpecial care to pay all due honours to
ſuch as died in the Wars in defence of their own Country: And to that purpoſe tells us, that all thoſe who were kill'd at the ſeveral Battels fought in <hi>Morea</hi> were moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly buried in the manner as follows. Firſt, for the ſpace of three days they left their Bones in a Tent, where every one of their friends made them Preſents of what they liked moſt when they were yet alive: Afterwards they laid them, together with the foreſaid gifts, in <hi>Cyprus</hi>-Cheſts or Coffins, and every
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44346:13"/> Tribe having placed the bodies of thoſe that belonged to them, on Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, they were drawn by men to the place of Burial; being followed by an infinite number of Citizens, who fill'd the air with lamentable wailing and out-cries. Moreover the ſame Hiſtorian obſerves, that beſides thoſe forementioned Coffins, they carried ſome empty ones, in honour of them whoſe Bones they could not find.</p>

                  </note> THEY likewiſe differed very much amongſt themſelves,  in the Honours they conferr'd on the Dead, before they carried them to their Graves, as alſo in the way and manner of their Mourning.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44346:15"/> White with abundance of Garlands, and others (as the <hi>Galatians</hi>) put a Letter very well ſeal'd into their hand, that they might make known their intentions to them in the other World, and that they had well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted themſelves in performing their laſt duties to them.</p>
               <p>THEIR Mourning laſted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen days: And therefore they commonly cut off a finger from the Dead Body, and on the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd all the Funeral honours they thought due to the Party Deceaſed.

At <hi>Delphos</hi> they ſacrificed unto the Dead themſelves. At <hi>Delos</hi> they cut off their own hair, and laid it on the Grave.

And to all theſe they
ſometimes added the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Cities or Provinces they had conquer'd. Next came all his Domeſticks in mourning, and were followed by Muſicians, who plaid to a ſad and doleful Tune; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments being diverſe, according

At firſt, the cuſtom was to write their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs in Verſe, which never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded two Diſtichs: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they found Proſe to be the better way, becauſe it left them more at liberty, not only to expreſs the Name of the Deceas'd, with that of his Family and Tribe; but likewiſe the honourable Offices and Employments he had diſcharged, his Profeſſion, and the Legacies he had bequeathed.

               <p>NEITHER did they that out-lived them (in acknowledgment of benefits received) forget any thing that might conduce to the preſerving of their memory. <note n="*" place="margin">Plin. l. 7. c. 44.</note> For preſently upon the Death of any perſon of quality they ordered his Statue to be made to the life; which after it had graced his Funeral pomp, was brought home, ſet in a Niche, and was uſed to be taken thence (in caſe he had been a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate) upon days of great Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, to accompany the publick Proceſſions; <note place="margin">Statues of the Dead kept in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations houſes, and in publick places.</note> and if he were a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon, they adorn'd it in its

Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time one of the moſt proper and handſom youths, that could be found, attended conſtantly at his Boulſter, to drive the Flies away with a Fan of Peacock-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: His Phyſicians alſo viſited him every day, felt his Pulſe, ſtill
ſaying, that he grew worſe and worſe; and at laſt having declar'd him Dead, all the Shops throughout the City were ſhut up immediately, every one ceaſing from his work, and ſtriving to out-vie one another in expreſſing their grief and ſorrow. At laſt ſeveral young Noblemen of the higheſt Quality took this Bed
(together with the Corps of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Emperor) on their ſhoulders, and firſt carried it to the Place,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44346:25"/> where they were uſed to elect their Magiſtrates: Here they ſet it on a Throne, which was erected in the midſt, the Senators taking their
ſeats round about it, and the Ladies having placed themſelves in certain Galleries, two Quires began a mournful concert, whereof the one was compoſed of Boys, and the other of Girls, who ſang by turns the Praiſes of the late Emperor from two ſcaffolds on each ſide of the Throne. <note place="margin">Their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> Theſe concerts were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with an eloquent Oration, uttered by his Succeſſor, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been oft interrupted, by the applauſe, as well as lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Auditors, ended at laſt in a general mourning, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with moſt doleful out-cries.</p>
               <p>NO ſooner was this noiſe over, but the Funeral-pomp began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. The firſt that ſet forth were thoſe that carried the Statues of all the Great Men, that had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the City, <hi>viz.</hi> of their <hi>Kings, Dictators, Conſuls,</hi> and <hi>Emperors.</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44346:25"/> Theſe Statues were accompanied with the repreſentations of plain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſſed work on Braſs, of all the Provinces and principal Cities ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Empire: After theſe came ſeveral that bare Standards; there being as many of them, as there were different Provinces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Roman</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>AFTER all theſe illuſtrious marks of their Grandeur, followed the ſeveral Companies of Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, every one in their rank and order. Then came the Archers; and after them the Regiments of the Guards, with their Trumpeters: And in the rear of all came a Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, conſiſting of young Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and laſt of all many Chariots loaden with all the Ornaments, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, and precious things that were to be ſpent and conſumed at the Funeral.</p>
               <p>WHEN all this train was paſs'd by; the Prieſts, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates elect, did again lift up the dead Body with the Bed of State
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44346:26"/> on which it was laid, and delivered the ſame to ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, who as ſoon as they had taken it up on their Shoulders, the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany began their march out of the City towards the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi>
ſome of the Senators walking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the Bed of State, and others behind it. In the midſt of this Field there was a kind of Square Tower of Wood erected, and on the top of it were four little Towers made Taper or Spire-wiſe, every one of them leſs than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all of different heights; and on the top of the ſecond of theſe Towers they placed the Corps. After which all the Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity having ſeated themſelves upon
ſeveral Scaffolds, erected there for that purpoſe, beheld the Tiltings and Races, that were run about the Wood-pile; the ſight of which was very pleaſant and delightful: For beſides the activity and nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe on Horſe-back, and the ſeveral exerciſes of Foot-men,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44346:26"/> there were many Triumphal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, which they did drive with the greateſt ſwiftneſs imaginable, and then turned them about in their full career. At length theſe Games, which they called <hi>Pyrrhica,</hi> being ended, the new Emperor attended by the chief Magiſtrates, came down from his Scaffold, and all of them having with their Torches ſet this wooden Tower on fire, an Eagle flew out of the top of it; which was the mark of the Divinity of the Deceaſed. <note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis, or Canoniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</note> For they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, that this Eagle carried his Soul into Heaven, there to take his place amongſt the Gods: And from that time forwards they gave him the compellation of <hi>Divus,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Demy-God;</hi> they dedicated Temples and Altars, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Prieſts, and ordained Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in honour of him.</p>

ſpoken of the Ceremonies uſed at the Burial of the Veſtals. In how great eſteem and veneration theſe Virgins (to whoſe care the keeping of the Sacred Fire was committed) were amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> is well known. For they not only render'd them the higheſt marks of honour they could poſſibly expreſs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they chanced to meet with any of them in the Streets; but alſo gave them the firſt places in all Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, both in their Temples and Theatres. They had always a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Uſher going before them; yea ſo great deference was given to their preſence, that if they acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally met with a Criminal, led to the place of Execution, he could not then be put to Death; this happy encounter procuring the poor wretch his Pardon.</p>
               <p>THERE was alſo the greateſt care imaginable taken in the choice of them: They never conſecrated any to this high charge, but from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44346:28"/> Six Years of Age to Ten. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they were to be without any blemiſh, neither ſtammering, deaf, crooked, lame, nor maimed; Their Parents alſo were to be free, having never been bound in any ſort of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, or imploy'd in baſe and mean Offices, for their Father was to have been either a <hi>Prieſt, Augur,</hi> or <hi>Epulo.</hi> The Girl, who had all theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, was by her Relations condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Porch of the Temple of <hi>Vesta,</hi> where ſhe was received by the High Prieſt, who conſecrated her for the ſpace of thirty Years to the ſervice of that Goddeſs; during which time ſhe was to keep her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity inviolable. Men were not
ſuffer'd to ſpeak with them, except in the Day-time; and very ſevere puniſhments were decreed againſt thoſe, who entred their Lodgings by Night.</p>
               <p>WHEN they happened to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe in this ſtate of Virginity, they were not only Buried with great Pomp; but had alſo the peculiar

ſhe likewiſe ſeverely puniſht for it, by the moſt ſhameful Burial in the World. They laid her all at length on a Bier, as if ſhe had been Dead, cover'd all over with many Cloaths, which were tied faſt and cloſe about her, that ſhe might be neither ſeen, nor heard. And being thus ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about, ſhe was carried from the Temple of <hi>Veſta</hi> to the Gate call'd <hi>Collina,</hi> attended by her Relations and Friends, all in tears; after them came the Prieſts with ſad and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted looks, without ſpeaking one word.

ſtopt the hole, there they let her periſh without any pity; for it was not lawful for them to ſhed their blood: And ſo ſolemn was the Mourning on theſe Days, that none durſt either work, or divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; neither was any thing to be heard throughout the whole City, but ſighing, cries, and lamentations.</p>

               <p>IT is matter of aſtoniſhment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>Perſians</hi> have ever had the renown of being one of the moſt civilized Nations in the world, that notwithſtanding they ſhould have uſed ſuch barbarous cuſtoms about the Dead <note n="*" place="margin">Diod. l. 17.</note> as are ſet down in the Writings of ſome Hiſtorians; and the rather becauſe at this day there are ſtill to be ſeen among them thoſe remains of <note n="‖" place="margin">Procop. De Bel. Perſ. l. 1. Agath. l. 2.</note> Antiquity, which do fully ſatisfie us, that their Tombs have been very magnificent. And yet nevertheleſs, if we will give credit to <hi>Procopius</hi> and <hi>Agathias,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> were never wont to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Dead Bodies, ſo far were they from beſtowing any Funeral Honours upon them: <note place="margin">The <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Dead in the open field in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of burying them.</note> But, as theſe Authors tell us, they expoſed them
ſtark naked in the open fields, which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44346:30"/> is the greateſt ſhame our Laws do allot to the moſt infamous Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, by laying them open to the view of all upon the high ways:
<note place="margin">Their fooliſh Opinions.</note> Yea in their opinion it was a great unhappineſs, if either Birds or Beaſts did not devour their Carcaſes; and they commonly made an eſtimate of the Felicity of theſe poor Bodies, according as they were ſooner or later made a prey of. Concerning theſe, they reſolved that they muſt needs have been very bad indeed,
ſince even the Beaſts themſelves would not touch them; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an extream ſorrow to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, they taking it for an ill bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Family, and an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible preſage of ſome great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hanging over their heads; for they perſwaded themſelves, that the Souls which inhabited thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being dragg'd into Hell, would not fail to come and trouble them; and that being always accompanied with the Devils, their Tormentors, they would certainly give them a great deal of diſturbance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:44346:30"/> AND on the contrary, when theſe Corpſes were preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, their joy was very great, they enlarged themſelves in praiſes of the Deceaſed; every one eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them undoubtedly happy, and came to congratulate their relations on that account: For as they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved aſſuredly, that they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields, ſo they were perſwaded, that they would procure the ſame bliſs to all thoſe of their Family.</p>
               <p>THEY alſo took a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſee Skeletons and Bones
ſcatered up and down in the fields, whereas we can ſcarcely endure to
ſee thoſe of Horſes and Dogs uſed
ſo. And theſe remains of Humane Bodies, (the ſight whereof gives us
ſo much horror, that we preſently bury them out of our ſight, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we find them elſewhere, than in Charnel-houſes or Church-yards) were the occaſion of their greateſt joy; becauſe they concluded from thence the happineſs of thoſe that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44346:31"/> had been devoured, wiſhing after their Death to meet with the like good luck.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sick Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the wild Beaſts.</note> THE ſame Hiſtorians inform us, that when any private Souldier was ſick in their Armies, and in outward appearance paſt recovery, they carried him to the next Wood or Foreſt, leaving with him only a piece of Bread, a little Water, and a Stick, that he might, as long as he ſhould have any ſtrength, defend himſelf from the wild Beaſts, which moſt commonly devour'd <note n="*" place="margin">Herodot. l. 3.</note> theſe poor wretches; and if it chanced that any one of them eſcaped, and came back to his own houſe, all the people ran away from him, as if they had ſeen ſome Ghoſt or Devil; and did not ſuffer him to converſe with any body, till after he had been purified and expiated by the Prieſts; as if having been ſo near Death, he were thereby (according to their opinion) become unfit to live any longer; for they ſuppoſed that he muſt needs have had great converſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44346:31"/> with <hi>Daemons,</hi> ſince notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his extream ſickneſs he had been able to defend himſelf againſt the wild Beaſts, and recover'd his
ſtrength, without any man's help or aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>AND howſoever barbarous and inhumane theſe cuſtoms may ſeem to us, yet were <note n="*" place="margin">Juſt. l. 19</note> they amongſt them
ſo ſtrictly obſerv'd, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Death one of their moſt Illuſtrious Captains called <hi>Seoſez,</hi> only becauſe he had interred his Wife; <note place="margin">Expoſing of Dead Bodies moſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved by the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi>
                  </note> Burial amongſt them having
(as they ſaid) always been contrary to the Religion of their Country. And for further confirmation of what hath been ſaid, the Hiſtorian <hi>Menander</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Menand. in Excerpt. de Legat.</note> aſſures us, that one of the Principal Conditions in the Treaty of Peace, concluded between the Emperor <hi>Juſtian,</hi> and <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoez,</hi> one of their Kings, was that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of his Kingdom ſhould be permitted to bury their Dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Burning of the Dead abhorred by them.</note> NEITHER did they leſs abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Burning of the Dead, 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44346:32"/> which was the cauſe, why in the beginning of that Monarchy, King <hi>Cambyſes</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Juſt. l. 19.</note> had well nigh made his People to riſe in Rebellion againſt him, for having cauſ'd the body of <hi>Amaſis</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to be digg'd out of his Grave, and afterward Burnt with great pomp and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; they openly declaring, that this was to give a very dangerous example to Poſterity; ſince inſtead of being a Conſervator of <note n="‖" place="margin">Strab. l. 15. Cic. l. Tuſcul. l. 1.</note> the Laws of the Land, which did not allow either of Burials or Burning, he was the firſt that brake them.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER (not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the veracity of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Hiſtorians) certain it is, that this inhumane cuſtom of expoſing the Dead was never long in uſe amongſt the <hi>Perſians:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Burying in uſe alſo amongſt them.</note> For beſides that ſtately piece of Antiquity, call'd the Forty Pillars, whereof the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Remains are ſeen in theſe our days, in the very ſame place, where the famous <hi>Perſepolis</hi> once
ſtood; we read in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Tuſculan</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:44346:32"/> Queſtions, as likewiſe in <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that in time paſt theſe People were wont to cover the Corpſes with Earth only, without any other ceremony or expence; or elſe (after they had covered them over with Wax, to preſerve their
ſhape and figure) ſhut 'em up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Caves and hollow places of Rocks, and ſometimes in Tombs. And <hi>Xenophon</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Xenoph. l. 2.</note> puts us out of all doubt concerning this matter, when he tells us, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his Children to put up his Corps in any rich Coffin, but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to commit it to the ground. The
ſame thing is confirmed to us by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> and <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> ſpeaking of old <hi>Darius</hi> Son to <hi>Hyſtaſpes,</hi> and Father to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who (ſays he) having ſubdu'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> aboliſh'd the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> they had of <hi>Burning</hi> their Dead; and inſtead thereof ordain'd <hi>That</hi> of <hi>Burials.</hi> The other (<hi>viz. Quintus Curtius</hi>) in the exact Deſcription he gives of the Defeat of the latter <hi>Darius,</hi> and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44346:33"/> the Conqueſt of his Country by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, tells us, that this incomparable Conqueror ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving totally routed and deſtroy'd the <hi>Perſian Army</hi> at the Pillars of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> upon the News he received, that the King was kill'd there, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſpatch'd <hi>Leonatus,</hi> one of his principal Courtiers, to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Wife, to condole with, and comfort them; and that theſe Princeſſes in the trouble and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wherein they were, by reaſon of their extream affliction, thinking at firſt that he was ſent thither to diſpatch them, fell down at his feet, and with tears beſought him, not to
ſlay them, before they had buried the Body of that poor unhappy Prince. Which Opinion is the more confirmed, becauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> having afterwards deliver'd <hi>Beſſus,</hi> who had kill'd <hi>Darius,</hi> into theſe Princeſſes hands, they thought they could not inflict upon him a more cruel puniſhment, than by cauſing his Body to be cut into a thouſand
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44346:33"/> pieces, and ſcattered abroad in the Fields. We alſo learn from <hi>Appian</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made the Chief of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Commanders his priſoners, who had taken the Party of his Brother <hi>Cyrus</hi> againſt him, caus'd them to dye a ſhameful death, and expoſed their Corpſes to the devouring Beaſts. So that we muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that at leaſt in thoſe days the caſting abroad of Dead Bodies was accounted a Puniſhment, and not an Honour amongſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> DURING the time of their Mourning they wore cloaths of a brown colour; and not only the Men and Women were ſhaved, and had their hair cut off, but generally all their Beaſts and Cattle were
ſhorn too. <note place="margin">Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the <hi>Perſians</hi> at this day.</note> But as they have in theſe latter Ages, embrac'd the Law of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> ſo have they altered their Cuſtoms and Ceremonies. They can bury no Body, except they have firſt demanded, and obtain'd the King's Leave for it; or if they be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44346:34"/> too far from the Court, the Lord Lieutenant's, or Principal Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; which asking of Leave is but a Formality, it being never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. Aſſoon as this is granted, if the Party be never ſo little conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, they carry ſome Standards before his Corps, which are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Saddle-horſes, charged with their Arms, <hi>viz.</hi> Swords, Darts, Arrows and Turbants. Thoſe that lead theſe Horſes are naked to the Waſt. Then come their Friends, who beſides their nakedneſs, give themſelves large gaſhes, out of which the bloud runs from all parts. They all march before the Body, round about which their Prieſts are,
ſinging Dirges, or Prayers for the Dead, which are interrupted and blended with the ſad lamentations of the deceaſed parties Relations, who follow after the Corps, at the head of a great throng of people, who have all their Turbants untied, and hanging looſe on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. In this order they proceed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44346:34"/> till they come to a River, or any other place where much water is, and there waſh the Body, having firſt placed it under a Tent. Then they march on towards the place of Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which is moſt commonly a <hi>Moſquee,</hi> in caſe the Perſon decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be of Quality, or if of a low rank, the next Church-yard.

They waſh the Corps, and ſhave all its Hair off; Then they wrap it in a Linnen-cloth, which they have beſprinkled with Soap-ſuds, and afterwards with Roſe-water; and thus lay it down
ſtretched out at length in a Coffin,
(which they expoſe to the view of all comers, in the Entry of their Houſe) not lying on its Back, or Belly, but on its right ſide, with the Face turned to the <hi>South,</hi> as if looking towards <hi>Mecha;</hi> a City, which they have a great veneration

This Coffin is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a Canopy of divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, according to the different Rank or Quality of the Perſon. If it be for a Souldier, it is red; if for a Prieſt, green; and if the Party was neither of theſe, then they make uſe of a black covering.</p>
               <p>IT is likewiſe to be obſerv'd, that when they wrap their Dead in a Winding-ſheet, they let their Feet
&amp; Heads be at liberty, that they may the better, and with the more eaſe kneel down, when the Angels come to examine them; leaving them a lock or tuft of Hair on the top of their Heads, that the Angels, who make them kneel whilſt they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate them, may by that Lock lay hold of them: <note place="margin">Their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Examen of Souls.</note> For they are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that as ſoon as the Dead is in the Grave, his Soul comes into his Body again, and that two Angels in a diſmal, horrid and frightful

(which are his good Deeds) and remains with him, to comfort and delight him until Doom's Day, when they ſhall both enter into Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>BUT if the dead Perſon know himſelf guilty, he is ſo poſſeſt with fear, that he cannot give ſo juſt and
ſatisfactory an Anſwer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is preſently ſeverely puniſh'd; for thoſe black Angels (as they ſay)
ſtrike him with a fiery Club; and that with ſuch violence, that the fierceneſs of the ſtroak makes the ground to ſink under him, where
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44346:37"/> he is ſo extremely preſs'd and ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that all the Milk he hath ſuck'd from his Nurſe, runs out through his Noſe.

Wherefore, to the end the deceaſed may be delivered from theſe Black Angels, their Friends, that come to weep and lament at their Graves, do encourage them, crying continually with a loud voice, <hi>Be not afraid, but anſwer boldly.</hi>

The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances of which take as follows: The King advanceth to the door, and by his order, a Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an delivers himſelf with a tunable
ſinging voice to this purpoſe. <hi>There was ſome time ago a moſt rich, wiſe, and Puiſſant King, who having laid down his life in this World, to enjoy Immortality in the other, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deveſted himſelf of all his Eſtates and Dominions, in favour of his Children, without reſerving any thing to himſelf of all thoſe immenſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44346:51"/> Eſtates he poſſeſs'd here: And it being nois'd abroad, that he is now ſolitary and wandring in a ſtrange Country, without Souldiers to guard him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Horſes or Elephants, wherewithal to defend himſelf: Without a Train and Equipage ſuitable to his Grandeur, and without a Palace for the place of his abode; the report of this ſumptuous Building has drawn us hither, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to purchaſe it: If therefore he be willing to part with it, whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to, he will very much conſult his own intereſt in ſo doing, we being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſpare nothing to procure it, that thereby we may expreſs the love we have
ſtill for our deceaſed Father.</hi> To which the people that are within anſwer in a like muſical tone, that they are fully ſatisfied with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and thereupon the price being agreed on both hands, the Prince makes his entrance into, and takes poſſeſſion of it, in the Name of his Father. After this placing himſelf in the Tent Royal, if it be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my encamped; or in the chief City,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44346:51"/> if it be a Kingdom; or in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, if it be only a City; he there, together with his whole Court, hear kneeling the recital of the old King's Life, which being ended, he cauſes the Machines to be ſet on fire, amidſt the confuſed noiſe of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and other Inſtruments.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of their Graves.</note> AS for the magnificence of their Graves, it is ſuch, as cannot be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently deſcribed.

He calls the Iſle <hi>Calempluy,</hi> which he ſays lies at the mouth of a large River, where it diſembogues it ſelf into the Sea, in the extream parts of <hi>China</hi> Eaſtward; being a place, which by rocks is made, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44346:52"/> inacceſſible, and which the lofty Cliffs, that ſurround it on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſide, do conceal from the Eye of thoſe that ſail by it; the ſwift cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the River contributing alſo very much to its ſecrecy. He adds, that that Iſle is but a mile round, and is environ'd on the water-ſide with a wall of Jaſper, flanked with a rampart of Earth; on the top of which there is a Walk, or Gallery faced with Baluſters of bright ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Copper, with ſeveral inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed Pillars of the ſame Metal, and behind them, at a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the figures of abundance of Animals of molten Copper, almoſt of all the kinds that can be found, which make one ſide, as the Balu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the other, of a moſt curious and delightful Gallery. Within the precincts of which, you ſee nothing but little Groves of Orange-trees, and other the moſt delightful and

               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:44346:52"/> IT is in theſe Temples and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitages they depoſite the Bones of their Kings, and other Princes of the Royal Bloud; which are built not only of Marble, Porphyre, and Jaſper, but with variety of other Stones, which with us are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted precious, both becauſe of their beauty and rarity. Neither are their Coffins leſs rich; the matter whereof they are made, being Gold or Silver, beſides the vaſt Treaſures incloſed in them. Theſe Coffins are always attended by Hermits, who continually pray for the Dead, being themſelves perſons of the higheſt Quality; for none are ſent thither, but great Lords, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves arrived to a great Age, are glad to retire, and end their days at their Princes Graves; thereby hoping to anticipate their favour, and procure for themſelves to be their Courtiers in the other World, as they have been in this. There are alſo many young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who by ſome miſdemeanours,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44346:53"/> being fallen into diſgrace at Court, take for a great favour to have the liberty of going, and retiring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ever in theſe delightful Hermitages, where they make it their buſineſs to ſupplicate thoſe Illuſtrious Deceaſed, to make their peace with the King, that they be re-admitted to his Grace and favour.</p>

               <p>THE Inhabitants of <hi>America</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways took a particular care to bury their Dead, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that on that Ceremony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the reſt of the Soul depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They were all of them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally perſwaded of the Souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; though to this truth
(which Nature taught them) they added a thouſand Fables of their own invention.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Souls.</note> THEY fancied almoſt as many different places for the Dead, as there were different kinds of deaths, as well as different ſorts of crimes.</p>
               <p> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ioan. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri. hiſt. Americ.</note> For example, they were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that good and honeſt Men, as thoſe that had been kill'd in Battels, or had devoted themſelves to be a Sacrifice in honour of their Gods,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44346:54"/> went directly after their Death, to the Houſe of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which they placed near that Luminary: This was the higheſt degree of happineſs among them. As for the wicked, they ſaid that they remained here below on the Earth, and were yet more unhappy there, than they had been during their lives: That thoſe who had been Thieves were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually purſu'd by <hi>Daemons,</hi> that never left them at quiet: That the Adulterous were ſcorched with the Flames of their unlawful Luſts; and though they had always many handſome Women before their eyes, yet they were the only Dead, to whom it was forbidden to marry again in the other World, becauſe they had indulged, and given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too much liberty in this: That thoſe who had killed their Fathers, their Wives, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were eternally ſlain by the
ſame Perſons, and with the ſame kind of Death wherewith they had formerly deſtroy'd them: That they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44346:54"/> who had murther'd their Kings, met after their Death with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of mad riotous fellows, with whom they were fain to fight inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, giving and receiving large wounds continually, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo much liberty as to lay down their Arms for one moment, or ſtop the bloud guſhing out from all parts of their Body. And finally, That thoſe who had put any of their Prieſts to Death, were perpetually praying to the Gods, without any hope of ever being heard.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER opinion they had concerning thoſe that died without having committed any crime, and who otherwiſe were neither good nor bad. If they were young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who had liv'd but a ſhort time, or died before they were weaned, they believ'd that they met with an inviſible Manſion upon Earth, where they enjoy'd that life they had been depriv'd of, and that there they attained to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme old age, that they could no
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44346:55"/> more tell their Years: And if they were old Men, their opinion was, that they began to grow young, as
ſoon as they were arrived in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and that at length they became ſo very young, that their former old age was by them wholly forgotten. If any died of a ſudden death, they ſuppoſed him to go to a place, where he was moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſurpris'd, and ſtruck with a raviſhing admiration, to ſee in that Region every thing contrary to, or at leaſt very different from what he had ſeen in this: in the admiring of which ſtrange and agreeable <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis</hi> he was employed to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. And laſtly, if any were drowned, they fancied him to paſs from the Water into a dry place, where he immediately voided the water he had let down, and where he was no more in danger of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ſame misfortune, the Gods having taken care to leave neither Sea, River, Brook, nor any Spring there, leſt the ſight of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44346:55"/>
ſhould occaſion any trouble to them who had miſcarried thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their manner of apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Dead.</note> THEY had alſo ſeveral ways of decking their Dead, which were generally very rich and pompous, and ſuitable to the Place or Office they had diſcharged, or to that <note n="*" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>  which in their life-time, they were moſt taken with. For example, they put upon their Prieſts the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Idol they had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto: Courtiers they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in ſuch a garb as their Prince moſt affected, and apparelled the common ſort in ſuch an habit, as was moſt agreeable to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, trade, or fancy of every one of them. Theſe were their ordinary ways of dreſſing the Corps. But they had others which were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, wherewith they ſet forth the Bodies of debauched and wicked fellows: for they clothed Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards in the habit of <hi>Ometotchtli,</hi> the God of Wine; and Adulterers in that of <hi>Tlaxolteutl,</hi> the God of Luſt. They had alſo particular
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44346:56"/> manners of apparelling thoſe that periſhed by Shipwrack, or in Battel, dreſſing the former like to <hi>Tlacot,</hi> the God of Water; and the latter in the warlike Ornaments of <hi>Vitzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopuchtli,</hi> the God of War.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their Mourning.</note> NOR was their Mourning leſs different and various; <note n="*" place="margin">Bellef. in Coſmog.</note> it being more or leſs according to the age of the Party deceaſed; for they were extremely ſorrowful for the Death of their Children, and almoſt not at all concern'd for the Departure of aged Perſons; inſomuch that as they ſpared nothing to take care of the nouriſhment and education of the one, ſo they did much neglect the other. And what I find moſt remarkable therein, is this, That their Mourning for Children, was not only very long, but univerſal alſo, they being generally bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the whole City or Town in which they were born. On the day of their Death, no Body durſt come nigh their Parents or neareſt Relations, who carried themſelves
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44346:56"/> like furious and mad People, and made a moſt dreadful noiſe within their Houſes, howling and crying like Perſons in deſpair, plucking off their Hair, biting, ſcratching, and tearing their Fleſh. On the next day they flung themſelves down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Beds, and bathed them with their own tears. On the third day they began their lamentations, which continu'd the whole Year; during which time neither the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor Mother of the Child, ever waſh'd themſelves; and the reſt of the whole City, to condole with them for their loſs, did weep three times a day, till the Corps was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Grave.</p>
               <p>AS concerning their Mourning for others, it was regulated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of the Years they had liv'd; laſting eleven Months, if the Party had liv'd but five Years; ten, if he had liv'd ten Years; nine, if fifteen; eight, if he had attained to twenty Years of age; ſeven, if twenty-five; ſix, if

               <p>AS ſoon as their King was fallen
ſick, they put a Mask upon the face of their principal Idol, and did not take it off, till he was either Dead, or perfectly recovered. If he Died, they preſently publiſh'd a ſolemn Mourning for him, not only in the City, but throughout the whole Kingdom; to every part of which Expreſſes were ſent, to give notice thereof, to the end that all manner of rejoycings might immediately ceaſe. Upon which notice given, all the great Lords repaired to Court, to attend his Funerals: and in the mean time his Corps was well waſhed and embalmed. Now when the Court was full and compleat, and all the Grandees were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Palace, the Body of the Prince was taken out of his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bed, to be laid open to the ſight of all, on a Straw-bed, in the midſt of the Hall: And this ſad object,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44346:61"/> which drew tears from the Eyes of all the ſtanders-by, was in this manner expoſed for the ſpace of three days, during which time it was not lawful for any Lord to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf from the place; and to that purpoſe every one of them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their Neceſſaries to be brought thither to them, by their Servants and Vaſſals; nor did they take any reſt, but in their Chairs.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus attended and watched him, they put on his face the Vizard of the Idol, for which he always had the greateſt devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they ſtopt his mouth with a large Emerald, and covered him with ſeventeen very rich Carpets or Coverings; upon each of which the name of the Idol, in whoſe Temple he had choſen to be Buried, was written. Then they cut a handful of his Hair, which they laid up as a precious Relick, ſaying, that the memory of his Soul remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Hair; and ſacrificed a Slave to him, whoſe office it was,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44346:61"/> during his Life, to light his Lamps, and burn his Perfumes; that he might do him the ſame ſervice in the other World.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44346:78"/> horrid. As ſoon as any of their Princes was Dead, they open'd his Body to take out the entrails, which otherwiſe might have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it, and after having waſh'd it well, they poured melted Wax all over it, both within and without. Then they fill'd it with Thyme, mixt with Chervil, Sellery and Anniſeeds bruis'd together; and after that having ſow'd it up again, as neatly as poſſibly they could, they
ſet it ſtark naked upon a Chariot, which was to carry it not only through all his own hereditary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, but thoſe alſo which he had
ſubdued and made tributary. When they came to the Frontiers of any Countrey, thoſe that had conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and attended it ſo far thither, returned back, and others of that Province receiv'd and took care of it, thus conveying it from hand to hand, till it had gone round the whole Kingdom. Now it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Inhabitants of every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to do what out-rage or injury
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44346:78"/> they pleaſed, to revenge thoſe wrongs which the Prince in his life time had done them: So that ſome cut off his Ears, others his Hair, others his Noſe, others ſtruck him on the Forehead, others ſlaſh'd deep and large gaſhes in his Arms, and others pierced his Hands with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; every one inſulting on that part, which he conceived he had been agriev'd or injur'd by. For example, thoſe that could never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a hearing from him, revenged themſelves upon his Ears, which had always been deaf to them; they that were ſcandaliz'd with his debaucheries and luxury, tore off his Hair, that was his chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and after they had ſhaved him, to make him look ugly and ridiculous, they made a thouſand flouts at him. They that diſlik'd his too great delicacy and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateneſs,
ſlit his Noſe for him, as
ſuppoſing that he could never have been ſuch, but becauſe he lov'd and delighted too much in Perfumes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44346:79"/> and pleaſant Scents. They that were offended at his Government, broke his Forehead, the place where all his Tyrannical Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances had been hatched. Thoſe to whom he had done any violence, regarding his Arms as the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his ſtrength, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners of their miſeries, did with ſeveral blows break the very Bones of them. And they who had
ſuffer'd by his covetouſneſs, either becauſe of the heavy Taxes and Subſidies he had levied upon them, or elſe becauſe he had not rewarded their ſervices, did ſlit open his hands, for having been too griping or cloſe fiſted.</p>
               <p>IN the end, when all had thus wreked their ſpleen upon him, by puniſhing him according to their pleaſure, and the wrong they had receiv'd from him, they brought him back to the place where he died, and having erected a great Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile, they burnt him, with one of the moſt beautiful of his Miſtriſſes,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44346:79"/> or Concubines, together with his Cup-bearer, his Cook, his Maſter of Horſe, and the chief Groom of his Stable, with ſome Horſes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides fifty others of his Servants, all whoſe throats they cut, whilſt his Body was a burning, and buried them about the Grave, wherein they laid his aſhes.</p>

This Tomb was nothing elſe but a very large Bier or Coffin; for beſides the Body of the King, it was to contain all the Officers, and others above-mentioned, which were
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44346:80"/> flung into it, as faſt as they were
ſlaughter'd. To which they added
ſeveral Ornaments of the deceaſed Prince, with great ſtore of Veſſels of Gold; covering the whole with a large Carpet, upon which they, laſt of all, laid abundance of earth above three foot high.</p>
               <p>AT the Years end, they met in great numbers at the ſaid Tomb, where they kill'd fifty Pages of the late King'<hi>s</hi> with as many Horſes; both which they ſtuff'd up with
ſtraw, after they had unbowell'd them; and then they placed theſe Horſes upon ſeveral wooden arches, as if they had been running a galop, and faſten'd the Bodies of the Pages upon them; which was in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, the moſt magnificent pomp they could fancy or think of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to honour the memory of their Kings; which indeed ſuited very well with their barbarous manners, as more becoming Beaſts than Men.</p>

Wherefore as ſoon as any one was Dead amongſt them, they did cut the Body to pieces; and mixing it with their uſual Meats, Mutton, Beef, or the like, they ate it with a
ſingular guſt and devotion. Yea, the neareſt relations of the Dead, made this a matter of much joy, and with a great deal of ceremony, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one another to theſe Feaſts, to eat the Body of ſuch a one, much in the ſame manner, as we invite our Friends to attend the Funeral of a deceaſed Friend or Relation. In a word, to devour the Dead, was to pay him their laſt Duty, and the higheſt mark of the reſpect and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they had for him; in which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44346:82"/> they out-vied the Doctrine of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras;</hi> that Philoſopher main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining only a <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> or the tranſmigration of Souls into other Bodies, whereas theſe put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the tranſmigration of dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into living ones. <hi>Horatius</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Horat. l. 1.

Marc.</note> but <hi>Tertullian</hi> aſſures us, that this monſtrous piety was univerſal among, and exerciſed by them upon all ſorts of men; and as they uſed neither Interments, nor Burnings, they devoured the Bodies of their own Country-men, as well as thoſe of Foreigners, when they were Dead. So that what thoſe fore-cited Hiſtorians do relate only of the Inhabitants of <hi>Pontus,</hi> of the <hi>Maſſagetes, Hyrcanians, Derbices,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> we find confirmed in <hi>Europe,</hi> to demonſtrate, that however barbarous this Cuſtom
ſeems to be, yet it cannot well be doubted, but that ſuch there have
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44346:82"/> been. Nay, their cruelty went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of old people; for as
ſoon as they were come to ſeventy years of Age, <note n="*" place="margin">Zenodot. in Collect. Cent. 5.</note> without ſtaying for Death's call, they rid them of the miſeries of old Age, by knocking them in the head, or cutting their throats, and then made a Feaſt of them; and <note n="*" place="margin">Hieron. contr. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.</note> what was yet more horrid, was, that the Children on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were thought fit to diſcharge this bloudy office, being oblig'd by the Laws of the Land to take a Knife and murther their Parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Neither were they wanting to defend and maintain this their extream inhumanity, with many

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44346:83"/> and added, that after their Death they could give them no higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of gratitude and duty, than by feeding upon them; becauſe by that means their Parents became one and the ſame ſubſtance with them, as they themſelves were before they were born.</p>

For we read in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> planted a Wood in <hi>Berſabe,</hi>

               <p>INDEED this veneration for Woods and Solitary Places, is in a manner natural; for the <hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves, which were led only by the light of Nature, have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged this verity; and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaks of all Woods and Foreſts, as ſo many Temples: In theſe our <hi>Druids</hi> erected Altars for their Sacrifices; and here alſo it was all Antiquity believed the Gods made their <note n="‖" place="margin">Apol. l. 3.

 <note n="*" place="margin">Var. 1.</note> by making them ſerve for Gallows, and thereby expoſing them to the character of the moſt <note n="‖" place="margin">Olaus. l. 16.</note> infamous pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imaginable. Thus the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Colchos,</hi> and the <hi>Tibarens,</hi> a People of <hi>Scythia,</hi> made a piece of Religion of it, to hang the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their Relations upon Trees, for an horror to Spectators, and for a prey to the Fowls of Heaven; and the ancient <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:44346:94"/> could think of no better way to ſhew the veneration they had for their Princes after death, than by fixing them to a Gibbet. Surely we muſt
ſuppoſe theſe Men worſe than <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> to fancy that an honour, which indeed is the greateſt infamy in the World; and to eſteem that a Religious and Pious duty, which indeed is the extremeſt impiety and undutifulneſs that can be conceived. What honour can a Body be thought to receive, by ſuffering a loathſome corruption in the Air, or by being expoſed in a ſhameful nakedneſs, which daily grows more ugly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured and frightful, or to be toſt to and fro, and become the ſport and may-game of the wavering Winds? Certainly it appears to me, that even according to the dictates of Nature, nothing can be more horrid or inhumane. This is the reaſon why our Laws appoint the
ſame as a Puniſhment and juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the moſt hainous offenders and notorious Criminals; and which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44346:94"/> makes as great an impreſſion on our minds, to deter us from like crimes, as to ſee a Man loſe his life by the hands of the Hang-man. Neither can I imagine what way theſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous People have to puniſh the wicked, ſince they make uſe of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to honour Perſons of worth; except one ſhould ſay, that being <hi>Barbarians,</hi> Vice is had in eſteem and veneration amongſt them, as Virtue is with us, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their natural brutiſhneſs, they pay the Duty of Burial only to ſuch, who by their wicked actions have made themſelves famous amongſt them.</p>

ſo theſe which they uſe of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days are moſt ridiculous, being grounded merely upon the fooliſh dreams and idle fancies of their <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> or Doctors.

               <p>IN the third place, I ſhall ſpeak of that of <hi>Daniel</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Hegeſip.</note> , who cauſed it to be built himſelf at <hi>Ecbatana</hi> in <hi>Media,</hi> at the time when he was the Favorite of the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> He ordered it to be made in the faſhion
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44346:102"/> of a Tower, which was wrought with ſuch extreme curioſity and art, that the World never yet ſaw its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, its contrivance being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtupendious and inimitable. <hi>Joſephus,</hi> whom I now quoted, and who himſelf ſaw it ſeveral ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſays, that in his days, it ſeem'd to be yet ſtark new, and look'd then, as if it had been but juſt finiſhed; adding, that a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſt had an allowance given him to keep there both Day and Night, that no Body might ſpoil or damnifie that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Building; with whoſe beauty and extraordinary curioſity the Kings of that Nation were ſo much taken, that they ſince made uſe of it for their Royal place of Burial.</p>
               <p>NOR is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be built at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for his Father <hi>David</hi> and himſelf, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted here; who being a moſt wiſe Prince, as the great and matchleſs things he atchieved in his life-time, do abundantly teſtifie, it is eaſie to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44346:103"/> gueſs; that this Monument of his was a ſurpaſſing, curious and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Maſter-piece of Art; and wherein neither skill, nor riches were wanting, that might render it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wonderful and extraordinary. There was nothing in, or about it, but what was wonderful and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing; Nature and workmanſhip having beſtowed their utmoſt skill and greateſt Treaſures upon it. But that which I find moſt remarkable in it, is the place wherein he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the two Coffins for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and himſelf, to be placed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame could never by any induſtry be found out; the inner part of the Vault or Cave being made in the faſhion of a Labyrinth. And Hiſtory informs us, that <hi>Herod</hi> being on a time obſtinately reſolved to find out this ſecret place, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
ſome of his Men to break down certain ſtones, whoſe remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val he thought might likely diſcover the concealed Royal Tombs, but was
ſoon affrighted from attempting fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44346:103"/> by the fire that iſſued forth in great flaſhes from it, and conſumed two of his Men upon the ſpot; ſo that beſides a rigorous Edict he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, whereby he ſtrictly enjoyned, that for time to come, none ſhould dare to attempt a like re ſearch, he cauſed a very mean Sepulchre to be made hard by it for himſelf, by way of reparation of the wrong he had offer'd to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Two ſorts of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in their Sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres.</note> NEITHER ſhall I ſpeak here of the great Treaſures found in thoſe Sepulchres; for none can be ignorant of the vaſt Riches of all kinds, that were laid up therein, who conſiders, that thoſe Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lookt upon as ſacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable among the <hi>Jews,</hi> every one of them carried thither the moſt rare and precious things they had, thinking them more ſafe there, without Guards, than in their own Houſes or Coffers. They were moſt commonly Lords, and Perſons of great Eſtates, who did ſo; as finding it too cumberſome for them
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44346:104"/> to keep their Treaſures at home, by reaſon of their great Riches: as likewiſe Widows and Orphans, who were not capable of looking after, and managing what was their own.</p>
               <p>BUT beſides thoſe riches which were kept there for the uſe of the Living, much was alſo encloſed in honour of the Dead. Hence it was that the High Prieſt <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf beſieged within the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Pious,</hi> took out of <hi>David</hi>'s Sepulchre, nine hundred Years after his Death, three thouſand Talents, whereof he gave a part to that Prince, to make him retire with his Army; and with the other he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Souldiers, in order to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a condition of preventing the like diſaſter for time to come. Out of which Sepulchre, <hi>Herod,</hi> a good while after, took a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Veſſels of Gold, Jewels, and other precious Ornaments. From whence we may eaſily conclude,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44346:104"/> that his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſpared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to honour his Father's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. In like manner, we read in the Fourteenth Chapter of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> did in their Invaſion of <hi>Judea,</hi> open all the Princes Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, for the ſake of the Treaſures they encloſed. And <hi>Sozomene</hi> tells us, that the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Tomb being opened in his days, a young Prince of the Royal Blood was found lying at his Feet, with a Crown of Gold upon his Head, and array'd in a moſt rich Robe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princely habiliments.</p>

The firſt is, <hi>How it comes to paſs, that ſo great honours were by them paid to the Dead, ſince according to the</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick <hi>Law, none could touch them, without being polluted; inſomuch that thoſe who took care of their
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44346:105"/> Burial, could have no fellowſhip with any, till after they had waſhed and purified themſelves?</hi> To this all the Interpreters do unanimouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his intent was not thereby to ſignifie, that dead Bodies were abominable in themſelves; but that bearing the blemiſhes and
ſtains of ſin, by their being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of life, they were to purifie themſelves, who had touched them, as if they had touched ſin it ſelf; Death being its proper and natural effect and reward.</p>

ſo often mentioned in the Scripture; from whence ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that the Dead amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſometimes conſumed in the Fire, but without any ſufficient ground or reaſon for it, nothing
(as hath been ſaid) being more contrary to the Cuſtome of that People. Wherefore we anſwer, that thoſe burnings mentioned in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44346:105"/> Scripture, were quite of another nature, and muſt not be underſtood of Corpſes, but of ſweet-ſcented Woods and Perfumes, which they conſumed to a vaſt expence, at the Funerals of their Kings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons of the higheſt Quality.</p>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:44346:116"/> or Relation; not doubting, but that if they ſhould neglect any the leaſt circumſtance therein, they would be ſeverely puniſhed for it: For they do eſteem them ſo eſſential and abſolutely neceſſary for the Reſt of the departed Soul, that they are perſwaded it would never be by the Angels carried up into the Bed of God, there to repoſe to all Eternity, if but one ſingle punctilio ſhould be omitted in this ſervice; but that on the contrary it would be fain to wander up and down in a Region where it muſt meet with troops of Devils, that would moſt cruelly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and torment it.</p>

For they ſtrip the Monks of their Frock and Cowl, and let their Bodies lie

As for their Prieſts, they apparel them with their own Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal Garments, and Eccleſiaſtical Ornaments; thereby to repreſent the high Excellency of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and Dignity of their Character. As for the Lay-people, they are, after their Death, adorned with their richeſt cloaths; and if they be ſuch as have been Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, with their Gowns and Robes of State; as thinking they cannot be too neatly and handſomly dreſs'd, being to appear in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44346:125"/> take to hide themſelves from the

               <p>AFTER what has been before
ſaid concerning Funeral Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as common to all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World (even the moſt barbarous) none can doubt, but that they are Sacred in themſelves,
ſince they are taught us by Nature, Reaſon, and conſequently by God himſelf, in order to give humane Bodies, the reſpect and honour due to them, as being by means of the Immortality of the Soul, far eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled above thoſe of all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. True it is, that theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies among ſome people are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſuperſtitious and cruel too, proportionably as by their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation and obſtinacy they have more or leſs ſwerved from the Truth, which inwardly did dictate tothem ſentiments altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44346:129"/> to their extravagant actings. But thanks be to God, they have with us remain'd pure and entire, as will plainly appear both from the continual practice of the Church, from the firſt Centuries until now, &amp; by Arguments no leſs ſtrong and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, than holy, and religious, upon which they are grounded; ſo as to be able to ſtop the mouths of the moſt obſtinate Libertines and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; in caſe they have but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to read the unqueſtionable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Authorities we are to alledge here.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelling and Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
                  </note> AS ſoon as any one is Dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, they cloſe his Eyes and Mouth, kiſs and embrace him; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they waſh, perfume and apparel him. When he is dreſs'd, they for ſome time expoſe the Body in the Entry of the Houſe, or in
ſome other large Room, till the Prieſts come to take it away, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to its Burial; at which time all the Company march in Proceſſion, attended with more or leſs Pomp
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44346:129"/> and Ceremony, according to the quality of the party Deceaſed. At the head of this ſolemn attendance one advanceth with the Croſs, who is followed by the Clergy-men,
ſinging all the way: On this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the number of Lights and Wax-Tapers is great, and greater is the croud of People that accompany the Corps; whereof ſome are weeping and lamenting, whilſt others repeat Prayers for the Dead. Laſt of all, when they are arrived at the Church, and a Maſs for the Reſt of his Soul has been celebrated, he is Interr'd there, or elſe in another conſecrated place, call'd the Church-yard.</p>
               <p>THESE are all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies we uſe in this particular; of which ſome one or other are often omitted, either by reaſon of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of the Party, the negligence of his Relations; or laſtly, becauſe
ſome do affect a more ſimple and plain way of Burying their Dead. Nevertheleſs all of them may in an
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44346:130"/> holy manner be practiſed; and for which we have reaſon to expect a Reward at the laſt day, as being Works of Mercy, which by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Judge are ſo highly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us.</p>
               <p>NOW we muſt prove, that theſe have always, and are ſtill uſed; and ſhew the reaſon of this Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why we ſhut the Eyes and Mouth of the Dead.</note> IN the firſt place then, we cloſe the Eyes and Mouth of our deceaſed Friends and Relations (which S. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> tells us in his <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi> is a Cuſtom that was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) to repreſent, that the Death of the Faithful is, according to the Oracles of Scripture, but a Repoſe; ſince after having been aſleep for a while, they ſhall be awaked to Eternity: Moreover, by ſhutting their Eyes and Mouth, we do intimate, that the Dead are no more to take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the objects of this, their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment now being ſtedfaſtly to behold all the raviſhing beauties of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44346:130"/> the other World; and continually to praiſe God, who is the glorious and bountiful Diſpenſer of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why we kiſſed the Dead.</note> TO which the foreſaid Father adds in the ſame place (and S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> confirms it in his 118. Epiſtle) that they kiſs'd the Dead, either to congratulate them upon the account of the happineſs they were going to enjoy; or thereby to ſignifie the Eternal union, that God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ordained to be between them and the Living, who both of them make but one and the ſame Church: Which Communion all the power of the bottomleſs pit can never break or diſſolve, nor ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the holy Travellers, from thoſe who are already enter'd upon the poſſeſſion of Everlaſting Glory: As alſo to ſhew the Natural tenderneſs and love they had for the Deceaſed. But this Cuſtom is now quite abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with us in many places, and not very ſtrictly obſerved in others, though indeed it be very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; and they who practiſe it, do
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44346:131"/> thereby ſhew their piety; ſince the motives thereof are moſt Holy. <hi>Denys</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the Seventh Book of his Hiſtory, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the embracing of the Dead, which queſtionleſs was grounded upon the ſame reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why we waſh the Dead.</note> AS for the uſage of waſhing the Dead, S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his Speech on this Subject, and S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his 84. Homily on S. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that it was hallowed in the Perſon of our Lord and Saviour, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Body was waſhed as ſoon as they took it down from the Croſs. And we read in the ninth Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that a Woman of <hi>Joppa,</hi> called <hi>Tabitha,</hi> whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> reſtor'd to life, had been waſh'd before ſhe was laid in the upper room of the houſe. S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> alſo, whom I juſt now quoted, in his firſt <hi>Homily</hi> upon <hi>Job,</hi> deſcribing the Funeral Duty a Son ought to pay to his deceaſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tells us, that he muſt firſt of all waſh his Body, which decent
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44346:131"/> Cuſtom is confirm'd by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Apologetick. Surius</hi> informs us, that S. <hi>Martian</hi> took a particular care to ſearch for the dead Bodies of the Poor, in order to the giving them Burial, and that he never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of waſhing them well with fair water. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, does both in his Ritual, and ſeveral other Works of his, ſpeak of this Cuſtom as univerſally approved of by the whole Church: And though it be not at this day uſed in <hi>France,</hi> yet S. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> gives us ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inſtances, that it was in his days religiouſly obſerved amongſt us. By which waſhing of the Body they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, that as the Dead had by the Sacraments been cleanſed from their filthineſs, ſo they would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be receiv'd into Heaven, where no polluted or unclean thing ſhall ever be able to enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why the Dead are perfumed.</note> NEITHER is the Cuſtom of perfuming the Corps leſs holy and reaſonable, ſince beſides that it was
(as well as that of waſhing) ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44346:132"/> in the Perſon of our Lord, it is authorized by an infinite number of inſtances among the Primitive <hi>Christians,</hi> which without doubt may very well be imitated. We read in S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> that the three <hi>Maries</hi> not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with the precious Drugs and Odours wherewith <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did perfume and embalm the Sacred Body of our Bleſſed Lord, ſpeedily repaired with ſweet Spices to his Sepulchre, with an intent of paying that Duty to him there. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the reaſon why the Primitive <hi>Christians</hi> were ſo careful to perfume the Dead was, becauſe they regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them as ſo many Members of the Myſtical Body of the Redeemer of the World. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologetick,</hi> upbraiding the <hi>Heathens</hi> with their vaſt expences of ſweet Scents and Perfumes, conſum'd in their Temples, tells them that thoſe Odours would be better employ'd in embalming the Bodies of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:44346:132"/> than in perfuming their Idols. Upon which account it is, that the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who knew that this pious Cuſtom was religiouſly obſerv'd by the <hi>Christians,</hi> reproach them in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius Felix,</hi> that they neglected the Living, and took care only of the Dead; ſince they reſerv'd all their Perfumes for their Funerals. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus</hi> ſpeaking in his <hi>Catachetical Instructions</hi> againſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who laviſhed too much Mony in perfuming themſelves, ſays, that that expence cannot be well allow'd, but only to the Dead. <hi>Prudentius</hi> and <hi>Orentius</hi> two Chriſtian Poets, who have made ſeveral Elogies in praiſe of thoſe that dy'd with the
ſweet Odor of Holineſs, do not omit mentioning among other Honours done to them, that of perfuming their dead Bodies. S. <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> does in his 18. Epiſtle ſay, that this honour was paid to his Brother <hi>Caeſarius.</hi> Several other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſame kind might be produced out of S. <hi>Ambroſe, Gregory</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:44346:133"/> the Great, <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> his Annals, concerning the Bodies of <hi>Martyrs:</hi> But to ſhun prolixity, we
ſhall to the Premiſes only add what <hi>Lactantius</hi> delivers on this ſubject. <hi>The reaſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>why we</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>do perfume the Dead, is, becauſe this honour did always attend the</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis, <hi>or Canonization of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as it is obvious to obſerve both from Sacred and Profane Writers; and therefore it is, that we render this kind of Divine honour to thoſe whom we believe (as it were) deified, by their paſſage from this life, to a bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why the Dead are clothed.</note> AS concerning the manner of apparelling the Dead, all of us are not in the ſame practice: For ſome do only cover them with a large Winding-ſheet, as we do in <hi>France;</hi> and others dreſs them in the very
ſame Cloaths they were wont to wear when yet alive, as in <hi>Italy</hi> and other places. Which latter way was formerly eſteemed more honourable, and much uſed in the firſt <hi>Centuries.</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:44346:133"/> For not to ſpeak of the Prieſts, who are always buried with us in all their Eccleſiaſtical Ornaments: I find in the <hi>Roman Pontifical,</hi> that Pope <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychius</hi> did in his time order all the Bodies of Martyrs to be arrayed in a fair Surplice: With reference to which, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> in his 44. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle finds fault, that ſome of his Predeceſſors had that honor done to them, which was only due to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. <hi>Surius</hi> acquaints us, that an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Lady, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> by Name, clad St. <hi>Maximinus,</hi> a Martyr, in a very rich Apparel, before he was laid in his Coffin. And <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> tells us as much of <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> a <hi>Roman Senator;</hi> who being informed that an Illuſtrious Captain of his time, called <hi>Marinus,</hi> was Martyr'd at <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Palaeſtina,</hi> cauſed a ſtrict ſearch to be made for his body, and when he had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, committed the ſame to the Earth, adorned with very coſtly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilements. We read in the Lives of the Fathers of the Deſart, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44346:134"/> in that of S. <hi>Pachomus,</hi> that the dead Bodies of all thoſe Hermites were moſt richly decked. And St. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> tells us, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beſtow'd very coſtly Cloth and Stuff, to array the Corps of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Macrina,</hi> who died in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
               <p>TO the foregoing inſtances of the rich Veſtments beſtow'd by the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> upon the Dead, we may add the Deſcription of two magnificent Tombs, found in the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the <hi>Vatican;</hi> The firſt of theſe was diſcover'd in the Year one thouſand four hundred and forty eight, in the Chappel of St. <hi>Petronilla,</hi> as they were digging a Grave for a Penitentiary then late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceaſed. It was all of Marble, and
ſo purely white, and curiouſly poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it paſs'd for a wonder; in the in-ſide of which there were two <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi>-Cheſts or Coffins, over-laid with Plates of Silver, whereon the ſign of the Croſs was engraved, and within the ſame were two Bodies apparel'd
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44346:134"/> in Veſtments of Cloth of Gold, but
ſo rich, that beſides four-ſcore pounds weight of Silver, which the Plates weighed, the Gold of their Cloaths, and other Ornaments amounted to
ſixteen Pound-weight. The other Tomb was, that of the Empreſs <hi>Mary,</hi> Wife of <hi>Honorius,</hi> which was diſcovered in the time of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, and was likewiſe of Marble; in which, over and above the Gold, which amounted to about forty Pound weight, there were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
ſeveral curious Veſſels of Cryſtal and Agate, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rich Jewels. As for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why we dreſs the Dead, they are very plain and obvious, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that Nature teacheth us to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nakedneſs of humane bodies, we do ſignifie thereby, that they have by their death put on immortality; and therefore the more rich thoſe accoutrements are, the more proper are they to repreſent thoſe Heavenly Robes of Glory, prepared for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:44346:135"/> NOR is it needful to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Antiquity for inſtances, that may authorize the expoſing of the Corps to publick view. We herein follow Tradition, which with us is inſtead of a Law; and injoyns us to ſet the Body, either in the Entry, or the principal and moſt publick room of the Houſe; and that for two reaſons. The firſt, that by this ſight, thoſe that paſs by may be taken off from Terreſtrial things, and fix their thoughts on thoſe that are Heavenly, by being thereby put in mind of their latter end. The other, to crave the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Suffrages for the Deceaſed; that God may be merciful to them, and without ſuffering them to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in the torments of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> receive them the ſooner into the abode of the Bleſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons of the Pomp and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony wherewith they carry the Dead to the Grave.</note> IT is the belief of this Bliſs and Felicity, which the Faithful enjoy after their Death, makes us accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them in a pompous Proceſſion, with Hymns and Lights. <hi>We give
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44346:135"/> all theſe marks of joy at Burials</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> in his Fourth <hi>Homily</hi> on the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews) becauſe we conſider the Dead, as ſo many ſtout Champions, that have couragiouſly fought, and gloriouſly obtained the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</hi> Wherefore we give thanks to God, for his having ſo powerfully
ſupported them in all their needs and troubles; deliver'd them from all the miſeries of this Life, made them triumph over all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and laſtly, for having baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their fears, by crowning them with Eternal Glory and Felicity. And indeed this Proceſſion has
ſomething in it of a triumphal March; the Hymns or Songs are
ſo many publick ſhoutings and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations; and the Lights that
ſhine every where, do by their ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor much add to the glory of this Pomp. 
<q>What can be more great and ſolemn </q>
(ſays S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Interment of <hi>Sancta Paula,</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> of that of his
Siſter) <q>than to ſee ſuch a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44346:136"/> of Perſons, conſecrated to God, cloathed in their Sacerdotal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and who by their gravity and the orderly and decent manner they proceed in, look like ſo many Princes, and are really ſo, of a Kingdom far more glorious, than any on Earth? What is more charming and pleaſing to the Ear, than the melody &amp; concert of their Songs? whereby they imitate the Angels, who at the ſame time do with <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> and joyful Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, receive the Soul of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted?</q> In ſhort, what is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to behold, than the light of
ſo many burning Tapers? This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial brightneſs giving us a weak <hi>Idea</hi> of that Eternally clear and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning day they meet with in Heaven. We might here add many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why our Funerals are attended with Lights; as firſt, That it is the emblem of Joy, Honour and Life, which are the three chief advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of that Eternal Beatitude, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with true Chriſtians ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44346:136"/> in the other World. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they paſs (as the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it) from the bitter waters of mortification and auſterity, to a river of pleaſure; and from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and humility, to the higheſt degree of Glory; in a word, from Death to Eternal Life. Secondly, we make uſe of Lights on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to put all the powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to flight, and to ſhew that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians having never had any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with thoſe infernal Spirits, which endeavour to hide all their actions; but on the contrary exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed themſelves in ſuch works as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for their exemplarineſs to be
ſet before the eyes of the whole World; they are paſſed from one light to another; that is, from the amiable brightneſs of Virtue, to the glory of its Reward. In the third place, to intimate, that they have obey'd that Precept of our Lord, which requires his Servants to be always ready, with their Lamps burning, that they may be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44346:137"/> and in a poſture to open to, and follow him whenever he ſhall pleaſe to call upon them. And laſt of all, to ſignifie, that they died in the light of Faith, and that as they have in this life ſought nothing but <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> who is the true Light, ſo ſhall they poſſeſs the ſame in the other, to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why the Croſs goes before.</note> AT the head of this Pomp the Croſs advanceth, which is the Mark and Character of the Elect, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> and the Key of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> The moſt ancient Writers of our Religion tell us, that it hath always been carried in great Solemnities, and was the chief Ornament in all Pompous Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Beſides, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great cauſed it to appear at his Triumph, as it did to him in the midſt of the Fight; and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in the <hi>Empire</hi> do ſtill in our days place it on the top of their Crowns; <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomene</hi> tell us, that in the very firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> it was
ſeen at the head of all the Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44346:137"/> which the <hi>Orthodox</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Arrians;</hi> That S. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> cauſed ſome Silver-ones to be very curiouſly wrought for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and that the Clergy never went forth in a Body, neither at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nor any other City of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> without advancing the
ſplendid Repreſentations of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Wood. And to the end, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might never diſcontinue this holy Cuſtom, the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian</hi> eſtabliſhed it by a Law; as we may read in his 133. <hi>Novel:</hi> Which <hi>Surius</hi> alſo confirms by a thouſand inſtances of Antiquity. It is not therefore to be wonder'd at, that we carry it in all our Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Marches, ſince it has ever been the Cuſtom ſo to do in all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Pompous Solemnities whatſoever. And I find there is more reaſon for it in this, than in any other beſides; nothing leſs than the Kingdom of Heaven (into which this alone can procure us an entrance) being here at ſtake.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44346:138"/> Thus we ſee in the Goſpel, that when the Soveraign Judge ſhall come down in the Clouds, to give all men their Doom and Reward, he ſhall cauſe this ſign of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to go before him, which
ſhall be the touch-ſtone of the Good
&amp; Bad; for as he will receive all them into the number of his Elect, that have reſpected it; ſo will he caſt down to Hell all thoſe Reprobates, who Devil-like have deſpiſed and contemned the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why they weep there.</note> IT might ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that after this pompous and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Proceſſion, a quite contrary Quire ſhould follow; there being nothing more unſuitable to thoſe Hymns, and other marks of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings afore-mentioned, than the Tears and Lamentations of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Deceaſed, and that
ſadneſs which appears in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of all their Friends. But theſe Tears of the Laity have their reaſons, as well as the rejoycings of the Clergy: The one expreſs the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44346:138"/>
ſenſe of Nature, and the other that of Faith. Both which ſentiments are ſo juſt, that far from being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and deſtructive of each other, they make up one of the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Concerts and <hi>Symphonies</hi> in the World. This S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> elegantly declares, in his <hi>Comment</hi> on the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</hi> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> where that <hi>Apoſtle</hi> adviſeth us not to be ſad and dejected at the Death of our Friends and Relations, as they are who have no hope. <hi>This Oracle</hi> (ſays he) <hi>does not condemn all ſorrow for the Dead, but only ſuch as is immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and like that of the</hi> Heathens, <hi>who expect no Eternal Felicity in the other World. It is impoſſible</hi> (adds the ſame Father) <hi>that we ſhould have no ſenſe of, and feel no grief at all for the Death of Perſons, who are ſo dear to us; for though we are aſſured, that we ſhall one day meet them in Heaven, yet this parting (beſides that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Nature) depriving us of them for a time, cannot but be very grievous. Moreover, we do not only in Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44346:139"/> the deſtruction of the Body, but the horrid and frightful image of Sin, which is the cauſe of it; ſo that far from being not to afflict our ſelves in this ſo ſad a juncture, we might</hi> (ſays he) <hi>be altogether comfortleſs, if Faith did not awake our Hope, and Hope calm and allay this natural and juſt ſorrow. So that we are grieved, and cannot chuſe but be ſo, becauſe of this ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But the bitterneſs of this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſweetned and mitigated, by the
ſtedfaſt hope we have one day to ſee them again in Heaven, who for a time are departed from amongſt us. Nature afflicts, and Hope glads us; our own weakneſs caſts us down, and Faith rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us: Our miſerable condition makes us mourn, and the Divine Promiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth and comforts us. I forgive Parents</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Jerome) for the Tears they ſhed at their Children's Death. No, I cannot</hi> (purſues he<hi>) blame your mourning, when I conſider you are the Father and Mother of them that are Dead. But withal muſt blame you, if you do not ceaſe your Tears, when
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44346:139"/> I have put you in mind that you are</hi> Chriſtians. And S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> on the ſame ſubject ſpeaks to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <hi>I do not abſolutely forbid you to weep, but to weep immoderately. I am not cruel, but rather ſympathize with you, as well knowing how much Nature ſuffers on theſe occaſions. This I ſee commonly happens even to the moſt Virtuous Perſons; and not to mention thoſe two great Patriarchs,</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Joſeph, <hi>the one whereof wept over his Wife</hi> Sarah, <hi>and the other over his Father</hi> Jacob; <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, who ought to be our Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, wept at the Grave of</hi> Lazarus; <hi>which the</hi> Jews <hi>perceiving, did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his Tears to the love he had for this holy Perſon. You ſee therefore</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes S. <hi>Ambroſe) that Tears, when moderate, may be the marks as well of our Piety, as of our Grief; and that being made up of the weakneſs of our Nature, and certainty of our Hope, they may well become</hi> our Chriſtian Funerals.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why the Dead are pray'd for.</note> BESIDES, I find that the Prayers the Friends of the Dead re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe, are very ſuitable to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Solemnity.

Now this variety which ſeems ſo diſagreeing and inconſiſtent, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs moſt pleaſing to God, and makes a moſt admirable Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, wherein he very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; becauſe theſe differing Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not ſo contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that they are all equally good and holy.

Theſe pious Works, as well as Prayers, are done for the Reſt of the departed Souls. Which Cuſtom has always been obſerved by the Church, as we may collect from all the fore quoted Fathers, who ſpeaking of the Funerals of the Chriſtians, mention alſo theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and holy aids.

                  <note place="margin">Burying-places of <hi>Christians.</hi>
                  </note> NOW what remains, is to ſhew, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ever had particular Places to Bury their Dead in, and that thoſe Places were conſecrated and hallowed. We read in the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical, that almoſt the ſame Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are us'd at the Conſecration of <hi>Coemeteries,</hi> as at that of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; both which have the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and the one may be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted as many ways, as the other. St. <hi>Denys</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> who lived in the time of the Apoſtles, does in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44346:141"/> the ſeventh Chapter of his <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> call <hi>Coemeteries,</hi> Honourable and Sacred Places. The ſame Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives them in the
51. Chapter of his Book of his Soul; as well as <hi>Optatus Milevitanus,</hi> in his
ſixth <hi>Book;</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his 68. <hi>Epiſtle;</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in the Second Book of <hi>Offices;</hi> and Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 64. <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> Moreover S. <hi>Jerome,</hi>
ſpeaking of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Coemetery</hi> of the firſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which was at <hi>Antioch</hi> without <hi>Daphnis</hi>-Gate. And Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his Sermon concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> aſſures us, that in his time there was not one <hi>Chriſtian</hi> City, Town or Village in the World, which had not a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard belonging to it. But beſides this great Number of Authorities, which cannot be oppoſed, all of them proving the ſacredneſs of theſe Places, by the holy Name which is beſtow'd upon them, we ſhall be the more perſwaded and convinc'd of this Truth, if we do conſider
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:44346:141"/> that the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and other Divine and Eccleſiaſtical Services are here celebrated, as well as in Churches. Neither do I ſpeak only of thoſe Places called <hi>Catacumbae,</hi> where <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> were interred, but generally of all our Church-yards. Let us hear what St. <hi>Clement</hi> the Pope ſays in his <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions; Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves in the</hi> Coemeteries, <hi>there read the Sacred Books, and ſing your Spiritual Hymns; be preſent at the</hi> Maſs <hi>that is celebrated there, and after you have received the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our</hi> Saviour, <hi>continue the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your Songs.</hi> Next, let us inſpect the Acts of Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> wherein we ſhall find, that having been driven and caſt out of the Churches, by the command of <hi>Conſtans,</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperor; he retired to <hi>Coemeteries,</hi> there to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf in the Duties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Charge. And S. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> to the ſame <hi>Conſtans,</hi> ſays, that the People of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who were <hi>Catholicks,</hi>

So that it muſt needs be a great matter of joy and comfort to us, to be Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ſuch Holy Places. Now all this ſhews, that it hath been the conſtant belief of the Church, that the Bodies of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were not to be lookt upon, as thoſe of other Men, but as Relicks, which were one day to be tranſported into the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Wo to them, who by their impenitence and obſtinacy, ſhall be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of this unſpeakable Bliſs: For, as their unclean and polluted Carkaſſes have defiled and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe Sacred Places; ſo ſhall they be Eternally puniſh'd for it in Hell; where, inſtead of a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Burial, they ſhall, like the rich Man in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> for ever have no other Grave, than thoſe devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet never conſuming Flames.</p>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44346:143"/> as ſo many Secretaries of their Gods, and Interpreters of their Wills; they all with one accord will tell us, that Burial is one of the chief and moſt indiſpenſable Duties charged upon Mankind; of which none can deprive another, without a manifeſt breach of the Law of Nature. Nay, they peremptorily aſſert, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors themſelves may not deny it their vanquiſh'd Enemies. <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> repreſents the Women of <hi>Argos,</hi> crying out againſt <hi>Creon,</hi> King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> as an ungodly and Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prince, becauſe he would not permit them to bury their Sons, who were ſlain in the Battel, they had fought againſt him; not being able to conceive, but that if he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Gods, he would have reſpected their Laws.</p>
               <p>AND <hi>Sophocles</hi> ſpeaking of the threats, wherewith the ſame <hi>Creon</hi> menaced <hi>Antigone,</hi> becauſe ſhe had
(contrary to his order) buried her Brother <hi>Polynices,</hi> introduceth her, anſwering that Prince with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44346:143"/> courage and conſtancy, founded upon the Will of the Gods, which ought always to be prefer'd before that of Men. <note place="margin">Sophocl. in Antigon.</note>

                  <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> informs us, that <hi>Cybele</hi>'s Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons having cauſed <hi>Atys</hi> to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, upon the account of his too great familiarity with her, and left his Body lying on the ground in the open fields, the whole Country of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> which was the ſcene of that cruel action, was thereupon

               <p>IN ancient time it was not lawful to make water, or ſo much as ſpit, in Places ſet apart for Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Dead, for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they were us'd to have there the repreſentations of Griffins, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Dogs, (they being the moſt watchful of all Creatures) as ſo many Spies to have an eye that no undecent action might be done there.</p>
               <p>YEA, it was this great reſpect which the Ancients had for the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:44346:157"/> Dead, that firſt gave birth to their Idolatry, and made them change Sepulchres into Temples. Here they reared their Altars, offer'd Sacrifices, and at laſt worſhipped them as Gods, who were buried as Men. <hi>Virgil</hi> tells us, that the Marble-Tomb, <note place="margin">Aen. 4.</note> which Queen <hi>Dido</hi> had caus'd to be erected in her Palace, in honour of her firſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, was (even during her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time) looked upon as a Temple,
ſo that by the Divine Honours, which were there paid to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
ſhe firſt gave an inſtance of this Superſtition. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that all our <hi>Divines</hi> have upbraided the <hi>Pagans</hi> with that groſs blindneſs, into which they wilfully plung'd themſelves, by placing them amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gods, whom they had by experience, known to be but Men, having ſeen them, as well as others, obnoxious to Death, which is the greateſt defect of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:44346:158"/> humane Nature, and therefore moſt contrary to Divinity.</p>

               <p>AND what ſurpriſes me more, is, that wiſe and learned Men have not been able to keep themſelves from being taken with this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and not only with the multitude followed, but by their Writings authorized the ſame. <hi>Labeo</hi> tells us, with his uſual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as if he were pronouncing the Decrees and Acts of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>

               <p>IN ſhort, this Opinion was of old ſo univerſally receiv'd, that there was not a Family but had their own Gods; for every one honoured in particular all thoſe of his own Blood, that were dead.</p>

               <p>AND indeed from what they tell us themſelves, I find that they expreſſed no leſs reverence to them whom they had ſoon die, than to thoſe they believed Immortals, and were worſhipped publickly.
