         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>My Honour'd Lord,</p>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here present to your Lordship the true Effigies of <hi>Dr. Heylyn</hi> (drawn to the Life, so far as my Pen is
<pb facs="tcp:59267:3"/>
able, to preserve the memory of his person among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of worthy men, for his extraordinary merits, I hope, may be truly said to this Church and Nation, wherein he labour'd while he liv'd to promote the publick Good of both; that his Name will never be forgotten, whil'st his Books are extant, if we may believe the words of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>Vir sapiens</hi> (saith<note place="margin">S. Jer. Com. in cap. 2. Esdr.</note> he) <hi>diebus &amp; noctibus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borat
<pb facs="tcp:59267:3"/>
&amp; componit Libros ut memoriam suam poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris derelinquat;</hi> so the Works which this painful Presbyter has publish'd to the World, the Catalogue of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ordinary with the Writers of our Age, and the matter in them upon several Subjects not vulgarly handled, I doubt not, will perpetuate his Memory to future Posterity; especially among all good men, who are sincere Lovers of Monarchy and Episcopacy.
<pb facs="tcp:59267:4"/>
I am sure for his Religion and Loyalty, for the Cause of the King and Church of <hi>England,</hi> no man could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himself a more faithful and zealous example, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant writing and sufferings. And for his conversation, not only as a good Christian, but as becomes a Clergy man, it was so unblameable, that his most inveterate enemies could never throw dirt in his Face for the least Immoralities.</p>
                  <p>Therefore for his sake,
<pb facs="tcp:59267:4"/>
whom your Lordship hath seen in his house at <hi>Abingdon,</hi> where he made you heartily welcome in those dayes, when I had the honour (though so unworthy a person) to dictate the first Principles of Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Learning to you, which God has since well blessed, that you are one (and I wish may long continue so) of the Cheif Prelates in this Realm: I doubt not, I say for this Reverend and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mans sake more than mine,
<pb facs="tcp:59267:5"/>
your Lordship will be pleased to take into your Patronage the Narrative of his Life, which I have faithfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and retriv'd from the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances and unpardonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies of a late Writer. I am the more nearly concern'd for my Relation sake, because Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> was not an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary common Clergy-man, though he acted in a lower Sphere than the highest Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries in our Church; its sufficiently known he was
<pb facs="tcp:59267:5"/>
singularly well acquainted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove many others, with the principal motions and grand Importances in his time both of Church and State, as any man may perceive, who will take the pains to peruse his Writings. And that he had not only a speculative Science in the Civil and Ecclesiastical Polity of this Nation, but was oftentimes employed an Agent by the late King and Arch-Bishop, (the two blessed Martyrs of
<pb facs="tcp:59267:6"/>
this Land) in several mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters committed to his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Charge; for which he incurr'd the odium of the Mobile and especially of those Factious People, then call'd Puritans, but now Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; a Name though seems new and strange to them, was<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:59267:6"/>
hair-brain'd zeal without understanding, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with invincible obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in their Enthusiastical Dotages, if Power was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to their Wills, would bring a second desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon our Church, and confusion in the Kingdom. Both which God and his good Angels evermore protect, that we may enjoy the inestimable comforts of Peace and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, our true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on establish'd by Law and

                  <p>I Had never put my self to the trouble of writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Reader to his pains in reading the third Publication of Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s Life, but that I have been most grosly abused in the first and second, upon the same Subject. At the sight of both which, I was not a little amazed, but ashamed: First to see an anonymous piece printed before the Doctors works, which I had ordered otherwise: And late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little Book crept forth with the Name of its Author. Therefore I must crave leave of the Reader's Patience to shew how I come concern'd, and have been uncivilly dealt with by <hi>George Vernon</hi> (as he writes himself) Rector of <hi>Bourton</hi> on

                  </p>
                  <p>About four years agoe hearing that Mr <hi>Hen. Heylyn</hi> my Brother in law, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to print his Fathers life before some miscellaneous pieces of his Writings, I made a tender of my service to that work; for which I could propose no other advantage to my self than my labour for my pains? and only to testifie my real reverence and hearty affection to his Father and mine, whom I ever honoured for his learning and good life: And because I thought such a duty might be more reasonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from me, his Son-in-Law, than any other who was a stranger to him; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when he was pleased to put several papers into my hands to transcribe, and had often discoursed various passages of his Life to me, which I know none in the world can give an account of but my self. Yet since his Sons fancy led him to make choice of another before me, I was satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and did patiently expect the coming forth of the work, not only Term after Term, but year after year, a very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time for so small a Tract. But at last instead of the Life came a Letter to me
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59267:9"/>
from a Book-Seller in <hi>London, viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Chr. Wilkinson</hi> at the sign of the black Boy in <hi>Fleetstreet,</hi> to desire my assistance, for the thing (as he writ) was at a stand: The printing of which Mr. <hi>Harper</hi> his Friend would not have undertaken had not Mr. <hi>Heylin</hi> assured him, that I was engaged in it, because it must needs be (as he said) lame and imperfect if it was done without my knowledge, who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>quainted with all the transactions of the Doctors Life.</p>
                  <p>But to those Letters I returned several flat denyals, thinking it below me to medle in that, which another had before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, much less to be his journey man to patch up what I should have made new. Besides I had no confidence in the Man, so bold and forward in the work, because he was a mere stranger to my Father <hi>Heylyn</hi> (as he now publickly confesses) and I beleive never saw the Doctors face in his Life. Yet still I was importun'd, and his writings were sent down to me, withal to let me know the Writer was willing I should make what alterations in them and additions to them, I pleased, for which I have Mr. <hi>Wilkinsons</hi> letter by me in <hi>his verbis.</hi> a person so honest as will not deny his own words.</p>

                  <p>To this Letter I expected no less than ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil thanks, for the trouble and pains I had undergone in my new imploy, not sought by me, but importuned by others, that I can say, <hi>Non lecta est operi, sed data causa meo.</hi> But instead of thanks from him, and the return of common civility; he disfigured my Papers, that no sooner came into his hands, but he fell upon them as a Lion rampant, or like the Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59267:12"/>
The Cat, upon the poor Cock in the Fable, saying, <hi>Tu hodie mihi discerperis.</hi> So my Papers came home miserably clawed, blotted and blurred, whole Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences dismembred, and Pages scratched out, several Leaves omitted which ought to have been printed, especially if he met with any passages in the Life that seemed an Ornament to it, he would give no fair Quarter to them. Such an Interpolator he was, as I hope not to meet with his Fellow. Whereas the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may think I did the like with his Manuscript: No, I sent it up whole and entire, took the pains to transcribe out of it what I thought fit to be inserted into the Life, and set his Name thereto. I did him no wrong; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he most shamefully used my Copy, that before it was carried to the Press, he swooped away the second part of the Life wholly from it; in the room of which, he shufled in a preposterous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion at the last Page, which he caused to be printed in a different Character from the other, and therein could not keep himself honest, but as the Poet saith,</p>

                  <p>For he took out of my Copy Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s Dream, his Sickness, his last Words before his Death, and left out the burning of his Surplice, which the Doctor thought ominous, but he judged superstitious. Finally he so mangled and metamorphised the whole Life I compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that I may say as <hi>Sosia</hi> did, <hi>Egomet</hi>

                  <p>Notwithstanding all which malicious practices, misbecoming any generous man, much more a Scholar and a Divine. I did intend to trouble my self no further about him, but patiently endured the wrongs, because the writing of a Life is an exercitation of no such mighty consequence; but since he hath provoked me again, by presuming to publish a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Life after he had so macerated the first, and endeavours to asperse my Name in these words, <hi>viz.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59267:14"/>
purposely omitted, because this censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and critical Age will not bear them: But for other things, both in words and matter, which is purely the Doctors own, and without them none would presume to write on such a Subject: I have made no further use of them than the Calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator himself hath done, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be either his or mine, but must be attributed to the right Owner; <hi>viz.</hi> the Doctor himself, who left them for a Rule to guide the Writer of his Life. However I have not been surrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious of whole pages together out of<note place="margin">Pag. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63.

I am no such Excerptor: But he is in the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty humor of the man who took all the Ships in the <hi>Attick</hi> Haven for his own, and yet was not Master of any one Vessel.</p>
                  <p>But all this while I misunderstand him, for possibly he meaneth his own dear words I have excerpted: If it be true, why doth he not speak in plain down right English, that the World may see my faults? For every one does not know what is excerpting. If I have been so
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59267:14"/>

But he would have done well to have particularized them, and set down my Crime in capital Letters; and then I should have demonstrated with better evidence, how he hath been inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to me: But I stand in justification of my self; what words have I robbed him of, and am become the richer for them? Truly I was never so taken with him as to be once tempted to break the Commandments, because I love plain speaking, writing, and dealing, which he does not: I hate the word excerpted, and the action imported in it: Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is a fanciful man, and thinks there is no Elegancy nor Wit, but in his own way of talking at this rate.

His Parishoners of <hi>Alsford</hi> perswaded, they should never fix eye on him, unless they took a journey to a Goal or a Gallowes. All which matters true or false are unworthy to be mentioned in the Life of so venerable a person as Doctor <hi>Heylyn:</hi> but they are scandals, and, for the most part, untruths, as shall appear hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Concerning his Marriage though he was my Father-in-law, I cannot excuse it from being clandestine, much less justify the contrary (as the Author does boldly) against a general known Truth, beleived by every one in the University, affirmed by all, and not denyed by the Doctor himself. I have reason to know it above others, because this was wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully charged upon me by Doctor <hi>Hood</hi> of <hi>Lincoln</hi> Colledg, as if I had intended to have done the like, when I desired to hold my fellowship a longer time than
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59267:17"/>
the year of Grace which had been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to others, perticularly to Mr. <hi>Cross,</hi> Rector of <hi>Great Chue</hi> in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> but denyed to me for this reason, which the Rector alledged against me, saying, <hi>You are to marry Doctor</hi> Heylyns <hi>Daughter, (we hear) and you will doe as he did.</hi> The good Man then forgetting himself that one of his own Daughters was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Fellow of <hi>Lincoln-Colledge</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was kept private, and the profit of the Fellowship received by his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law, who shall be nameless. It is more ingenious to confess an Errour, then make a weak defence or Apology for it, that does rather aggravate than extenuate the crime: While the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor sweats to prove the Doctors Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was not clanculour, because he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it to be <hi>performed upon St.</hi> Simon<note place="margin">pag. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>and St.</hi> Judes <hi>day between ten and eleven of the Clock in the morning in his own Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg Chappel, in the presence of a sufficient number of witnesses of both sexes, the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dinner was kept in his own chamber,</hi> &amp;c. Yet all this while it was a Marriage clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, a Marriage in Masquerade, a Marriage <hi>incognito</hi> to the Colledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the President and Fellows neither
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59267:17"/>
knew, nor beleived there was a true so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of Marriage in their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and though some of them were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the wedding Dinner, they took the invitation to a merriment, and not to a Marriage. Indeed it was not clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine against the Lawes of our Church and Realm, because the usual ceremonies and formalities of both were performed in the solemnization betwixt the parties, but such Marriage was expresly against the Laws and Statutes of the Colledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Founder; and much more for a married Fellow to keep his Fellowship after. He is an absur'd Writer that will start in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to circumstances, and not prove the main matter which is controverted. But what mattereth it or availeth, whether the Doctors Marriage was clandestine or no? was he only the first example of this kind in the University? was not this done in his youthful dayes? <hi>In amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re haec insunt vitia.

Yet I will not go about to accuse or condemn them, nor Apologise for him further than the rule of Rhetorick will allow, and that is, <hi>Quod negari non queat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsione voculari eludas, &amp; rem facias risu magis dignam quam crimine.</hi> that which cannot really be denyed must be put off<note place="margin">A. Gell. lib. 12. cap. 11.</note> with a Jest, and so it will seem a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter rather than a Crime, for which we have the Example of <hi>Cicero,</hi> when he was accused about Money: And so it was the Doctors case about Matrimony; the whole affair and management of it was a most pleasant humour, which he he was resolved to carry on dramatically under a disguise, and yet the same was real. Mrs. <hi>Bride</hi> placed at the the head of the Table, the Town Musick playing, himself waiting most part of the Dinner, and no formality wanting, all which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances were contrived Fallacies and yet most undeniable truths. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Writer of his Life is most greivously offended, with any one that is not of his opinion about the Doctors Marriage, and the Colledge dividend, which he received betwixt that time and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59267:18"/>
the Resignation of his Fellowship. Saith he most Davidically, <hi>But what shall be given to thee, or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue,</hi> I think still it was a Clandestine Marriage, and the Doctor was after bound to restore all emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from that time, but the Colledge did easily forgive him, and in testimony of their Love and extraordinary respect, many years after his Marriage, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate him for some time of the War with convenient Lodgings for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Wife, and Family, when they were driven out of all House and harbour from his two Livings, <hi>Alsford</hi> and <hi>Southwarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi> Why then the Writer should be so rugged as to fall into uncivil terms with that noble Foundation? I see no cause for it; much less to charge them with odious things to which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves can best answer, if he will hearken to any reason: But he seems to me, for a time deprived, and (as it were) in a fit of Quakerism while he Canteth so dolefully, saying. <hi>They take Bread out of the mouths of Young Students, and send them to</hi>

swinged by the Doctor and the Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put an end to all the Epistolary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies between them, that he was fain then to lower his Top-sail, and durst never appear in the Doctors time, top and top gallant: In revenge of which, and therein he thinks he hath done a great Act, not to call him so much as <hi>Peter Heylyn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> or Good-man <hi>Heylyn;</hi> nay, he will not allow him a Christian Name, because he will be out of Charity with him both alive and dead.

I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, unless this be accounted a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach (which rather tendeth to his credit) that he is an impartial Writer of Histories, relating the naked Truth of things without respect of Persons, and chiefly, because he utterly dislikes such a Reformation of Religion, that is carried on in a popular and tumultuary way, which I think cannot be justifiable neither by Law, Reason, nor Scripture, nor by all the Learning Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>

hath, or ever shall have to prove the contrary. I appeal to the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the primitive Christians in the first Centuries, whether this was judged by them, an approvable way of Reformation, that is effected by the vulgar sort, (who are not competent Judges of Religion) but by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Christian Magistrate, with the advice and good counsel of the Clergy, which is the only regular and most Scriptural way; the other bends to Sedition, Blood-shed, and Confusion, if it be left to the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: Which caused the good Father to complain of the <hi>Donatists.

Their Piety and Patience is most exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary to us; that we should rather suffer for true Religion, than make resistance or Reformation by rebellion. It was a seditious saying of <hi>Donatus. Quid est</hi>

                  <p>Secondly that which so imbitters Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> against Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> is, (saith he) <hi>That</hi> Heylyn <hi>would make men believe, that it was Presbyteriaas in</hi> England, <hi>that began the late Strife and War.</hi> And who believes otherwise, but they who have a bloody mind to War again?

For what were the fruits of the godly Reformation?

those evils attending them. I think the Doctor set the Sadle upon the right Horse.</p>
                  <p>But I am sure Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not, when he puts Lads and Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who are <gap reason="foreign">

Superstitions and Forgeries of the other; Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> hath redeemed, St. <hi>Georges</hi> Honour and Reputation prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by undeniable Authorities, that St. <hi>George</hi> was a blessed and glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr for Christ, so believed and owned in all Christian Nations, a Canoniz'd Saint through Christendom, the Patron both of our <hi>English</hi> Nation anciently deemed, and of the most Honourable Order of Knighthood in the World. The History was at first presented to his Majesty by the Author, and afterwards to the Knights of the Noble Order, by his Majesty it was most graciously accepted, and by the Nobility highly praised. Notwithstanding Dr. <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> the intimate friend of Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> for whose sake to revenge the old quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, appeared against the Author, and<note place="margin">Append. to the Histo.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of K. <hi>Ch.</hi>

But there was little need for that, because all Dr. <hi>Hackwels</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Accusations were <hi>Idem per Idem,</hi> the very same repeated over, which Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> had before laid down in his Book called <hi>Histriomastix,</hi> which occasioned a second Edition of Mr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyns</hi> History, wherein he answered the Arguments of both his Antagonists, who never troubled him more upon that point, and Dr. <hi>Hackwell</hi> for his part, in the next Edition of his book about the decay of Nature made an ingenious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the passages relating to St. <hi>George.</hi> Which blessed Saint and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> the more zealously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with his pen, not only for the reasons before mentioned, but from a perticular <hi>obligation,</hi> wherewith he thought himself bound above others to prosecute the History.

found such base dealing, when this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Father so prevaricated with his Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from which he Apostatized most shamefully. No doubt he was a Jesuite in <hi>voto,</hi> or had a Pope in his Belly before he crept into the Bishoprick, His Lordships Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie was detected in a Sermon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Preached, for which he was not only questioned, but sentenc'd to a Recantation before the King.

bestowed a Living upon any Person, as he had many in his Gift, being both Lord Bishop and Lord Keeper, he would tye the Incumbent to pay an annual pension out of it, to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to such charitable and pious uses as he thought fit; so that the stream of his Charity flowed out of other mens Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and not his own; at the best he robbed <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> which the Incumbents felt by dear Experience, whom he kept at a low <hi>pittance,</hi> that for the most part they lived but poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the <hi>heavy</hi> Taxations laid upon them.

he could not be seated in a better manner, all those delightful convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces considered; and yet to add more pleasure to them, he spared no cost to beautifie and enlarge his Prebends house, in the mean time his Wife lived in the Country with his Brother Mr. <hi>Edward Heylyn</hi> at <hi>Minster Lovel</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire,</hi> and sometimes with his Uncle <hi>Raynton</hi> at <hi>Shilton</hi> in <hi>Barkshire,</hi> a man of a good Estate, who was afterward High Sheriff of the same County.</p>
                  <p>So soon as he was settled in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVI"/> house, several of his Friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Town came to visit him, and give him joy.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59267:76"/>
by his Majesties Order the <hi>decision</hi> of this Sea-question was referred to Mr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> as a Person thought fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin it; but he could neither satisfie the Captain, nor the Lord with any further answer at present, than <hi>That his Majesty was mistaken in him, for his skill and knowledge did lye more in the historical than philosophical part of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy:</hi> At which the Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> seemed to be much displeased, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had spoken thus, either out of slight to his old Captain, or through some aversness in himself to be engaged in the business; but Mr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied his Lordship to the contrary, that he intended to use all possible means by his own study, and consult with others more learned than himself in this point, <hi>non conamur tenues grandia</hi> and afterward give the King and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship a full account of the whole matter.</p>
                  <p>Several Letters passed betwixt his Lordship and Mr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> but in one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVII"/> partienlarly, <q>his Lordship commended the honest old Captain to his judicious care and consideration, telling him that in the credibility of that <hi>phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> his Majesties resolution would be

much guided by his judgment; which he found would be of special Authority with him; that he press'd the point oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to him, because he conceived it a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he owed to the Truth it self, to have it made manifest one way or other, that is either to be freed from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains imposition and pretence, if upon Tryal it appeared to be fallacious, or else to be approved and declared for right and perfect, (if such it be) to the silencing perpetually of all milici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impugners thereof, that the World may be deprived no longer of the participation and use of so publick and common a benefit.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I asked him the Ground whereon he went, and told him the difficulties which others found.</hi> His Ground (<hi>he said</hi>) was by the <hi>Nodes</hi> of the Moons Circle, because the Moon accompanied the Earth, having it the Center of her Orb. The difficulties which others imagined, was the finding out the place of the Node or ☊ upon the Superficies of the Earth. <hi>His Principle I determine to omit till more leasure, for I had but one whole day to stay in</hi> London. <hi>The difficulty of the place of ☊ I saw factible at Sea, and accordingly let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it. Now being at</hi> London, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired conference with him, and thus I proceeded. You require for the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Longitude, the distance of ☊ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth; Well, imagin you were now at Sea in an unknown place, and that I gave you in degrees of Longitude the distance of ☊ from that Place where you are; what, will you conclude? He was entring into I know not what, by demands of, if this, and if that: But I held him to the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the</hi> Hypothesis, <hi>telling him, he had</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59267:77"/>
                     <hi>what he required. At last he answered;</hi> Why? methinks you have already done it your self? You have the distance of ☊ in the degrees of Longitude of the ☊ from an unknown place, and therefore the difference of the ☊ is also unknown, except in that place only: But we require the distance from the other known place which you promised to argue? <hi>At last he began to be sensible of his mistake, and I advised him to desist from such undertakings; and being of so great an Age, to labour the discovery of another Voyage, or rather only labour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the blessed end thereof, being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy opened to us by our Saviour. And this was the end of our Communication, and will be I suppose of that business also. I wonder how for these twelve years, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath mused upon this Subject, and hath had</hi> conferrence <hi>with so mamy lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, would receive no Answer: But it seems they gave him too much</hi> liberty <hi>of</hi> digression; <hi>and he having a very ill expression of his confused</hi> conceipts, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled himself more and more in perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>

                  <p>Thus at last the old Captain was weaned from his dear Opinion, which

he had doted upon for so many years; but to his further grief, and worthily to be lamented by others, followed the Death of his Friend and learned Lord, who was the honour of his time and degree.

                  <p>It is worth our while, to see what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXIII"/> he hath written upon this point in the cause of <hi>Bloud</hi> many years after the first discourse of the Bishops <hi>Peerage</hi> when there was little hopes of ever their returning again into the House of Peers. <q>That the Bishops were disabled<note place="margin">Obser <hi>p.</hi> 224.</note> by some ancient Canons (saith he) from sentencing any man to death, and (it may be) from being present when any such sentences was pronounced, I shall easily grant; but that they were disabled from being assistants in such case, from taking the examinations or hearing the depositions of Witnesses, or giving counsel in such matters, as they saw occasion, I beleive not: Certain I am, that it is, and hath been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in point of practice. And that the Bishops sitting as Peers in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Parliament, were never excluded before this time from any such assistance, as by their Gravity and Learning, and other abilities they were enabled to give in any dark or difficult<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Observator</hi> rescued, <hi>p.</hi> 283</note> business (though of blood and death) which were brought before them:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59267:102"/>
As for the Councel of <hi>Toledo</hi> it saith nothing to their disadvantage, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is, <hi>si quis sacerdotum discursor in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienis periculis extiterit apud Ecclesiam proprium perdat gradum,</hi> that if any Priest shall intermedle in Cases endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering the Life of others, let him be degraded. Hereupon I conclude, (as to the present business in hand) that the Bishops were to be admitted to all preparatory Examination, because their counsel and assistance would have tended rather to the preservation, than conduced to the endangering of the Parties Life. I saw about that time<note place="margin">Observ. on the Hist. of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> pref.</note> (saith he) a little Manuscript Tract, entituled, <hi>De jure paritatis Episcoporum,</hi> that is to say, of the right of the Peerage of the Bishops, in which their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges were asserted, as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: But they not willing to contend in a business which seemed so little to concern them; or else not able to strive against the present stream which seemed to carry all before it, suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be excluded at that time, without protesting to the contrary, or interposing in defence of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rights. And this I look on as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59267:102"/>
the first degree of their Humiliation; For when it was perceived that a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of sogreat consequence might be done in Parliament without their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and consent; it opened a wide gap unto their Adversaries: First to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Votes, and after to destroy even the Calling it self. But this was not the main point which the Commons aimed at; they were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have a close Commitee, to take Examination in the business of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any Bishops should be of it; for fear, lest favouring the Earls cause or person, they might discover any part of those secret practices which were had against him, and thereby fortifie and prepare him for his just defence, when the Cause should come unto a Tryal.</q> Thus far the Doctor writ of this <hi>Subject,</hi> when he lived in <hi>Lacyes Court</hi> at <hi>Abingdon.</hi> What he presented to the Bishops themselves at the time of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Tryal, concerning the right of <hi>Peerage,</hi> deserved a rare commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, especially at that conjuncture of time, that he could command his <hi>Parts</hi> and Pen of a sudden to write on this

by his often dancing attendance after them, to sift the Doctor, if they could gather any thing by his speeches, whether the Arch-Bishop had moved him to draw up those <hi>Exceptions</hi> against <hi>Pryn</hi>'s Book; which he denyed, or at least was not bound to confess; for as he was faithful to his Soveraign, so he would never prove himself unfaithful to his chief Minister both in Church and State: For they would have been glad of any matter to put into their <hi>charge,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that worthy Prelate, against whom Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> and others of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies never ceased prosecuting, till the Parliament took of his head; and the Ax having once tasted of Blood, had a keen Appetite for more; went on to the Supreme Head of all.</p>

of <hi>Shelton</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks,</hi> to whom he ever shewed a Love and Reverence: and had the Doctors <hi>Power</hi> been answerable to his will and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he had design'd more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Preferments</hi> for him, but the sudden and unexpected alteration in his own <hi>affairs</hi> prevented, (so soon almost as he was preferred) that he could shew no other <hi>Specimen</hi> of his gratitude.

Christians to such a bloody Decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that every tenth man of them was to be killed: And this other was <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi> enough in its kind, that all the Gentry of the Nation, (not only the <hi>tenth</hi> part of them) who had engaged in his Majesties Service; should first be compelled to compound for their own Estates, and afterward without mercy <hi>Decimated;</hi> that brought an utter ruin upon many of their Families.</p>

A heavy charge this is, if it carried the least semblance of Truth; but what honest man may not be so belyed: <hi>Si accusare suffecerit, quis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocens erit?</hi> When the Doctor in all his Writings, (and no man I may say more) hath declared his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and upon every occasion, as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he meets with her, <hi>whets</hi> his Pen most sharply, to lance her old <hi>sores,</hi> and and let the World see what filthy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and <hi>errors</hi> abound in her; more particularly in his Book of Books, <hi>Theologia Veterum</hi> upon the Apostles Creed, the Sum of Christian Theology, positive, polemical, and philological; and in all his Court Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons upon the Tares, especially the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59267:127"/>
fourth Sermon; also in his great <hi>Cosmography,</hi> where he sets out the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> in their pontifical Colours: Therefore for the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him from this foul <hi>aspersion,</hi> with which some have maliciously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spattered many of our excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; I particularly thank the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and <hi>Learned</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingsleet</hi> for his Answer to <hi>T. G.</hi> who would have made use of the Puritans accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Papists purpose, but the worthy Doctor quickly <hi>refuted</hi> him, and ever after put him to silence, in citing Dr. <hi>Heylyns</hi> fourth Sermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Tares,</hi> where he lays at the <hi>Door</hi> of Papists, the most gross Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, greater than which, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known among the Gentiles. This being brought into discourse at such time as the Arch-Bishops Book against <hi>Fisher</hi> the Jesuit was newly publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was affirmed by some, that the Doctor in his Sermon had pulled up Popery by the Roots, yet one of the Company most maliciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed thereunto: <q>That the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop<note place="margin">Arch-Bish. Life <hi>p.</hi> 339.</note> might print, and the Doctor might preach what they pleased against
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59267:128"/>
Popery, but that he should never think them, or either of them to be the less Papists for all that.</q> A Censure of so strange a nature, (saith the Doctor himself) that he believed it is not easie to be parallel'd in the worst of times. But what need is there of producing Sermons or other Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in his behalf, when his general Conversation, more severe than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, fully attested, that as he was a strict Observer of all the Rites and Orders of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so a perfect <hi>Abhorrer</hi> of Popery and Roman Superstitions, that he would not so much as hold corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with a Papist, or with one so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; as I can instance an Example of one Mr. <hi>Hood</hi> whose Family and the Doctors were very kind, when he lived at <hi>Minster,</hi> being near Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but the Gentleman afterward changing his Religion, and turning Papist, came to <hi>Abington,</hi> to give him a Visit in his new House; the Doctor sent his Man Mr. <hi>Gervis,</hi> who was his Amanue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>LIKE a true Christian and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Son of the Church, the good Doctor did patiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all the persecutions, reproaches, and clamorous speeches, both of Papists and Puritans; not regarding what the height of their <hi>malice</hi> could speak, or their virulent <hi>Pens</hi> could write against him; because he was able to defend himself. But that which drew all the <hi>odium</hi> and inveterate malice upon him, from the several <hi>Factions</hi> then preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, was his <hi>Loyalty, Learning,</hi> and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59267:131"/>
Conscieuce, that he constantly asserted the Kings <hi>Prerogative,</hi> the Churches Rights, (not infringing the Peoples privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,) in the defence of which he was continually employed untill his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties most happy Restauration, which was the longed hope and earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of this poor distracted Nation. <hi>Quia non aliud patriae discordantis reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>

                  <p>Thus being settled in <hi>Westminster,</hi> he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XCIV"/> fell upon the old work of building a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and repairing, which is the costly pleasure of Clergy men, for the next Generation; because building is like planting, the chief benefit of which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to their <hi>Successors,</hi> that live in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Age; as <hi>Cicero</hi> said of them who took delight in planting Oake-Trees, <hi>Serunt Arbores, quae prosi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>I Cannot tell how welcom or unwelcom this Address may prove, in regard of the greatness of the Cause, and the low Condition of the Party, who <hi>nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates</hi> in it: But I am apt enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self, that the honest zeal which moves me to it; not only will excuse, but endear the boldness. There is (my Lord) a general speech, but a more general fear withal amongst some of the Clergy, that there will be no <hi>Convocation</hi> called with the following Parliament; which if it should be so resolved on, cannot but raise sad thoughts in the hearts of those, who wish the peace and happiness of this our English <hi>Sion.</hi> But being Bishops are excluded from their Votes in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, there is no other way to keep up their honour and esteem in the Eyes of the People, than the retaining of their places in Convocation: Nor have the lower Clergy any other means to shew their duty to the King,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59267:133"/>
and keep that little freedom which is left unto them, than by assembling in in such meetings, where they may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the Power of a Convocation, in granting Subsidies to his Majesty, though in nothing else. And should that Power be taken from them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the constant (but unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented) practice of the late long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and that they must be taxed and rated with the rest of the Subjects without their liking and consent? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see what will become of the first Article of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> so solemnly, so frequently confirmed in Parliament; or what can possibly be left unto them of either the Rights or Liberties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to an English Subject. I know it is conceived by some, that the distrust which his Majesty hath in some of the Clergy, and the diffidence which the Clergy have one of another, is looked on as the principle cause of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For I must needs behold it as an Innovation, that any Parliament should be called without a meeting of the Clergy at the same time with it. The first year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Qeen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59267:134"/>
times of greater diffidence and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than this present conjuncture: And yet no Parliament was called in the beginning of their several Reigns without the company and attendance of a Convocation, though the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the State aimed then at grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Alterations in the face of the Church, than are now pretended or desired: And to say truth, there was no danger to be feared from a Convocation th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ugh the times were ticklish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled, and the Clergy was divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sides and Factions, as the Case then stood, and so stands with us at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time. For since the Clergy in their Convocations are in no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to propound, treat, or conclude any thing, (more than the passing of a Bill of Subsidies for his Majesties use) untill they are impowered by the Kings Commission. The King may tye them up for what time he pleaseth, and give them nothing but the opportunity of entertaining one another with the News of the Day. But if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That the Commission now on foot for altering and explaining certain passages in the publick Liturgy, shall
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59267:134"/>
either pass instead of a Convocation, or else is thought to be neither compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table nor consistent with it; I hope for better in the one, and must profess that I can see no reason in the other. For first, I hope, that the selecting of some few Bishops, and other learned men of the lower Clergy, to debate on certain points contained in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer-Book, is not intended for a Representation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is a Body more diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and cannot legally stand by their Acts and Councils; and if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be for no other purpose, but only to prepare matter for a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as some say it is not) why may not such a Conference and Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be held both at once? For neither the selecting of some learned men out of both the Orders for the composing and reveiwing of the two Liturgies, digested in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, proved any hindrence in the calling of their Convocation, which were held both in the second and third, and in the fifth and sixth years of the said Kings Reign: Nor was it found that the holding of a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59267:135"/>
Convocation together with the first Parliament under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any hinderance to that Conference in disputation, which was designed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Bishops and some learned men of the opposite Parties. All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, I do most humbly beg your Lordship to put his Majesty in mind of sending out his Mandates to the two Arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Bishops, for summoning a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation according to the usual Form, in their several Provinces, that this poor Church may be held with some degree of veneration both at home and abroad. And in the next place, I do no less humbly-beseech your Lordship to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse this freedom, which nothing but my zeal to Gods Glory, and my affection to this Church could have forced from me. I know how ill this present Office doth become me, and how much better it had been, for such as shine in a more eminent Sphere in the holy Hierarchy to have tendred these particulars to consideration; which since they either have not done, or that no visible effect hath appeared thereof, I could not chuse but cast my poor Mite into the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which if it may conduce to the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59267:135"/>
Churches good, I shall have my wish; and howsoever shall be satisfied in point of Conscience, that I have not failed in doing my duty to this Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the light of my understanding, and then what happens to me shall not be material.

                  <p>Soon after, a Convocation was called <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XCV"/> by his Majesties Writ; and during the time of their siting (while he lived) he seldom was without <hi>Visitors</hi> from them, who constantly upon occasion, came to him for his Advice and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in matters relating to the Church; because he had been himself an <hi>ancient Clerk</hi> in the old <hi>Convocations.</hi> Many Persons of Quality, besides the Clergy, for the reverence they had to his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the delight they took in his Company, payed him several <hi>Visits,</hi> which he never repayed, being still so devoted to his studies, that except going

The good Doctor hath sent Meat from his own Table to the <hi>Prisoners</hi> in <hi>Goal,</hi> and at <hi>Abington</hi> such as were condemned to dye, he took <hi>pains</hi> to instruct and prepare them for Death, and to administer the holy <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> unto them before their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, particularly to one Captain <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> and his Company condemned with him, at <hi>Abingdon</hi> Assizes, the Captain being a known <hi>Royalist,</hi> for which reason it was thought, the Judge was so severe against him upon his Tryal, and plainly partial in the Examination of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of both sides.

that they were generally <hi>aged</hi> men, or well stricken in years, who had the gift of prophecy, though their <hi>eye sight</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len them, as did with <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet they were called <hi>Seers,</hi> because they foresaw future things, they were so old, that for their Age and gravity they were sometimes <hi>upbraided,</hi> so <hi>Elisha</hi> by the Children was mocked, who undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly were so taught by their ungodly Fathers, to say of him go up thou baldhead.

                  <p>But there is another sort of Dreams <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="CXI"/> which may be called <hi>divine</hi> or superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, which are imprinted on the mind of man, either by <hi>God</hi> himself or his

holy <hi>Angels,</hi> from which necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows prophecy; because such extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary impressions are usual for those ends.

                  <p>A Monument of Mortality. Of Peter <hi>Heylyn</hi> Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. Prebendary and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Dean of this Church. A man truly worthy of remembrance.
<pb facs="tcp:59267:155"/>
Endowed with excellent parts. Of sharp and pregnant Wit. A solid and clear Judgement. A memory tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to a Miracle. Whereunto he added an incredible Patience in Study. And therein still persisted, when his Eye sight ceased. He Writ many Books, upon various Subjects, (that are now in mens hands) containing in them nothing thats Vulgar either for Style or Argument. On all occasions he was a constant Assertor of the Churches Right, and the Kings Prerogative, as well in their afflicted as prosperous estate. Also he was a severe and vigorous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser of Rebels and Schismaticks. A despiser of Envy, and a man of undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit. While he was seriously intent on these, and many more like Studies Death commanded him to be silent, but could not silence his Fame.</p>
                  <p>He died in the Sixty third year of his Age.</p>
