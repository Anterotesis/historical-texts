         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And in thys question he stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dethe in doubt, perceuing on the won syde, that it were against the commaundement of god, so for to do, and on the other syde he dooth thynke it to be an vniuste and an vn natural thing, that the hosba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d shold be constrained to bear those vices in hys wyfe, which are more greuous, and heynose, than whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But at the laste, sekinge how to wynde hym out of thys doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful question he sayth, I do reason then after thys fashion and saye, bycause he dyd not commaunde this thig, as by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> way of aprecept

And alyghtel before, he made a similytude of Chryste, whyche dyd repudyate and caste of the syngagog, being a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb facs="tcp:5823:12"/>
taking vnto him a new spouse which is the churche. The words of Orygen are these followynge: we must say (sayth he) that Chryst dyd not put away his fyrst wyfe, that is to saye (after the spiritual vnderstondynge) the fyrste Synagoge, to geeue example that he woulde do accordyng as the scriptur teacheth, which saith: whom God hath ioyned together let no man separate) but when his wife is an aduouterous woman, beynge corrupted of the aduoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse ennemye, by whose counsell she soughte the death of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, &amp;c.

<pb facs="tcp:5823:12"/>
Hitherto are the wordes of Ory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen. Thou heareste in this place (gentyll reader) of a diuorsement, and after the dyuorsemente of a newe spouse, whereby, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfeste / and open, that Orygen was of thys mynde playnelye, that after a man hath put awaye his wyfe for whoredome, he may marrye another wyfe. But where as he sayethe, that the bysshopps dydde agaynste the doctryne of the gospel, whiche permytted and gaue lycence for maryage, after dyuorsemente, he dooth meane of those men, whiche dydde putte a waye theyr wyues for other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as the Iewes dydde.

After the selfe same reason, as the woman is an aduoutrous person although she semeth to marry le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, during the lyfe of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, euen so the man, although he semeth lawfullye to take that woman to wife, which is so diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from her husbande, yet dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And yet those matrimonis by mans law were not punished, yea they were taken as good and law full. But Origens reasoninge is, whether suche matrimonies be lawfull after the words of Christ
<pb facs="tcp:5823:13"/>
or no, namely, where as great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences did make the separation be twene the man and wife, as for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptynge to poyson her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or to do murther, and saith: Thou shalt examyn, whither he hathe a iuste excuse before god or naye.

And that thynge whiche he hathe not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye forbydden, he hath whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye permytted. The selfe same doctor with in fewe wordes after,

And truly ther is nodoubt but that this byshop did practyse that thing in his flock, whiche he wrote to be iuste, and according to the lawe. For in thexposition whi che he made vpon the seuenth ch, of the first epistle, to the Corinthi ans, he sayde after this wyse: (and that the man do not put away his wyfe) you must vnderstand (saith he) except it be for the cryme of for nication. And therfore (sayth he)
<pb facs="tcp:5823:15"/>
the Apostel speakyng of the man dyd not put therto (yf he doth put her awaye, let hym continue syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell) as he dyd when he spake of the woman, bycause it is lawfull for a man to mary another wyfe yf his wyfe be a whoore, which he hath put awaye: for he is not in so streight bondage of the lawe, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> woman. For the hed of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the man. And the selfe same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor sayde a lytle before.

For there is no such leaue gyuen to the woman, that she mai mary againe, although she dooth put away her husbande, for that he hath playde the whoremonger or hath forsaken his faith, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfullye hath desired the vse of

hys wyfe. The reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof is bi cause the inferior hath not that same prerogatiue in the law, ouer the hedde, whyche the superior &amp; hed hath ouer the inferior, that if the man doth forsake the fayth, or wold contrary to godlynes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte the lawfull vse of his wyfe, yet can she nether marrye, to anye other, nor yet returne to him aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yne. In this place where he saith that the inferyoure hath not that same priuylege, that the supery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath, he semeth (although he sayeth not so openlye) to geue leue to the man to mary another wyfe: But / within fewe wordes after he permytteth the wyfe alsoo to take another housbande, althou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe her fyrste husband be alyue.</p>
            <p>For in his exposytyon vppon these wordes of Paule, (for a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

or a sister is not bounde in suche case) that is to saye saith he they ought not to receaue any ho not by matrymony whiche do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayn &amp; hate the author &amp; maker of matrimony. For it is no good or fyrme matrimony, which is with oute the loue of god, by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che reason, the woman, whiche is putte away bycause she doth fear and loue God, dooeth not synne yf shee ioyne her selfe to an other husbande. For the coutempte, and hatred of God oure maker, doth loose and vndoo the bond of matrymonye, and settethe at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertye / the partye whiche is soo put awaye so that he, or she so for taken maye with out blame and offence cople them selfe in matry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againe with other.

<pb facs="tcp:5823:17"/>
agaynst god, and the holy state of matrymony bycause he wold not in the loue and honor of god con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynewe therin. And therfore, the faythe, and promyse of matrymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is not to be kept with hym, or her, whyche therfore forsaketh it and is gon from it, bycause he wold not here and beleue that the god of the Chrystyn people, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theye do worship sholde be the au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor and maker of matrymony. For if Esdras dyd command the wyues, and hosbandes, whiche were infidells to be put awaye, that therfore god sholde be mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciful, and not displesed if they tok other wyues or husbands of there owne nation (for they hade no sich commaundemnt that they sholde so put them awaye that thei shold take none other:) how mych more

yf an infidell person doth depart on his owne wyll, may the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full woman or man take in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age one of their owne law?

Yea, if we wyll so narrowly loke vpon the type, Origen sayth, that Chryste dyd dymysse the sinagog from hym, bycause she was a mur therat of her hosbonde, when she sayde: Take hym: Take hym, and crucifye hym, and puttyng awaye the same synagoge he ioyned the churche to hym for his spouse.</p>
