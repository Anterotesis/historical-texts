            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The firſt, whether it would be honorable and profitable to the King, and Common-wealth in generall, and to thoſe Countreys in particular, if it might be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. The ſecond, whether it be Feaſable. The third, how a compitent reward may be apportioned for them that ſhould vndertake ſo great a worke.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, the firſt argument ſhall be the counſell and care of the State in euerie age ſince this Kingdome began to be improued, appearing by the many Acts of Parliament concerning this buſineſſe, as againſt Weares, Gorces, Stankes, &amp;c. begun the 9. of <hi>H.</hi> 3. itterated the 25. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. augmented the 25. and 45. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. the 21. of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. the 1. and 4. of <hi>H.</hi> 4. And at length more diſtrictly the 12. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. But in all theſe times by reaſon of the turbulent condition of the State at home and abroad, the proſecution of this buſineſſe was either altogether fore
<pb facs="tcp:16182:3"/>
flowed, or ſo ſnatchingly perſued, that little fruit came thereof. But in the peaceable time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. who was the firſt great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouer, and in whoſe time the miſchiefe was growne to a great height, a ſetled courſe of Commiſſion of Sewers was eſtabliſhed, with <hi>a verie endleſſe power, ſuch as hath neither length nor bredth, againſt offendors,</hi> (it is the word of the Statute not onely againſt the fore-named incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, but now for the maintenance and increaſe of Walls, Ditches, Bankes, Gutters, Sewers, Goates, Caulcies, Bridges, Streames and other defences againſt inundations: by which verie names of things in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Acts not mentioned it doth appeare how the miſchiefe was growne almoſt paſt remedy before any ſufficient prouiſion was publikely made for redreſſe. Yea, although the Lawes of Sewers were ordained like Acts of Parliament, not examinable by any other authoritie, as being the moſt abſolute that paſſeth vnder the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> (ſuch was my Lord <hi>Pophams</hi> iudgement) yet ſo bootleſſe ſeemed the labour vnto the Countries afflicted, that the wiſdome of the whole Common-wealth thought fit to prouide an other Act two yeeres after to conſtraine the Gentlemen of the Countrey vnder paine and forfeiture to take the oath of a Commiſſion of Sewers as they ſhould be thereunto deſigned. In this time alſo that royall Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Counteſſe of <hi>Richmond,</hi> procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an admeaſurement and diuiſion of all the ſurrounded grounds on the North ſide of <hi>Spalding,</hi> which before that time lay promiſcuouſly. This was a great worke, and of excellent vſe, not for thoſe times onely, but the fruit of it hath continued euer ſince, euen vnto theſe dayes, and will be a great guid in this drayning buſineſſe whenſoeuer it is vndertaken. Neither did that royall Lady reſt in this, but ſhe ſat her ſelfe amongſt the Commiſſioners of Sewers, yea, and ſet her hand to the verie worke of drayning, and indeed, hit vpon the right way: but in her worke there were ſome notable errors (the world not being then ſo skilfull) which being followed by the neglect of the Countrey, in time forfeited her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious intention. After her ſtood vp <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>; Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and tooke great paines to perfect what ſhe had begun: He went into the Countrey in perſon, and imployed all his authoritie in it; but becauſe the Countrey ſhould haue borne the charge, when he was once paſſed on to <hi>Yorke,</hi> nothing went forward that hee had proiected, notwithſtanding his many Letters, and increpations. In the 3. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. the Commiſſion of Sewers was made perpetuall, which by the former Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8. was to endure but twentie yeeres, and in the 13. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was enacted that euerie particular Commiſſion of Sewers ſhould continue for ten
<pb facs="tcp:16182:3"/>
yeeres, which before was limitted to fiue; and that in the interim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the determining of one Commiſſion, and the Awarding of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Iuſtices of the Peace might execute the Commiſſion of Sewers for a whole yeere. After that by theſe prouiſions and preſidents mens wits were a little ſet on worke, in the 29. of <hi>El.</hi> ſome Gentlemen vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the recouerie of the Mariſhes of <hi>Erith, Leſnes</hi> and <hi>Plumſtead,</hi> for whoſe encouragement a Statute was made, <hi>That they ſhould haue the moye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all ſuch gained Lands, and an eighth part of the other moyetie, and hold it of the Queene as of the Mannor of Eaſt-Greenwitch in Socage by Fealtie, pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing a pennie an Acre yeerely, and no Tyth for ſeuen yeeres.</hi> This Act of Parliament incouraged many men to vndertake alſo in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and the Countreys confining, and that with approbation of the State, becauſe (ſaith the Statute) <hi>ſuch Approuement will be a great and ineſtimable benefit to her Maieſtie, her Heires and Succeſſors, diſburthening her Highneſſe of many chargeable Bankes, and workes of Sewers in thoſe ſurrounded grounds, and in the increaſe of many able Subiects by habitations being there erected, and in like ſort, profitable to many her Highneſſe Subiects, both bodyes Politike, as Corporate, who haue eſtate of inheritance, and other intereſt within the ſame.</hi> The ſame alſo was the opinion of the State in the fourth of King <hi>Iames</hi> his raigne, when the Parliament paſſed an Act for the vndertaking of <hi>Francis Tindall, Henry Far,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Cooper</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> which Act gaue them two parts of the Land ſo to be inned and drayned, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Tyth for ſeuen yeeres after thoſe ſeuen yeeres which were allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them to doe their worke in. To ſpeake nothing of the improue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Marſh-Land, Walderſey,</hi> the Londoners proportion, and diuers others, which though they remaine chargeable to the owners, becauſe the generall drayning is not effected, yet doe they yeeld ſo great an improuement, as well witneſſeth how aboundant it would be if thoſe charges by a generall drayning were preuented.</p>
            <p>But if any man beſide this Argument taken from the conſent of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages, wiſe and politike Princes and aſſemblies of Parliament, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be led into thoſe particulars whereby it is probable they were moued, let him conſider, Firſt, the coſtly and troubleſome meetings of the Commiſſioners of Sewers; Grieuous (though neceſſarie) Taxations, Hartburnings, Emulations, Controuerſies, and inſupportable charges, for cutting, clenſing and repayring of Riuers, Draynes, Goates, Sluces, Bankes, and ſuch like coſtly workes of Sewers, ſo much to be lamented, ſo impoſſible to be any other wayes preuented, then by a generall dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeuerall Leuels wherein thoſe Lands reſpectiuely doe lye.
<pb facs="tcp:16182:4"/>
Next, it would be remembred, that in winter, when the Ice is ſtronge enough to hinder the paſſage of Boates, and yet not able to beare a man, the Inhabitants vpon the Hards, and the Bankes within the Fennes, can haue no helpe of Food, no comfort for Body or Soule, no Woman ayd in her Trauell, no meanes to baptize a Child or to adminiſter the Communion, no ſupply of any neceſſitie, ſauing what thoſe poore deſolate places can afford. Moreouer, it hath beene the policie of this State to demoliſh all places of defence, ſauing thoſe that be in the hand of the Soueraigne power; this onely remaineth, whether we know in the Barrons Warres, the Rebels, vpon the naturall ſtrength of the place and aboundance of prouiſion there, reſorted, as into a Faſtneſſe, and to which purpoſe it might ſerue againe, if God and the wiſedome of our Gouernours were not watchfull at the Helme. What ſhould I ſpeake of the health of mens bodyes, where there is no Element good. The Aer Nebulous, groſſe and full of rotten Harres; the Water putred and muddy, yea full of loathſome vermine; the Earth ſpuing, vnfaſt and boggie; the Fire noyſome turfe and haſſocks: ſuch are the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of the Drownings.</p>
            <p>But if a man would attend the manifold and great profits of Drayning, it were not hard to muſter a royall Army of them. Conſider firſt the quantitie of the Pen-Leuels valued at 500000 Acres. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Camden</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it from the edge of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> to <hi>Waynflet</hi> in <hi>Lincolneſhire,</hi> 68 Miles, and that is by the Stringe; but if you reckon the Bow of the Fenne which runneth vp on both ſides <hi>Witham</hi> till you come within a Mile of <hi>Lincolne</hi> (as rotten a peece as any of the reſt) we may well call it 80 Miles in length; in bredth it is much 30, more 20, ſeldome ſo little as 10 Miles: a goodly Garden of a Kingdome; yea, a little Kingdome it ſelfe: as much and as good ground, it is ſuppoſed, as the States of the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> enioy in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the riches of the ſoyle if it were gayned from the waters, much may be ſaid. Compare it with high ground, who will not preferre a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell Medow? Compare it with the grounds in the ſame tract which lye but a yard higher then it; ordinarily let for 20. ſhil. an Acre and vpward: not about <hi>Ely</hi> and other good Townes onely, but at <hi>Thorny-Abbey</hi> my Lord of <hi>Beaford</hi> lets betweene 3 and 400 Acres of riſing ground vpon which the Abbey ſtands, for 300. li. <hi>per annum,</hi> whereas the reſt of his Lordſhip of <hi>Thorny,</hi> containing 16 or 17000 Acres of drowned ground, is eſteemed as it now lyeth, of little or no value: yet it appeareth by the Hiſtorie of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmeſburie</hi> (vouched by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Camden</hi>) who liued
<pb facs="tcp:16182:4"/>
about 1200 yeeres ſince, that in his time it <hi>repreſented a very Paradiſe, for that in pleaſure and delight it reſembleth Heauen it ſelfe; in the very Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes bearing Trees that for their ſtraight talneſſe, and the ſame without knots, ſtriue to touch the Starres. A Playne there is as euen as the Sea, which with greene graſſe allureth the eye: ſo ſmooth and leuell, that if any walke along the Fields, they ſhall find nothing to ſtumble at. There is not the leaſt parcell of ground that lyes waſt and void there, here you ſhall find the earth riſing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for Apple-trees, there ſhall you haue a Field ſet with Vines, which either creepe vpon the ground, or mount on high vpon poles to ſupport them, &amp;c.</hi> For in thoſe dayes Vineyards were verie frequent in <hi>England.</hi> The like may be ſaid of the Abbey of <hi>Crowland,</hi> of the great Lordſhip of <hi>Whittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea,</hi> and of all the reſt that conſiſt of part dry and part drowned Land; yet thoſe dry &amp; drowned Lands are of the ſame nature, and where there is any difference, the drowned is the richer, as appeared in the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie dry yeeres 1619 and 1620, when the edges of the drowned Fenne being dry, yeelded twice as much graſſe as the riſing grounds did. I ſhall ſpeake of a ſtrange thing, yet was it related by a Gentleman intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the place and of good credit: <hi>Borrough</hi> great Fenne containeth about 7000 Acres, this Fen is vſually ſo much ſurrounded, that the dry places and all, are not well able to beare the Inhabitants Cattell: in thoſe two yeeres it was all dry and yeelded ſuch aboundance of Foather, that they receiued for a great part of Summer 50. li. a day for the ioyſting of Cattell, as they call it, out of the high Countreys. The like may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be the condition of all the reſt of the Fens, eſpecially if the ground be ſmooth and free from Haſſocks. I will giue you an inſtance. There is a banke in <hi>Thorny</hi> of a Mile long or more, caſt vp out of two Draynes of the moſt mirie Fens, which lying ſomewhat high, as being a Horſe-way from <hi>Thorny-Abbey</hi> to <hi>Peterborough,</hi> is growne into verie fine and feeding graſſe.</p>
            <p>And here to proue the Richneſſe of the Fen-ſoyle, let it be obſerued, that where water ſtands all the Spring in barren Land, there will be no graſſe at all; not ſo much as where for want of raine the Sunne burneth the ſoyle: and this is a certaine argument of Sterile or leane Earth. But where though the waters ſtand, the Earth notwithſtanding bringeth forth Fruit, it is an argument of a fat and luſtie ſoyle, and ſo much the fatter by how much the Fruit is courſer and larger; for all grounds that will afford nouriſhment to Graſſe, will not ſuffice ſap enough for Sedge or Reed; but on the contrarie, that which will beare Reed or Sedge in any quantitie, is able to yeeld ſap enough for aboundance of
<pb facs="tcp:16182:5"/>
Graſſe. So great a quantitie therefore of rich Land being gayned, would meruailouſly increaſe &amp; ſupport the multitude of his Maieſties ſubiects, wherein conſiſteth the glorie and ſtrength of a Kingdome. Adde hereto the augmentations of his Highneſſe Reuenews (for there are in the Fen, if I remember a right, 16 Mannors belonging to the Crowne on the South-ſide of <hi>Boſton,</hi> beſides the great Honour of <hi>Bullingbrooke</hi> on the North, containing about it by eſtimation 60000 Acres of Fen-Land, which was lately let for 18. li. a yeere to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Vincent Skinner</hi>) beſides his Cuſtomes, Subſidies, Prouiſions, Caſualties, &amp;c. What ſhould I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the profits which would accrew to the Common-wealth? the aboundance of prouiſion for victuall, Fleſh, Fiſh and whit-meats, the breed of Horſes ſeruiceable both in Peace and for Warre, the rich and neceſſarie Merchandizes of Wooll, Hydes, Tallow, Hempe, Rape, and ſuch like; the tranſportation of the commodities of the Countrey from place to place for the vſe of the neighbour-parts; the eaſe of Trauellors, who now are faine to make compaſſe iournies to auoid the ouerflowings; the conuoy of his Maieſties Armies if occaſion ſhould require, are all publike profits, and of excellent conſequence to the King and kingdome. Such alſo would be the reſtoring of the Nauigation vnto the Townes of <hi>Wiſbich, Spalding</hi> and <hi>Waynflet,</hi> and from thence vp into the Countreys. Theſe are publike benefits: and for priuate the drayning would encreaſe the reuenew of many Corparations, both Eccleſiaſticall and Ciuill, and of many his Maieſties particular Subiects, as well Lay-men as Rectors and Vicars of many great Pariſhes which now afford the Incumbents verie ſmall meanes. There is one other great commoditie which a drayning will produce worthy to be inſiſted vpon, and that is the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Sheepe and other Cattell from the rot. For it is a true thing, that when the Fens yeeld moſt paſturage, then they doe the moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to men in their Sheepe and Cattell, thence is the common ſaying of the Countrey, <hi>From the Farme to the Fenne, from the Fenne to Ireland.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the Fen is neuer ſo dry, but there are many watry plaſhes, and much rotting Spire-graſſe in it, where-with the Sheepe are vſually tainted in the Summer-time, and whereof they dye in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if men be not carefull to ſell them to the Butcher before: if they be ſo prouident, then is the Countrey and Citie too, fed with vnholeſome food. As for other Cattell, together with the wet Graſſe they ſlap vp ſuch an aboundance of ſmall Stiklebacks, that when they dye of the rot, or be killed for vſe, their Mawes will be found full of them. Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in the Mariſhes beyond <hi>Wainflet</hi> in <hi>Lincolneſhire,</hi> and ſuch like,
<pb facs="tcp:16182:5"/>
where the grounds be ſeuered and trenched, it is hard to find a poore man, though they ſit at great rents, for their Cattell are alwayes ſound and thriuing, and therefore euer merchandable: or if they come to a miſchance, yet fit for food. And that this was the opinion of all the Commiſſioners of Sewers, appeareth by the Seſſions at <hi>Peterborough</hi> the eighth of <hi>September,</hi> 1619, there being preſent the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Fane,</hi> and 25 other Knights and Gentlemen Commiſſioners of Sewers, aſſiſted by a multitude of the Countrey. They agreed and concluded, <hi>That by a drayning, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent great profit would ariſe to the Countreys and Owners of Lands, &amp; that it would be without preiudice publike or priuate.</hi> And thereupon did decree the deſigne ſhould be proceeded in, and determined to giue all lawfull ayd &amp; aſſiſtance thereto, according to the extent of the Commiſſion of Sewers. Which alſo was confirmed the 23 of <hi>September</hi> following at <hi>Ely,</hi> and the 24 at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iues.</hi> And the buſineſſe was proſecuted at <hi>Cambridge</hi> the 15 of <hi>Oct.</hi> and at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iues</hi> and <hi>Hunting.</hi> the 16 of <hi>Oct.</hi> where there was 20. ſhill. ſet vpon euerie Acre for the accompliſhment of the worke.</p>
            <p>If men deſcend vnto particular obiections, then muſt ſeuerall anſwers be giuen them. Firſt therefore it is obiected, that they find leſſe burthen of Foather vpon the ground in dry yeeres then in wet. I anſwer, it muſt be confeſſed that ground which beareth Reed or Sedge will not be ſo fruitfull if it be dry, becauſe ſuch ranke traſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a great deale of moiſture, but when through want of ſuch ſtore of moiſture it improueth into graſſe (as in a yeere or two it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly doe) then a little moiſture will ſuffice, as we ſee in ordinarie Meddows. It will be vrged that euen in Meddows ouerflowings will doe good. It is true, if ſo be the water remaine not long vpon the ſoyle: but to be ſurrounded, or to lye in the ſuds, as we ſay, three quarters or halfe a yeere more or leſſe, doth miſchiefe not helpe the ground. I appeale to the Countrey if there were not in the yeere 1619 many thouſand loads of Foather gotten where ſcarce euer any was had in the memorie of man. Witneſſe the great ſtacks which were then ſeene all along the wild Fennes, as thicke (to mens ſeeming that road aloofe) as ſhocks of Corne in a Corne-field, and that of reaſonable good Graſſe. For if the water be drayned, and the cold moiſture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from the root of Reed-ground, that Reed will in one ſummer returne into Sedge, and that Sedge ſhortly into good Graſſe, of which there hath beene aboundant experience throughout the Fens in the dry yeeres 1619, and 1620.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16182:6"/>But the drayning ſome ſay will decay Fiſhing and Fowling. I anſwer, it is neither poſſible nor profitable to drayne <hi>Porſen</hi> in <hi>Crowland,</hi> or ſome Deepes in the Eaſt-Fen beyond <hi>Boſton,</hi> or the Meares of <hi>Whittleſea, Ramſey,</hi> &amp;c. which be the chiefe places for Fiſh and Fowle. For other Fens there are no Fiſh or Fowle taken in them, but onely in the Riuers or Draynes; and thoſe will be both more in number and more enlarged after the drayning, and the Fiſh and Fowle better contained in them, and ſo more eaſily gotten: For now the water ouerflowing all, the Fowle are ſo diſperſed, that men cannot come at them (for there is not, nor muſt there be any ſhooting in the Fen) and the Fry of the Fiſh is loſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured in the Reed or Sedge, which in the deepe Riuers and Draynes would be ſecured. But all this is not conſiderable in reſpect of the great benefit that will be made of Graſſe in ſo large proportions of excellent Land.</p>
            <p>It will againe be obiected, that although the drayning will be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the Lords and Owners, yet the poore Commoner ſhall be in danger to looſe his Common by the incroaching Lords, or at leſt when ſuch Common-Fens are recouered and ſecured, the rich men will ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them with Cattell, that the poore man ſhall not be able to make any benefit, where now he getteth a poore liuing, partly by the Paſturage of a few Cowes, partly by his labour in Fiſhing and Fowling, which labour the rich man will not take. Now ſaith the poore Fen-man, we haue euerie yeere an <hi>Order</hi> brought from <hi>Northampton,</hi> which layeth a Law vpon the rich, that they oppreſſe not the Commons: he meaneth the confluence of waters which drowne all. This is a great obiection and of conſequence, and hath two parts. To the firſt part concerning the Lords incroaching vpon the Commons, I know not what prouiſion the State will thinke fit to make: but there is already a good care taken for it in that verie Act of Parliament which was made for Approue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this kind, the 43. <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 11. the words be theſe, <hi>Prouided alwayes, and be it enacted, That this Act, nor any thing therein contained, ſhall not extend to the impairing, diminiſhing, letting, taking away, or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of the intereſt of the Commoners, or any of them, or of the Lords or Owners of the Soyle, in or to any part of the reſidue of the Waſts or Commons which is not, or ſhall not be ſet forth or aſſigned to the Vndertakers: Nor to any franchiſes or Liberties, or Waife, Stray, Leete, Law-day, nor other Liberties to be vſed or taken in the part ſo to the Vndertakers aſſigned: But that as well the Commoners, as Lords and Owners of that Soyle ſhall and may enioy their Commons in the reſidue thereof.</hi> To the ſecond part of the obiection that
<pb facs="tcp:16182:6"/>
rich men will ouer-charge the Common when it is ſecured, and ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the poore; I confeſſe it is a common calamitie in all vnſtinted Commons, and deſerueth a great deale of wiſedome and care in the State to preuent it, eſpecially in ſuch rich Soyles. Two helpes there are: One, that the Commoner who dwelleth vpon, or neere the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon will make good ſhift if the rich man dwell but a Mile off, as in the Fen it will often be. But if the Land which is ſet out for the recompence of the drayning be let, part to the poorer ſort at reaſonable rents, then the poore man hauing ſeuerall grounds (adioyning to the Common) wherein to ſuccour his Cattell at need and whereupon to get Foather for them, he may ſhift with his rich Neighbour ſo much the better. Other helpe I know none but an apportionment; which in the Fen will be more difficult then in other vnſtinted Commons, becauſe in one Fen many Towne-ſhips haue intereſt of Common; and yet there will be enough for all if it be well ordered.</p>
            <p>It is farther obiected, that if the drayning ſhould ſucceed there will be then as much want of water, as there hath beene formerly too much. I anſwer, that when the Riuers and Draynes are deepened (which is a thing muſt be performed) they will hold a world of water more then they now doe; and it will ordinarily be held vp alſo to a ſufficient height by the Works for the drayning, except when a Flood is feared, which if it come, there will be water enough and two much; if it come not, yet within a few houres, if the Current of the water at the Workes be inhibited, the Countrey will be full enough: beſide, the partitions of the Land aſſigned for recompence of the drayning, will in a ſhort time make Ditches enowe to containe more water then the Cattell in thoſe parts will vſe: and by common intendment, all good Husbands will make Ditches for diuiſions in their owne grounds, and Sluces to detaine or let goe the water at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Finally, ſome will ſay they are many times drayned from Heauen and therefore need not mans helpe. True it is that God Almightie hath taught them by the experience of ſome dry yeeres, though rarely, the difference between a wilderneſſe of water &amp; a goodly greene Meddow: to lead them by ſence (who are hardly gouerned by reaſon) to diſcerne what may be beſt for themſelues and their poſteritie: of which great document if they make ſiniſter vſe, vainly fancying to themſelues that which is to mans reaſon impoſſible, they muſt be content to be puniſhed according to reaſon. That is to ſay, whereas ſuch dry yeeres ſhall haue drunke vp the waters, if not of the Riuers, yet of many of the Draynes,
<pb facs="tcp:16182:7"/>
which thereupon are growne vp and peſtered with weeds and rubbiſh, it followeth neceſſarily, that vpon the next confluence of waters into that Leuell, the Sewers which contained them being ſtifled, they haue bred a greater and more fearfull Inundation.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe there be certaine Tacite and ſilent obiections which ſome are either afraid, or aſhamed to vtter, and yet are obſtinately gouerned by them. I will name but two: The one is, the loſſe of their Land: The other is, meere enuie; or if you will giue it a gentler name, Priuate Emulation. The former I may more boldly auouch, becauſe it pleaſed his late Maieſtie to faſten vpon it when he gaue gratious audience to a hearing of this buſineſſe in the yeere 1619. <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord or Owner had rather be ſaid to be Lord or Owner of 1000 Acres though they be ſcarcely worth to him 1000. ſhill. in the yeere, then part with 500 to make the reſt worth 500 Angels by the yeere: In like manner the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner. Reaſon for this if they could giue any, it is likely I alſo were able to render ſome, but in truth I cannot, nor any ſhaddow of reaſon, but as a ſullen Bird that is taken when it is old will rather dye then feed, ſo ſuch Fen-men; not conſidering that though the alotment for the reward of drayning ſhould be in Land, yet the expence being neceſſarily to be in money, much of the Land muſt be ſold for ſupply thereof, which they that are able and willing may purchaſe before any other, to keepe their inheritances entire, being exceedingly improued. For Emulation, it is ſo notorious, ſo diffuſiue a vice amongſt them, as a man may imagine it to be bread there, as <hi>Hydra</hi> was in the Fen of <hi>Lerna.</hi> I will put a caſe. <hi>Iohn a Stile</hi> hath 2000 Acres in the Fen worth him haply 50. li. a yeere, and no other Liue-load. <hi>Iohn a Nokes</hi> hath 200 Acres in the ſame Fen worth 50. li. a yeere, but beſides he hath an Inheritance of 300. li. a yeere, and thinkes himſelfe, and ſo is, a Gentleman of ſome reckoning, the other is but a poore man and liues hardly. When the queſtion of the drayning of the Fens comes, <hi>Iohn a Stile</hi> is glad, and promoteth it all he may: But <hi>Iohn a Nokes</hi> his rich Neighbour (what ſaith he) ſhall <hi>Iohn a Stile</hi> be a better man then I, who hath beene alwayes glad to ſhroud himſelfe vnder my wings, that I cannot, I muſt not endure: For if the Fen be drayned, his Land may be worth 500. li. a yeere, though he part with one halfe for the drayning: my improuement will be little worth, no drayning therefore by my conſent. But enough in an vnpleaſing Argument, it being againſt my diſpoſition to haue but touched ſo harſh a ſtring.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus long held the Candle to the Sunne, that is, proued what
<pb facs="tcp:16182:7"/>
no reaſonable man can denie, that the drayning of the Fens in the ſixe Counties will be both honourable and profitable to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and many particular perſons, and anſwered the obiections which ſome ignorant or wilfull people ſtand moſt vpon, giue me leaue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſecond Queſtion, that is, whether it be feazable or no.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let it be for the time admitted not granted, that this great worke cannot be accompliſhed; I aske what ſhall the Countrey looſe? For they that vndertake it, muſt haue no benefit till the worke be done. If it be not done, they indeed looſe both labour and coſt, the Countrey looſeth nothing, but on the contrarie muſt gaine much, For it cannot be indeauoured that all the Fens ſhould be drayned, but at leſt ſome muſt neceſſarily reape great benefit, all ſome, by ſuch indeauour. But the wiſedome of the Parliament thought the worke feazable, and that not long ſince to wit in the laſt Parliament of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the words are theſe. <hi>Wherein it is apparant to ſuch as haue trauailed in execution of the Commiſſion of Sewers in the Iſle of Ely and Counties adioyning, that the Waſtes, Commons, Mariſhes, and Fenny-grounds there ſubiect to ſurrounding, may be recouered by skilfull and able vndertakers.</hi> And the Commiſſioners of Sewers at <hi>Peterborough</hi> the 8. of <hi>September,</hi> 1619, were reſolued of the poſſibilitie of the ſame. But what are the reaſons men thinke the Fens cannot be drayned? Forſooth becauſe many and great men haue attempted it and fayled: as if all wiſedome and inſight were confer'd on great men. It may be their miſſes haue taught other men wiſedome: there is no greater aduantage then to learne by other mens loſſes. Hence it is that we ſee many things performed euerie day which our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought bootleſſe to attempt: beſides, the cauſes of miſchiefes and ſo the remedies are often-times not perceiued till the miſchiefe be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. But will you giue me leaue to render you alſo a reaſon why thoſe many and great men failed in their enterpriſes? I hold it for a certaintie, that it is vtterly vnpoſſible to drayne, or fruitfully to recouer any notable part of the Fen vnleſſe all that Leuell of Fen whereof it is a part, be ioyntly recouered. And this hath beene aboundantly proued by the miſcariage of all particular workes, except Marſhland, and that is gayned by imbanking, partly becauſe it lyeth on the out-ſide of all the reſt next the Sea and adioyneth vpon the excellent out-fall of <hi>Linne</hi>; partly alſo, becauſe as much coſt hath beene and is beſtowed vpon it, as the verie Soyle is worth, for it now coſts about 3000. li. a yeere to maintaine the Bankes, and ſo the medicine hath beene as ill as the diſeaſe. Some-thing might be ſaid alſo for <hi>Holland-Ellow</hi> by South of
<pb facs="tcp:16182:8"/>
               <hi>Spalding,</hi> which is bettered by the Bankes, but neither recouered nor ſecured, and likewiſe of <hi>Walderſey</hi> and ſuch portions. But for the dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all together, my Lord <hi>Popham</hi> of worthy memorie may be an example ſomewhat to ſtay mens minds from thinking it ſo vtterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, who being a wiſe experienced Gentleman, and of better eſtate then that he ſhould be contented wilfully to caſt it away, yet was verie deſirous to haue aduentured vpon the drayning of all <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and ſurely had put it to the hazzard, if he had liued but two yeeres longer. But if I may ſpeake without diſparagement to his wiſedome, that courſe which he intended (for I haue ſeene his Card and the wayes he intended to worke) would rather haue bettered much, then wonne or ſecured any.</p>
            <p>After his time and not aboue 13 or 14 yeeres ſince, his Maieſtie and the Lords were ſo afflicted with Petitioners out of thoſe parts, all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring helpe againſt that common calamitie (whereof they are now againe made ſenſible) that it was thought fit by the State to ſend S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Clement Edmonds</hi> to take view of the Countrey, being aſſiſted by the Lords and other Commiſſioners of Sewers. In which his Perigrination (for it was an vncouth and wild way he went, and a long time he ſpent in ſearching into euerie nooke and corner) he obſerued with all diligence whatſoeuer might inuite him to thinke the drayning feazible, or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him from it. At length in the returne of his Report to the State, he reſolueth that it may be done. Yet not probably by any conſent of the Countrey, or ſuch as are intereſted in the Land, but rather by others. His reaſons I forbeare here to touch vpon. After that, the right noble Patriot, the Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> by direction from King <hi>Iames,</hi> and the aduice of the Lords of the Councell, made a iourney into thoſe parts to promote the generall drayning, as a buſineſſe of great honour to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, with whom ioyned the honourable and worthy Commiſſioners of Sewers, &amp; by an vnanimous decree deſigned vnto his Maieſtie 120000 Acres of the Fennes to inable him to accompliſh ſo great a work. Which Decree his Maieſtie ratified by his Royall aſſent and acceptation, and would certainly haue performed the worke Royally and Really, ſauing that he was at that time and vnto his death, taken and kept off by his weightie and important affaires of State. Since whoſe deceaſe, his Royall Maieſtie that now is, hath greatly deſired that the ſaid worke might be proceeded in, and for that purpoſe, finding that he could not preſently relieue the great diſtreſſe the Countrey is now in by reaſon of the Inundation, hath remitted vnto the ſaid Commiſſioners the fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:16182:8"/>
Decree to inable them to prouide ſome other more expedite way for the Countries reliefe. By all which it appeares that by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King <hi>Iames,</hi> of the Lords of the Counſell, and the Commiſſioners of Sewers, the worke is feazable and greatly deſired. For the Soyle I doubt not it is well diſpoſed to a drayning, both becauſe it hath a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fall to the ſea, and becauſe the Sewers (though with ſome difficulty and greater charge which yet the profit will farre ſurmount) may be in a ſhort time ſufficiently eaſed. That the Fennes haue a Competent fall to the ſea, it is argument enough becauſe they at length empty themſelues into the Sea, which the deepe Meares doe not. Whether that fall bee ſufficient to emptie them ſooner and with a ſtronger Current then now they haue, is the queſtion. I leaue the particular fall of euery leuell how many foote it hath to the high water marke to farther examination; but it is euident that from the heads of the ſeuerall draynes vnto the low water marke there is fall ſufficient.</p>
            <p>It is alſo euident that Deeping Fenne lyes lower then <hi>Thornie, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> or <hi>Croyland</hi> Fennes (whence alſo ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cambden</hi> it hath his name) yet hath the Earle of <hi>Exeter</hi> made a conueyance of the water from Deeping Fennes vnder <hi>Spalding</hi> riuer to the ſea, and that to ſome good effect if the out fall at ſea were kept open: whence it followeth, that there is a fall into the Sea out of the loweſt Fennes, and a deſcent much lower then the bottome of <hi>Spalding</hi> riuer; and yet the Flood at <hi>Spalding</hi> is not one houre in ordinary Tides, and conſequently the Ebbe there aboue 10. From which obſeruation it may bee gathered, that a fall may bee had from <hi>Spalding</hi> to the low water marke of twenty foote, which fall being improued by skilfull workemen will produce a ſtrange effect. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Wisbich, Clowes Croſſe, Salters Load,</hi> &amp;c. But how that muſt be done, and how the incoueniences thereupon enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are to be preuented is the very <hi>Eluſinium ſacrum</hi> the myſtery of drayning, which belongeth not to this place. For the out fall at <hi>Linne,</hi> no man maketh queſtion of it, onely the difficulty will be thought to be in the placing of the workes, which will indeede bee chargeable but of neceſſary and excellent vſe. I would haue it alſo conſidered that within theſe few yeeres the Tide from <hi>Spalding</hi> did flow vp beyond <hi>Crowland</hi> and neere <hi>Thornie,</hi> where as now the Tides are ſeldome ſeene aboue <hi>Spal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>; an euident argument that the Fennes grow euery yeere worſe then other. For the out fals of <hi>Wisbich</hi> and <hi>Spalding</hi> being daily more and more choaked with ſands from the ſea and mudd out of the draynes which cannot now paſſe to ſea, and the riuers ſtifled with weedes for
<pb facs="tcp:16182:9"/>
want of a current; it comes to paſſe that the whole Fenne is now vnder water; though this preſent drought hath brought all other riuers of the Kingdome to a very low ebbe. Which miſchiefe if it grow but a few yeeres more (as it will certainly doe if it bee not preuented) the whole Leuell will be drowned perpetually and become of no vſe at all. Beſides, thoſe waters growing deepe in ſo large a leuell, and being increaſed by a Flood; a ſtorme of winde will haue ſo much water to worke vpon, that it will rayſe billowes as in a ſea, the force whereof neither the bankes of Marſh land nor of other inned grounds, nor houſes, nor bridges will bee able to reſiſt. What then will become of the fiſhing and fowling (their principall comndities) when the game is diſperſed ſo wide that it will not be worth the labour and charge to goe about to take them? What will become alſo of the multitude of poore people, who now liue (though very meanely) in thoſe Fennes by taking Fiſh and Fowle, by gathering Haſſocke, Reede, &amp;c. and by tranſporting by their Boates paſſengers and commodities too and fro? Finally the Towneſhips and particuler men that liue now vpon the Hards, will be confined as into ſmall Ilands in an open ſea: and euen thoſe Ilands will be daily leſſened by the billowes which ſtormes will driue againſt them on all ſides. Adde hereto that the Meares (and <hi>Whitleſea</hi> Meare ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cambden</hi> is ſix miles long and three miles broade) which haue of late yeeres much enlarged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, being yet more deepned and their waues rayſed by ſtormes and raging like the ſea, will dayly ſwallow more and more of the light Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoyle bordering vpon them, and ſo at length may grow to an immenſe both longitude and latitude, and make it truly <hi>Circumfuſa Palus.</hi> But to inſiſt a little more vpon the fall or deſcent of the Leuell of the Fennes into the ſea; it appeareth that the riuer of <hi>Peterbrough,</hi> (whoſe naturall Current, as it is moſt plentifull, ſo his exceſſe is moſt inundant) which ſhould fall out at <hi>Splading,</hi> or at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> or both, if it had vent, paſſeth now on to <hi>Whittleſea</hi> Meare, and ſo runnes through the whole Iſle, and meeting the riuers of <hi>Ouſe, Grant, Brandon</hi> and <hi>Stoke,</hi> ouerflowes all, and falleth out leaſurely at <hi>Linne</hi> aboue threeſcore miles from his aberration; in which tract running vpon a leuell and in ſmall and cloyed draynes, it makes the greateſt deluge: beſide, the windes hauing the aduantage of the waters when they are out, with greater violence then any banke made of looſe earth can reſiſt, carry them whether they liſt vpon the face of the whole Fenne, becauſe they haue no ſuch ſtrength of Current as will violently lead them away: ſo that if the winde bee Northerly and ſtiffe, it beateth them toward <hi>Linne,</hi> and then the Fenne is ſooner drie;
<pb facs="tcp:16182:9"/>
but if it blow out of the Eaſt or South, the whole maſſe of waters is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from <hi>Lin</hi> ward, &amp; finding no other out-fall, continues vpon the face of the Fenne till thoſe winds remit, and the waters fall backe to <hi>Linne,</hi> where they find no very free diſcharge becauſe they are holden vp by the Tide 12 houres in 24. and thence it comes that if any Flood happen in <hi>Aprill</hi> or after, the Fennes are loſt for that whole yeere.</p>
            <p>More concerning the poſſibility to drayne the Fennes need not bee ſaid, this being no place fit to diſcouer the manner of the Workes or the places of Aduantage whereon to ſet them, or the old or new draynes that muſt leade vnto them. Onely thus much I thinke fit to intimate, that there is a great difference betweene theſe Fennes and the Leuels in the Low Countryes. For there the ſea is higher then the Land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their onely way is by Banking to keepe out the ſea, and then by mils and other deuices to heaue out the water: which worke of banking though it be exceeding chargeable and dangerous for breaches, yet they are conſtrayned to truſt to it, becauſe they haue no fall to the ſea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide they are ſo ſcanted for Land that the value thereof doth counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile that exceſſiue charge: but with vs in the Fennes all is otherwiſe. For we haue a fall to the low water marke of more then twenty foote to empty the waters into the ſea. Beſide, we haue abundance of riuers and draynes to lead them vnto the ſeuerall out-fals which may and muſt bee deepned; but we haue no firme earth in place to make bankes, nor ſound ground to place them vpon. Beſides, the Land to be gained will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray that charge neither (if all the truſt be vpon banks) can it be ſecure to incourage men to inhabit, build, plant and ſtocke the ground to bee gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe we haue had experience that ſome few breaches in Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and other banked grounds haue brought great deluges and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of houſes, Cattle, &amp;c. many of which are not yet regained, others held good at an exceſſiue charge, and vnder deſperate dangers.</p>
            <p>There is alſo an other danger in Banking procured by a ſmall contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Vermine, they be Water-rats, which make their holes in the banks cloſe to the water when it is at the ſhalloweſt in infinite number, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the frie of fiſh, doe multiply like fiſhes. Theſe burrough deepe into the bankes, which being made of light earth, when the waters do riſe and are beaten into them by the winde, many of thoſe holes are worne into one, and ſo the whole banke is in no long time demoliſhed; a miſchiefe which it is impoſſible to remedy, &amp; yet ſuch as will render all Banking inſufficient to keepe out the water, much more vnſafe for men to truſt vnto if they ſhould be deſirous to inhabit neere them or vnder
<pb facs="tcp:16182:10"/>
their protection. Finally, the cure by Banking is impoſſible for our Fennes, vnleſſe the water could be taken into thoſe banked draynes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it fall into the leuell of the Fennes, that is to ſay, as the riuers deſcend from the high ground; otherwiſe the waters can neuer riſe to make vſe of the height of ſuch bankes, but will rather returne and drowne <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borrough, Deeping Huntington,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore the way muſt bee to begin at the Out-fals and there to repulſe the ſalt water and ſands, and by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduantage of the fall to low water marke, to conuey away the freſh and the ſand and other ſilte which now choketh the riuers and draynes.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe arguments againſt truſting to Bankes in a caſe where in great aduentures of mens perſons, habitations and eſtates are to be borne; there is another argument againſt entertaining of Strangers to performe this work, for this Banking is the conceite of Strangers who are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med only to banking at home. And this is an argument firſt of Honor, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly of ſecurity, thirdly of profit. For the matter of Honour: Now, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, we haue reaſon to inſiſt vpon it, when the reputation of our Country is brought into competition with our neighbours, who were wont to haue their dependance vpon vs, and reliefe from vs. Is the old Actiuity and abilities of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation (who in former times were eſteemed the greateſt vndertakers in the Weſterne parts of the world) growne now ſo dull and inſufficient that we muſt pray in ayde of our neighbours to improue our owne Demaynes? The Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> is ſaid to marry the ſea, as if he had with it but <hi>diuiſum Imperium</hi>; wee haue beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Lords of the ſea, and our Common Law hath adiudged the ſea to be part of our Kingdome, ſhall wee ſuffer that Regality to become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Strangers, and not that onely, but the freſh waters within our Continent, as if our ſelues were not able to bring them into order? Surely our great plenty and abundance of fruitful Land hath beene hitherto one cauſe why this improuement hath beene neglected: but of late the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of peace hath ſo multiplyed our people vnder our laſt two peacefull Princes, that we haue tranſplanted many Colonies into <hi>Ireland, Virginea, Bermuda,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Chriſtophers, New England,</hi> &amp;c. and beſide hath ſtirred vp men at home to gaine much rich Land from the ſeas, and in particular to attempt vpon this ſurrounded Leuel, wherin that they haue not hitherto preuailed, hath not beene want of skill, or will, nor yet of indeauour. For diuers worthy men haue appeared in the vndertaking, the laſt and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt being our late Soueraigne Lord of bleſſed memory, who thought it no diſhonour to declare himſelfe an Vndertaker herein, but being tranſlated hence, hath left
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16182:10"/>
                  <l>The Honour of this Worke to Crowne the Raigne,</l>
                  <l>Of his deere Sonne our now dread Soueraigne.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For matter of ſecurity; ſhall wee eſteeme it of ſmall moment to put into the hands of Strangers three or foure ſuch Ports and Harbours as <hi>Linne, Wisbeach, Spalding</hi> and <hi>Boſton</hi> will be when the out-fals ſhall bee opened to Low water marke, and permit the Countrey within and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them to be peopled by ouerthwart neighbours whoſe ſtrength and vndertakings begin to grow formidable; or if they quaile themſelues muſt giue place to our moſt Auncient &amp; dangerous enemies, who will be ready enough to take aduantage of ſo many faire Inlets into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of our Land, lying ſo neere together, that an Army landing part in each of them, may eaſily meete and ſtrongly intrench themſelues with wals of water and drowne the Countrey about them at their pleaſure? This very thing was obiected by a worthy Patriot in a late Parliament, wherein a bill was preferred for the admitting of Strangers to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Worke, and thereupon caſt out.</p>
            <p>Finally, if nothing were conſiderable but the matter of profit, would it be thought fit to giue ſo great a portion of our Land as the third part of that Leuell to Strangers to empty themſelues into, and leaue our owne Countreymen with ſo great trauell, charge and aduenture to ſeeke for ſeates abroad in remote parts, when we may comfort both them and our ſelues by placing them at home? Neither yet would I be vnderſtood to be ſo enuious to Strangers, as that I had rather the water then they ſhould poſſeſſe the Land; but the queſtion being whither ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Vndertaking of the worke, Strangers or men of our owne Countrey, I am out of doubt that no true <hi>Engliſh</hi> man will be ſcrupulous in the choyce. Yet I doe ingeniouſly acknowledge that the induſtrye of ſome of our neighbours, eſpecially the Dutchmen, deſerueth commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and imitation for enlarging themſelues into the ſea, eſpecially in, and about <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and ſecuring themſelues from the ſea by coſtly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious deuices; but ſuch deuices are not proper for our buſines, which is to be performed in a farre different manner, the error leading vs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the remedy which is meerely Naturall: for Nature hath giuen to all riuers and waters as well their courſes, iſſues and out-fals into the ſea as their heads and ſprings; and by the former hath as well prouided for the vſe of man as by the latter. This guidance of Nature if wee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and adde Art as a hand-mayd vnto it, wee ſhall by remouing the cauſe auoyd alſo the effect; and by conſideration how the miſchiefe hath growne, learne to preuent it in the future; wherein the ſparing of coſt is
<pb facs="tcp:16182:11"/>
no frugality. But if it be queſtioned, Whether thoſe <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to aduenture their eſtates and the reputation of their skill, be able to accompliſh the buſineſſe? the anſwer is, That beſide that they can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their abilities, What praejudice can it be to any man to be an idle ſpectator, whileſt they expend their money and exerciſe their skill, they requiring no recompence till the Worke be performed?</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Queſtion is, How a Competent Reward may be apportioned for them that ſhould vndertake ſo great a Worke? This indeed hath beene the great and maine Impediment of the Drayning of the Fennes, for many yeeres; moſt men intereſſed, being vnable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe Money, and alſo vnwilling to part with any of their Land, of how little value ſoeuer it hath beene vnto them, or how great ſoeuer the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement of the remainder might be: or if ſome were willing, yet the minds of the multitude haue not beene vnlike the Waters of the Fenne; which not being contained within due limits, but diſperſed abroad ouer the ſurface of ſo great a Leuell, are eaſily interrupted in their courſe by the ſlender oppoſition of Flagges and Reedes: euen ſo, theſe mens minds not being reſtrained by Authoritie, nor guided by rule of Reaſon, doe ſtray into ſeuerall Opinions, and receiue Impediment from Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as ſlender as thoſe Weedes: ſome of them being not aſhamed to alleadge, that by gayning of Graſſe, they ſhould looſe their Reedes and Sedge, not conſidering the difference of their values. But of late, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing information from the King and his Councel, and the Commiſſioners of Sewers taking into their conſideration, that the Wiſdome of ſeuerall Parliaments haue thought fit to giue a part of ſuch Lands to thoſe that ſhould improue the whole, and pondering how great the benefit of ſuch improuement would be to them and their poſteritie, haue (not many yeeres ſince) fallen vpon an excellent courſe to encourage men of skill and abilitie to embarke themſelues in that Deſigne. Whereupon, after a Tax layd vpon the Lands of that whole Countrey by the Acre, to enable the Commiſſioners of Sewers legally to conuey part thereof to beare the charge of aduancing the whole, King <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memorie declaring himſelfe to be the Vndertaker, a Decree of Sewers was enacted at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> the 20. day of <hi>February,</hi> in the yeeres of the Reigne of our late Soueraigne Lord King <hi>Iames,</hi> of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the 19. and of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the 55. Whereby was deſigned to be granted to his Maieſtie for the ſupportation of that vaſt Charge, 120000. Acres of the Fenne Lands, to be conueyed vnto his Maieſtie, his Heires and Succeſſors: that is to ſay, out of euery particular part, a proportion anſwerable to the
<pb facs="tcp:16182:11"/>
quantitie of the Land, and the benefit that ſhould redound vnto the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners thereof, ſo that in the whole it ſhould accompliſh the ſaid number of 120000. Acres, as the Commiſſioners of Sewers, after a particular ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey, ſhould thinke fit to allot the ſame. Which Lands notwithſtanding, the King was not to haue any intereſt in, or poſſeſſion of, vntill eyther the whole Fennes, or ſome notable part, were effectually Drayned, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the Commiſſioners, or a competent number of them. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why this Decree tooke no effect, was the many and important affaires of State, wherewith his Maieſtie was exerciſed the whole time of his life, after the ſaid Decree was enacted. Whereupon all the good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and preparation, both on the part of his Maieſtie, and the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners fell to the ground.</p>
            <p>Since which time, thoſe Countries hauing beene grieuouſly afflicted with the continuance and encreaſe of Inundations, they are now by the hand of God not led onely, but conſtrained to ſeeke ſome effectuall meanes for ſpeedie reliefe. Whereupon ſome of them (as men readie to periſh by the Waters, are wont) haue reached out their hands, to take hold vpon ſuch weake and defectiue helpes, as the examples of their predeceſſors haue left vnto them, that is to ſay, vpon particular Workes of Goates, Draynes, Bankes, &amp;c. not duly weighing, how they haue formerly fayled thoſe that haue layd hold vpon them: Witneſſe the coſtly Draynes of <hi>Morton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> called <hi>The New Leame; Clowes Croſſe, Popham Mea, The Londoners Loade</hi> and many others; and the many miles of Bankes about <hi>Deeping, Thornie Walter Sea, The Londoners Land,</hi> and infinite others: all which are now of little or no vſe, though the charge of them hath beene ſo great, as if it had beene beſtowed at once vpon the generall Worke, would haue gone farre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the accompliſhment of a Reall Drayning, which long before this time had made a rich Improuement. Others there are, who finding the Diſeaſe of the Fen to be like the ſtopping of the Vrine neere the fall of the Kidneyes; from whence being returned, it firſt filleth vp all the veines of the body which before were neere full with bloud, and then drownes the Patient in his owne Water: of which Diſeaſe there is no poſſible Cure, but to remoue the Impediment neere the Kidneyes, ſo to regayne the naturall Out-fall. In like manner, the Waters that annoy the Fennes, doe firſt fill the Riuers and Draynes; at whoſe iſſues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned backe by Impediment, they ouerflow and ſtifle the whole Body of the Fenne: of which Diſeaſe, there is no poſſible Cure, but the opening and ſecuring of the Naturall Out-falls; at which, the whole Body of the Fenne will equally and ſpeedily vnburthen it ſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:16182:12"/>
and ſo returne to that priſtine Condition, ſo much extolled in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Antiquitie. This then being the onely way for Cure of that grand Diſeaſe, vnder which many thouſand Acres of Ground, and (which more is) many thouſand People doe languiſh, thoſe onely ſhall approue their Iudgements in this Cure, who themſelues incline and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to incline others to further by Art that Naturall Remedie.</p>
            <p>Yet how Naturall ſoeuer this Remedy be, it cannot be imagined that ſo vaſt and enorme a quantity of Land as theſe Leuels do containe can be drayned without a huge expence; and the preuention of the ſame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe for time to come by apt Works will greatly increaſe if not double the charge, beſide the neceſſary prouiſion to maintaine, nay to better the Nauigation by deepning the riuers, &amp;c. Adde hereto the aduenture of ſo great ſummes as are neceſſary to be expended in theſe Workes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of although ſuch as ſhall vndertake the buſineſſe, well knowing their owne wayes and meanes are (as behoueth them) ſecure, yet their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants (for without aduentureres no priuate mans abilitie is able to effect it) relying vpon their credit and skill, haue reaſon to require no Litige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but a Legall and pregnant aſſurance of a valuable recompence which being conformed to the decree for the 120000 Acres before recited will be indifferent both for the Aduenturers and the Owners, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth was concluded by the Commiſſioners before they enacted that Decree.</p>
            <p>Here it may be obiected, that many Noblemen and Gentlemen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in thoſe Leuels, will chooſe rather to disburſe ſome ſummes of money for their parts to keepe their Inheritances entire, then part with any of their Lands. The anſwer whereunto is, that a booke may bee made according to the Cuſtome of Aduentures, wherein euery man that liſteth may write ſuch a proportion for his aduenture as will intitle him to ſo many Acres as vpon the ſuruey ſhall be ſet out of his Land to make vp the number of 120000 Acres. Out of which alſo it muſt bee conſidered, that a good proportion muſt be ſet apart for the perpetuall ſecuring of the workes to be effected, as the Commiſſioners of Sewers in the forenamed Decree haue juditiouſly prouided.</p>
            <p>Thus much being collected out of looſe papers which had lien long by the wals, and tyed together with ſome Additions out of new obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, is preſented by a friend to this incomparable deſigne; which if it be effected, will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
