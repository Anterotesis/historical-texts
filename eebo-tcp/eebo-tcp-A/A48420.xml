            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the Memory of so dear a <hi>Royal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss,</hi> Your own more particular, and the Worlds no less <hi>Universal Loss,</hi> is that most sacred <hi>Amulet</hi> that You wear nearest

your heart; so every <hi>Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait</hi> of that <hi>divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi> tho' never so faint an Essay, carries some pretension to your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships favourable Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>I confess, indeed the weakness and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my own attempting Hand in so bold an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: And to excuse my Blushes, could only wish that the World would as easily pardon the Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of so poor a Pen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the hallow'd <hi>Memoirs</hi> of that <hi>Most Excellent Princess's LIFE;</hi> as her <hi>Funeral State</hi> will do the poorest melting Eye and bending Knee that shall approach there: 'Tis but the same Attractions that must inspire all Pens to be her <hi>Historians,</hi> as it makes all Knees her <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to make my own want of Deserts a bar to your Ladiships good Graces, towards this
<pb facs="tcp:57305:4"/>
duteous <hi>Offering</hi> I make You, I must only remind You, That <hi>Medals</hi> are stampt in Copper as well as Gold, whilst the <hi>Royal Effigies</hi> both values and illustrates, at once, the meaness of the Lineaments that draw it, and the Courseness of the <hi>Mettal</hi> that bears it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis from that Merit alone that I presume to make your Ladiship this Presentation; whilst my endeavours however short

            </p>
            <p>But whilst so large a portion of those Royal Smiles, that have so kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and so warmly shined on her most <hi>Darling Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,</hi> the <hi>Countess</hi> of

only coud lodge You so near that Royal Bosom, a Hand that ever weigh'd where she chose; whilst nothing less than a very near Affinity to her own Exalted Virtues, coud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend or Qualify for her Favourite.</p>
            <p>And Madam, your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship thus cherisht, and thus advanced to no less an Honour than that of the dearest <hi>Cabinet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident</hi> of the fair <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> a Renown
<pb facs="tcp:57305:6"/>
that must give your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship so lasting a Name, as shall live with Hers: This single Glory of it self alone, is not only a <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick</hi> to your Fame, but likewise entitles it to a <hi>Chronicle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Madam, as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a <hi>Record</hi> as so fair a Theme must furnish You; however 'tis but a very melancholly One: For in recounting those envied <hi>Blessings</hi> You possest in so many Royal Smiles and

Embraces, I am the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Remembrancer</hi> of those You have lost: A Loss so irreparable, and withal so heavy, as cannot receive even that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Consolation of Sorrow, viz. <hi>That to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in Misery, is some Ease to the Pain of it.</hi> On the contrary, not all the Thousand Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with You can lessen this infinite Affliction.

            <head>THE LIFE OF THAT Incomparable PRINCESS, MARY, OUR LATE <hi>Sovereign Lady,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>A <hi>White-Hall</hi>-Scaffold, and a Royal Martyrdom, with all the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects of that hideous and unnatural Regicide, hung so louring over the <hi>English</hi> Heads, that all the Horrours and Calamities of a Twelve Years Anarchy and Confusion,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57305:8"/>
were but too justly our succeeding Portion. Here the whole Royalty of <hi>England</hi> groaned under a total Eclipse, whilst so many upstart Changes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, all like the Births of <hi>Nile,</hi> every Year new Monsters, so polluted and defiled the Throne, that under their Barbarous Usurpation all Honour, Honesty and Conscience seemed to have whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandoned and forsaken us, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this one single surviving Justice, <hi>viz.</hi> That Vipers bred Vipers, Stings for their own Hearts; and Traytors betrayed Traytors, the natural, and indeed only honest Gratitude of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany.</p>
            <p>After this long melancholy Face of Affairs, whether the Divine Justice had satisfied it self with that short Twelve Years Scourge, or rather its more gracious Mercy with-held the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any farther Vials upon us; so it pleased the Almighty Providence, that by a Revolution wholly made up of Wonders, and by a Hand entirely his own, the Royal Exiles were re-called; whilst the whole ecchoing Nation strewed the Palms and Olaves, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57305:8"/>
the <hi>Hosannah's</hi> for their Reception, whilst such a Glut of popular Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport and Extacy attended their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Restauration, that Triumphal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were but faint Monuments of those Joys that rose higher than Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles and Pyramids.</p>
            <p>The Royal Brothers, the Illustrious Remains of the Great Martyr, the now happy, though late Darlings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, had all the Homage that Hearts or Knees could yield them, whilst our whole industrious and even studied Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, by a kind of common Rivalship and Emulation, who should kneel lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, or bend lowest, could not pay fast enough our new and chearful Tenders of Zeal and Veneration, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards making (if possible) some part of a Reparation for our old shameful Arrears. In fine, All Things shined and dazled round us; so heartily did the Fair and Smiling <hi>SIXTY</hi> endeavour the Atonement of the Black and Rueful <hi>FORTY EIGHT.</hi> 'Tis true, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Joy was seon after clouded by the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> who, a short Sharer of his Brother's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57305:9"/>
Triumphs, and the People's Love, made his much lamented <hi>Transit</hi> to Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality on the 13th of <hi>September,</hi> 1660.</p>
            <p>After the most splendid and daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Entry, and no less magnificent Coronation of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; the publick Satisfaction, not wholly founded in the present Felicities and Blessings they enjoyed, had yet farther Vows to offer up to Heaven; <hi>viz.</hi> For a fair Race of Heirs from this Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Royal Stock, that glorious Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession that might fill the Throne for ever, and bless even latest Posterity, as the entire Consummation of the whole <hi>English</hi> Happiness.</p>
            <p>But in all our Desires of this last Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, the unfortunate Barrenness of His Majesty's Royal Consort, our now Gracious Queen Dowager, in a short Time shut out our Expectation, and render'd our Prayers succeness on that side: Insomuch that the whole Nation's Hopes were now entirely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in the more fruitful, and so more happy Second Royal Line, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage of His Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57305:9"/>Accordingly, on the 30th of <hi>April,</hi> in the Year 1662. Providence was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bless this longing Nation with the Auspicious Birth of a young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, <hi>MARY,</hi> our present sacred Theme, His Royal Highness's First-born; the Father's Joy, and the ample Reward of a Mother's grateful Pain. This Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Cradle, and Sacred Nursery, in very few Years after, (the not long Life of her Royal Mother,) was enriched by the fair Increase of three Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Dukes of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Kendal,</hi> and two more Sisters, <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta.</hi> But of all this Royal Progeny, the Great Dispenser thought fit, by a too hasty Call of the others too early Setting Infancy, to leave us the only Pledges of smiling Heaven in the two Princely Sisters, <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Anne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was Born at the Royal Pallace of St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, at <hi>Westminster</hi>: At her Baptism she had for God-Father, Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and her God-mothers were the Dutchess of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and Dutchess of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57305:10"/>And now to commence the History of her Life, from her first Seal of Christianity: Her Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers stood very easie Guarrantees for their fair Charge, whilst their Vows and Promises made for her at the Font were so early answered and performed on her Part, that even her first Dawn of Reason and Discretion were enlightned with all the most forward Beams of Heaven. The Divine Instructions, even in her budding Infancy, were received with so sensible an Affection and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that the Principles of Religion were never planted in a more fruitful, or more hopeful Soil.</p>
            <p>As her Years and her Vertues grew up together, and every Heavenly Grace, her ever improving Ornaments, shined daily brighter and brighter; the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Justice, to have her whole universal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perfections equally matched, took Care that the Casket should be no ways unworthy of the rich and ample Treasure it held. For, without the least Shadow of Flattery, such love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sweetness, an Air so entirely charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57305:10"/>
and a Form made up of every Thing that both to the Poet and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might sit for an Original, were so wholly her own, that never more personal Advantages appeared, than in this young and truly beautiful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
            <p>To all these, she had a Wit so live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so penetrating, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Conversation entirely grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to those who had the Honour to enjoy it: For, withall, she had that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Goodness, Condescention and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability, (Graces that Wit is not always accompanied with) which opened that Freedom to an ingenious Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as if she resolved to bless where she favoured, not satisfied to be the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress so many Excellencies, only for a distant Admiration.</p>
            <p>But as if all these admirable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications were not enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a Master-piece; for one yet fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing-stroke more, she had all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Education to embellish her natural Accomplishments. She carried the Glory as well at the <hi>Ball</hi> and the

               <hi>Masque,</hi> as in the <hi>Presence</hi> and the <hi>Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Room</hi>; and she was that absolute <hi>Mistriss</hi> of the <hi>French Tongue,</hi> that her <hi>French</hi> Tutor, the famous <hi>Peter de Laine</hi> gives her this Character, That she had all those excellent Endowments, which not only himself, but all that had been honoured with any instrumental share in her Princely Education, had so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately found in her, to the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both of their Endeavours and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations. That Aptitude of Nature, quickness of Apprehension, Faithfulness of Memory, and obliging Readiness to comply with whatever good instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were set before her, that these, and a thousand more were certainly Born and Bred up with her, and now arrived to that height of Perfection she had attained. And all this fair Character so far from false Incense and Flattery; that in the most sacred Truth, her Highness was the most Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht, not only of Princesses, but of her Sex; and among all those Epithetes of <hi>Great,</hi> of <hi>Beautiful,</hi> or <hi>Witty</hi>; above that August Air, that Majestick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which inspired us at the first sight with the highest Sense of Respect and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57305:11"/>
Veneration: She possest, and that in a most eminent Degree, a Virtue, which she valued so much the more, as that it out-shined and transcended all the rest.</p>
            <p>Having arrived at the Age of about Fifteen, with all this fair Train of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants waiting her thither, with all Eyes upon her, and indeed all Knees before her; her Attractions had still a larger Influence, and more spacious Field than three narrow Kingdoms only could afford her, whilst the Fame alone of such transcendent Merits, were sufficient to inspire a warmer Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Foreign Princely Homagers, than that of her humbler Vassals at home.</p>
            <p>Of these, the Illustrious <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> our now Gracious Soveraign, resolved to be her boldest Addressor; for having Communicated his Intentions to Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s then Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador at the <hi>Hague,</hi> whom the Prince so far honoured, as to make him a Counsellor and Confident in this Affair,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57305:12"/>
the Prince was so frank as to express his whole Sentiments of Marriage in this kind, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That the greatest Thing he considered, were the Person and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the young Lady: For though it would not pass in the World, for a Prince to seem concerned in those Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; yet for himself, without Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, he declared, that he was so; and in such a degeee, that no Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Fortune or Interest could En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him, without those of the Person, especially those of Humour and Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That he might perhaps be not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easy for a Wife to live with; he was sure he should not be so to such Wives, as were generally in the Courts of this Age. That if he should meet with one to give him Trouble at Home, 'twas what he should not be able to bear, who was like to have enough Abroad in the Course of his Life: And that after the man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e was resolved to live with a Wife, which should be the best he could, he would have one that he thought likely to live well with him, which he thought chiefly depended upon their Disposition and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57305:12"/>Here we see the rich Cabinet of a fair Soul unlockt; and whilst the Prince publishes so worthy, so generous, and glorious a Declaration, of what a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and good Husband he intended to make himself, and consequently what equal and suitable Returns he expected from a Wife; 'twas from his entire Satisfaction that all those great, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed only honourable, Ends of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage would be fully answered in the Person of the Princess; that of the whole Choice of <hi>Europe,</hi> (for several Offers in <hi>Germany</hi> had already been made him) he had sixt his Thoughts only on the Daughter of <hi>England,</hi> the fair Mark of his Ambition, where he was confident the highest Expectation of all the fore-mentioned Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Wife would be amply gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
            <p>In his prosecution of so honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Design, as the Prince proposed to himself some higher Felicities than in the generality of Marriages of Princes, so he resolved likewise not to follow the general Practises of Courting by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57305:13"/>
Envoys and Proxies, too common on such Occasions; but, if I may so say, to be his own Ambassador on this Subject, and make his own personal Addresses to the Princess. And accordingly, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving smooth'd his Way by some Letters to beg Leave to visit <hi>England,</hi> upon their favourable Answer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he prepared to set forth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>Upon the Prince's intended Voyage for <hi>England,</hi> eighteen Deputies, with the Pensionary <hi>Fagel</hi> at the head of them, in the Name of the Nobles, and the respective Towns of <hi>Holland,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented his Highness with their Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of his good Voyage, as all the Members of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> did the like; and the next Morning, when his Highness took Leave of the <hi>States General,</hi> he received the Complements of the several Colleges by formal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, and of all the foreign Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters there, and then Embarkt on the Yatches and Men of War that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in the <hi>Maese,</hi> accompanied by many Persons of Quality, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Note, to the number of above Forty.</p>

His Highness, with all this honourable Attendance, the King and Duke at that time being at <hi>New-Market,</hi> whither his Highness and his Retinue, in his Majesty's Coaches arrived about Seven in the Evening, was received by his Majesty with all the Marks of Tenderness and Affection. On the <hi>Thursday</hi> following, the Prince, and all the Persons of Quality that came over with him, were honoured with his Majesty's and his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's Company to my Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan's House at <hi>Euston,</hi> where they were nobly Entertained, and lay that Night, and the next Morning returned to <hi>New-Market</hi>; and on <hi>Saturday,</hi> with the King, and the whole Court, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness came to <hi>Whitehall.</hi>

            <p>But not to dwell upon Ceremony and State, the Caresses and Reception he met here, let it suffice, that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness having not only proved a success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lover in his own personal Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the Princess, but likewise a prevailing Oratour with his Majesty,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57305:14"/>
the <hi>Royal Assent</hi> was obtained, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly his Majesty was pleased, on the 24th. of <hi>October,</hi> to declare to the Lords of his Privy Council, (whom he had caused to meet extraordinary for that purpose) that his Majesty had concluded a Marriage between her Highness the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; upon which their Lordships, about Three in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, went in a Body, to make their Complements to her Highness, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to the Prince. The News of which being spread in the Town, was followed at night with Bone-fires, Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bells, and all the other Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of Joy. And the same Day the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> went to preform their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Congratulations, by the Mouth of their Recorder, to his Majesty, and his Royal Highness, and afterwards to the Princess and Prince on so happy an Occasion.</p>
            <p>On the 29th. of <hi>October</hi> following, their Majesties, accompanied with his Royal Highness, their Highnesses the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> and his

Highness the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> attended by a great many of the principal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and other Persons of Quality, having been pleased, upon the humble Invitation of the City, to honour them with their Presence, first at the Show in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> (it being that Day, the Entrance of Sir <hi>Francis Chaplin</hi> to the Mayoralty) where placed in a Balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny under a Canopy of State, at the House of Sir <hi>Edward Waldo</hi> (upon whom his Majesty was then pleased to conferr the Honour of Knighthood) and afterwards at the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where the Entertainment was very Noble and Magnificent, his Majesty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly pleased with those great Demonstrations of Duty and Affection, with which the City received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Royal Presence at this Day's Solemnity.</p>
            <p>This Declaration of the Princess's Marriage was so gratefully, and indeed so Universally received, that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Grace the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> Lord President of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's most Honourable Privy Council of that Kingdom, appointed a Meeting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57305:15"/>
of such of the Lords of the Council as were in and near the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (having in the mean time given Notice thereof to the Magistrates) to acquaint them with it, to the end such Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the shortness of the time would permit might be taken, for expressing their extraordinary Joy on this happy Occasion; and having at their Meeting ordered a Congratulatory Letter to be prepared to be sent to his Majesty, on the 30th. of <hi>October</hi> at Four in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, his Grace accompanied by the Lords of the Council, and the rest of the Nobility then in Town, came from the Pallace in their Coaches to the chief Gate of the City, where they were met by the Lord <hi>Provost</hi> and Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs in their Scarlet Robes, and the Town Council in their Gowns, with the Sword and Mace carried before them, followed by a Guard of <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans,</hi> through which (with Trumpets sounding and Drums beating) they walked all on Foot to the Cross hung with Tapestry (whereupon was placed an Arbour hung with many hundreds of Oranges) which his Grace and the Lord <hi>Provost</hi> ascending, with as many
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57305:15"/>
of the Nobility as it could hold, (the rest of the Magistrates, with the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Quality, placing themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Stage erected before the Cross for that purpose) they drank the <hi>Good Healths</hi> of their Highnesses the Prince and Princess, next of their Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses the Duke and Dutchess, then the Queen's, and last of all his Majesty's Health, during which the Cannon plaid from the Castle, all the Conduits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross ran Wine in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and many Voiders of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats were thrown among the people, who were filled with a general Joy since they first heard they happy News, which then was exprest by their loud and frequent Acclamations. After which, the Bonefires being kindled, and the Bells ringing, his Grace and the Nobility retired to their Lodgings, leaving the Magistrates, who at Eight of the Clock at Night went down to the great Bonefire that was in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court of the Pallace, where his Grace, and many of the Nobility that were to sup with him, met them, and drank the Healths again. And were the next Day invited to Dine with his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57305:16"/>
Grace in an Apartment of the Pallace, where with the Nobility and Ladies, the Clergy, the Judges, and all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Quality, they were splendid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained by His Grace.</p>
            <p>To compleat the mutual Felicities of this happy Royal Pair, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 4th of <hi>November</hi> their Marriage was privately solemnized at St. <hi>Iames's,</hi> by the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of His Majesty, Their Royal Highnesses, and some of the chiefest of the Nobility. It was remarkable, that when the Bishop came to these Words of Form, <hi>Who gives this Woman?</hi> That His Majesty answered, <hi>I do.</hi> Upon which, Their Majesties, Their Royal Highnesses, and Their Highnesses recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Complements and Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Ambassadors of the States General of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and of the other Foreign Ministers residing in the Court. And the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made likewise their dutiful Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57305:16"/>'Twas the 5th of <hi>November</hi> before the News of His Majesty's Intentions of the Marriage arrived at <hi>Dublin</hi>: And the First of <hi>December</hi> before the Consummation was published there; which filled the Place with that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Joy, that on <hi>Monday</hi> the Third of <hi>December,</hi> His Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and all the Nobility and Gentry in Town, met in great Splendour at the Play, where there pass'd a general Invitation of all the Company to spend that Evening at the Castle. And whilst the Streets were every where fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Bone-fires, the Bells ringing, and all the Great Guns of the City fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring round; at the Castle was a very splendid Ball, and in the Long Gallery a magnificent Banquet prepared for the whole Company; who parted not till Two a Clock in the Morning.</p>
            <p>The Prince and Princess were now preparing for their Departure for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; during their whole Stay in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> having been highly caressed by the whole Court and Kingdom. The

Prince had the particular Honour to stand Partner with His Majesty, as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, together with the Lady <hi>Isabella,</hi> represented by her Governess the Lady <hi>Villers,</hi> to a young Brother; Her Royal Highness, on the 7th of <hi>November,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to Bed of a young Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christned by the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 19th of <hi>November,</hi> about Nine in the Morning, Their Highnesses par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> in order to their Embarking on the Yatchts appointed to transport them for <hi>Holland</hi>; His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and His Royal Highness being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to accompany them as far as <hi>Erith,</hi> where Their Highnesses went on Board; but being several Days detained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds, they arrived not in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> till the 29th.</p>

            <p>In the Evening they were entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a preparation of Fire-Works, in which were represented several Figures, as that of a Drake, a Lion, a St. <hi>George</hi> on Horse back, Fountains, Pyramids, Flower-Pots, Castles, Triumphal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> as descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in all the Streets were a great number of pitch Barrels, provided for the several lofty piles of Bonefires prepared for the Solemnity of the Day, which ended in Rejoicing and Feasting, and all other Testimonies of the Universal Joy.

            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57305:22"/>This Marriage thus concluded to universal Satisfaction of the Kingdom, 'tis worth our Consideration to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the chief Movements in an Affair of this Importance. Of all the Court Sollicitors in the Prince's behalf, the then Lord Treasurer, his Grace the now Duke of <hi>Leeds,</hi> was one of the chief and most prevailing Orators. That wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Patriot, possibly one of the fairest <hi>Phosphers</hi> to our present Rising Sun; was ever an indefatigable Zealot for the <hi>English</hi> true Interest and Honour, and the Protestant Religion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently amongst his many memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Services, must not a little glory in being instrumental in so auspicious an Alliance. To this the King's particular Esteem and Respects for the Person of the Prince, not a little contributed; when, as Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> tells us in his Memoirs, his Majesty was pleased to express his Opinion of the Prince in these Words.
<q>I never yet was deceived in judging of a Man's Honesty by his Looks, <hi>(of which he gave some Examples)</hi> and if I am not deceived in the Prince's face, he is the honestest Man in the World,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57305:22"/>
and therefore I will trust him: He shall have her, &amp;c.</q>
But in truth, above all other Arguments, the then grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jealousies of the Parliament car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Cause: For at that time 'twas highly adviseable for hushing the Quiet of the Nation, that the Eldest-Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Crown should sleep in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Arms. Whilst in reality the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession was rather more for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's, than the Prince's Gratification: A Concession, in which the King poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bly acted with a Resolution more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, as being contrary to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conduct and Measures of that Reign, as where neither the Duke nor the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador were called to the Consult; the first being much surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed when he received the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for his Concurrence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Matter, and the latter not a little disgusted, as not knowing how he should Answer it to his Master, That an Affair of that Importance should pass without his Communication, much less Advice, in a Court where nothing before had done so, for many Years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:57305:23"/>But for a more particular Inquiry into her Father's Inclination in the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of this Match, I shall only quote Mr. Secretary <hi>Coleman</hi>'s long Letter to Father <hi>La Chaise,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, where he tells him,
<q>That to propose the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> Eldest Daughter to his <hi>Royal Highness,</hi> in a Match for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was not only without the Consent, but against the good Liking of his Royal Highness, insomuch that they must Excuse him with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction: That the said Lady was not to be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ked upon as the Duke's Daughter, but as the Kings, and a Child of the State, and so the Duke's Consent not to be much considered in the Disposal of her, but the Interest only of State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, this Marriage of the Duke's Daughter, and the Protestant Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was a Matter of that Weight and Moment, as wanted no less than an Excusatory Epistle sent as far as <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <q>His Royal Highness <hi>(as the Secretary tells us in another of his papers)</hi> having sent a Letter to the Pope on that Subject, which he tells us was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57305:23"/>
and that the Pope remained satisfied, that the Duke was in no Fault.</q>
But whatever Apology was wanting on this Occasion, how uneasy a Guest soever his Royal Highness had been, at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relisht Marriage Feast, nevertheless I may justly say, how strong soever his own private Aversion might be, yet still even himself was so far highly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental towards the making this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, that his own Conduct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Necessity of it, and that <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> in reality was the strongest Hinge it moved on.</p>
            <p>Upon this Match of the presumptive Heiress of <hi>England</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ever, even from his Infancy, so jealous and vigorous a Zealot for the Common Interest of <hi>Christendom,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the then formidable Growth and too aspiring Ambition of <hi>France,</hi> the Expectations of <hi>Europe</hi> had now, in all Reason and probability, the very fair Hopes of some speedy Alteration of Councils, and change of Measures, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Dissolving, or at least slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the too strong, and I may say too fatal, I am certain, too inglorious Links
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57305:24"/>
and Ties of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; of having I say, at least some leading Influence towards awakning the Lethargy of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which with so long, and no less shameful Easiness (to give it no harder a Name)
<q>
                  <l>Hinc illae Lachrymae—</l>
               </q>
had hitherto in every point, so highly contributed to the whole Grandeur of that incroaching Monarch, as to lend a Helping-hand even to the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it. All this might reasonably have been expected from this Marriage, had Providence thought us worthy of such Blessings, at least at that Season, whatever later Blessings it had in store for us.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, notwithstanding the forementioned Magnificent Reception of the Prince and Princess by the whole <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> so Welcomed and Caressed, even to a Torrent of Joys amongst them; nevertheless there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not those Engines of <hi>France,</hi> who in a very few Months after so turned the Tide, as to poison the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Faith of <hi>Holland</hi> with those Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loasies of the Prince's Match, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57305:24"/>
the Prince instead of bringing the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Court over to His and Their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest by his Alliance, had on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, himself been lured and drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>English</hi> Interest and Party by it; nay, and not only so, but through his own private Ambition and the <hi>English</hi> Encouragement, had upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Match, formed some aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Designs, even upon <hi>Holland</hi> it self. Insomuch, that instead of their former Hopes of having strengthned the Prince's Arm in their Cause by this Alliance, it was the general popular Fear, that they had rather lost a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion by it, than gained one.</p>
            <p>Whilst the injured Prince's Glory was shaded by all those false and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Imputations, it was at this time, and partly through these Jeaulousies, that the Peace at <hi>Nim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n</hi> was shuffled together, so dishonourable to <hi>England,</hi> and so pernicious to the <hi>Confederacy.</hi> Insomuch, that this Match of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that was thought to have given so great a Blow to <hi>France,</hi> was by Dint of Conduct and Management turned wholly to the <hi>French</hi> Advantage. Thus
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57305:25"/>
far indeed this Match was for the <hi>French</hi> Advantage; the <hi>Destined</hi> Hour was not yet come for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to stand up the Champion of <hi>Christendom</hi>; the over-ruling <hi>Providence</hi> had not yet signed him that Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, being reserved perhaps for a later Execution; at a Season, when the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger and difficulty of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance shall heighten the Glory.</p>
            <p>But now to open the new Scene of her Life, her Entry into the Marriage State: Here we have so Dazling a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect before us, so vast a Subject both for Praises and Admiration, that her very Enemies (if such Goodness could have any) must join in her <hi>Panegyricks</hi> upon that Theme: For as 'tis in this Feild only, that the <hi>Fair Sex</hi> have their Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels to gather, so never were richer Bridal Chapplets worn than on that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>row; whilst between those only Pillars of Nuptial Happiness, <hi>Resignation</hi> and <hi>Endearment,</hi> the three great <hi>Matrimonial Vows</hi> to <hi>Love, Honour</hi> and <hi>Obey,</hi> were engraved in that Tables she wore next her heart; not (as too often) the Right Ceremony of a Bridal Morning,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57305:25"/>
but the constant Exercise of a Life, her whole Life but one long (to our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row too short) Nuptial Day: Those three <hi>Divine Graces</hi> that shined through her whole Deportment and Conduct, I might say, with equal Lustre; unless that (like the three Theological Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi>) the last were the Greatest. For to pay her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory this sacred Right, she was that Tenderness, that Gentleness, that Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that intire Submission and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that though she had all the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of such high Veins, the Majesty of such a lovely Personage, and the Birth-right to three fair Diadems; yet instead of the least <hi>Wedlock Insult</hi> or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation, from Beauty, Honours or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, or any thing the World calls <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Fair</hi>; on the contrary, they were only so many brighter Plumes to enrich and furnish out the Houshold Dove.</p>
            <p>But this we must the less wonder at: For to give exalted Virtue its due, <hi>Love</hi> is the fairest Off-spring, where 'tis the Child of Piety: For if there be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence or Harmony in all the Cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57305:26"/>
of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> 'tis undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly there where they flow from that Heart and that Tongue that is toucht with an <hi>Altar Cole.</hi> For true Religion and Virtue, not only pull down so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Blessings from Heaven, as their own fair Reward, upon the honourable Bed of Marriage, but likewise bring that ample Dowr of Blessings of their own along with them, by enlightening the Soul to the performance of the whole Duties of Marriage, which crown the whole Felicities of it: Love may join Hands and Hearts, but it is Heaven alone that truly ties them.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Princess enricht only with all the Gifts of Heavenly Grace, to make her the best of Wives; but likewise all the Gifts of Nature too, to make her such; whilst the freer Gayety of her Temper, and Fluence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, in conjunction with the more Reservedness of the Prince, so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened their Society, and cheered their Embraces, as to make them the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingest, and thereby the happiest Pair in the World. In fine, to summ her whole Character upon this spacious

Subject: The famous Examples of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, such as a <hi>Portia,</hi> or a <hi>Camilla,</hi> those old <hi>Roman</hi> Presidents of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Nuptial Fidelity, came so far short of the more dazling perfections here; by so much, as that above that rigid Feminine Honour, their only shining Guides, here was that infinite Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the brighter Luminaries of Christianity, a more beauteous and more sacred Constellation, for her leading Lights.</p>
            <p>'Tis thus we find her in her narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Pallace at the <hi>Hague,</hi> with her little <hi>English</hi> Court about her, either melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Complacence and Tenderness to her ever loved Lord, when at home with her; or else wafting her no less melting Sighs, Tears and Prayers after him, when exposed to remoter Toils and Hazards abroad: For in truth, the Prince was never facing of Dangers, or pushing for Glory, but the Princess was as ardently wrestling of Heaven for his preservation.</p>
            <p>When after the toil of a Campaign, and the fatigues of the Feild, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57305:27"/>
of her own prayers, and the Justice of his own Cause, as the good <hi>Genii</hi> that still hover'd round him, had brought him back to her Arms again, she flew with all the wings of Love to receive him; ever the forwardest of the whole Congratulating Train to meet him; and so inexpressible her Joys and Indearments that welcomed him, that still she had new work for a bended Knee, those yet new Vows to offer up, that her Thanks to Heaven for his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection were as important a part of her tendrest Devotion, as the Prayers to implore it.</p>
            <p>Though her chief Residence and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Court in <hi>Holland</hi> was at the <hi>Hague,</hi> yet she had several other Pallaces, the Hereditary Princely Seats of the House of <hi>Orange,</hi> as at <hi>Honsla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57305:27"/>But in all these places, her whole En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment was, in a manner, only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her own Roof. For notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her natural Goodness, she had all the Condescension and Courteous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position imaginable, yet still she owed so much to her own High Birth, that as she lived in a Re-publick, there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that high Quality amongst them, worthy a Princess particular Intimacy and Familiarity: insomuch that out of an indispensible point of State, she could neither make Visits abroad nor Confidants; so that, as I said before, her whole Conversation was altogether at home.</p>
            <p>But whilst the narrowness of her Court, almost to a Recluseness and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude took from her so great a part of that Grandeur, State and Homage, the usual Attendance of Royal Veins, and which so many transcendent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the Princess so highly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited; nevertheless it afforded her those particular Advantages, that repaid that unregretted Loss. For, to her Glory, the Closet and Altar had so much the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57305:28"/>
more of her Company, as the Throne had the less. The less of the Hurry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Pomps of Life, it gave her so much the fairer Occasion (an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion always embraced) of more close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly following the great Original of her own Name, <hi>viz. In choosing the better part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, as much Restrained or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served as her own princely Character obliged her to live there, yet still her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Civility and Caress to the Burgher-Master's Ladies, or any of the more eminent Grandees of State, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occasions of Complement, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit or Address made to her, gained her that Veneration and Esteem amongst them, that it is almost incredible to imagine, how entirely she carried the Hearts of the whole <hi>United Provinces.</hi> The visible Charms in her Person, and no less in her Carriage, with her exalted Piety, equally visible to the whole Eyes of the World, were those Attractions that all joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to dazle and astonish, such as obliged them to pay her the most
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57305:28"/>
Cordial LOVE, HONOUR and RESPECTS.</p>
            <p>Besides for one Contentment still, which extracted a particular sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from this Recluser sort of Life, she was too passionate a Lover of her Dear LORD, even for that single Consideration alone, to affect a more noisy or more popular Court. Her Worldly Delights were wholly circled in his Embraces: A Prince so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the most tender conjugal Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as being adorned with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny surpassing Virtues to attract and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that Affection: Of whom a great Minister of State, and one who had been long acquainted with his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Endowments gives this noble Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>A PRINCE, who joined to the great Qualities of his Royal Blood, possesses all the popular Virtues of his Country: Silent and Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Given to Hear and Enquire: Of a Sound and Steddy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57305:29"/>
Much Firmness in what he once Resolves, or once Denies: Great. Industry and Application to his Business: Little to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: Piery in the Religion of his Country, but with Charity to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Temperance unusual to his Youth, and to the Climate: Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in the common Management of his Fortune, and yet Magnificent upon Occasion: Of a great Spirit and Heart, aspiring to the Glory of Military Actions; with strong Ambition to grow Great, but rather by the Service than the Servitude of his Country. In short, a Prince of many Virtues, without any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mixture of Vice.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57305:29"/>But though the Princess in her <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Court, had not those high quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Guests at Home to Welcome: However she had sometimes the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of more Illustrious Royal Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that came a little farther Abroad to honour her Court: For on <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> the First of <hi>October,</hi> 1678. Her Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highness the Dutchess of <hi>York,</hi> and the Princess <hi>Anne</hi> began a Journey from <hi>White-hall</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to visit the Princess of <hi>Orange</hi>: A Visit so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary grateful to her, that she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with all the highest Marks of Respect and Affection, and with all the Entertainment suitable. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Transports of Caresses and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments between the two Princely Sisters was inexpressible: But the Felicity the Princess enjoyed was no lasting Blessing, for they made but a short stay there, whilst the parting of the two Princesses, was little less than a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57305:30"/>Not long after, Providence was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to send her another Royal, though then unexpected, Visitant more. For in <hi>February,</hi> 1678/9. at that time, when the prophetick Fears of <hi>England,</hi> from the Duke's suspected Inclinations and Adherence to the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest (for hitherto they were only suspicions) had made that Ferment in the <hi>English</hi> Blood, that the Nation's pulse beat high; his protecting Royal Brother his constant Sheild against the Assault of Fortune, had sent him over, with his Dutchess and Family, to the <hi>Hague</hi>; in hopes, that Distance and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the common Cure of Jealousie might at least have wrought that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Operation, as, in some measure, to allay the Ferment, and cool the then too threatning Heats against him. But whatever this Expedient might work towards the End desired, the Duke found an extraordinary and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Reception from the true fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial Duty of the Princess, and a very hospitable Roof from the generous Prince, whilst the Princess melted into all the tendrest Condolance and Pity
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57305:30"/>
on the mournful Occasion of his Visit there. 'Tis true, the <hi>Belgian</hi> Populace gave him but a colder Welcome; and, to say truth, afforded him very little more Civility, than the Herd does the wounded Deer: An ungrateful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the too long and too warm Zeal of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> for the Interest of theirs, and the common.

Here amongst all the Sighs and Tears pay'd to that expiring Prince, none certainly could be a truer or heartier Mourner than the Princess of <hi>Orange.</hi> 'Tis true, his lamented Death advanced the Princess so much the nearer to a Crown. But so far were her Thoughts from pluming her self with that gay Trifle added to her Scutcheon, that on the contrary, not only her natural and passionate Tenderness for so near, so great, and so honoured a Relation, but likewise those for the Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of her Country, infinitely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed all private Considerations, if it were possible for her diminutive Ambition to have any such: For Empire and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty weighed but light in her Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:57305:32"/>But as we have endeavoured to play the Divine Historian, in recounting the inimitable Vertues and Piety of this most excellent Lady; so we find her not only so zealous a Professor, but rank'd also in that higher Class, the Champions of Religion too; witness her several Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>Holland</hi> to her ever-darling Sister the Princess <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi>; in which, to copy from her Grand-father's Original, I may truly say she drew her own <hi>Eicon Basilice,</hi> whilst out of some little Fears of that too dangerous Influence,

Grounds of Faith, as wholly unshaken as her own. Nevertheless, 'twas an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Tenderness of Affection, and Warmth of Zeal on the right side; and her inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Prosecution of so noble a Theme must stand no little Monument of her Glory.</p>

               </gap>n for so Divine a Theme as such trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Piety, and true Zeal for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I shall borrow her fairer Character from a more deserving Historian, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Lake,</hi> her Royal Highness's sometimes Chaplain; whilst in his Preface to his <hi>Officium Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charisticum,</hi> a Present truly worthy so sacred a Hand as the Princess's, he just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells the World,
<q>That She is become her own Theatre; every Scene of her Life is so generally known, (whilst the World is a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to applaud and admire her) that it were even an unpardonable Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, either to think of adding any thing to her Highness's Luster, or to

believe he need open his Reader's Eyes. The Gravity and Sweetness of her Miene, the Affability of all her Comportments; the Vertue, Innocence and Goodness of her Life; her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved Constancy in adhering to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of our Church; her frequent and devout Retirements into her Closet; her unwearied Attendance at her Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and Altar, are sufficiently obvious; that the bare Knowledg of her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness has been enough to render her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, with the most profound Respect. And that he's encouraged to tell her, that these Endowments will ever more import and stead her than any external or worldly ones, wherewith too she is abundantly provided. The Celsitude of her Descent only enrolls her Name in the Catalogue of the <hi>Great,</hi> is secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and transitory, calculated for this World; but it is her Grace and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that writes it in the Book of Life. Beauty is fading, Grandure is fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the Wreathes of Civil Honour

are withering; but her Godliness is a Crown that shall not fade away, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously set off with a diffusive Charity, a great Humility, and an exemplary Devotion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to our History: As we left that sleeping Prince (the much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <hi>Charles</hi> the Second) in his Tomb, and find his Brother in the Throne: When after the first fair Dawn of this new Reign (a Morning that smiled so kind and promising, even to the dispel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling almost all our past Frights) the growing Day soon clouded, and our whole Hemisphere began to lowr: When Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Zeal (not to be too long on so unpleasing a Subject) had superseded all other Obligations of Trust, Faith, Vows, Honour, and every thing that ought to be binding or sacred; and all the fatal Consequences were but too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; insomuch that our Religion and Liberties bore but a Melancholy Face un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the black Storms above them: 'Twas then when the reviving and increasing Terrors of the Nation from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Calamities, call'd and invited

            <p>To describe the Prince's glorious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into <hi>England,</hi> so late and so fresh in all Memories, were a needless Repetition.

            </p>
            <p>And now to compleat the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's impatient Desires, there wanted only the Presence of her Royal Highness, who accordingly upon a solemn Invitation of the Estates embarked for <hi>England,</hi> attended by a Squadron of English and Dutch Men of War, and arrived safely at <hi>White-hall</hi> on the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1688.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57305:35"/>
to the inexpressible Joy of the People, having been also saluted all the way her Yatch passed, by the Forts and Ships in the Road, as also by the Tower-Guns. The same Day she received the Complements of the whole Nobility; and the next Day Their Titles were proclaimed, only with all the Customary Formality of Proclamations of that kind, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Gates at <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> were shut, where the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder and Sheriffs attended, till the Heraulds at Arms came to the Gates, and there informed the occasion of their coming, before they were opened for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission into the City.</p>
            <p>On the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> following was celebrated their happy Coronation; which added that fairer Glory to the Triumphs of the Day, as the Nation had conceived those fairer and more than common Hopes from the Illustrious Royal Pair that then received the Crown. And to conclude the Ceremony by the universal Satisfaction that finish'd it, I can only say, if Excess be a Fault, there wanted even a General Pardon for the Joys of that Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57305:35"/>And here in Relation to her Majesty's share of Glory, I must now remark, as an everlasting Trophy to her never-dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Honour, a Record that shall keep her Memory fragrant to the end of the World: That not only our Altars, the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> owes its Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters and Bulwarks to Her; his now Majesty's double Alliance (through her Marriage) to the Crown of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> being the greatest Invitation and Encouragement to the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to call him over for their Deliverer: But likewise 'twas this Royal Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our Ascendant that has taken up the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> which the Un-British Effeminacy, Coldness and Negligence of the foregoing Reigns had so weakly, so poorly, and so unkindly let fall. The before so long Titular, and only Titular Blazon in the Royal Scutcheon of <hi>Arbiter of Europe,</hi> is now become (and that a Work I may say so far of her own fair Creation) a true and massy Jewel in the English Crown, whilst her propitious Marriage alone has lent this happy Kingdom that Hand and that Heart, that dare put in Execution
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57305:36"/>
what his Predecessors made only a <hi>Feint</hi> and Shadow; has crown'd us that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Prince, who in the Head of an Army dares speak true English again, true Royal English. A Prince, whose publick Benefits and Obligations to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have reconciled those almost incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible Names, the <hi>Protestant Deliverer,</hi> and yet at the same time the <hi>Romish Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>; whilst his indefatigable and active Services in Relief of the common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses of <hi>Christendom,</hi> have made even the most rigid Royal Sons of the <hi>Vatican Mother</hi> both love, embrace and honour him.</p>
            <p>The next Year after their Majesties Coronation, his Majesty's Personal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance being required in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the Reduction of that Kingdom to his Obedience, (a Work that appeared too difficult for any other Conduct but his own) the Parliament by a Statute made for that purpose, settled the Royal Administration in the Queen, to hold for such time during his Majesty's Absence. By virtue of this Act, whenever his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's leading Sword in the common Cause of <hi>Christendom</hi> has been called

abroad, and thereby the Regency de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved into the Queen's Hand; as all those times of his Majesty's Absence were ever at that active Season of the Year, as required the most vigorous and most vigilant Councils of <hi>England</hi>; so the Royal Helm, tho steered by a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Hand, was never better guided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or more firmly, by the most Manly Royal Pilot. I may truly say, that as she was a second <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the Church, so she was no less in the Council-Chamber.</p>
            <p>But as highly qualified as she was for Exercise of Sovereign Power; how she affected it, I shall refer my Reader to the Reverend Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s his more eminent Authority, where in the Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her several other Vertues, he is pleased to leave us this Record of her.</p>
            <q>
               <p>She was the Glory of her Sex, and an Ornament to the Crown she wore, made truly Great by Nature, Birth and Education. She had a large and capacious Mind, a quick and lively Apprehension, and a piercing and solid
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57305:37"/>
Iudgment; she had a Strength and Firmness of Mind beyond her Sex, and such a Dexterity in managing the greatest Affairs, as would have become the greatest and most experienced Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. Never was there greater Skill in Government with less Fondness for it, which she could take up and lay down with the same Equality of Mind: Tho, I doubt, I must unsay that, for she was always grieved at the occasion of taking the Government, and as glad to resign it.</p>
               <p>Never was Majesty better temper'd with Easiness and Sweetness; She knew how to be familiar without making her self cheap; and to condescend without Meanness: She had all the Greatness of Majesty, with all the Vertues of Conversation, and knew very well what became her Table, and what became her Council-Board, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:57305:37"/>In short, her greatest and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies (for Vertue it self will meet with Enemies in the World) had no other fault to charge her with, but her Throne; which is the only thing for which most Princes are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable. She ascended the Throne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed before she desired it, but was thrust into it, not by an hasty Ambition, but to save a sinking Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And I hope <hi>England</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have Reason to say, That an empty Throne could never have been filled with a nobler Pair.</p>
            </q>
            <p>As the heighth of her Birth, and the depth of her Conduct and Capacity, so every ways suted to her Place and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter (her little Ambition of Power only excepted) had so signally enrich'd her for a Sovereign Head: And to all this the bountiful Riches of Nature in so many Personal Accomplishments, had mark'd her out as well for the leading Court-Star too; yet either of these Claims and Prerogatives were so little
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57305:38"/>
her Concern, that the only Study of her Life was that Exemplary Piety, as should render her the leading Vertue that shin'd there. For so free was she from the least Pride and Vanity, those too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Taints both of Greatness and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that if it were possible for her to glory in any of her illustrious Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Acquisitions, it was not in the Beauties of her fair Eyes, or the Glories of her exalted Station, but those of her more exalted Mind: so far was she from being transported or delighted with what her Crown or her Glass reflected her, that on the contrary, she only looked upward for the Lustre to adorn her, and inward for the Mirror to please her.</p>
            <p>And altho three Diadems were a very alluring Birth-right, a fair Portion of Worldly Felicity, yet she had still a higher Ambition: The Crown she aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to was enrich'd with far brighter Lustre than that of Pearls and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; and so little was she elevated with her first, that she waited only for her later and dearer Coronation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:57305:38"/>But not only to survey her in this higher Sphere of Piety and Religion, but descend from her Communication with Heaven, to her Converse with Man, and describe her Morals as well as Divinity: She was the kindest and most constant Patroness to her Friends. And to keep up no less to the great Christian Maxim of returning Good for Evil; so she was a Protectress even to her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whilst many a just Blow from too many deserving Heads has been shielded off by her interposing Mercy.</p>
            <p>Then for another of her shining Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, she was Charitable (if that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine might hold in <hi>our</hi> Church) even to <hi>Merit.</hi> And as so many hundred poor Widows are now provided for mourning Attendants at her Funeral; so in her Life-time she has made many more hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of them smile at her Gate, than those are now order'd to mourn at her Hearse; when so many Mouths have been fed, and Backs clothed by her Majesty's Royal Bounty. And whilst so many living Monuments of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour shall ever sing her Praises; so the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57305:39"/>
cheerful and thankful Prayers of the Poor are of all, the loudest <hi>Trumps</hi> of <hi>Fame</hi>; for their Sound reaches Heaven, and makes the sweetest and most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Musick there.</p>
            <p>Take her in all Capacities, she was a <hi>Wife</hi> so tender, that all her Sex might take Pattern from: A <hi>Princess</hi> so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that all Mankind could do no less than reverence: A <hi>Mistress</hi> so obliging, that even the poorest of her Menials could not but doat upon her: And a <hi>Companion</hi> so cheerful, (where ever she vouchsafed her Friendship and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation) that made all Harmony where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she spoke; every thing smiled round her, Heaven only excepted, when it so early snatch'd her away. Yet pardon that Expression, Heaven smiled not less on her, in advancing her to that brighter Crown of Glory she so long aspired to, and was so well prepared for; but on us, when we were thought unworthy the longer Blessings of such a Princess.</p>
            <p>To all her more Princely Perfections, those superiour Ornaments, (for we have still new Subject of her Praises, in a yet
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57305:39"/>
lower Class of Vertues) she thought it no Disgrace to wear the humbler Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Badg even of common Domestick Housewifery, whilst that Hand that graced a Royal Scepter, condescended to the poor Needle; as if she resolved to make her Life a Pattern to Woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as well to the Cottage as the Court; and by this particular Humility, to shame the Idleness of the highest and proudest, as well as lead and encourage it from so Royal an Example, even the lowest and the meanest.</p>
            <p>And now to descend to the humblest, and at least the most neglected part of her Life, her <hi>Diversions,</hi> the Hours she rarely stole from Books or Devotion. The Theatres have sometimes (but very rarely) prevailed, and that by Dint of Address and Supplication, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her Royal Presence. The Muses (for whom both her Person and her Life were the fairest Scene) have now and then obtain'd the Grace of her Royal Encouragement.</p>
            <p>And besides the several Balls and Masks at Court upon the Anniversaries
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57305:40"/>
of her Coronation, or those of her own or his Majesty's Birth-days, her Majesty was twice publickly entertain'd by the City of <hi>London</hi>; the first was on the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> in 1689, being the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival Day of Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkington</hi>'s Instalment into his Mayoralty; and the second on the same Day in the Year 1692, the like Festival Triumph at Sir <hi>Iohn Fleet</hi>'s Accession to the Chair.</p>
            <p>At the first of these Invitations from the City, their Majesties, with both the High Courts of Parliament (then sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) with all the Chief Ministers of State, Foreign Ministers, their Majesties Privy-Council, the Judges, Ladies of the Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides the Pageantry of the Day, were treated at a splendid and magnificent Dinner at <hi>Guild-hall.</hi> At the second Entertainment there was much the like Splendor and Magnificence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, excepting that the Parliament not then sitting, that part of their Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Guests were wanting. Both which were attended with the universal Shouts and Acclamations of the People, in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for the Honour the City, and the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57305:40"/>
Satisfaction they themselves received from their Majesties Royal Presence there; both through their Entry into the City, and also their Return to <hi>White-hall.</hi> I shall only recite some part of the Solemnity.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Hastings</hi> at the upper End of the Hall (where, under a Royal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy of State, the Table for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties was seated) being erected a state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Structure, supported with noble Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns and Pillasters of Egyptian Marble, the Base and Capitals of Gold, bearing a large Etableture of Silver, with Banners, Trophies, Escutcheons, Statues, all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Grandure of the Royal Guests, and the Solemnity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; upon a large Shield was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently painted the Poetical Story of <hi>Perseus</hi> and <hi>Andromeda,</hi> with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription;

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:57305:42"/>But now to come to the most mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part of our History.</p>
            <p>On Thursday the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> her Majesty felt an Indisposition, which at first she did not think of moment enough for Application to her Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</p>
            <p>The Day following her Illness increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, the worthy Dr. <hi>Millington,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> were called; and upon the growing Danger, Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> Dr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi> and some other learned Gentlemen were added to the <hi>Consult</hi> of <hi>Physicians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Saturday the Symptoms of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> appeared.</p>
            <p>At the same time for her Ghostly Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, the most Reverend the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Right Reverend the Bishops of <hi>Worcester, Ely, Sarum,</hi> and <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> paid her their Religious Attendance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57305:43"/>These worthy Prelats, the ever most delightful Society of her Life, are now the mournful Assistants to conduct her out of it. And tho 'tis easily to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined what a more melancholy, tho Christian, Office they undertook in this last duteous Service to their most gracious Royal Mistress, their best of Friends and Patronesses: Yet as afflicted as they were at the too visible Face of that <hi>King of Terrors, DEATH,</hi> that so imminently threatned that Sacred Life; however, on the other side, they could not but be as extraordinary pleased to find her so well and so richly prepared to receive him.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was the most constant Attendant even to her last Breath, was one day ask'd by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, <hi>What her Physicians Opinion of her was?</hi> To which his Grace ingeniously replying to this Effect, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired of her Recovery: Her Majesty, wholly unstartled, with her natural Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, was pleased to answer in these words,
<q>
                  <l>God be praised, I am provided.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57305:43"/>That constant Tranquillity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of Mind attended her through her whole Sickness, (her Preparation for Eternity being not the Work of her Death-bed) that all along she express'd a perfect Resignation to the Pleasure of Heaven; and seem'd to have nothing in this World, that she should be concern'd to part from but her dear Lord, to whom, amongst many other affectionate and tender Expressions, she was pleased to utter this kind and most passionate Wish, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That his Subjects might all love him as she had done.</q>
            <p>His Majesty during her whole Sickness, was that pious and constant Mourner over her, and such his extraordinary Tenderness and Fondness, that no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions could draw him a moment from her, whilst he lay upon a Camp-Bed all the while by her in the same Room.</p>
            <p>The Day before her Death she join'd in Communion with the Reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57305:44"/>
and took her <hi>Viaticum</hi> for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the <hi>Blessed Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine; her Religious Deportment through her whole Sickness was such, that her Reverend and pious Heavenly Guides found occasion to <hi>learn</hi> more than <hi>instruct</hi>; insomuch that the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was heard to say,
<q>That when it pleased God to call him, he pray'd that he might be found so well prepared to die.</q>
            </p>
            <p>During her whole Sickness no Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were wanting, if possible, to save so pretious a Life; but as Human Art and Care cannot fence against the Will and Pleasure of Heaven, both the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians Industry, and the Nation's Prayers were wholly successless: for on Friday the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> about One in the Morning, her attending Divines resigned their Charge to her ministring Angels, at which time she breathed out her Soul into the Arms of Heaven.</p>
            <p>It was observable, that not the least Pang of Death was seen in her Face,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57305:44"/>
whilst she breathed her last, as if she had rather seem'd to have lain down to sleep, than die.</p>
            <p>If our Christian Creed will allow us that Latitude of Faith, as to give Credit and Reputation to Omens and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as the Presages or Fore-runners to the Deaths of Royal Heads, we have some very signal Occurrences that either happened before, or about the time of the Queen's Departure, worthy some particular Observation.</p>
            <p>For instance:</p>
            <p>First; His Majesty upon his going in his Royal Robes to the House of Lords for signing the two last Acts, <hi>viz.</hi> for the continuance of Tunnage and Poundage, and the frequent Session of Parliaments, his George was so missing as not possible to be found, insomuch that he was forced to borrow that of the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi>'s, to wear on that occasion.</p>
            <p>Upon the Queen's first Indisposition, the great and eldest Lion in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57305:45"/>
who had been about twenty Years there, commonly call'd King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Lion, sickned with her, and died the Wednesday Night after Christmas-Day, about Midnight, 48 Hours before her Majesty; which affords us so much the more matter of Curiosity, as that the like happened at the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, when another of those Royal Beasts much in the like manner made the same <hi>Exit</hi> with that Prince.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Bristol</hi> we have a certain Account that a Keeper of Sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi>'s Park shot an Eagle flying some very few days before the Queen's Death, being a Bird of that extraordinary Size, that her extended Wings reach'd three Yards wanting two Inches; and what adds to the Surprize and Wonder of this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, That the very same Keeper likewise shot another Eagle of very large Dimension in the Duke of <hi>Bolton</hi>'s Park three days before King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his Death.</p>
            <p>I dare not attempt the describing the <hi>Royal Sorrows,</hi> those of the afflicted King
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57305:45"/>
at this staggering Shock. But as the Painter of old drew the Mourning <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> vailed, the Royal Face of Grief being above his Pencil's Reach: So not daring to venture on so bold a Theme, I shall only presume to say, Tho the Queen was so well prepared for her Death, his Majesty was not prepared for it. And altho she left the World without the least expiring Pangs, by dying even in Smiles; his Majesty, a mournful Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, stood by in little less than Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to behold her.</p>
            <p>The publick Addresses of Condolance which the two Houses of Parliament have since presented to his Majesty on so deplorable a Subject, in which they were truly the Nation's Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, (for they spoke but the universal Voice of Sorrow) have amply testified the sensible Loss of so excellent a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. Nor has the City been wanting in the like melancholy Duty, having likewise resolved the immediate erecting their Majesties Statues in their Royal Exchange.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57305:46"/>I shall only remark upon this National Calamity. The Learned affirm, that as in the loss of an Eye the kind concentring optick Nerves unite and convey their double force to the other remaining Light: so may we live to see the same verified in the Royal surviving Luminary of these Kingdoms. And let it be no less the Nation's particular Care and Duty to be tender of that great surviving Light, because 'tis our ALL.</p>
            <p>The Solemnities of her intended Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (in which both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment resolve to make a part of the Mourning Cavalcade) are such as,</p>
            <p>The Body to lie in State in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Bed-Chamber at <hi>White-hall,</hi> all hung with Purple Velvet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ladies of the best Quality the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Mourners there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Bed of State, and the Ornaments of Plumes, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the several other State-Rooms in <hi>White-hall</hi> likewise hung in Mourning, and their Majesties Houshold Servants planted there as Mourners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57305:46"/>From thence the whole intended Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral March, where His Majesties Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Servants, all the Judges, Serjeants at Law, Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City, but above all, both Houses of Parliament are to attend the Corps drawn by eight Horses in an open Chariot with a black Velvet Canopy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>White-hall</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The stately Pyramid of prodigious height designed to be erected in the middle of <hi>Westminster</hi>-Abbey to repose the Body in during the Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with infinite more Splendor than I can pretend to recount or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, will be all perform'd with that Grandure and Magnificence, sutable to the passionate and highest Affection the Nation pay'd to so truly matchless a Princess.</p>
            <p>Nor will the publick Mournings for so lamented a Sovereign Head, be confined only to three Kingdoms. The States of <hi>Holland,</hi> no less sensible of this common Loss, have resolved to express their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Afflictions for their dear Princely Mistress in an extraordinary manner;

when besides their going into a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mourning, Orders are given, that through all the Provinces, the Bells of every Church shall toll three times every Day for the space of an Hour, and this to be continued six Weeks.</p>
            <p>But in all the wet Eyes and sad Hearts on this deplorable Occasion, I shall only add one farther Set of no less passionate, tho a lower degree of Mourners: And those are the infinite Number of her poor Pensioners, and other Objects of her Royal Charity, amongst whom, to her never-dying Honour, she distributed near 30000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> all out of her own Revenue. These, tho the poorest Mourners, will yet be the richest Tears, whilst the occasion that sheds them must more than embalm her Memory.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I shall endeavour to sum up our Loss by the Pen of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Wake.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>If a Queen so <hi>vertuous,</hi> that her very Example was enough to convert a Libertine, and to reform an Age:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57305:47"/>
So <hi>Courteous</hi> and so <hi>Affable,</hi> as to be the Wonder and Delight of All that knew Her: So great a Lover of her <hi>Country,</hi> and the <hi>Interests</hi> of it, as to be willing to hazard what, next her Conscience, she the most valued, her good Name, and good Opinion in the World, for the Preservation of them: So <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> in her Mind, as not to have ever known, no not in Death it self, what it was to <hi>fear:</hi> So <hi>happy</hi> in <hi>Business,</hi> as to astonish rather than satisfy, those who were the best versed in it. I say, that to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of such a Queen as this, and that at such an Age, when our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were at the highest from her, be a Loss above the power of Words to express, then such is our Loss: The Greatness of which we are so far from being able sufficiently to declare, that we cannot yet make an Estimate of it.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:57305:48"/>I shall only add, Though the Great <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> through the Blessing of Heaven, lives to preserve us the LION, Supporter of the English Scutcheon; yet in the Person of our Deceased Queen, I may truly affirm, we have lost the Royal ROSE of <hi>England.</hi>
