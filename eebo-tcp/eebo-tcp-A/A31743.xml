            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>William</hi> the Second of that Name, of fewer years than his Brother, but of greater Intereſt in the Inclinations of his Father, with haſty Steps aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the Throne, entring the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Palace at the wrong Door. He indear'd himſelf to the one by the reſemblance of Humours, and the roughneſs of his Temper; and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd the other by the Credulity and Eaſineſs of his Diſpoſition: Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more deference to the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Promiſes, than to the Right of Primogeniture. His Vows to God, his Word to his Brother, and his Ingagements to his Subjects, were all plighted with a like ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with the ſame Integrity obſerv'd, and maintain'd. He was poſitive and ſturdy, and that paſs'd for Valour; He was crafty and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, and that was reported for Wiſdom: He was accounted Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, when he purſued his own
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57753:4"/>
Temporal Advantages, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted prophane, when he invaded the priviledges of the Church: He was immeaſurably covetous, only in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the being unreaſonably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe; and under the pretence of Religion he committed the greateſt Acts of Enormity and Impiety. His incontinency was not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, becauſe he could not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Vow of Matrimony; and tho' in ſpeculations and Diſputes he ſeem'd concern'd for Religion, yet by his Actions he appear'd to be a practical Atheiſt. The courſe of his Life was turbulent and uneaſie; and the manner of his Death vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and untimely.</p>
               <p>He was no ſooner mounted on the Throne, but troubles aroſe to diſcompoſe his quiet. <hi>Robert</hi> his Eldeſt Brother highly reſenting this great Injury, to be juſtled out of his Seat by the partiality of his Father,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57753:5"/>
and the Incroachment of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; began to think of ſome time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Expedients for the Recovery of his Right, and being aſſiſted in his pretenſions by ſeveral of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in <hi>England;</hi> as <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bayeux</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent, Roger Montgomery</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury, Hugh de-Grandemenil, Robert Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and divers others of the Clergy, and Nobility (who raiſed great forces, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed themſelves of many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places) the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to compound for his Peace, by an aſſurance of three Thouſand Marks <hi>per Annum</hi> to his Brother during Life, and the Reverſion of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; and by a Solemn promiſe to reſtore to the people their Ancient Laws, and to indulge them the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of hunting in his Foreſts.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57753:5"/>
By theſe condeſcenſions he diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the preſent Storm that impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over his Head, and gain'd ſome ſhort Reſpite from his growing Troubles.</p>
               <p>This Tempeſt was hardly allay'd in the South, but freſh Clouds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to gather in the North. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colin</hi> King of the <hi>Scots</hi> thinking it a fit Opportunity to purvey for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and inlarge his Borders, when his Neighbour was imbroyl'd with inteſtine Commotions; makes a ſudden and furious incurſion into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> over-runs the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, burns and deſtroys all before him, and returns home loaden with the ſpoils of the Inhabitants, without the leaſt hinderance, or oppoſition. And tho it was not long, before King <hi>William</hi> was ſufficiently revenged on his Invader, whom he reduced to the neceſſity of paying the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Homage due to the Crown,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57753:6"/>
and to give aſſurance of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fidelity by New ſtipulations; yet ſuch an enterpriſe could not be accompliſhed, without a vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Treaſure, and a great loſs of Men.</p>
               <p>The King (who was very prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of his promiſes, but ſlow and penurious in the performance) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected the payment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made with his Brother <hi>Robert;</hi> whereupon he makes his Application to the King of <hi>France;</hi> who preſently furniſh'd him with conſiderable ſupplies, by which Aſſiſtance he aſſaulted and took ſeveral Towns in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi> and by his ſucceſs obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged King <hi>William</hi> again to raiſe a powerful Army, and to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport them into that Country; where tho by his crafty Addreſs he avoided the Effuſion of Blood, and the conſumption of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57753:6"/>
yet he waſted his Treaſure, and purchaſed a Truce with the King of <hi>France,</hi> by the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mony.</p>
               <p>And now all things were calm and quiet, but not long ſo; the Skie began to be overcaſt with gloomy exhalations, and troubles aroſe upon an occaſion as unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as unneceſſary. <hi>Malcolin</hi> King of the <hi>Scots</hi> was a generous and magnanimous Prince, and being at Peace and full Amity with his Neighbours, he undertook the Toyl of a Journy as far as <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> to pay a Royal Viſit to his Ally and Friend the King of <hi>England:</hi> Who either out of a Humour, Pique or Pride, would not vouchſafe ſo much as to ſee him; which Barbarous return to the Civility of the affronted King did ſo exaſperate him, that he poſted back to his own Country,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57753:7"/>
made ready a powerful Army with all Expedition, and again infeſted <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thro' the Country without Comptrol, and enriching his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers by the Ruin and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of harmleſs and unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people. And tho' in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this deſign he loſt his Life, and the Life of <hi>Edward</hi> his Eldeſt Son, and his whole Army intirely Routed and Defeated (being drawn into an Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade by <hi>Robert Moubray</hi> the Kings Lieutenant) yet King <hi>VVilliam</hi> ſuffer'd a great diminution of his Honour and Fame, by ſo unhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable a Refuſal of a common Reſpect to his equal in Degree and Title.</p>
               <p>The King, who was never happy in any long intermiſſion of thoſe diſtemper'd Fits that ſhook him, fell now into a ſnarp

and dangerous Paroxyſme. The <hi>VVelchmen</hi> taking Notice of the Kings inceſſant Troubles and Diſtractions; to gratifie both their Revenge and Avarice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Engliſh Borders, and making uſe of ſuch Advantages as naturally attend a ſurprize, they became Maſters of many Towns and ſtrong Holds, committing all manner of Outrage and Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, exerciſing that Malice, which they bore to the King, upon the Lives and Eſtates of his innocent Subjects. The King with great induſtry and care, got together a handſom Army, with which he marched in Perſon toward them, promiſing to himſelf an eaſie and a cheap Victory: But he was diſappointed of his purpoſe, and forced to retreat with all ſpeed to <hi>London</hi> to compoſe an Army of greater ſtrength, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57753:8"/>
In the mean time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his perplexity, <hi>Robert Moubray</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> (who had done him ſuch ſignal Service in repelling the <hi>Scots,</hi> and deſtroying their King) finding himſelf diſregarded, and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Honour, or Reward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for his ſingular Merits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be Male-content; and joyn'd in an open Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Lord and Maſter. But the King reinforced with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my far ſtronger than ever he had imbodied before; took, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd the Earl, and enter'd the <hi>VVelch</hi> Territories, where not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to provoke them to the Deciſion of a Battle, he perſued them with Stratagems, Erected many Caſtles and Forts, that ſo by degrees he might become Maſter of the Country: But they retreating to the natural
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57753:8"/>
Fortifications of Woods, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and inacceſſible paſſages, did ſo baffle him in his Attempts, and ſo haraſs and tire out his Souldiers, that he thought it moſt adviſable to withdraw from the Enterpriſe, and to commit the further proſecution of it to his Lieutenants, who in time utterly ſubdued thoſe Naked and Wild people, but not without horrible Inſtances of Cruelty, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeen a Man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to a Throne, inveſted with Regal Authority, ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with all the external Glories, and Felicities of a Diadem; yet denied the inward ſatisfaction and Tranquillity of a quiet and peaceable injoyment of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions. Hitherto we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, how Invaſions from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and diſtractions at home
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57753:9"/>
render'd his Life uneaſie: Let us now take an Account of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral, and irregular Actions, which made his Perſon unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and his Reign unfortunate to his Subjects.</p>
               <p>He aſſumed to himſelf an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate and Licentious Power to ſupply his neceſſities by the detriment and ſpoil of others. And becauſe in his Time the Clergy was of all Ranks of Men the moſt opulent, he found them the moſt proper Objects of his Rapine, and Oppreſſion. When any Biſhoprick, or Abby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vacant, he preſently ſeized the Revenues into his own Hand. He kept the See of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> four years to his own uſe, and would have done it longer, but that a deſperate Sickneſs put him into a Fit of Devotion; for being at the brink of Death,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57753:9"/>
and ready to expire, he reſolved to commute for his Intruſion, by the donation of thoſe Livings, which (as he thought) he could no longer detein, and haſtily conferred the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury</hi> upon <hi>Anſelm,</hi> and and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Lincoln</hi> upon <hi>Robert Bloët:</hi> But no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was Health reſtor'd, but his old Inclinations return'd, and no other Tokens of Repentance appear'd, but a Remorſe and Sorrow for parting with two ſuch rich Morſels; for he never deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from importuning and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the two poor Biſhops, till he ſqueeſed good Sums of Mony from <hi>Anſelm,</hi> and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds from <hi>Bloet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He kept in his Hands at one time three <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>opricks <hi>(Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, VVincheſter,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury)</hi> and twelve Abbies; all which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57753:10"/>
he ſet out to Farm, and gather'd the Profits of them into his own Coffers.</p>
               <p>Being obliged to pay a great Sum of Mony to the King of <hi>France,</hi> he found this Invention to procure it; He pretended a reſolution to make War, and a ſudden irruption into <hi>Normandy,</hi> in order to which he levied twenty thouſand Men (by Preſs and other coercive means) who being drawn to the Sea ſide, and ready to imbarque, he order'd it to be ſignify'd and made known, that becauſe he could more commodiouſly levy men in <hi>Normandy</hi> (without the Toyl and Charge of tranſporting) whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would pay Ten Shillings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the raiſing of ſuch Forces, ſhould be excuſed from going on that Expedition, which proffer was ſo grateful and plauſible to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57753:10"/>
the Army, that there was hardly any man that did not greedily comply with the propoſal. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded extortion to Uſury, took up Mony by indirect Courſes, and imploy'd it to unjuſt purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; he would not ſupply his Brother with Mony (tho upon a pious undertaking to the Holy Land) without a Mortgage of his Dutchy of <hi>Normandy;</hi> and he could not raiſe it but by exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and compulſory Loans, ſo that to advance the Sum, the Biſhops melted their Plate and the Temporal Lords deſtroyed their Tenants.</p>
               <p>Spiritual Preferments were not given, but ſold by Auction, and he received from <hi>Thurſtan</hi> Five Hundred Pounds for the Abby of <hi>Glaſtenbury;</hi> and fell out with <hi>Anſelm,</hi> becauſe he would not give a Thouſand Marks for being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57753:11"/>
made Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He arrogated to himſelf the Glory of Building <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> but His Subjects were at the Expence, who believed, that he rear'd that Fabrick only for a pretence to lay a heavy Tax up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People, and was a great gainer by the Project.</p>
               <p>If the Preiſts tranſgreſſed by carnal deviations from the ſtrict Rule of their Profeſſion, the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was in the Purſe; and a compoſition with the King was as effectual, as a Sacerdotal Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. And becauſe he received ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Profit by particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> he incouraged the Relaps of ſuch as were converted to Chriſtianity, accounting it no matter to be <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt,</hi> ſo they were but Benefactors to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57753:11"/>
Among other Faults laid to his Charge, it is worth obſerving, that he is noted <hi>for impoſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Fines upon diverſe</hi> of the Nobility, <hi>for ſmall offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having by his Avarice and Severities wearied his Subjects, and diſpoſed them to ſeek for Safety and Liberty in other Countries; He unexpectedly iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a Proclamation that no man ſhould depart the Realm without his Licenſe, for the purchaſe of which he did not care to loſe a Subject. While Promoters, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and ſuch ſort of State-Caterpillars were his principal Favorites, and Partakers of his Grace and Bounty.</p>
               <p>He had a mind to be reputed <hi>an exact Obſerver of his Word and Promiſe.</hi> And perhaps he was ſo in matters of ſmall Importance: But when Profit and Advantage
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57753:12"/>
came to be weighed, Self-intereſt ſoon turned the Scale. He made a ſolemn Agreement with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Robert,</hi> to bequeath the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to him; but it does not appear, that he remembred the Ingagement, or ever had an intention to be juſt to his Word. When he was preſſed by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine War, and by the Loyalty and Valour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reſcued from the Rebellion of his <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Followers, he promiſed a reſtitution of their Ancient Laws, and an indulgence to ſome Priviledges which were much valued by the people of thoſe times; but with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity the obligation ceaſed, and he became a Bankrupt of his Word and Promiſe. As little did he regard his Promiſes to God his Creator, for being dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſick at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57753:12"/>
of Recovery, he made a Solemn Vow, that if he were reſtored to his Health, he would lead a New Life, and give over all his diſorderly Courſes, but the reſtoration of his ſtrength was accompanied with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his former vicious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and he became ten times more the child of wrath, than he was before.</p>
               <p>He is reported to be very laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and incontinent, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he did not defraud his own Wife, (having never been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried) and was not obſerved <hi>to debauch the Wives of other Men,</hi> he only paſſeth for a ſimple For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, and even in that not at all curious, not entertaining a ſelect Concubine, but promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly trucking with any Woman that came in his way.</p>
               <p>To ſhew how conſcientious
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57753:13"/>
he was in matters of Religion, take the words of Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> p. 35. <hi>He appointed a Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be held between Chriſtians and Jews, and before the day came, the Jews brought the King a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to the end they might have an indifferent hearing; the King took the preſent, encouraging them to quit themſelves like Men: And ſwore by St.</hi> Lukes <hi>face (his uſual Oath) that if they prevailed by Diſputation, he would himſelf turn Jew, and be of their Religion. A young Jew on a time was converted to the Chriſtian Faith, whoſe Father being much troubled at it, preſented the King ſixty Mark, intreating him to make his Son to return to his Judaiſm; whereupon the King ſent for his Son, commanding him without more ado to return to the Religion of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But the young Man anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57753:13"/>
he wondred his Majeſty would uſe ſuch Words; for being a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian he ſhould rather perſwade him to Chriſtianity: With which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the King was ſo confounded, that he commanded the young Man to get him out of his ſight. But his Father finding the King could do no good upon his Son, required his Mony again. Nay (ſaith the King) I have taken pains enough for it; and yet that thou mayſt ſee how kindly I will deal, you ſhall have one half, and the other half you cannot in Conſcience deny me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In one Act he ſhew'd himſelf a Tyrant, and an Atheiſt, for fifty Gentlemen being accuſed for Hunting and killing the Kings Deer, he cauſed them to be condemned to the Trial by Fire, which they eſcaping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd by the miraculous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and he thereby
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57753:14"/>
defeated of his greedy expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Confiſcation of their Eſtates, fell into an outragious Paſſion, and cry'd out, <hi>How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens this! is God a juſt Judg in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it? Now a Murrain take him that believes it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But vengeance from Heaven ſoon overtook <hi>him that did not believe it;</hi> for the King (though warned by Dreams and other uncommon Preſages, of ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Diſaſter) appointed, a Hunting in the new Foreſt upon the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> When the day came, he began to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with the remembrance of thoſe ominous Bodings, and ſtay'd within till Noon: But having at Dinner driven away all care and fear, by drinking himſelf into hardineſs and ſecurity, he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Horſe, and eagerly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owed the Chaſe: ſhortly after

Sir <hi>Walter Tyrrel,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> (to whom the King at their going out had given two Arrows very ſtrong and ſharp, telling him, That he knew how to ſhoot to purpoſe) having a very fat Buck in view, and at a convenient diſtance to be ſtruck, let fly an Arrow, which glancing on a Tree, or elſe grazing on the Back of the Deer, reach'd the King, hit him in the Breaſt, and he immediately dropt down dead.</p>
               <p>Thus fell <hi>Nimrod the mighty</hi> Norman <hi>Hunter,</hi> deſtroy'd by that very ſport in which he took ſuch exceſſive delight, violently brought to death on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; by which he had delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately deſign'd the deſtruction of many others; and in that very place where his Father had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated ſo many Town, and

Maud</hi> (common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtyled the Empreſs) was the only Daughter and Heir of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, and tho ſhe was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57753:16"/>
and afterward a Dutcheſs, yet ſhe could never arrive at the <hi>Station</hi> of a Queen. <hi>Stephen</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp'd the Crown, and kept it from her; and <hi>Henry</hi> her Son confirm'd the Diſſeiſin, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding for his own Succeſſion, without any regard to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Title.

potent, <hi>endow'd with great poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> and in expectation of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Additions: He was in his own Right Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> in Right of his Wife Duke of <hi>Guyen</hi> and Earl of <hi>Poietou,</hi> and in Right of his Mother, Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and preſumptive Heir to the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> This greatneſs of Eſtate added to the Greatneſs of his Spirit, and buoy'd up by the Hopes of a far greater augmentation of his Fortunes, puſh'd him on to ſet up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a competition for the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement</hi> of which many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents concurring (as the untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Death of <hi>Euſtace</hi> the Son of King <hi>Stophen,</hi> the melancholick deſpair of his Mother the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, upon her improſperous conteſt with <hi>Stephen,</hi> and the Loſs of her Brother, and other

actually King, diſturbed by no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, or Pretender, might with all affluence of Honour, Wealth, and Pleaſure, have enjoy'd his Kingdom in profound Peace; but in deſpight to Fortune, who hitherto had Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.

               <p>And now <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> began to find him a coſtly and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous diverſion; for having not well digeſted the affront put upon him by King <hi>Henry</hi> in marrying of <hi>Eleanor</hi> his divorced Queen, and ſeeking all occaſions to demonſtrate his Reſentments, he became an open Abettor of <hi>Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>St. Giles,</hi> with whom King <hi>Henry</hi> had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie

For the young King having imbibed ſome mutinous Notions of diſcontent from the inſinuations of the <hi>French</hi> King, and being animated by his advice and aſſiſtance, began openly to oppoſe his Father.

whole power, and thereupon in one day they <hi>began</hi> their <hi>Attacks,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> invading <hi>Normandy, Aquitain,</hi> and <hi>Britain;</hi> and the King of <hi>Scots Northumberland.</hi> The old King in a ſhort time diſincumbred himſelf from theſe Exigencies, and triumphed over all his Enemies; but new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles like <hi>Hydra's</hi> Heads, ſprung up every day to arreſt his Tranquillity; and he had no ſooner made a Truce with his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> but the defection of his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> who had poſſeſt himſelf of a great part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Poictou,</hi> obliged him to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an Army thither, and by the <hi>influence</hi> of it to reduce him to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But the ſplendor of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was <hi>darkned</hi> with a ſenſible miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, <hi>Henry</hi> his Darling, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner of his Empire, but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence of the Throne, ended his Competition with his life, to the equal content and ſorrow of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Within a while <hi>Richard</hi> his Heir apparent, revived his former diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, relapſed into the old fit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and drew along with him his Brother <hi>John,</hi> with many more of his Fathers <hi>Adherents,</hi> and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who all joyn'd with <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> (the Inheritor of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Crown, and his animoſity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>Henry)</hi> he preſently form'd an Army, and (leaſt natural affection ſhould prevail above concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Injuries) with all ſpeed and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour laid Siege to the City of <hi>Mentz,</hi> in which King <hi>Henry</hi> was then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally preſent; who apprehending himſelf to be in great danger, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to fall into the hands of ſuch Enemies, ſecretly withdrew out of the Town, and eſcaped. But the Town being taken (the place of his Nativity, and in which he took great delight) he became almoſt diſtracted with grief and paſſion, and in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57753:21"/>
extremity of his rage <hi>utter'd</hi> this blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous expreſſion, <hi>I ſhall never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after love God any more, that has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a City ſo dear to me, to be taken from me.</hi> Indeed this inconſiderable loſs made a mortal Impreſſion on his ſpirits, bereaving him of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Majeſtick grace which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him in all his actions, ſo that he tamely condeſcended to ſeek a Peace at their hands, to whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſcorn'd to vouchſafe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of any conditions; but when he came to underſtand that his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son <hi>John</hi> was in the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt him, he fell into a fit of fainting, and dy'd within four days.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> was the Author and inſtrument of his own misfortunes; He came to the Crown in peace and quiet; but never injoy'd it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or ſatisfaction. He was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <hi>Son,</hi> an indiſcreet <hi>Father,</hi> an unnatural <hi>Brother,</hi> an unjuſt <hi>Husband,</hi> 
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:57753:22"/>
a niggardly <hi>Maſter,</hi> a fickle <hi>Friend,</hi> a ſevere <hi>Enemy,</hi> a valiant King, but too penurious.</p>
               <p>His Actions were great and <hi>renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> but ſmutted with the tincture of notorious Vices. He dealt unjuſtly with the King of the <hi>Scots;</hi> and to his cruelty extended to his Brother was added a manifeſt Perjury.</p>
               <p>He made his Son a Rival in his Throne, and took many ſtrange Women to be Rivals in his Bed. As his Wife was divorced from her other Husband, ſo was his conjugal love eſtranged from her.</p>
               <p>His Partiality to his Sons is too manifeſt, while he fondly gave to <hi>Henry</hi> a ſhare of his Crown, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from his other Sons a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent maintenance. But theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary cauſes produced the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, his Indulgence to one, and his Niggardlineſs to the reſt, provoked them all to be Rebels againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:57753:22"/>
His Incontinency is ſo evident, that it ſuperſedes all the miſpriſions of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie: His cloſe Amours with the fair <hi>Roſamond</hi> were palpably detected by the induſtrious curioſity of his Queen; but his inceſtuous dalliance with the Spouſe of his Son, has left an indelible blot upon his memory.</p>
               <p>His carriage toward <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> while alive, ſpeaks him brave, and magnanimous; but his mean ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a ſordid Penance at the Tomb of that ſawcy Prelate, diſcovers plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>Superſtition</hi> was predominant in him beyond a ſenſe of <hi>true Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Parſimony, which is commendable in men of lower ranks, was a vice in him; by it he loſt the love of his Children, and diſobliged his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, while by Taxes, Confiſcations, Seiſure on Biſhopricks and Abbies, and other avaritious practiſes, <hi>he lived poorly,</hi> only that he might die rich.</p>

               <head>THE LIFE and REIGN OF <hi>EDWARD</hi> the Second.</head>
               <p>EDWARD of <hi>Carnarven</hi> was the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, and ſucceeded his Father in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England.</hi> He was in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon handſome; in his Converſation acceptable; in his Inclinations not <hi>extrémely Vicious;</hi> continent beyond any of his Predeceſſors; not given to grind his Subjects by <hi>hard</hi> Taxations, or to enrich himſelf by their Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhment. He aſcended the Throne with the Univerſal Joy and Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of the Nobility, and the People; the way to it was plain, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57753:23"/>
the Seat eaſy. He had the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of an extraordinary Education, the example of an Illuſtrious Father and a Victorious King; an early initiation in the Buſineſs of State, a happy opportunity to underſtand the <hi>Art</hi> of Reigning, by commanding the Realm, and preſiding in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during his Fathers abſence. When he took the Reins of Government into his hands, he was neither in his Nonage, nor Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; the Kingdom ſtood in no need of a Protector becauſe of His Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor an <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> becauſe he was ſuper-annuated. He was juſt ripe for Rule, and all circumſtances concurr'd to make the Concluſion of his Reign as proſperous as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe <hi>happy</hi> Prcludiums, never was there a Prince more unfortunate, never was there a Life perplexed with more Diſaſters,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57753:24"/>
or a Death attended with ſharper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Miſery and Horror: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecuted by his Subjects, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by his Qeen, depoſed by the People, and inhumanly Murdered by wretched Miſcreants.</p>
               <p>He began his Reign with a <hi>rude</hi> and irreligious contempt of his renowned Fathers Will, and dying Commands, which as it gave juſt cauſe to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ſuſpect his Veracity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſo it appear'd an ominous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his future Calamities, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion by Heaven. For whereas his Father had expreſly charged him, never to recall <hi>Pierce Gaveſton</hi> from Baniſhment (who had been the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar to the young Prince's Luſts, and the Debaucher of his Youth) he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent for him home, heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Honours and Riches upon him, and grew ſcandalouſly fond of him. His Father ſetled his Quarrel with <hi>Scotland</hi> upon him by Entayl, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57753:24"/>
him to carry his Bones about with him through that Kingdom, till he had ſubdued it: but ſo little Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration had he for thoſe <hi>Glorious</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, that he neither took them with him in a Military Proceſſion, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded their quiet Sepulture; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to affront them, he entred into a Treaty for his own Nuptials, before he had ſolemnized the Funerals of his Father. The Old King had obliged him to ſend his heart to the Holy Land, with Sevenſcore Knights to proſecute the Holy War, and two and thirty Thouſand Pounds (a mighty Sum in thoſe Days) which he had gathered for that Pious uſe: But he not only neglected his Fathers Directions, but in plain ſcorn and deſpight to his Commands, he prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſquander'd it on that ſame <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veston,</hi> from whoſe very ſight he was precluded by his dying Father.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to divide the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory 
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57753:25"/>
of his Life into ſeveral Acts, I may recite it, as it was, in one Scene of <hi>Trouble</hi> and misfortune. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of <hi>Peirce Gaveſton</hi> from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Exile was very diſpleaſing to the People; His admiſſion to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Honours and Favours about the Court, did ſmartly aggravate their juſt Reſentments; but his Pride and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation at the Marriage of the King in <hi>France</hi> (where the Four Kings and Four Queens, were ſeen in all their Pomp, beſides the King and his Bride, yet he was obſerved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel them all in Bravery) had ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible an Operation on the Lords of <hi>England,</hi> that when <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> expected to be Crown'd, in the preſence of many Princes, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons, they boldly went to him and briskly told him, how haynouſly he had tranſgreſſed his Fathers Will in recalling <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> to which ſince they were Cautioners; they would
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57753:25"/>
ſee it performed; and unleſs he would remove <hi>Gaveſton</hi> from Court and Kingdom, they would not ſuffer his Coronotion to proceed. King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> confounded with this ſtinging Declaration, gave them ſatisfaction, and ſolmnly Swore to do what they deſired, in the next Parliment, and ſo the Coronation proceeded: In the ſolmnizing whereof the King again provoked the Lords to Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, adding the honour of carrying St. <hi>Edwards</hi> Crown before him, to the other Titles he had conferred on <hi>Gaveſton;</hi> which urged them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Conſultation, how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſome plauſible way to reſtrain the Violence of the Kings Affection which in a ſhort time took affect. For <hi>Gaveſton</hi> not content to engroſs the Kings Favor, and dictate his arbitrary Orders through the Kingdom, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached on the honour of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and placed opprobious Nick-Names 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57753:26"/>
upon divers of them, who therefore did not only envy him for his undeſerved Advancement, but mortally hated him for his un-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſolency. It was not long before a Parliment met, who unanimouſly preſs the King to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Remedy to their Greivances in the Rere of which they urge the Baniſhment of <hi>Gaveſton:</hi> The King ſeing no ſafety in expoſtulation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to their Demands, and the ſeveral Articles (like thoſe of the Council of <hi>Trent)</hi> are injoyn'd under an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, and pain of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Hereupon <hi>Gaveſton</hi> was ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but as the Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overnour, not as an Exile; where after he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57753:26"/>
Earl of <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> but <hi>Gaveſton</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible, his Power exceeded all Limits, and his expences all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſupply; the Kings Revenue was waſted, the Queens maintenance retrenched, and all diverted to the <hi>accommodating</hi> the Luxury of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite. The Lords began to ferment in a new <hi>Diſcontentment,</hi> and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King, poſitively told him, if he did not immediately remove <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſton</hi> out of the Court and Kingdom they would riſe in Arms againſt him, as a perjur'd King. But he, after he had ſtrugled a while between Love and Fear, condeſcended to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Baniſhment, making his return a capital Offence, and ſo to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt, if ever found in the Kingdom. <hi>Gaveſton</hi> once more is diſpatcht out of <hi>England,</hi> and goes to <hi>France,</hi> where finding no ſafe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, he paſt into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and there meeting with no ſecure ſhelter, he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57753:27"/>
ſecretly returns to <hi>England,</hi> relying on the immovable Favor of the King, and the intereſt of the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi> The bewitched King received him with tranſports of joy, and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of the ſight of the Lords, and all other Obſervers, betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>York,</hi> carrying his beloved Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. The Lords hearing of it, make after him, and chooſing the great and potent Earl of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> for their General, ſent a Meſſage to the King to deliver <hi>Gaveston</hi> into their Hands, or at leaſt to ſend him peremptorily out of the Kingdom. But being abuſed by evil Counſel, and diſregarding the Meſſage from the Lords, he marcht from place to place, ſeeking a ſure refuge for his dear Favourite, refuſing to ſtay with the Queen, who with tears beg'd his company, and lodg'd him in <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough-Caſtle;</hi> which being furiouſly aſſaulted by the Confederate Lords,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57753:27"/>
                  <hi>Gaveſton</hi> thought it beſt to render himſelf, deſiring only the favour to be allow'd once to ſee the King's face, and the King reciprocally ask'd the ſame. <hi>Gaveſton</hi> was ſent under a Convoy toward <hi>Wallingford,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intercepted by the way, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from his Guard by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> after long deliberation his Head was ſtruck off at a place call'd <hi>Blacklow.</hi> In the mean time the King of <hi>Scots</hi> taking notice in how unready a poſture Affaires were in <hi>England,</hi> how the King remitted all caſe of the Government to <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> and that he gave himſelf up to Luxury and Licentiouſneſs, in a ſhort time, and with little or no oppoſition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced almoſt all <hi>Scotland</hi> to his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and encouraged by that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. He entred <hi>England,</hi> burnt, and took ſeveral Towns, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd with a ſplendid Army rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by King <hi>Edward,</hi> more reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

a Court, than a Camp, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a hundred thouſand men; he with an Army hardly amounting to thirty thouſand, utterly overthrew and defeated them. This misfortune was follow'd by the loſs of almoſt all <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the treacherous Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Berwick,</hi> which yet King <hi>Edward</hi> was in a fair way to recover, had not the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his immoderate kindneſs to <hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> the younger, (whom he had ſubſtituted and embraced in the room of <hi>Gaveſton)</hi> and thereupon withdrew his forces from his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Theſe Croſſes were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the loſs of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whereof all the Towns were taken, or burnt by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and an incredible number of Priſoners and Cattel carried into <hi>Scotland;</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> in vain attempting to ſeek a Reprizal, and at laſt forced to paſs over all hopes of ſatisfaction, by the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57753:28"/>
concluſion of a Truce. The unhappy King poſtponing the affections of his Subjects to the fond love of a Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, advanced <hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> to the higheſt pitch of Honour and Favour, committed all Affairs to his ſole Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; he (in perfect imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Predeceſſor) ſervilely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the Kings Humours, and arrogantly inſulting over the Lords. They to remove this inſupportable Nuſance, continue in Arms, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate together, and ſend a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Meſſage to the King, requiring the confirmation and execution of the Articles formerly granted, otherwiſe threatning to conſtrain him by force of Arms, and accordingly aſſembled a mighty body about <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> where the King then lay; but by the interpoſition of the Prelates, an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation was made, and all things agreed to their mutual ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Soon after a Parliament was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57753:29"/>
call'd, wherein the King complain'd that the Lords had taken up Arms, had murthered <hi>Pierce Gaveſton,</hi> and done him many other Affronts; they on the other ſide juſtifie their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as not undertaken againſt, but for the Preſervation of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the puniſhment of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemies of the Kingdom; but the Queen, with the Prelates and the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> found an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to qualifie theſe heats; the Lords became humble Suitors to the King for his Grace and Pardon, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them kindly, as dutiful and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects. But this Reconcilement not being founded in ſincerity, was but of a ſhort duration: The two <hi>Spencers,</hi> Father and Son, became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable in their Covetouſneſs, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and Arbitrary diſpoſal of all Affairs; wherefore the Earl of <hi>Lancaster</hi> with divers other Lords, entred into a new Confederacy, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57753:29"/>
themſelves by Oath to live and die together, in the maintenance of the Rights of the Kingdom, and to procure the expulſion of the two <hi>Spencers.</hi> In purſuance hereof, they gather a great Army, march to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and inſiſt ſtoutly on their former demands; to which once more the King is induced to condeſcend, by the mediation of the Queen and the Prelates, and by publick Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the <hi>Spencers</hi> are baniſhed; but in a ſhort time after the Edict was revoked, they recall'd, and reſtored to their former place and authority.

                  </gap>gan now to change, and by a ſtrange <hi>caprichio</hi> of fortune, the King got the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over the mutinous Lords, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered them in Battel, ſlew many of them in the Field, and put many to death, by the Sword of Juſtice; but ſo ſoon as the heat of Revenge was a little qualify'd, repented of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>

Hitherto the miſerable King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived only ſlight wounds in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme parts of his Body, now he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſtab at the Heart. The Queen enraged to ſee her Husbands love diverted upon upſtart Favorites, and diſdaining to be a Penſioner to their pleaſure, found a plauſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to repair into <hi>France,</hi> where (to be revenged on her Husband for his neglect of her) ſhe continued in too ſcandalous a familiarity with the Lord <hi>Mortimer.</hi> The King being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it, commanded her to return, and ſhe delaying to come, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed her, and the Prince (who was at that time alſo in <hi>France)</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Kingdom, baniſh'd them and their Adherents, and ſtrongly guarded the Seas with three Fleets, to intercept their paſſage. The Queen by the help of Foreign Friends, got together a conſiderable Army, and landed near <hi>Harwich,</hi> and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57753:30"/>
reinforced by the conjunction of the Earl Marſhal, the Earl of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and many other Lords and Biſhops. The King was aſtoniſh'd at the News, being utterly irreſolute what courſe to take: He had <hi>no Counſellors</hi> about him, but the <hi>Spencers,</hi> London <hi>was not to be truſted, his Army was waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the people from all Counties flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to the Queen.</hi> In this perplexity he ſecretly <hi>withdraws from the Court,</hi> attended by the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> and a very few others, and being diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his Retreat to the Iſle of <hi>Lundy,</hi> He <hi>hides himſelf</hi> in the Abby of <hi>Nethe;</hi> where within a ſhort time he was <hi>taken,</hi> his Followers all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and the two <hi>Spencers</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and ignominiouſly executed, and himſelf committed to the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> After <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> a Parliament was call'd, wherein it was agreed to Depoſe the

King, and ſet up his Son, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to take the Crown, unleſs his Father would freely reſign it, the poor King as tamely ſurrender'd the Scepter, as he had before unworthily weilded it, and having formally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and <hi>abdicated the Government,</hi> and the Speaker of the Parliament, renounced all Allegiance to him, in the Name of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he was taken from the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (from whom his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thought <hi>he had too kind uſage)</hi> and being hurried from place to place, and wearied with all manner of ſeverity and indignity, waſted by ſtarving, tormented by noiſome ſtinks, and attempted by Poyſon, he was at laſt barbarouſly and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely ſtifled to death between two Pillows.

               <p>IF Magnanimity, Valour, Piety, Gentleneſs, Liberty, and other Heroick and Princely Qualities, were communicable by Generation: if vertue could be intayl'd; If the gifts of the mind deſcended by Inheritance, or were demiſable hy Will, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably annex'd to the Body; no man could ever have a juſter Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion to Glory and Fame, than <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the Second,</hi> the only Son of that incomparable Hero, <hi>Edward the black Prince,</hi> and grand Son of that moſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57753:32"/>
illuſtrious and victorious <hi>Edward the Third.</hi> But Children do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reſemble the Features of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the great ſhame and ſcandal of the Mother: Wit, and Vigor are ſeated in the Brain; and Children are not begotten by the Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> was a Child at the death of his Father; and never acted like a man, during his own Life. A Crown was too heavy a Load for his tender Brows, and the Reflection of its Brightneſs daizled his Eyes.</p>
               <p>The Tranſactions of State, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Minority, are not to be the Subject of my Recital, ſince the Event of all Affairs that were proſperous, is to be imputed to the Conduct of his Guardians; and where any Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents interrupted his Proſperity, it ought not to be attributed to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. I ſhall therefore paſs over ſuch Occurrences as are recounted by Hiſtorians, during his pupillage;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57753:32"/>
and begin my Remarks, at that Period when he aſſumed the Regal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And firſt he depoſed the Lord <hi>Scroop</hi> from his Chancellor-Ship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he refuſed to ſeal ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant grants made by the King, and receiving the Seal from his Hands, he kept it for a certain Time, and with it ſeal'd ſuch Grants and Writings as he thought fit, at his own abſolute will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>His Army ſent againſt <hi>France,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> was not very proſperous; but laying Seige to <hi>Ypres,</hi> as they paſt through <hi>Flanders,</hi> were forced by the Power of a <hi>French</hi> Army coming to their Relief, to raiſe the Seige, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. And tho the Biſhop adviſed the King to lay hold on that Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to try the Fortune of a Battle with the <hi>French,</hi> and he pretended over Night to be in a mighty haſt and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57753:33"/>
Eagerneſs to ingage in that enterpriſe, yet in the Morning the Humor was off, and conſulting his own eaſe and ſafety, he appointed the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to go on that Inployment, who ſpinning out the Time with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Preparations, till the Biſhop was return'd, the Project was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the undertaking came to Nothing; and the Diſpute was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſhort lived Truce.</p>
               <p>Neither did the Expedition into <hi>Scotland,</hi> tend to the Honour of the King, or Advantage of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: for the <hi>Scots</hi> having made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions into <hi>England,</hi> taken, and burnt divers Towns upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and enriched themſelves by a general depredation of the Country. The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was diſpatcht with a mighty Army to repreſs them: but having entred <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able by any Art, or Stratagem to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57753:33"/>
provoke the Scots to Battel, they returned without obtaining any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satisfaction, then a ſuitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in burning, and deſtroying many Towns there. And tho a truce was made with the <hi>Scots;</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Regard to the Stipulation, they again entred the Borders, and took <hi>Berwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the unfortunate King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to form Plots againſt his own honour and Quiet; for being incenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon real, or upon imaginary Provocations) a deſign was laid to have that great man Arreſted, and arraign'd of Treaſon before Sir <hi>Robert Treſilian,</hi> chief Juſtice (tho by the Law of the Land his Tryal ought to have been by his <hi>Peers)</hi> and it is eaſie to imagin what would have been the Iſſue of ſuch irregular Proceedings: but the Duke having timely intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miſchief and contrivance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57753:34"/>
againſt him; withdrew himſelf op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely to his Caſtle of <hi>Pomfret,</hi> where he ſtood upon his guard, till by the laborious travel and powerful interceſſion of the Kings Mother (tho by reaſon of her Corpulency ſhe was moſt un-fit for ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment) the King was pacified, and reconciled to the Duke.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> ſtill meditating Revenge and the <hi>French</hi> King ſtill ready to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the quarrel, prepared for a freſh Invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> and receiving auxiliary Ayds of great Number and ſtrength from the <hi>French,</hi> once more entred the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Borders. King <hi>Richard</hi> receiving Advertiſement of it, with great Speed rais'd a mighty Army, and marching in Perſon at the Head of them, entered <hi>Scotland,</hi> burnt <hi>Edingburgh</hi> proceeding without Control, but could by no means draw the <hi>Scots</hi> to Battle; they in the mean Time to divert the Kings progreſs,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57753:34"/>
made a deſcent into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and Beſieged <hi>Carliſle;</hi> to the relief of which the King approaching with ſo formidable an Army, obliged the <hi>Scots</hi> to retreat into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and upon their Receſs the King returned into <hi>England,</hi> bringing with him neither Honour nor Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by ſo fruitleſs an Expedition.</p>
               <p>After theſe things (and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages not ſo directly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Hiſtory of his Life) King <hi>Richard</hi> began to haſten his own Deſtiny, and by Imprudent Actions, pernicious Counſels, <hi>and an Arbitrary Aſſertion of his indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Prerogative,</hi> to kindle thoſe Flames of Mutiny, and Diſcontent, which never were extinguiſh'd, but at the Expence of his own Blood, and the Loſs of his Crown. <hi>Robert Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> and Marquiſs of <hi>Dublin</hi> was his Darling, and <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> was his Favorite: The firſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57753:35"/>
a Gentleman of commendable good Parts, he created Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> (tho he himſelf was but Lord of it) the other a man of mean extraction, he made Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of <hi>England;</hi> both very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, and not accompliſh'd with ſuch Merits, as might advance them in Titles, or Offices beyond the Ancient Nobility, without Envy, or Obloquy. Theſe Wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors ſet a falſe Glaſs before the ſhort ſighted King, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed him with erroneous repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his own ſufficiency, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Authority,</hi> and uncontrollable Power: Inſomuch that in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then call'd, the King began ſharply to expoſtulate with the Lords, and by an undecent Compariſon with the Freedom of their Tenures, to Challenge to himſelf an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable liberty. This haughty Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the King, exaſperated the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57753:35"/>
Parliament, and fermented them to ſuch a degree of diſſatisfaction, that inſtead of conſenting to grant him a Subſidy toward his Wars, they fell foul upon the <hi>New Chancellour,</hi> and never gave him over, till they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a ſevere Judgment againſt him to the <hi>Forfeitures</hi> of his Life, and the <hi>Confiſcation</hi> of his Eſtate. The adverſe Party were highly net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at theſe proceedings, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puſh'd on by Revenge, and Malice, they combined in a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Deſign to Murther the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and ſuch other Lords as croſs'd the King in his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Courſes; which Flagitious Plot was to be perpetrated upon an invitation of them to a Supper in <hi>London:</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Lord Mayor was a prime In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in this Enterpriſe; but the King imparting this matter to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Exton</hi> the preſent Mayor, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57753:36"/>
endeavouring to make him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice in the Action, he would by no perſwaſions be induced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſo vile an Attempt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they deſiſted from the further proſecution of it. Notwithſtanding this, and many other untoward paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, a Subſidy was granted to the King under certain Limitations; but the Parliament were ſo <hi>diſguſted;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King had <hi>reſpited</hi> the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Judgment</hi> againſt the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,</hi> that they poſitively declared, unleſs the Chancellour were removed they would proceed no farther in a Parliamentary Courſe. The King hereupon grew Cholerick, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told them, he would rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to the French King for Aſſiſtance, than ſubmit to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Yet upon good Reaſons offer'd by the Lords, a great change was made in the Miniſters of State, and particularly the <hi>Chancellour</hi> was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57753:36"/>
                  <hi>removed:</hi> and ſo deſirous were the Lords and Commons to have the Duke of <hi>Ireland excluded</hi> from the <hi>Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> that they were content he ſhould receive thirty Thouſand Marks, on condition he would tranſport himſelf into <hi>Ireland.</hi> But no ſooner was the Parliament diſſolved, but the King recanted all his condecenſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked all Orders againſt the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the reſt, and received then into higher Favour, than they were in before. And tho' the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Nottingham</hi> performed a Noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, hardly to be parallel'd in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, yet their Service was diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and their perſons ſlighted, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> gave them no countenance: By whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance a New Plot was laid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and the eaſie King ſurrounded with Paraſites and corrupt Judges, ſuffer'd them to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57753:37"/>
purſue their extravagant practices, and Two Thouſand <hi>Perſons</hi> were at once <hi>indicted</hi> before Sir <hi>Robert Treſilian the Chief Juſtice.</hi> He then <hi>propounded certain Queries</hi> to <hi>Robert Belknap</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice and other <hi>Judges,</hi> which they ſoon <hi>reſolved,</hi> in defiance <hi>of the Law,</hi> and the priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And notwithſtanding he ſtood in ſuch ill Terms with his people, yet a way was found <hi>to pack Juries</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Indictments</hi> were found of many Crimes <hi>againſt ſome of the Lords:</hi> Whom having a deſign to perſecute, he ſummon'd the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Juſtices, and Sheriffs of the Kingdom, that he might be informed, what power of Men they could aſſure him of, to ſerve him againſt the Lords: <hi>And intending ſhortly to call a Parliament,</hi> he <hi>tamper'd</hi> with them to have no <hi>Knight</hi> or <hi>Burgeſs</hi> choſen, but ſuch as the King and his <hi>Council</hi> ſhould <hi>Name.</hi> But finding by the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57753:37"/>
Anſwer of the Sheriffs, that they could not raiſe any Forces upon ſuch a pretence, nor infringe the Ancient <hi>Liberty in Elections</hi> to Parliament; the King and the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſent into all parts to raiſe men in this Quarrel againſt the Lords, conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on ſome Devices how to intrap them. The Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> being advertiſed of this, had a ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the reſt, and aſſembling a numerous Body of Men, ſtood upon their Guard, and ſent Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to the King, requiring ſuch Traytors and Seducers as were about his Perſon, to be delivered up to them. The King was adviſed by the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and others about him, to offer <hi>Calice</hi> to the French King, to procure his Aſſiſtance againſt the Lords; and with all ſent to the Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> requiring to make an eſtimate of how many able men might be rais'd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57753:38"/>
in the City, who making Tryal of what could be done on ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, received this Anſwer from the People, that <hi>they would never fight againſt the Kings Friends, and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Realm.</hi> In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> interpoſed with his advice, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the King to ſend for the Lords under ſafe Conduct, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expoſtulate with them; to which the Lords conſented, upon Oath given by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that no Fraud, or evil practice ſhould be uſed againſt them: But being ready to come according to appointment, they received intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Ambuſh laid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap them, and ſo deſiſted. If the King was privy to this Plot, he was guilty of an Action moſt unworthy of a Prince: But the Conſpirators were certainly known, yet not call'd
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57753:38"/>
to Account for it. After this, upon a more ſecure Conduct from the King, the Lords preſented themſelves before him, and after ſome cholerick conteſt a Reconciliation was made, and it was concluded that all matters ſhould be heard and regulated in a Parliament, ſpeedily to be call'd. Hereupon the Favorite-Lords were highly diſſatisfy'd, and plainly told the King, they would not hazard their appearance at ſuch a meeting; and ſo the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the reſt of that Faction withdrew from Court, and abſconded. But the King not able to brook their abſence, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an Army to be rais'd for the ſafeguard of the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to reconduct him to his Preſence; who being encounter'd on the way by the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> he fled and eſcaped by leaping into a River, but after two or three years dy'd miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably in a foreign Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57753:39"/>
And now the Lords, having got matter enough againſt the King, at leaſt to juſtifie their taking up Armes, march'd directly to <hi>London</hi> with forty thouſand men, and ſome of them going to the King in the <hi>Tower,</hi> they ſhew'd him <hi>the very Letter</hi> which <hi>he had writ</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Ireland, to levy an Army</hi> for their deſtruction; as alſo <hi>the Letters writ to him by the</hi> French <hi>King,</hi> importing a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct for him to come into <hi>France,</hi> there to do Acts tending to his own diſhonour, and the prejudice of the Kingdom; which being done, they civilly retreated, upon the Kings <hi>promiſe to come next day to</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, to concert all matters; but <hi>the fickle King alter'd his mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went to Bed,</hi> and diſcover'd his purpoſe to avoid the meeting next day. The Lords being advertis'd of this, ſent a peremptory meſſage to him, That if he did not come accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57753:39"/>
to his promiſe, they would chooſe another King, that ſhould hearken to the faithful Counſel of his Lords. The King ſenſibly touch'd with this ſharp meſſage, gave them a meeting, and they poſitively inſiſting that the Traytors ſo often complain'd of, ſhould be removed from the Court, he at laſt with much reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy conſented to their Deſires, and ſo the whole Neſt of Vipers was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated, ſome expell'd the Court, ſome bound by good Sureties to appear and anſwer, and ſome committed to Priſon. When the Parliament met, they proceeded roundly, the <hi>corrupt Judges were arreſted</hi> in their Seats of Judicature, and carried <hi>to the Tower,</hi> for acting contrary to the Agreement made in the preceding Parliament; the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the reſt of that Crew, cited to appear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to certain Articles of High Treaſon, and for non-appearance
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57753:40"/>
baniſh'd, and their Lands and Goods ſeized to the Kings uſe; Sir <hi>Robert Treſilian</hi> was hang'd, Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember</hi> beheaded, ſeveral others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, and the Judges condemned to die, and the King obliged by Oath to ſtand to ſuch order as the Lords ſhould ſet down. Some years after, upon a Riot committed in <hi>London,</hi> the King ſeiſed on their Liberties, and took away their Charter, which could not be reſtored till they paid a Fine of ten thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>I intend a compendious Abſtract, and not a compleat Hiſtory; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſtudiouſly omit the recital of many Tranſactions and Occurrences coincident with this relation, as not having a direct and principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in the Eſtate and Life of King <hi>Richard.</hi> Unſtable Fortune had the Aſcendent over all the Affairs of the poor King, and the courſe of his Reign was imbroiled with a ſtrange
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57753:40"/>
Viciſſitude of proſperous and adverſe Accidents. The Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and other Lords, entring into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination to ſeiſe upon the King, the Plot was detected, and their lives taken away for the aſſurance of his ſafety. A Parliament was call'd, wholly conformable to the Kings will, they that oppoſed him were baniſh'd, confiſcated, and executed, and the whole power of it devolved on a certain ſelect number of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, to the great prejudice of the State, and a dangerous example to future Times: a Pardon was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all the Subjects, except fifty, whoſe Names not being expreſſed, he kept the Nobility under an awe, that if any of them offended him, they might come under the notion of exempted perſons; and thus the King ſeem'd ſecure againſt all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57753:41"/>
But an unforeſeen Accident, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on a very ſlight occaſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an extraordinàry Revolution, by which the whole frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was unhinged, and that <hi>Cloud which at firſt appear'd but of the bigneſs of a hand,</hi> ſoon overſpread the <hi>sky,</hi> and diſſolved in a tempeſtuous <hi>ſhower</hi> of Blood. The Duke of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> was baniſh'd the Kingdom for ſix years, and ſeveral Perſons of Note and Quality, either by voluntary withdrawing, or a compulſory Exile, went beyond the Seas. The Duke within a ſhort time was advertis'd that his Father was dead (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he became Duke of <hi>Lancaſter)</hi> and that King <hi>Richard</hi> had ſeiſed into his hands all the Eſtate deſcended to him by his Fathers death. And meeting often with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> then in Exile, and mutually la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the deplorable condition of <hi>England,</hi> the enormous actions of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57753:41"/>
King, and the Impoſſibllity of ever reclaiming him; they began to enter into Conſulation, by what means beſt to get him removed; and in the very Nick, Solicitations came from ſeveral Parts of <hi>England</hi> to urge the Duke to haſten over, and to take the Government upon him, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all ready <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> to that work The Duke preſently graſp'd the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and without further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation prepared for his Return, and with a very few Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and about threeſcore Perſons preſently put to Sea, and landed in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> which was no ſooner known but ſeveral <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>great Numbers of the Gentry and Common ſort,</hi> flockt into him. And tho he was <hi>invited</hi> to come and take the <hi>Government</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, yet he pretended no other cauſe, but to take Poſſeſſion of the Inheritance, deſcended from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and moſt unjuſtly ſeized and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57753:42"/>
detain'd by King <hi>Richard. His For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces increaſed dayly,</hi> and a mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was got together, and all the <hi>Kings Caſtles forthwith ſurrendred to him,</hi> many of the Kings <hi>Friends</hi> were Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, and ſome put to death. All this while King <hi>Richard</hi> was in <hi>Ireland</hi> and for ſix weeks (by reaſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds) had no Notice of the Dukes Landing: After which time waſting many daies in a dilatory Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, he landed in <hi>Wales;</hi> but hearing that all the Caſtles from the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> were delivered up to the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> that the greateſt Part of the <hi>Nobility and Commons</hi> were <hi>joynd</hi> with him, and his principal Counſellors taken and executed; he fell into abſolute Deſpair, <hi>diſmiſſed his Army,</hi> bidding every one to ſhift for himſelf, and the next Night ſtole away, and got to the Caſtle of <hi>Couwey.</hi> The Duke proceeded on his March, and every
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57753:42"/>
day ſome <hi>Lords and Gentlemen</hi> of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count came in to him, and having proferred Conditions to the King with which he ſeem'd to be content he agreed to meet the Duke, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Journy was ſeiſ'd by an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh laid for him, and carried to Flint-Caſtle. Thither the Duke came, and carri'd the King with him by eaſie Journeys, to <hi>London,</hi> and the next Day lodged him in the Tower. Preſently a Parliament was called by the Duke, but in the Name of King <hi>Richard,</hi> aad many heynous <hi>Crimes laid to his Charge,</hi> ingroſt and ſum'd up in three and thirty Articles for which the Parliament adjudg'd him to be depoſed from all Kingly Honour, and Princely Government; thereupon the King by a formal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument made a Solemn Reſignation of his Crown and Authority, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it his Requeſt that the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> might be his Succeſſor, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57753:43"/>
in token thereof taking the ſignet from his Finger and puting it upon that of the Dukes: Which being reported to the Parliament, they approved of it and appointed the Sentence of his Depoſition to be publickly proclam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>We have followed this moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Prince to the laſt Scene of his Life; but the manner of his death is ſo variouſly reported, that it is hard to pitch upon that Author, on whoſe credit we may ſafely rely. It is moſt certain that he did not long Survive his Reſignation, but being carried to <hi>Leeds,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> ſoon after a Period was put to his Life, and Miſeryes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the three and thirtieth year of his Age.</p>
               <p>If he did not imitate, his Father; yet he reſembled His Mother, and was the Goodlieſt Perſon alive. His <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> was good; but corrupted
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57753:43"/>
by <hi>Education,</hi> his <hi>Inclinations</hi> prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to Vertue, but were pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Flatterrers,</hi> and <hi>Evil Counſellors.</hi> Crafty men made Advantage of his <hi>Credulity;</hi> and he was ruined by too ſtrict a <hi>Constancy.</hi> If he had not been deficient to himſelf; his Oppoſer had not ſo eaſily prevail'd, his <hi>Timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> apeared in not fighting for his Crown, his <hi>Moderation</hi> in the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of it, and his <hi>Courage</hi> in ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Loſs.</p>

               <p>IAm now ingaged in a difficult Task, divided between Truth and Reſpect, being to deſcribe the Life of a Prince, who (contrary to the cuſtom of the World) was better ſpoken of <hi>while he lived,</hi> than he has been <hi>ſince his Death.</hi> His Fame had ſuffer'd a great dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution by ſucceeding ſo admirable a <hi>Father;</hi> had it not recover'd by the proſpect of ſuch a <hi>Brother,</hi> who was to be his Succeſſor. If in the Lives of former Kings any miſtake was committed, the Records and Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57753:44"/>
Writers muſt vouch the Relation, and the preſent Age cannot confute it: But to give an Account of a Life ſo lately ended, requires an exactneſs beyond my Reach, wherein the leaſt Trip overthrows the Credit of the Reporter. To enumerate the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a Prince, without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Failings, is but to flatter his memory, and deceive Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; to reckon up his Vices, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermingling the mention of his laudable Actions, is but ſo ſully his Fame, and deduce no Benefit to the Curioſity of Obſervers. I reſolve to tread lightly on his Grave, and not preſs too hard upon the Heels of Truth. I may purſue my Topic, in recounting the Inſtances which juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denominate him <hi>unfortunate,</hi> and Note the Errors of his <hi>Government,</hi> without reflection on his <hi>Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he was of extraordinary Parts, that he had a quick mercurial
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57753:45"/>
Wit, a great inſight into the liberal Sciences, and even the mechanical Arts no man will deny: He had a piercing, if not a ſolid Judgment, his intellect was comprehenſive, if not profound.</p>
               <p>His Lenity and Clemency were very conſpicuous, and recommended him to the Love, and Praiſe of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators; yet it ſo fell out, that ſuch egregious Acts of Severity and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were exerciſed upon all ſorts of men, as will puzzle Poſterity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the meaning.</p>
               <p>In his time no Man had the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſet a Value on himſelf for any promotion, nor no man had cauſe to deſpair of a preferment: The Cards were daily ſhuffled, and unexpected chance turn'd up the Trump.</p>
               <p>Upon all occaſions he profeſt a great Zeal for the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet every day that profeſſion loſt ground. Popery was not allow'd
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57753:45"/>
yet it hover'd among us: The Frogs did not cover the Land, yet the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical Vermin ſwarm'd in every Corner: Tho' the Papiſts were not ſhelter'd by a legal <hi>Indemnity,</hi> yet they grew numerous and confident upon the expectation of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching <hi>Jublie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Brother and Succeſſour had a mighty Aſcendent over his Genius, catching at all opportunities to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Ambition, and propagate the Faith; while the other indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in pleaſure, and avoided the fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of Government.</p>
               <p>There are ſo many living Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his <hi>Incontinency,</hi> that if I forbear to mention it, I ſhall render the Truth and Impartiality of my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remarks ſuſpected. It is uſual with Kings and Princes to proſecute prohibited Amours, but ſo great was his generoſity, that he thought it a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragment to manage a <hi>ſecret Intrigue.</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57753:46"/>
His Liberality was ſo extraordinary, that he ſpared not to give a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years purchaſe for a <hi>Moments Fruition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He loſt the <hi>Love of his Friends,</hi> by too fond <hi>a Love of his Brother;</hi> and by too ſtiff a Refuſal to conſent to his Excluſion, he endanger'd the Intereſt of his Family, and gave a ſhock to Monarchy it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The firſt and greateſt misfortune that befell <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was, the Cruel and Ignominious Death of his Father, that incomparable <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, Sentenced to die, and publickly Executed before his own Palace, by a Jancto of flagitious men, garbled out of a Parliament by the Uſurper. From his Fathers Martyrdom to his own Reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was one continued Scene of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and ſorrow. In the year 1648 <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was deprived of Life by his <hi>Evil Subjests,</hi> his <hi>Friends</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57753:46"/>
on, and not able to prevent it: In the year 1660. <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was brought to the Throne by his <hi>Good Subjects,</hi> his <hi>Enemies</hi> looking on, and not able to hinder it: The one an inhumane Action, and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd; the other wholly ſurpriſing, and miraculous: In the one no <hi>Blood</hi> ſhed, but that of the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; in the other not one Drop of Blood drawn, even of the meaneſt <hi>Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, and ſucceeded imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Right of three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but did not actually poſſeſs them for many years. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a King truly <hi>unfortunate!</hi> His Father barbarouſly deſtroy'd, and he in no capacity to call to account the bloody Actors of that Tragedy; three potent Kingdoms uſurped by violence, and by force detain'd from him, and he not able to put in a claim
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57753:47"/>
for his Right, or contend for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: His Enemies inſulting in their ſucceſs, abjuring his Title, and metamorphoſing a glorious Monarchy into an Anarchical Commonwealth: His Friends haraſſed, impriſon'd, plunder'd, ſequeſtred, executed, no man daring to own his Allegiance, or capable to contribute advice or aid toward his Reſtoration: Himſelf a deſerted Exile, wandring from one Princes Court to another to ſeek for ſhelter and ſubſiſtence; while the ſubtle machinations of the Uſurpers did not more ſenſibly aggravate, and advance his unhappineſs, than the improſperous Attempts of his loyal Subjects to compaſs his Reſtitution. In <hi>Scotland</hi> the Heroick Acts of the moſt renown'd Marquis of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> (who with an inconſiderable handful of men traverſed the Kingdom, and performed ſuch Exploits, as may juſtly denominate his Hiſtory the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral 
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57753:47"/>
of a Romance)</hi> only ended in his deſtruction, while he became a <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> to his Enemies implacable malice, and a <hi>glorious Martyr</hi> for Loyalty, but with an irreparable detriment to his Maſters cauſe. In <hi>Ireland</hi> the moſt Noble Duke (then Marquis) of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was ſo ſucceſsful in his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, that he had reduced the whole Kingdom to the obedience of the King, except <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>London-Derry,</hi> to the firſt of which having laid a cloſe Siege, and beleagured it with a Royal Camp, he was diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd by a fatal Sally from the Town, his Army totally routed, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to a haſty and hazardous eſcape; which diſaſter was follow'd by the Rendition of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and many other conſiderable Towns, and after a faint Reſiſtance the whole Kingdom was ſubjected to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Conqueror, and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the King wholly extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57753:48"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> was ſo manacled with the Chains of an armed Power, that they could not budge; the Royal Party, than call'd the Cavaliers, were debar'd the liberty of meeting at home, or ſtirring abroad, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were diſarm'd, their Houſes ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſackt, and their Eſtates brought into the unmerciful Inquiſition at <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths</hi> Hall; in ſome corners of the Land ſmall Parties ſtarted up now and then to exert their Loyalty, and manifeſt their Allegiance, and the King was received into the Iſland of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> but by a Fleet ſent thither by the Uſurping power, ſoon compell'd to forſake it; ſo that theſe weak ſtruglings like the laſt efforts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tended only to diminiſh the number of the Kings Friends, and to heighten his <hi>Infelicity.</hi> In the year 1650, the King was invited into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> landed there ſafely, received with all the demonſtrations of joy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57753:48"/>
and ſatisfaction, and ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King. But to diſturb his Tranquillity, and interrupt the calm fruition of his new acquired Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, <hi>Cromwell</hi> (that victorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, who in the ſpace of one year had reduced almoſt all the Garriſons in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar-like</hi> made a compleat conqueſt of that Kingdom only by walking through it) is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht into <hi>Scotland,</hi> who in <hi>July</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that Country with an Army of ſixteen thouſand men effective; the <hi>Scots</hi> were not idle on their ſide, but form'd an Army conſiſting of ſix thouſand Horſe and Dragoons, and fifteen thouſand Foot, a party of whom attempting to beat up the Enemies Quarters about <hi>Muſleburgh,</hi> ſurpriſed the Out guards, and routed the firſt Regiment that oppoſed them, but were ſo warmly received by the reſt, that the Commander being wounded, the whole party was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd, 
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57753:49"/>
and purſu'd to the Army, and the whole Camp in danger of a ſurpriſal, had not the King himſelf unexpectedly appear'd in perſon, and ſtemm'd the Torrent. But in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following hapned a fatal deciſion of the diſpute at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where the <hi>Scots</hi> Army reinforced to above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand men, and preſuming on a certain Victory (having incloſed their Enemies beyond a probability of an eſcape) encountred the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, then decreaſed to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twelve thouſand, and with much courage and gallantry charged them; but the hand of God was in it, their whole Army was routed, four thouſand ſlain, and nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand taken Priſoners, with the loſs of three hundred on the Invaders ſide: After which the Kings Intereſt in <hi>Scotland</hi> declined daily, the Enemy getting advantage by the Diſſention between the Court and the Kirk-party,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57753:49"/>
and <hi>Cromwel</hi> by ſpringing of Mines (but more by corrupting the Governour with money) had <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh-Caſtle</hi> ſurrendred to him, the taking of which was follow'd with the loſs of many more Garriſons. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Scots</hi> were neither daunted in their Courage, nor defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in their Allegiance, but proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Coronation of the King, and he to the calling of a Parliament, and having got together a good Body of an Army, it was thought beſt that the King ſhould give <hi>Cromwell</hi> the ſlip, and make a ſudden deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> leaving him to take his ſwing and range through <hi>Scotland;</hi> to make this Enterpriſe the more hopeful, the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> and many other Loyal perſons began to peep out of their Receſſes, and to uſe all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to joyn; but <hi>a malignant Conſtellation ſtill influenced K.</hi> Charles <hi>his Affairs,</hi> ſome of his Abettors were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57753:50"/>
intercepted, ſome routed, and the Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> diſcomfited, and many Perſons of Quality and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution taken Priſoners. At laſt came on the diſmal Ingagement at <hi>Worſter,</hi> that critical <hi>Arbiter</hi> of the Kings cauſe, from whence we may date the depreſſion of the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, the exaltation of Anarchy, and Confuſion of Governments. I take no Pleaſure in deſcanting too long on ſo unpleaſant a Theme; in a word the King was defeted, his whole Army given up to death, or captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, except a very few, with whom he made his Eſcape, and after ſome weeks ſpent in lurking, diſguiſing, ſhifting, and un-eaſy travelling, he arrived ſafe in <hi>France.</hi> The King was now actually deveſted of his three Kingdoms, his Enemies victorious, in Poſſeſſion of his Right, and uſurping the Regal Authority, under the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of other Appellations: &amp; how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57753:50"/>
the grand <hi>Apoſtates</hi> from Loyalty dayly crumbled into Factions, and Diviſions, and the Supream Authority frequently changed its Dreſs, and put on a new Face; yet all concur'd in the deteſtation of King-Ship, and an abjuring the Family of <hi>Stuart.</hi> To recount the tranſactions of the <hi>Junto</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> or the Exploits of their Legions, through all the Dominions ſubjected to the Common wealth of <hi>England,</hi> might prove a tollerable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for the Reader, but I have no Inclination to admire their Policy, or cry up the Fame of the Protector: My Buſineſs is to obſerve the <hi>diſaſtrous Fate</hi> of an Exil'd King, and (there being yet no exact Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs tranſmitted to us of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Adventures) to Sum up <hi>his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune</hi> in a nine years Baniſhment, by noting how miſerably he was abandond', thurſt and kept out from the Poſſeſſion of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:57753:51"/>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all the Dominions and Territories belonging to them, a Penſioner to Strangers, and all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of his Friends at home, or his Allies abroad fruſtrated, and baffled.</p>
               <p>But when the Almighty Governor of the World had ſo long ſcourged the Royal Family, as to his wiſdom ſeem'd ſufficient, and all the Practices of human Strength and Invention were rendred ineffectual; in a ſudden and unexpected manner; without Means, without Contrivance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Succeſs of a Battle, or the operation of any Stratagem; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulican Babel was over turned, the King reſtored, and peaceably ſeated in the Throne of his Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>From his Reſtoration he Reign'd more than twenty four years, and I wiſh I could ſay happily. But not being bleſt with a legitimate Iſſue, he was continually teas'd with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of an impatient Heir:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57753:51"/>
Having miſapplied his Revenues (which were vaſtly increaſed beyond all that was given to his predeceſſors he was by his Neceſſities induced fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to call Parliaments, and by his evil Councils as often prompted to diſſolve them: his gentle Diſpoſition inclined him to an univerſal Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; but the malevolent Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſelf-intereſted men miſled him to a Connivence at extraordinary Severities: The Papiſts hated him for avowing ſo much Favor to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and Diſſenters blamed him for a ſuſpected Propenſion to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> His conſtitution was happy; but by his irregular cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he rais'd Batteries againſt his own Health, and he might have lived longer, if he had not lived ſo faſt. The Indowments of his mind were admirable; but his immerſion in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures over-ſhadow'd his Reputation: The prolonging of his Life had given
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57753:52"/>
an Adjournment to the Miſcheifs that quickly aſſaulted both Church, and State; but one Sort of Men thought he lived too long: whether any hand, but his own, contributed to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celarating of his Death, I have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to make any Aſſeveration; Let the future Writers of Hiſtory adjuſt that matter to the clear information of Poſterity. All I have to ſay, is the News of his Death was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before there was any Report of his Sickneſs: He died of an <hi>Apoplexy</hi> the Sixth of <hi>February</hi> 1684, and the whole Body (whereof he was the Head) was preſently ſeiſed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive <hi>Motions.</hi>

               <p>THE Reign of <hi>James</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was <hi>ſo lately begun,</hi> and (by the mercy of God) <hi>ſo ſoon deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,</hi> that every mans Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it may juſtly ſuperſede the Trouble of a Repetition. There needs no Art, nor Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World, that he was more unfortunate than all his Predeceſſors; and every impartial Obſerver will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he was the principal Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer, that ſapped the Foundations of his own <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he had arrived at the Throne by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57753:53"/>
an indirect Road: If he had gain'd it by Conqueſt, and ow'd his Title to the Umpirage of the Sword: If he had come in by Intruſion, Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Uſurpation; by Craft, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; by Force of Arms, or the prevalency of Penſions: If he had juſtled out the true Heir, or ſupplanted the lawful Pretender, or out-ſtript his Competitor by the aid of the people, or over-topt his Oppoſers by the Aſſiſtance of Foreigners: It had been no wonder, that the Crown had totter'd on his Head, that his Seat had been uneaſie, and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Short lived. But when his Title was not diſputed; when he was ſaluted King by an Univerſal Acclamation; welcom'd by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and congratulations of all his Subjects; his Revenues ſettled and augmented; his Enemies ſubdued, and his Throne eſtabliſh'd by a Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Parliament, and a ſubmiſſive peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57753:53"/>
his Ruin muſt neceſſarily be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to himſelf; and all his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes undeniably accounted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his own miſcarriage. So that while the Hiſtories of all Ages and Nations do abound with Examples of the Strange, Cruel, Falſe, and unnatural Methods uſed by ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men to gain principalities, King <hi>James</hi> muſt remain ſingle upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; as the only Perſon that will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and induſtriouſly dethron'd himſelf.

Fumes of Zeal, to attempt the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the general Religion current thro Three Kingdoms, eſtabliſh'd by Parliament, and incorporated ſo into the Laws, that the Religion of the Nation is the Law of the Nation; and to obtrude upon his Subjects a way of Worſhip as diſſonant from their Humour, as repugnant to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; a way exploded by the former Age, and deteſted by this; and ſo forſeit his Right to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown of Three opulent King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms upon a fallacious aſſurance of a Repriſal in Heaven; is ſuch a ſtupendious Act of ſupererogation, as may ſerve to ſupply half the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of Merit.</p>
               <p>On the Sixth day of <hi>February</hi> 1684 <hi>Charles</hi> the Second put off mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by his Death revived the Languiſhing Hopes of the Popiſh Expectants. He departed about

Noon, and in that very Afternoon <hi>James</hi> the Second was proclaim'd in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by Order of the Council: To convince the World, that howſoever the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment labour'd to Exclude him from Succeſſion by political Ordinances, and by a Courſe of Law; yet, that Deſign not being accompliſh'd, they would not ſo much as heſitate, or demur upon the right of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

News came to the King that the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> was Landed in the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> (an unſeaſonable Landing for that unhappy Gentleman! when the Parliament was Charm'd with the good Words, and amuſed by the great and gracious promiſes of the King) with a ſmall party, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day increaſing; who preſently were proclaim'd Traytors, and the King imparting the News to both Houſes, they forthwith in a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Loyalty reaſſure him that they will ſtand by him with their Lives and Fortunes againſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and all other his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and with an unuſual Expedition they paſt two Acts to augment his Revenue, by a New Impoſition on Wine, Vineger, Tobacco, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; and to ſecure his perſon, an Act of Attainder of the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> It was morally impoſſible
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57753:57"/>
for ſuch inconſiderable parties to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their purpoſes: the Parliaments in both Kingdoms were unanimous, almoſt all people relyed on the King's word, not doubting but he would continue a <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> tho he was not <hi>a Profeſſor.</hi> And ſo the event proved, for within a few days or weeks at moſt, the whole Enterpriſe came to nothing, the forces in each Kingdom were routed and diſperſed, the Duke and Earl both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners, and both executed on the Scaffold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Violent Hurricanes tear Trees out of the Ground; but the ſhaking of ſmall winds make the Tree take deeper Root; the quenching of an inteſtine Rebellion alway ſets the Prince ſome ſteps higher, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the ſubject as much.</hi> The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had now ſat long enough to do the Kings Buſineſs, and the King had Buſineſs to do not fit to be intruſted to the Parliament; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57753:57"/>
it was adjourn'd to the fourth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and from thence to the ninth of <hi>November.</hi> At which time being reaſſembled, the King made the firſt diſcovery of his claim to a <hi>diſpenſing Power,</hi> telling them plainly, that he will not want the Services of ſuch men whom he accounted faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but would imploy them in the Army, tho they were not qualified according to the late Teſts: The Parliament modeſtly and civilly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated this unexpected reſolution in an humble Addreſs, and propoſed an Expedient to moderate the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Law, purely to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Deſires of their Prince; but this did not ſound well in the Ears of the Court, ſome other meaſures muſt be taken, and ſo the Parliament was Prorogued to the tenth of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> and here we may bid them adieu, having after ſeveral Prorogations been diſſolved, as a company of inflexible
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57753:58"/>
ſtubborn Proteſtants, who would not tamely comply with the King's Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary pleaſure. Several Noblemen, and other perſons were now indicted and try'd for their Lives, ſome eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the merit of their ingenuous Defence, ſome were reſpited from Execution, and ſome ſuffer'd Death. The Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> was ſent Lord Lieutenant into <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants might be cajol'd into a laviſh credulity, till matters were ripe for their Deſtruction. An Army of twenty thouſand men was rais'd, and encamped at <hi>Hounſlow-Heath,</hi> becauſe the Militia was not found to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and the late Invaſions of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and <hi>Argyle</hi> were a ſufficient warning to the King not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken again unprovided. But the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of a Popiſh Chappel in the midſt of the Camp, and the open and daily celebration of the Maſs there, (together with the ſetting up
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57753:58"/>
Convents of Friers, and Schools, and Seminaries of Jeſuits in ſeveral places in <hi>London,</hi> the unclean Beaſts croſſing the Streets, and entring their Arkby couples) began to ſtartle the people; and the Diſpatch of the Earl of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlemain</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> as an Embaſſador to the Pope, and the entertaining a Nuncio from him, gave a mighty Umbrage of offence to all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men. That ſtrict Injunction by Law for every man that exerciſed any Office, to take the Oaths and Teſt, was a great <hi>Barricado</hi> againſt the Preferment of Catholick Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates; the Judges muſt be conſulted (or rather directed) how to apply ſome Remedy, and they to their eternal ſhame, made falſe Gloſſes on the Text, betray'd the Law, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Fortreſs of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and skrew'd up the Rules of a circumſcribed Monarchy to an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Deſpotick Government, to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57753:59"/>
command without controul; and <hi>to he obey'd without reſerve.</hi> But the putting a muzzle upon the old Laws to keep them from biting, was not enough to carry on the work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out introducing ſome Innovations; wherefore a Commiſſion was given to certain perſons to order all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Affairs, with an Authority and extent <hi>almoſt unlimited,</hi> and a <hi>Non-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante</hi> to all Rights and Priviledges. The firſt Eſſay made by this exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Court, was on the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (a perſon noble by Birth, and high in Office, reverenced, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by all men for his Candor, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and many eminent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) whom for a frivolous matter, without colour of Law or Reaſon, they ſuſpended from his Epiſcopal Function.</p>
               <p>It was now high time to recall the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Sword might
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57753:59"/>
be put into the Hands of the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel.</hi> To enumerate the miſchiefs that have accrew'd to the Proteſtants by his Adminiſtration, would require a Treatiſe by it ſelf; let it ſuffice to ſay, that in that miſerable Kingdom Popery was predominant, and bare faced Maſs-houſes ſet up in every Town and Village, the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons changed, their Charters condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all Offices Civil and Military conferr'd on Papiſts, the Act of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement (which the King had ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly promiſed to keep inviolated) infringed, and eluded, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men diſpoſſeſſed of their Eſtates by erroneous Judgments, the Proteſtants diſarm'd and diſmounted, ſuch as were able to remove forced to fly; and ſuch as ſtay'd behind ſubjected to all the Inſolencies and Barbarities of Slaves veſted with Authority.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Scotland</hi> ſtrict and ſevere Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were ſent to reſtrain all Field-Conventicles, 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57753:60"/>
and in <hi>England</hi> the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters were indicted, fined, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd. And yet within a ſhort time after, a <hi>general Indulgence</hi> was publiſh'd to all Perſwaſions, with a <hi>counterfeit ſaving</hi> to the Rights of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> the King being made to believe, that ſince he was ſecure from any Oppoſition from the Church of <hi>England</hi> (they lying quietly intrenched under the <hi>Blinds</hi> of <hi>Non-reſistance,</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience)</hi> if he could but caſt a miſt before the eyes of the Diſſenters, and muffle their hands, and charm them into a ſupine ſecurity; the deſired Reformation might proceed gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally without Interruption, and after a while the Doors might be open'd, and Popery let in with a full <hi>Breaſt.</hi> But they were groſly miſtaken in their Politicks: The illegal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> ſeconded by the Arbitrary and moſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57753:60"/>
unjuſt perſecution of the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the ejection of the Preſident and Fellows of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> Colledg in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion of profeſt Papiſts in their rooms, open'd the eyes of all ſorts, and quickly taught the Diſſenters what they were to expect (whoſe Toleration was Temporary and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious) when ſuch open Invaſions were made on that Church that was firmly eſtabliſh'd by Law.</p>
               <p>But unleſs the Jeſuits and Popiſh Counſellors had been ſelf murderers, and conſpired to overthrow their own Deſigns, by their imprudent and precipitate actings, they had never abuſed the poor King by ſuch perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious advice, to attack the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the perſons of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who were the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of it; to lay ſuch a ſnare before wiſe and religious men, as muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger their ſafety, or prejudice their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57753:61"/>
Conſcience; and becauſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented an humble Apology by way of Petition (a priviledg allow'd to all men by the Laws of God and Nature) imploring to be excuſed from being made Inſtruments to countenance and publiſh <hi>the monſtrous Aſſertion of an abſolute and diſpenſing Power;</hi> they were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> Indicted of Miſdemeanor, compell'd to plead, try'd by a Jury, and fairly acquitted upon their Trial, to the ſhame and confuſion of their Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors; and to the unexpreſſible joy and ſatisfaction of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The King hoping to eſtabliſh that by a Law which he could not bring to paſs by his will and power, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the calling of a Parliament; whom that he might form to the Standard <hi>ſet out</hi> by the Popiſh Cabal, he condeſcended to ſuch mean ſhifts, and ſuch indirect practices, by fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalling 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57753:61"/>
Mens Judgments, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaging them againſt the Liberty, and indifferency of their Votes, and turning Men out of their Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who would not abjure the natural Freedom of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that in mere Decency and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I forbear to inlarge upon it.</p>
               <p>Neither will I any more than make mention of the Intrigue about the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> Great pains have been taken to offer convincing proofs to the World of the Legitimacy of that Child; whereas there is nothing ſo hard to be proved, as a Buſineſs of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And the ſuſpition of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture has made ſuch an Impreſſion on common belief, that an Act of Parliament in Favour of the Birth would hardly reconcile the people to a Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>The bloody Executions in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> upon the unhappy Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors 
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57753:62"/>
of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated Multitudes of People into Diſcontent, and Mutiny: but when it was reported, that the King had given the Lives of ſo many wretched men by whole ſale to his Servitors to be retail'd by them for Lucre and Profit; the whole Nation was affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that unexampled Barbarity, and became <hi>ſeaſoned</hi> with a ſecret A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to his Government.</p>
               <p>The furious Drivers of the Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Plots began too late to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their miſtaken Policy: they had ſtretached the Prerogative ſo high that is began to crack; they had by their damnable Counſel hurried the <hi>unfortunate</hi> King to the Brink of Ruin: The Skie began to thicken with Clouds, and Thunder was heard a far off. Wherefore they began with all haſt to tack about to unravel that work which with ſo many hands and ſuch indefatigable induſtry they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57753:62"/>
had been knitting. Suddenly and unexpectedly a Proclamation iſſued to ſummon a Parliament with Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Corporations</hi> was reſtored: The Suſpenſion of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> taken off: The Vice-Chancellor and others of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and the Preſident and Fellows of <hi>Magdalen-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> reinſtated in their Places; The <hi>monstrous</hi> Commiſſion for Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs diſſolved; a Proclamation ſet out carrying the Face of a general pardon; but Squinting at and Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Papiſts. All men were fill'd with wonder at ſuch a hudled and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Alteration; that the great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State ſhould ſo poorly truckle to the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of the People; that the King ſhould ſend for the Biſhops and court them, from whom a little before he would not endure the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of an humble Petition. But the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57753:63"/>
Riddle was ſoon unfolded, and the wonder was turned into an Exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Joy at the miraculous Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Affairs.</p>
               <p>The Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Prime Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> ſadly reſenting the Invaſion on their Religion, Liberties, and Properties obſerving the arbitary and deſpotical proceedings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> beholding <hi>Ireland</hi> wholly given up to Popery, and Slavery, and their own Ancient Laws and eſtabliſh'd Religion ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, who had ſo often and ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promiſed the maintenance and Protection of them; they began to conſult of ſome proper and effectual means to divert the impending miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and to aſſure the reſtitution of their raviſh'd Freedom. To this end they made application to the moſt illuſtrious Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion and Protector of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> imploring his Aid to reſcue
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57753:63"/>
them from <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> and to ſave their Liberties now expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and at the laſt Gap. He with a Bravery and Generoſity, not to be matched in any Hiſtory deſcended to their Relief, and (poſtponing all his own Intereſts and Advantages) with the hazard of his perſon, and the conſumption of a vaſt Treaſure, landed in <hi>England,</hi> not with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Army, leaſt it ſhould look like an Invaſion; neither with too ſmall a Party leaſt he ſhould ſeem puſht on by a Neceſſity, or ingaged in a deſperate undertaking. The King had a great Army on Foot, which was quickly increaſed by a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Addition. And with appearance of great Reſolution, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Succeſs, he marcht from <hi>London:</hi> But he ſoon found by a fatal Experience, that the <hi>Hands</hi> of his Subjects were directed by their <hi>hearts,</hi> in which having forfeited his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, 
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57753:64"/>
he was to expect no Service or Aſſiſtance from them. On the contrary the Lords and Gentlemen, from all parts of the Kingdom flock'd in with their Arms and Horſes to joyn their Deliverer, and many Trops and Regiments of the Kings Army deſerted him, not enduring to be <hi>mingled among Papiſts,</hi> or be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>fight againſt Proteſtants.</hi> The King in this Perplexity was wholly irreſolute what courſe to take; at laſt he poſted to <hi>London,</hi> where miſſing his Popiſh Favorites (whom Fear of Puniſhment, and the Terror of an evil Conſcience had utterly diſſipated) he did not think it fit to truſt his beſt and trueſt Subjects, but ſecretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf in a Diſguiſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a ſtrange Accident diſcoverd, he was reconducted to <hi>London;</hi> from whence, at his own deſire, he was attended to <hi>Rocheſter:</hi> but not being able to live without the Miniſtration
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57753:64"/>
of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> he ſlipt away to the Sea ſide, and ſaild for <hi>France,</hi> voluntarily, and without conſtraint <hi>abdicating</hi> the <hi>Government,</hi> leaving <hi>the Throne vacant,</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> of his People, without <hi>a head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here ended the Reign of <hi>James</hi> the Second, too violent to laſt long. A Prince who (when he was a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) had the Reputation of being a valiant Leader, afirm Friend, and an immovable Obſerver of his word and Promiſe: But the Aſſumption of a Crown, the Flatteries of a bigoted Queen, the deſperate Counſels of a Popiſh and Atheiſtical Cabal, with a blind Perſwaſion of meriting <hi>Heaven,</hi> by the Adventure of all he had upon Earth, hath expoſed him to Cenſure, and repreſented him under a contrary Character.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he is abſolved from the guilt of his perſonal vices by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, and he ſhall be acquitted of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57753:65"/>
the Remembrance of them by me, I have ſo great a Reverence for thoſe of his neareſt Blood, that I ſhall not by the Blots of my Pen imprint a Stain on his Memory, or diffuſe the Tincture on his Poſterity.</p>

               <p>Thus you have a breif Epitome of the unfortunate Reigns of Six of the Engliſh Monarchs. Of Which the Firſt <hi>Broke his Neck;</hi> The next <hi>Broke his Heart;</hi> And every one of them <hi>Broke his Vows to God,</hi> and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to his Subjects.
