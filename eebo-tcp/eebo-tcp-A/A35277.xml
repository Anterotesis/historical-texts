            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Have long been aſhamed to ſee ſo many of my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings march into the World, and yet not one of 'em Honour'd by Your Lordſhips Patronage. It is an eaſie matter for a Troop to force themſelves on Ladies and Neutral Gentlemen, or Nobility, who will not Arm; but they muſt be Men of ſome Merit and Gallantry who compel regard from a General. Your Lordſhip is as much above us in our own Ways, as you are in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; and I give this manifeſt proof of it, Your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and, moſt Men believe, Your Inclinations, fixes You on the top of Eaſe and Pleaſure, therefore you
<pb facs="tcp:57374:3"/>
wou'd never have written one Line, if it had coſt you any pains, yet have you perform'd Maſteries, which we who make Poetry the whole Buſineſs of our Lives, cou'd never equal. In Your Eſſay on Poetry there appears to me a Commanding Genius, ſtanding on a Riſe, o're-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Age You live in, ſeeing all the Writers in it marching below You, and too often diſorderly; and You give us thoſe Orders which plainly ſhew, Poetry attends on You, You may do what You pleaſe with it, but we compar'd with Your Lordſhip, are poor drudges to it, that have oftner the Will, than the Power to do well. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has not only a perfect Underſtanding of what is fit to paſs in the World, but You are of a ſevere Temper which will not give Your Paſs to any falſe Sence, the abſence therefore of Your Name from my Writings ſeems a ſilent Charge againſt me of want of Merit. To remove that Reproach, I take this occaſion to tell the World, Your Lordſhip has approv'd of ſome of my Writings; and I have long'd to make my brags of it, but have been bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd either by the unkindneſs of Fortune, which has given me ſome blow, and made me unfit to appear before You, or by the kindneſs of ſome Generous Perſons, by which my Writings have been in a manner Morgag'd. Though the Law of the Land does not reckon Favours freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed among Debts, the Law of Gratitude does; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Man is oblig'd a Judgment is enter'd againſt him.
<pb facs="tcp:57374:3"/>
In the late Reign when Your Lordſhip grac'd the Lord Chamberlains Office, You were pleas'd to ſhew me thoſe Regards which made me vain: And I was very deſirous to make it known to the World; but the Cloudineſs of thoſe Times, got I think into my Head, I did not Write ſo well as I have done formerly. Now I venture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Your Lordſhip, becauſe I bring an Acquaintance of Yours, I am ſure You value, Mr. <hi>Boileau;</hi> and a piece of his all Men of Sence have eſteem'd, becauſe it expoſes to contempt Men, who are the Antipodes to good Sence; Prieſts who advance Nonſence above Reaſon, make Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles of the moſt Solemn Matters, and Solemn Things of Trifles; are idle in the great Affairs of their Calling, and buſie in Impertinence. By the few we have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, of ſuch kind of Churchmen we may gueſs the miſery of people who live in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, where there are ſcarce any other; where the whole Maſs of Prieſthood is a heap of proud Fleſh, and all the Strength and Nutriment of a Nation, goes to feed Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Corruption; thanks be to God, we are in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make ſport with'em, if e're they come amongſt us, they will ſpoil the Jeſt. And paſt diſpute 'tis very fit to render Men contemptible who endeavour to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſo. We have had too many in our Church who have buſied themſelves, and embroil'd others about things, which the <hi>French</hi> have had the underſtanding to know
<pb facs="tcp:57374:4"/>
were only fit for a Droll. But now we have greater Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs on our Hand. We have not time to contend for Modes in Religion, when the Being of the Proteſtant Religion, and indeed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation lyes at ſtake. In a Calm at Sea Men may have leiſure to wrangle at Cheſs; but if a Storm riſes the quarrel's at an end, and the Biſhops, Knights, Rooks and Pawns that bred it are left to ſhift for themſelves. I am well aſſured the Lutrin pleaſes Your Lordſhip, but I may doubt of my Management of it; for I treat it as an Engliſh Privateer wou'd do a French Prize, great part of it, I fling away, and I daſh-brew and diſguiſe the reſt as I think good. I ſhall not value how the World cenſures me, if I have the good Fortune to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of by Your Lordſhip, and thought worthy of the Title of</p>

In Expectations of Divine Delights:</l>
               <l>All look their Cloaths, but none their Appetites.</l>
               <l>For they were ready ere their Gowns were on:</l>
               <l>Headlong undreſt to the great Hall they run,</l>
               <l>But 'ſtead of Breakfaſt met a mournful Tale,</l>
               <l>Told by the Chanter, with great fury pale;</l>
               <l>Who as a Peſtilence were in his Breath,</l>
               <l>Struck mighty Hunger with a ſudden Death.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Everard</hi> painful abſtinence abhorr'd,</l>
               <l>And bad the <hi>Verger</hi> cover ſtraight the Board.</l>
               <l>To that once ſavoury motion no Man ſpoke,</l>
               <l>At length Learn'd <hi>Allen</hi> the deep ſilence broke.</l>
               <l>He only of all the Prieſts our Church obey'd,</l>
               <l>Had not his Latin ſmother'd and o'relay'd.</l>
               <l>Others by wealth to dulneſs did advance,</l>
               <l>And with the Churches Coin bought Ignorance.</l>
               <l>But he had wander'd from that practis'd Rule,</l>
               <l>And was as Learn'd as when he came from School<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </l>
               <l>His <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue there gave him mighty Power,</l>
               <l>There he was almoſt <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour.</l>
               <l>None in his preſence durſt lay claim to Parts,</l>
               <l>For if they did his Latin ſtab'd their Hearts.</l>
               <l>This Tyrant yet was their Defence and Grace;</l>
               <l>Latin was ſuch a terrour to the place,</l>
               <l>All other Canons fled at firſt Alarms,</l>
               <l>Of men approaching with ſuch dreadful Arms.</l>
               <l>But Noble <hi>Allen</hi> ſcorn'd his Head to hide,</l>
               <l>And ſturdy ſhocks of Latin durſt abide.</l>
               <l>Moſt Learnedly Equip'd, th' accompliſht Man</l>
               <l>Having firſt cough'd, his wiſe Harangue began.</l>

Some Huguenots our curſt Eternal Foes,</l>
               <l>Planted this here, to batter our repoſe.</l>
               <l>In ſome Church Hiſtory they have read, I fear,</l>
               <l>Canons once preach'd, and Deans ſat here to hear.</l>
               <l>I range in Volumes not to poach for Art,</l>
               <l>But to meet Latin which delights my Heart.</l>
               <l>Let us all ſtudy with what ſpeed we may,</l>
               <l>And ſhew our ſelves as deeply Learn'd as they.</l>
               <l>About this Pulpit then, let's quickly ſound,</l>
               <l>All Learned Men in theſe great things profound.</l>
               <l>Th' unlook'd for Counſel all the Aſſembly ſcar'd,</l>
               <l>But made an Earthquake in Fat <hi>Everard;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who ſhaking with aſtoniſhment and rage,</l>
               <l>How I (ſaid he) turn School-boy in my Age?</l>
               <l>Do thou look pale, and wither o're a Book,</l>
               <l>I ne're ſo much as on the Bible look.</l>
               <l>I only Study when our Rents are due,</l>
               <l>When Leaſes fall, and Tenants ſhou'd renew.</l>
               <l>Books I abhor, they fill the Church with Schiſms;</l>
               <l>Much miſchief we have had from Syllogiſms.</l>
               <l>If to Religion you wou'd Converts make,</l>
               <l>Burn Books and Men ſay I, and uſe a Stake.</l>
               <l>I will not vex my Head, my Arm alone,</l>
               <l>Shall without Latin throw this Pulpit down.</l>
               <l>I care not what Heretique Raſcals ſay;</l>
               <l>What troubles me I'll throw out o' my way.</l>
               <l>So let's prepare for the Renown'd deſign,</l>
               <l>And when accompliſh'd, plentifully Dine.</l>
               <l>No ſooner the word Dinner paſt their Ears,</l>
               <l>Than up their Stomachs roſe, down fell their fears.</l>

But than the Chanter none more bold and great,</l>
               <l>Said he, this Tub too long has made us ſweat.</l>
               <l>Do Deans fear Duſt, they muſt be cas'd like Clocks?</l>
               <l>Wou'd they like Cent'ries awe us from a Box?</l>
               <l>In our Church Pillar is ſome rottenneſs ſpread,</l>
               <l>To hide himſelf he wou'd be Wainſcotted?</l>
               <l>My Vengeance on this Foppery I'll throw;</l>
               <l>And an Hours Faſting on the work beſtow.</l>
               <l>This done at once we'll break our Faſt, and Dine,</l>
               <l>And two fair Meals with both their portions join.</l>
               <l>By this inſpir'd, the haughty Champions go</l>
               <l>With an audacious Zeal to charge the Foe.</l>
               <l>The Walls vain aid to the poor Engine lent,</l>
               <l>The Nails in vain their Iron Fingers bent,</l>
               <l>The Champions vanquiſht all reſiſtance found.</l>
               <l>The batter'd Engine fell with many a Wound.</l>
               <l>Antichriſt never had ſuch dreadful blows,</l>
               <l>From mighty Prieſts who were his bitter Foes,</l>
               <l>For as this Pulpit was, he's wondrous high,</l>
               <l>A great Uſurper of Church Vanity.</l>
               <l>Therefore have many rail'd at him aloud,</l>
               <l>He will let no Man but himſelf be proud.</l>
               <l>Now the Dean's State of late ſo high and great,</l>
               <l>Once more is in a Sea of Darkneſs ſet.</l>
