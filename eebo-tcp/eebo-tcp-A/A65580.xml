            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV have here (at the request
of some <hi>Honourable Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)
An Astrologicall Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
upon the future successe
of His <hi>Majesties</hi> present
<hi>Martch</hi> begun the 7 of <hi>May</hi>
Instant. It is delivered in <hi>Generall</hi> Tearmes,
for I neither will nor dare descend to <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</hi>
That would require the knowledge of
many things, besides His <hi>Majesties Nativity,</hi>
which I may not presume to meddle with;
It being in it selfe both unlawfull and very
dangerous to publish any thing concerning
the particular fortunes and Destinies of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
For in this <hi>Thrasybulus, Ascletarion,</hi> and <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus,</hi>
were much to blame; the first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
foretold the Destruction of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:34505:3"/>
               <hi>Emperour,</hi> the second, of <hi>Domitian,</hi> the third,
of <hi>Bentivoli</hi> in <hi>Bononia:</hi> So likewise the <hi>Preist</hi>
that caused the Rumour of the future <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering</hi>
of <hi>Galeacius Sfortia Duke</hi> of <hi>Millaine,</hi>
who were all of them worthily rewarded
for their folly. And so ought Master <hi>Lilly</hi> and
Master <hi>Booker</hi> to be for their pernicious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
wherein their sole endeavour hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been by most disloyall and ambiguous
Phrases to animate and hasten on the <hi>Rebels</hi>
and other <hi>Conspiratours</hi> to plot and attempt
<hi>Mischiefe</hi> against His <hi>Majestie,</hi> whereas an
honest and discreet Artist ought not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
any thing (especially of <hi>Princes)</hi> that
may any way tend to endanger their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but either not to meddle at all, or else
to deale privately with the <hi>Prince</hi> himselfe;
and then also to adhere to <hi>Cardanes</hi> Rule in
his Book <hi>De Astrologicis Interrogationibus:</hi>
               <q>Principi ne magnum malum firmiter unquam
praedixeris, sed Periculum.</q> Howbeit <hi>Cardane</hi>
himselfe dealt more plainly, and therefore
more dangerously with <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, as
appeareth in the <hi>Iudicials</hi> of his <hi>Nativity</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out in the beginning of his <hi>Duodecim Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustres
Geniturae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34505:3"/>
But neither <hi>Cardane</hi> (notwithstanding he
was a man of extraordinary credit) nor any
other personall example can warrant any
other private men to intermeddle with the
<hi>Nativities</hi> of their <hi>Princes,</hi> otherwise then is
before limited, or upon the <hi>Princes</hi> speciall
command. And yet if in this respect or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Art happen to be abused by some <hi>Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rij
(non veri filij) Artis,</hi> it hath but the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that other Arts and Sciences have: And
the Lawyers Rule is, That <hi>Abusus non tollit u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum.</hi>
The bounds of which limitation I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
I have not any way exceeded in this
Discourse, which be pleased to accept as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

<hi>Debilities</hi> of every Planet in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Coelestiall Scheme are easily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered:
It followeth then that we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
conferre them amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
according to the respective Numbers of their
<hi>Fortitudes</hi> and <hi>Debilities;</hi> that it may yet more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
appeare, which of them are most strong and
fortunate; which most weake and infortunate, and
accordingly how they succeed one another in
strength and Power.</p>
            <p>First then, the Planet <hi>Mercury</hi> of all the rest is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
most strong and fortunate in the Scheme. For
if the number of his <hi>Debilities</hi> be deducted from the
summe of his <hi>Fortitudes</hi> there still remaineth 22 Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of strength, which no other Planet obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:34505:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The next in dignity is <hi>Saturne</hi> who hath 12 Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
Then <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who are both very
powerfull; the first of them being endued with 17,
the latter with 10 <hi>Dignities: Mars</hi> and the <hi>Sunne</hi> are
both but weake in respect of their <hi>Essentiall Dignities:</hi>
yet for some Circumstances very considerable in this
case, the <hi>Sunne</hi> may be said to be the stronger, which
being generally taken is a good and laudable token.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moone</hi> of all others is the most debilitated
her <hi>Detriments</hi> exceeding her <hi>Fortitudes,</hi> by 8 which,
will prove very advantagious to His Majesty, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shallbe noted. And thus much generally touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the constitution of the Planets in the <hi>Figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to descend more particularly to the present
matter; We are (in this case) principally to consider
4 things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Ascendent</hi> of the <hi>Scheme,</hi> which is the
<hi>Significator</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> from whence his <hi>Majesty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his <hi>Martch:</hi> From which house we are to collect
the condition and State of this City during his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi>
absence.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> The 10 <hi>House,</hi> which (according to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)</hi>
is the <hi>Significatrix</hi> the journey: And from this
we are to deduce our judgement of his <hi>Majesties</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
during the time of his <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The <hi>Third</hi> thing to be considered is the 7 <hi>House</hi>
by which we are to judge how his <hi>Majestie</hi> is likely
to be received in those Parts where his Army shall
passe, and of his successe against the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And <hi>Lastly</hi> the <hi>fourth House;</hi> whereby we are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
our selves of his <hi>Majesties</hi> successe in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34505:7"/>
Vnde si quis istorum locorum melior, &amp; fortunatior

            <p>As concerning the first, we finde the 22 degree of
the <hi>Regall signe Leo</hi> at that instant ascending our <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
Cor Leonis</hi> in the <hi>Ascendent.</hi> And the <hi>Dragons
Head</hi> in the very <hi>Cuspe</hi> thereof: And the <hi>Sun (Lord</hi>
of the <hi>First House)</hi> not unfortunately posited in the
<hi>South Angle</hi> of the Heavens: Which is the house of
<hi>Empire, Rule, Dignities, Offices, and Arts, &amp;c.</hi> And
he environ'd with the two Benigne Planets <hi>Jupiter</hi>
and <hi>Venus,</hi> who likewise behold the Ascendent and
are free from any configuration with the <hi>Malevolents.</hi>
These are evident and undeniable Testimonies of
the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>safety</hi> of this famous <hi>Vniversity and
City of Oxford;</hi> And of the <hi>care</hi> and vigilancy of those
that are intrusted by his Majesty with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
thereof: Of the <hi>Fidelity, Courage, Industry,</hi>
and necessary <hi>Expence</hi> of her <hi>Inhabitants</hi> for the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi>
of it: And of their conformity to such whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<hi>Orders,</hi> as either are or shall hereafter be made
by the Wisedome of the <hi>Councellors</hi> for the good and
Benefit of the <hi>City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, All the good our hearts can wish for is
promised us by the <hi>Scheme.</hi> I hope the seasonable
care taken, and the Directions already given for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the Sicknesse will adde much to our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse:
Some strange kinde of Mortality must be
expected this yeare in most Cities and great Townes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34505:8"/>
throughout the South, South-East, and South-West
parts of this Kingdome: But especially let <hi>London</hi>
be forewarned of her misery: She is much (and
that deservedly) threatned. You may heare more of
her after the 23 of <hi>May</hi> instant, for from thence
doth the Influence of <hi>Saturnes</hi> Transite out of <hi>Aries</hi>
into <hi>Taurus</hi> begin to operate.</p>
            <p>As touching the second thing here considerable,
which is the <hi>Tenth House;</hi> we may observe the <hi>ninth
Degree</hi> and 31 <hi>min.</hi> of <hi>Taurus Culminating,</hi> which is
the <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Triplicity</hi> of <hi>Venus;</hi> wherein also she is
most fortunately seated within 3 <hi>Degrees</hi> of the <hi>Cuspe</hi>
thereof, beholding the <hi>Ascendent,</hi> free from <hi>Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or any configuration with the <hi>Malevolent</hi> Planets;
being <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Swift</hi> of Motion, and <hi>Orientall</hi> of
the <hi>Sun:</hi> To her (therefore) may we justly attribute
the signification of his <hi>Majesties Martch:</hi> Who being
(by nature) Benevolent, by her <hi>Essentiall</hi> and <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall</hi>
Position so fortunate: We cannot pronounce
lesse to his <hi>Majestie,</hi> and his whole Army, then a
wonderfull <hi>happy, prosperous,</hi> and <hi>successefull Martch,</hi>
And contrarily exceeding much <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Terrour,
dissipation,</hi> and utter <hi>Ruine</hi> to his <hi>Enemies:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dragons Head</hi> in the <hi>Cuspe</hi> of the <hi>Ascendent</hi>
tells us, <q>Quod habebit bonum antequam se inde moveat,
&amp; in principio Itineris, </q>
               <bibl>Haly Par. 3. Pag. 108.</bibl> This
was verified in part by that Gallant Encounter with
the Enemy performed (with so good successe) by
the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Goring</hi> neare <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
the same seaventh day; occasioned upon his
<hi>Majesties</hi> Motion hence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34505:8"/>
The Generality of this good to his <hi>Majesty</hi> and
his Army, is further confirmed by the Powerfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the <hi>Sun;</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>South-Angle;</hi>
And the unfortunate Positure of the <hi>Moone</hi>
in the <hi>Figure &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Ascendent</hi> and <hi>Tenth House</hi> being both <hi>Fixed

            <p>The next thing (in Order) which we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the <hi>Ascendent,</hi> and in the House of <hi>Kings, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquarius</hi> being a fixed Signe tels us that he shall
not quickely remove thence, but remaine there some
convenient time for the setling of some important
Affaires, and a full reducing of those Counties to
their obedience.</p>
            <p>If any man would be satisfied to what Quarter of
the Heavens the designe is intended, although he may
guesse something by the Motion which the Army
hath already made, yet he may informe his Judgment
best by considering the Signes of the 4 <hi>Angles, viz.
Leo, Taurus, Aquarius,</hi> and <hi>Scorpio,</hi> (which he shall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34505:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
find to be the one halfe <hi>Northerne,</hi> the other <hi>Southerne;</hi>
and also the Signes wherein the Planets are, viz. <hi>Aries,
Taurus, Gemini, Leo,</hi> and <hi>Aquarius,</hi> which are all of
them (except the last wherein the <hi>Moone</hi> is) <hi>Sententri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall.</hi>
Which will assuredly determine that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
and principall Actions of this Army or the
greatest part thereof are like to be <hi>Northerly,</hi> inclining
sometimes to the <hi>East,</hi> otherwhiles to the <hi>West,</hi> as the
Occasions of Warre requires.</p>
            <p>The 4 and last thing to be examined is the 4 house:
The <hi>Cuspe</hi> whereof is the 9 <hi>degr.</hi> and 31 <hi>min.</hi> of <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
the most viperous signe of the <hi>Zodioque;</hi> where
<hi>Mars</hi> hath the <hi>Dignities</hi> of <hi>Triplicity</hi> and <hi>Decade;</hi> But
is unfortunately collocated in the 12 house of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</hi>
This position of his ought to forewarne our
<hi>Commanders</hi> to take heed of some Disaster immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
before His <hi>Maiesty</hi> betake him to his <hi>Winter
Quarters:</hi> It seemes to be the beating up of an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter,
and the surprisall of some few of our Men,
who value their ease more then their safety: I'le say
no more: But I hope the Diligence and vigilancy of
our Commanders may prevent the danger.</p>
            <p>And now to summe up all; It is most apparent to
every impartiall and ingenuous Judgement; That
(although His <hi>Maiesty</hi> cannot expect to be secured
from every triviall disaster that may befall his Army,
either by the too much presumption, ignorance, or
negligence of some particular persons, which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
incident and unavoidable in the best of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)
yet the severall Positions of the Heavens duly
considered and compared amongst themselves as well
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34505:10"/>
in the prefixed <hi>Scheme</hi> as the <hi>Quarterly Ingresses,</hi> doe
generally render His <hi>Maiesty</hi> and his whole Army
unexpectedly victorious and successefull in all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes:
Beleive it <hi>(London)</hi> thy miseries approach, they
are like to be many, great and greivous, and not to be
diverted, unlesse thou seasonably crave pardon of <hi>God</hi>
for being <hi>Nurse</hi> to this present <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and speedily
submit to thy Princes mercy: Which shall be the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prayer of,</p>
