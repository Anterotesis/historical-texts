         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
Advertisement
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT is thought necessary to
assure the <hi>Publick,</hi> that the
following Treatise is a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Piece</hi> of that reverend
Author, whose name it bears;
'twas left finisht under his own
hand, and may serve as a fresh
proof of that <hi>true Christian Zeal</hi>
which inflamed his Mind, and
extended his Concern, to the
necessities of those miserable
Wretches, who are confined to
Prisons for <hi>CRIMES</hi> and <hi>Debt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107127:3"/>
Such afflicting Circumstances,
naturally incline Men to Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
the want whereof is
for the most part the true cause
of all their Misfortunes; but
since it is as impossible to make
that undone, that is once done,
as it is to call back Time; the
only remedy that is left for the
returning Sinner, is to make all
those Reparations to God and
Man, which his particular case
will admit off: Now to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he is here furnisht with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Directions both how to
begin and compleat his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and with variety of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to implore the assistance of
that Grace, which is so necessary
in order to his recovery.</p>
            <p>There has been so little writ
upon this important Subject, that
I perswade my Self the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it; will be very grateful
to all good Men, who rejoyce
at any means that are used to
<pb facs="tcp:107127:3"/>
rescue captives from the Slavery
of Satan: Besides the accurate
Management of the Argument,
will recommend it to the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the most judicious.</p>
            <p>Composures of <hi>Devotion,</hi> when
perfect in their kind, I think may
very well be ranked among some
of the difficult performances in
<hi>Divinity;</hi> since they require not
only propriety and decency of
Expression, but a mature Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
spiritualized Affections;
and a most comprehensive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all Christian Duties, to
render them Compleat; that
while the mind is stor'd with
rules to make a sound Judgment,
the will may be determined to
the choice of what is just, and
all the faculties wing'd to the
swiftest prosecution of it.</p>
            <p>How far this <hi>Devout Office</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
that Character, must be
left to the world to Judge, but
the talent our <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Learned
<pb facs="tcp:107127:4"/>
Author</hi> had that way is so well
known, that I need say no more
to satisfie the Reader, than to
assure him this is of a piece with
what he has already published
in that kind.</p>
            <p>God grant that it may Attain
that End which he Aimed at in
this and all his other Writings,
which was the Service of his
Blessed Master, and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Souls which were
redeemed by his most precious
Bloud; <hi>that they may both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and know those things which
they ought to do, and may have
Grace and Power faithfully to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the same,</hi> AMEN.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <opener>Reader,</opener>
            <p>THE Case of Poor Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
both for Crimes, and
also for Debt, is very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable,
and uncomfortable, with
Relation to their Bodies; but more
with Relation to their most Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Souls. And I think it a Good
Piece of Charity to Direct them,
how in their most Dangerous Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
they may, however, set
their Souls Safe, and also Provide
for their Bodily Straights; making
them as easy and advantageous to
them, yea, and I add really as safe
too, as their Case admits to make
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107127:5"/>
But when such Helps are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for them, these miserable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are neither like to inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, nor be at any Charge to
buy them for themselves. And
therefore another Sort of Charity
will still be wanting to their Releif,
and that is, the Charity of some Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Persons to Distribute such
Helps among Prisoners, and put
them into their hands. And when
Compassionate and Charitable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
do not Visit Prisons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
methinks such of them as
are of Ability, should not think
much to send such Visitants and
Companions as these among them.</p>
            <p>I have Prepared this little Piece
to be sent Abroad, both to Furnish
them with Particular Directions,
and also with Particular Prayers,
for their several Needs and hard
Circumstances. And I hope God
will from Time to Time stir
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of some or other

               </gap> and Charitable
<pb facs="tcp:107127:5"/>
Servants in Several Counties,
to send some of these Pieces
(or others which they like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
to be Distributed some
Due Time before the Assizes in
their Neighbouring Prisons. By
Gods Blessing they may Help
to Save many Souls by this
Means; at least they will
greatly Benefit, and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their own to his Mercy,
who sets not so much by any
Charity, as by that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Sinners, from the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of their ways.</hi>

after Commitment, and
before the Tryal.</head>
                  <p>I. AS soon as you are Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Prison, begin
seriously to Consider, and
Resolve within your Self,
how to spend your Time there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107127:7"/>
Do not once fancy, that you must
lye shut out there from all Business, and
Condemned to a State of Idleness. But
set your Self with all your might, to
mind the <hi>one thing necessary,</hi> viz. The
Great Work of Repentance, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Peace with Almighty God:
And know assuredly, that this will cut
out Work enough for you, and of more
Comfort and Profit to your Soul, than
any other Employments which you have
formerly been used to.</p>
                  <p>And do not think of leaving this
most necessary and important Work for
an after-Game, and that it will be time
enough to fall to it after you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Sentence of Condemnation. For
this shews, that you do not yet think
Repentance to be the Work of a Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but only of a Condemn'd and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Person, and that if you could have
any Hopes to live on, you would Reserve
your Self and are Resolved to Sin on.
And when you come to it with this
Mind, you are never like to do much
Good in the way of Repentance; nor
is it like to do much Good to you.
Besides, the Review and Amendment
of a whole Life, and making your
Peace with God and Men after a long
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107127:7"/>
course of Provocations against both, if
it be done as it should be, is a Work
of more Time, and Difficulty, and
Thoughtfulness, than you are aware of.
And after Sentence is once passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, the wretched Criminals often
times are either so Dejected with their
Misfortunes, or so Distracted with
Terrors, that their Minds are not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
to be any thing near so compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
Intent, and Thoughtful, as the
Work of Repentance Requires; or
to make half so much use as they should
of that little Time which is left them.
Not to put them in mind likewise, that
Considerable parts even of that little
Time will be snatched away from this
Grand Business, to be taken up in
Farewel Visits, some of Business, others
of Love and Kindness, and in other
Avocations and Interruptions, which
both the Noisy and Incommodious State
of Prisoners, and the Condition of
Persons taking a Deliberate Leave of
this World, must expect to meet
with.</p>
                  <p>As soon therefore as you are shut up
from others, fall to Converse with your
Self, and Call your own Heart and Ways
to Remembrance. And apply your Self
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107127:8"/>
with Seriousness to think of leaving
this World, and of Giving a Strict
Account to the Dreadful Judge of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, of all the Good or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
which you did whilst you lived in
it, and of the many Things which you
need to amend, and have to do, to make
your Peace with God, before you leave it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> fix your Thoughts on Heaven
and Hell, and look upon them as most
Real and Certain Things, and as States
of utmost Joy or Greif, and of Endless
Continuance. They who will not
Believe that there is an Hell, shall surely
feel it: And when, by feeling the
most Exquisite Pains thereof, they come
to be Convinced to their Cost that
there is One; they shall be for ever
incapable, either to bear it, or to get
out of it. Who can abide the Rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Torture of Fire and Flames, and<note n="†" place="margin">Isa. 33. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Dwell with everlasting Burnings?</hi> Who
can Endure to be perpetually gnawed,
and pierced to the quick, with the Worm
of Conscience, always accusing and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
him, and eating through his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
To lye down in a Bed of Sorrow, yea,
and which he has madly Chosen, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
Sought out for himself: Where
there is nothing, but Anguish without

abatement, and Horror without hope;
and wherein there neither is, nor can
be the least Glimps of the Divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but inexorable Justice comes Armed
with Power, to heap on such Plagues,
as an Almighty God can inflict, and an
immortal Sinner can suffer, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>And assure your Self, that this will
surely be the just Wages of the Crime
for which you are made a Prisoner, and
the unavoidable end of your mispent
Life, unless you Employ that little
space of Time, which you have yet
remaining, to prevent the same, by
true Repentance, and making of your
Peace with God before you dye.</p>
                  <p>Being therefore without delay to
Survey your past Life, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

and undertaking whereof,
God admitted you to the Hopes of his
Mercy and Eternal Life in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;
and attently bethink your self how
you have kept it. And read over your
Duty to God and to your Neighbour,
and at every particular of each of

them, propose to your self, and Consider
how you have Performed the same. And
this will shew you what Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
you have Broken, and what
Sins you have to bewail and amend, that
you may Recover Gods Favour, and
Prevent the Torments of Eternal
Fire.</p>
                  <p>And having thus Discover'd what
your Sins and Offences are, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you to Gods wrath, set your Self
instantly to humble your Soul for them
before him, that so you may be fit for
his Mercy. With hearty Self-abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Condemnation of your
Self for the same, acknowledge before
him, your own Baseness, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Unthankfulness, and Wretched
Folly therein. And fix in your Heart
the Firmest Purposes of Amendment
thereof, as seeing assuredly, that there is
no other way, either of shewing your
Duty, your Love, or Thankfulness to
God, or of saving your Self from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
misery.</p>
                  <p>And having thus Considerately, and
fully Purposed this Amendment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your Self, and that of all the several
Sins which you find you have been
Guilty of, Faithfully Promise him, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107127:9"/>
by his Help you will Amend them.
And beg his Grace to fix you in this
Purpose, and to Enable you, as occasion
is offer'd, to perform it. And then
humbly and earnestly beg his Pardon
for all your Sins, for Jesus Christ's Sake.
And every Day afterwards, as it comes,
apply your Self with utmost Care and
Diligence, to make Good your Work,
and Perform these Promises, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
that it is the honest keepers of
Promises, who are to Claim the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of them; and therefore in all the
Opportunities you meet with afterwards,
you must be strictly mindful according
to your Promise to do better, in all
those Points wherein you had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
before.</p>
                  <p>And as for all Wrong and Damage,
which you have done to any by your
Transgressions, especially by this for
which you are now a Prisoner; Resolve
within your Self, to make them full
Satisfaction if you are able; or else, to
make them as much Satisfaction as you
can, and to beg their Pardon, and their
Prayers to God to Pardon you, for the
Rest. And contrive how to do this,
and have things in a readiness, that it
may be done effectually and without
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107127:10"/>
delay, as soon as ever it may be Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and Convenient to do it; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at the same time against Casualties,
that whatever happens to you, it may
not be finally dropt and be undone. And
give out such General Intimations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
of your true Repentance and
fixt Intentions, of doing justice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your Ability, to all who have
suffer'd by you, as may be safe for you,
and something of Satisfaction to them,
in the mean time. And look on this
Reparation for Wrongs, as a thing that
must take Place of any Provisions, which
you would desire to make for your Self,
or your Family, out of your worldly
Goods; and that it is a necessary Course,
to prevent Gods Future Wrath, and to
Clear your Conscience.</p>
                  <p>In this Great Work, of posing, and
purging of your Conscience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the Course of your Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Repentance, and expressing your
Heart thereupon to Almighty God, you
will have great need of, and may receive
much comfortable assistance and benefit,
from Godly Directions, and Forms of
Prayers fitted for this purpose. And if you
are not otherwise provided therewith,
your needs herein may be supplyed by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107127:10"/>
a small Book, intituled <hi>A Companion for
the Penitent,</hi> wherein is <hi>An Office for the
Penitent to Carry on their Reconciliation
with God: And a Tryal or Judgment of
the Soul, to Discover the Safety of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Estate,</hi> &amp;c. lately Printed.</p>
                  <p>And during all the Time, which
God shall spare you after your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment,
to attend this Grand Business,
make Pious Books your Companions,
which you may Converse with as often,
and as much as you please, and always
with great Comfort and Advantage to
your Self; And Discreet and Religious
Friends likewise, if you have any such
who will come at you. For their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
and Devout Breathings, will be
like gentle Blowing on dying Embers,
and help to kindle any sparks of Virtue
and Goodness that lye Dormant in you.
They will call forth your Penitential
Relentings, and increase them, and bring
you by use to take Comfort therein, and
Direct you how to carry on the same.
Especially if you have a Wise and
Faithful Guide of Souls for your
Friend, prize his Visits, and make
the most of them, and prepare your
Self still to receive both Direction and
Warmth from his Lips. And be free
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107127:11"/>
in opening your Self to him, and in
begging his Judgment and Direction,
upon all the great Passages of your Life,
and the present Conduct of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
how you are to order it so,
as that you may be most sure of making
your Peace with Almighty God. And
be careful to receive his Directions with
Thankfulness, and to follow them with
Care.</p>
                  <p>And this way of spending your
Time, in transacting and perfecting
your Repentance and Peace with God,
let me again beseech you to look upon,
not only as an incident, to fall in now
and then, but as your Work and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
in Prison. And be sure to keep
your Self to it, as much as your Spirit
will bear. Remembring, that you
have a Great Work to do, and no Time
to throw away. That if you fail or
fall short therein, you are irreparably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for ever. And that there is
Great Danger of your Failing, unless
you shew such an early, a watchful, and
incessant care, as I advise you to. That
you have been desperately Foolish, as
well as Wicked, in throwing away the
former Days of your Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should now seek to redeem them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107127:11"/>
and to be double diligent in the good
Husbanding and Religious Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that small shred thereof which
still remains.</p>
                  <p>Take not therefore more than needs of
your Precious Time, especially not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Portions, from this most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and salutary Employment, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unprofitable Visits, or to throw
away in Idleness. But by no means
spend any Portions thereof, in that
Cure and Diversion of Cares, which
alass! Is too often the Refuge of Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
Malefactors, <hi>viz.</hi> Wine, and Jollity
and Prophane and Loose Conversation.
Go no more into such Society, than you
would into an Infected Room: But
Shun it as you would do the Plague, or
as you would do Persons who are throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fire-balls among Combustible Stuff,
and spreading Endless Ruine.</p>
                  <p>And in this Course, wait for the
Sessions or Assizes, and continue thus
to Employ your Self till your Tryal
comes.</p>

                  <p>AND then in the next Place, as to
what Concerns your Tryal,
look up to God as your only Deliverer
to bring you off there. All Tryals in
Human Courts, are of uncertain Issue.
Even the Innocent have Cause to Fear,
and the Guilty much more. For there
Men stand or fall, by the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Dispositions of Judges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
And their Hearts and Minds are
in no Hand but Gods, who Turns and
Governs them as he pleases. Their
Verdicts and Sentences in Tryals, are
influenced and determined, either in
Favour of the Prisoners or Against
them, according as some things are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
in Evidence, or others Omitted,
which are apt most to affect them in
their several ways of Reasoning and
Believing, and sway most with them.
And tho' these Particular Suggestions
or Omissions in Evidence, whereon the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107127:12"/>
Judgment thereof is like to turn, seem
accidents to us, and were not foreseen
nor dreamed of by the Prisoners; yet
are they all Wise Orderings and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
in God, so that in the Verdict
brought in thereupon, we have what he
pleases.</p>
                  <p>If you do Escape therefore at all, lay
down this beforehand within your self,
and be both attent and fixt in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
thereof, that it is he alone who must
send you Deliverance. And if your
Deliverance must come from thence,
Direct your Eyes to him from whom
your Help Comes, and place all your
Confidence in his kind and watchful
Providence: And when you trust to
him for Deliverance, seek for it with
earnest Prayers, and beg a longer Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite
in this World if he pleases. But
withal, seek this with Resignation to
his Holy Will, humbly submiting to
his Justice, if he think fit to bring you
to Deserved Punishment for this Offence,
for an Example to terrifie others; and
Praying, that whatever Vengeance he
Exacts for your Crimes here, he would
by no means Extend his Wrath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but for Christ Jesus'<hi>s</hi> sake spare
your Soul hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:107127:13"/>
And thus you see, that the Religious
Spending of your Time, which I have
advised you to, is really the best way
you can take to prepare for your Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and to deliver you from the Sentence
of Death here, as well as of Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hereafter. For if God, and his most
undeserved Care and kind Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
must be your Deliverer; these
Religious Exercises, which are the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
way to gain God, must be the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
ways of Deliverance, and they
have most Hope to escape the Danger,
who have done most and taken the
best care to secure his Favour.</p>
                  <p>If you have any Matters to Order
relating to this World, do them, as much
as you are able, before your Trial comes
on, and leave them not to be cared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sentence of Condemnation is past
upon you. For all your Time after
that, will have Care and Work enough
of its own, and should therefore be
kept as free from all other interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as it can.</p>
                  <p>When you are going to your Trial,
go first to you Prayers, and put your
Self into Gods Hands, and beg his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
Desire that his Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, may govern all your Carriage,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107127:13"/>
and all your Answers there, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
your Heart to express your Self
with Wisdom, and Uprightness, and
the Hearts of Judges and Juries to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the same with Favour and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.
Remembring, that both <hi>the
Preparations of the Heart</hi> in him who
needs and asks Favour, <hi>and the Answer
of the Tongue</hi> in those who are either to
Grant or Deny it, <hi>is from the Lord.</hi>
Prov. 16. 1.</p>
                  <p>When you are brought upon your
Tryal, I think you may safely make
the Legal Plea of not Guilty: For
tho you are Guilty in reality, yet you
are not Guilty in the Eye of the Law, till
you are Legally found to be so. And
when the Law asks you this, I conceive
you may answer, not according to your
Real, but your Legal Guiltiness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
innocent in Legal Estimate till you
are Convicted. For 'tis the Humanity
and Equity of our Law, as I take it,
not to require Criminals, Especially in
Capital Cases, to Accuse themselves,
which would be very unnatural, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
off all Tenderness and due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to Human Weakness. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are in Truth, it allows them
to put their Guilt upon the Proof, by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107127:14"/>
Pleading <hi>not Guilty,</hi> that where they
can not voluntary publish themselves,
and glory in a Fact as Confessors, they
may be Convicted thereof by due Proof
as Criminals, and brought to suffer Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for the same, as common Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
allows punishments should be
suffered, against their Wills. Yea, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to manifest its moderation and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to Clemency in this Case, after
they have thus put their Guiltiness upon
the Proof, the Form and Voice of the
Court is, to pray them <hi>a Good Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And having put your Self upon the
Tryal of this Plea, you may say such
things in your own Favour, as you
can say truly. But seek not for Safety
in Lyes, and Falsification of things
against your own knowledge; denying
what you know to be True to save
your Self, or possitively Affirming what
really you do not know, or perhaps
know to be otherwise. Much less seek
it in Mischeivous Lyes, to cast your
Faults on others, and either bring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Men under Suspicion, and into
Dangers, or make other Guilty Persons
Guilty of more than really they are:
For this is to give God fresh Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107127:14"/>
and back an old Sin by a new one,
and to forsake him when you stand in
the greatest need of him, which is the
readiest way to forfeit both his Peace
hereafter and his Preservation here,
and utterly to lose both Him and your
Self too.</p>
                  <p>Trust your Life therefore in his
Hands, by keeping your Defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
within the Bounds of Truth and
Justice: This is a Great Tryal of your
Faith. But 'tis a Tryal which you
have wickedly brought your self into.
And under the same, it is necessary for
you thus to approve your Faith, in
his mercy and care of you. You have
no Faith in him left, or none that he will
accept of, if you forsake him and his
ways in this difficult case, and fly to
Sin to save your Self. But if you can
trust wholly to his Providence and not
at all to evil ways, and have Faith to
contain your Self within your Duty
under the hazard of your Life, this
noble Faith will be a mighty Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of Great Account in his Eyes;
nothing ever recommending poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
more to God, than Faith doth,
when it keeps them innocent and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
in such hard Tryals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107127:15"/>
And therefore set your Self resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to act this Great, and most concerning
Part well, and to approve your Faith
in him when it is Tryed. And look
upon this trusting of your Self to him,
to be the wisest way of saving your Life,
as well as of preserving your Innocence.
For if you are Preserved at all, as I
say, you must owe your Preservation
above all things to his watchful Care
and kind Providence. And if you
must receive your Life from his Hand,
seek to him for it, and trust him with
it; and by no means leave him, to
seek out other unlawful Helps, which
will be like to Deceive you in this
World, and are certainly the way to
Destroy you afterwards, in that which
is to come.</p>
                  <p>And when you have heard your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers,
and have been heard to make
as wise a Defence as you could make
for your Self with Truth and Justice,
lift up your Heart to God when you
are taken from the Bar, and humbly
and devoutly Commit the Event of
all to him. And Pray that he will be
pleased to Order it in Favour to you,
waiting with Patience and Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Spirit, to see how he will
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107127:15"/>
Dispose the Hearts of Judges and Juries
to deal with you.</p>
                  <p>If you are Acquitted, give him
the Praise thereof, and Receive it
with utmost Devotion and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
But if you are brought in
Guilty and Condemn'd, humbly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your Self, and own the Justice
of your Sentence: And give Glory to
God, by justifying his Providence,
which has recompenced your high
Crimes with a deserved Vengeance;
and by justifying his lawful Ministers,
who bear the Sword in his Place, and
use it at any time upon such Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
as you are, confessing freely that
'tis used now in your Case, for
the Punishment and Terror of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers.</p>

                  <p>AND after you have received
Sentence, set your Self to lose
none of those precious moments of Time
which are left you, but to make the
Wisest and Carefullest Use thereof which
you can, in preparing for Death.
You are to Discharge this Great and
last Part of Dying but Once, Oh!
Therefore take care to do it well.
You can rectify or amend nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Oh! Then labour as much as in
you lies to make all sure, and set all
straight before. Finish all your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

therein, and send them up to
God in continual Strains and Breathings
of Devotion, either short and occasional

and Peace, take care before you dye
to receive the Holy Communion, after
you have endeavoured the best you
can to fit your Self for it, and to
Satisfy the Holy Man who Administers
it to you, of your Fitness for the
same. And if you can often have the
Blessing of a Prudent and Pious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Direction in that disconsolate
time, prize it highly, and improve it
diligently, and take such further ways
for the Securing of your Peace and
Quieting of your Conscience, as in

                  <p>And when you are brought from

your Sentence: Profess your abhorence
and true Repentance of the Crime
which you Dye for, and of all your
other Sins. Declare the Satisfaction
you have made, or would make, were

Beg all Persons to forgive you, who
have suffered by you in any kind, and all
who have ever learnt any ill from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107127:17"/>
your Acquaintance and Example. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that you do from your Heart,
forgive all Persons, and that you bear
not the least ill will against any of your
Prosecutors, or the Judges and Juries
who were concerned in bringing
you to Justice. And when you make
this Protestation of Forgiveness and
Good Will to them, be sure nothing
fall from you, that may bring the
Sincerity thereof into Question. And
therefore take Diligent Care, not to
shew uneasie Remembrance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment,
of the Evils or Injuries
which you have suffer'd, but only of
those which you your Self have done:
And to keep your last Breath from
being an hurtful Blast upon any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and your Dying Words from
casting out Darts and leaving a Sting
in your Enemies, Remembring, that
you are to leave the World and come
to Execution, not as a wild Beast,
fighting with your Foes, and pushing
and goreing; but as a Lamb, meekly
submitting, as your Blessed Saviour
did, tho he had no Real Guilt but
was perfectly Innocent, who suffered
the worst things without aggravating
them or being angry at them, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107127:17"/>
on the Cross spake nothing of his bitter
Enemies, but to Excuse them, and
Pray for them.</p>
                  <p>And having thus testifyed your
Godly Sorrow for your Sins, desire all
the By-standers to learn of you Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
(tho by no means to delay it so

will be sure at last, and utterly insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to all those, who will not take
care in time to appease him by amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life. Beg all that need it, to
take warning by your punishment, that
your most just and lamentable Death,
may terrifie more from Continuing in
their Sins, than the Example of your
Evil Life had lead into Sin.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, if you can do Right to
any Persons falsly accused, or wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
suspected, fail not to Do it the best
you can, before your Breath is stopt.</p>
                  <p>Profess also your Faith, whereinto

and lament the Dishonor, which you
have brought upon them by your wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,

and declare your earnest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to Do some Right to them now
by your Repentance.</p>
                  <p>And when by all these ways, you have

profess your lowly Hope in Gods

who for the Death and Merits sake
of our most Blessed Saviour Jesus Christ

Sinners, such as you are, upon their true

                  <p>After this, beg the Prayers of all the
Beholders, and the Prayers of all Good
People. And then fall to your own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

Dying Men; and desire all present to
help you by their affectionate and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

                  <p>Then take a kind and decent Leave
of all the Company, and pray God to
make them all the better by the Sadness

for their Pity, and their Prayers, and
Desire the Continuance thereof to assist
you in your last Agonies. Then turn

your self to take a fitting Farewell of
your particular Friends or Relations, if

commit your self to the Mercy of God

Providence, you deserve Pity from all,
and Patience and Forgiveness from your
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107127:20"/>
Creditors. They loose nothing by you,
that you have squander'd, but only what
God has taken away. But if rigorous
and unchristian Creditors will still be
hard upon you, you must do them all
the Justice you can, and when that is
done, bear the Rest with Resignation,
and conform your Will to the Will of
God, who calls you hereby to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Religious Trust, and Dependance
of an hard Condition, remembring all
the while to your comfort, that you
have not sought this afflicted State to
your self, but may receive it as a State
of Gods chusing for you, who knows
best what is fittest for us all, and as a
Visitation of his sending.</p>
               <p>But if you can charge your self with
any great wickedness, and have high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offended God, to bring these Losses
and Impoverishment upon you, as a
Judgment; or if you have run your
self in Debt, by riotous and luxurious
Living, by the Expensiveness of Riot,
Pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gaming, or by Idleness and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of Business; then you must hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
your self, and be heartily sorry for
these Sins, for which you suffer, and
bear the confinement you have brought
upon your self patiently, and set your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107127:20"/>
self to learn Repentance thereby. And
for working this Repentance, you may
have recourse to the foregoing Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
about the same <hi>for the Prisoner for
Crimes, Chap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But which way soever your Debt
comes, when you are their Prisoner, be
sure to deal candidly and openly with
your Creditors. If you cannot fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
them, lay your condition truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and shew your self disposed
to do Right to all as far as you can. Do
not pretend ways of raising Money
for them, which are not true; nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
payments, which you cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
'Tis your Duty to be sincere and
plain with them, and plain-dealing may
mollifie and engage them; but it will
be your Sin, and may double their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment,
if you abuse and delude their
expectation.</p>
               <p>And let them be first served out of
your Estate, so far as it will go; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in compassion to your needs, they
are willing to allow you some part of
it. But think not first of saving mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(whether they will allow of it
or no) for your self, or for your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and then of letting them take
what remains. For your Duty is first to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107127:21"/>
be just to all Men, and not live your
self, nor maintain your Dependants,
upon other Mens Goods kept from them
against their Wills; which is to live
upon with-holding Right, and pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Justice.</p>
               <p>Much less think of forcing them to
abatements and scanty compositions, to
reserve and raise a good Estate for your
self, or for your Heirs, out of their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Nor chuse to endure the tediousness
and hardships of a Jayl for your Life, to
supersede all Legal Remedy against
your Heir, for your Debts, which he
cannot be sued for a second time, after
you have dyed a Prisoner for them. For
this is paying very dear for doing
wrong, and denying Men their own;
and is certainly the way to carry off a
very unrighteous and guilty Conscience
with you, and to leave the Curse of ill
Reserved Goods and of unpaid Debts,
to your Heirs who survive you.</p>
               <p>And seek not to Tricks, or any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest
Fetches and Misuse of the Law,
to set aside Debts, or put them off and
postpone them, instead of paying them.
Nor spend any of your Money, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding,
or hindring your Creditors of
their just Right, which is all little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107127:21"/>
it may be too little, towards
the honest Satisfaction of it.</p>
               <p>And if by your Insolvency, any of
your Creditors are brought against
their wills to abate Part rather than
lose all, look on that Part as respited
not remitted, and pay it afterwards (if
God enable you) in the Sum it self, or
(if you cannot do that) be studious to
make it up in Good Offices and Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Services, and for the rest have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to God by Prayers in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
And what after-Recompences
you make them, do the same with
Good-Will, chearfully, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and thank them heartily for
their Patience and Kindness, in being
Content to want it so long as they
have done, when you do at last
pay them the sum it self, or, when
you cannot do that, in accepting your
services in lieu thereof.</p>
               <p>And having first taken this upright
care of your Creditors, and of their
Payments, then look to your self, and
provide the best you can for your own
Maintenance. If you have any thing
of your own left, after your Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
are satisfied, live frugally and
thankfully upon it. If you have not,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107127:22"/>
then you are called to get your Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
still as you need it, and in the
way of Honest Industry look up to God
<hi>to give you day by day your daily bread.</hi>
If he has enabled you to seek this,
by earning it for your self in any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Labour or Business, look on that as
the best way, and plie it with Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and Contentedness. But if thro
disability, or the numerousness of your
Family, or otherwise, you need to be
helped out by Gifts of Charity, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
your self to your state, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
your necessities modestly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an Alms with Thankfulness. First
represent your wants to your near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
who are more especially bound
to relieve the needs <hi>of their own House;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 4, 8.</note>
and then to any other Charitable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as your Case requires.</p>
               <p>And whether you Live by Alms, or
by taking Pains, bear always in your
mind, that you are called to act the
Part, and discharge the Duties, of a
poor Estate: And let it be your daily
study, to bring your mind to it, and
to think only of having such accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as are fit for a Poor Man; not
such as you had whilst you were in a
wealthier condition.</p>

               <head>Brief Directions
FOR
BOTH. III. General Directions for
both.</head>
               <p>BUT when Men are Prisoners,
whether for Debt or for Crimes,
they will be like to groan espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where they are kept long in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
under the burden of <hi>Solitude,</hi> or
<hi>Want,</hi> or both. They are shut up
from their Friends and Acquaintance;
and are much streightned for Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
or it may be for Necessaries.
And for a Conclusion of these Advices,
I shall give them some <hi>Brief Directions</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:107127:23"/>
for their due Reception thereof, and
for their Carriage and Improvement
under each of these bitter Ingredients,
and sorrowful Appendages of the State
of poor Prisoners.</p>
               <p>And first as for <hi>Solitude,</hi> that indeed
is a punishment as coming to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their wills, as their imprisonment
is; but nothing is more fit to be their
Choice, if they will make Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
their Business. For he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from the World, who would fall
in earnest to converse with God, and
to look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> himself. The greatest
Saints fall to this at certain times, as
the best means of evening their Accounts
with God, and perfecting their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
And all Men have Reason
enough to wish for some such thing,
before their Deaths! Especially if these
dying Persons are but young Penitents.
For when Men at first enter upon the
great work of Repentance, 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
advisable, and more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
needful for them, to retire
from the Noise, and Business, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
of the World, that they may
have little else to do, but to attend it.
And that they may keep out of the way,
of their former evil courses, till they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107127:23"/>
have unlearnt them; and of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Acquaintance and Companions,
till they can withstand and deny their
Sollicitations; and of those Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the World, which have ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
been too hard for them hitherto,
till they have considerately formed,
and fixed and fortified their Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
to such a Degree, as may be
able to overcome them.</p>
               <p>Let the Prisoners therefore make
Repentance their Work and Business
in Prison, as I have advised them in the
foregoing Directions, and then they may
Thank their Prosecutors for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of their Solitude and Melancholly
Retirement, and make it their own hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
desire and free choice. If they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it to converse with God, and to
know and amend themselves, which
they may do if they please, and will do
if they are wise to do well for themselves,
their Confinement will be as good to
them in a Jayl, as it is to a <hi>Devoto</hi> in
his Cell, and may be as wellcome to
them when put upon them by others,
as his is to him when he seeks it for
himself. And thus, what God sends
to punish your Sins, O, ye poor Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
by your wise use thereof, you
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107127:24"/>
will turn to cure them. And this alone
will change that Confinement! Which
may come upon you as a Curse, into
the greatest blessing.</p>
               <p>And to make that Confinement easy
to you in the Practice, which this
way will be so blessed and beneficial
in the Effects, keep your Fancy from
running out after the Noise, the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and busy Occupations and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
of the World. Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and roving Desires abroad, are
the greatest sting in being shut up. But
keep your Mind at home, and your
Desires within bounds, and the want
of those Liberties abroad which you
Covet not, and which you daily see do
hurt to others, and have formerly done
very much to your self, will sit light
upon you.</p>
               <p>And Consider, that as you are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
kept out of the Injoyment and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
so are you likewise out of the
Temptations, and, if you please, may
be out of the Cares of this World.
And ordinarily the Temptations of
Liberty have more of Danger, and of the
Cares of Trouble and Sorrow, than
the Injoyments thereof can fairly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:107127:24"/>
And if you are shut up from your
Friends, you are shut up also from
your Enemies. For a Prison is a
Guard against all other Wrongs, and
you are safe there in Stirrs and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
in Publick and in Private Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
And though it be hard to be
without the Company of those that
Love us, yet is it no despicable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
if thereby we are secured
from the Envious and Malicious, and
from the further attempts of all that
hate us. For ordinarily we are not
to promise our Selves so great Effects
from the kindness of our Friends, as
we have reason to apprehend from the
malice of our Enemies; Spite and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
being usually more industrious and
watchful of opportunities to shew it self,
and eager to do it to the full, than Love
is.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you Fancy, that now you
are as one taken almost out of the
World. But what if you be? You
have seen Evil enough, and Done too
much in it, to be fond of it; and
this Recess from the World, affords
you great advantages of making your
Self ten thousand times more happy in
another World. And if imprisonment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107127:25"/>
is bidding adieu to the World, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that this Time of your Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Prison, is not the first Time
of your Renouncing the World. For
every Christian doth this, when he is
Baptized. They all Profess to be as
Persons out of this World, and to keep
Hearts free and loose from it, and
to live above it: And if People are
really of this mind, it will not affect
them much, wheresoever God calls them
to make their abode in it.</p>
               <p>You are restrained also to one Place,
and must move but in a narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass.
But if by Gods blessing, you can
have your Health, and be easy and
quiet under this Confinement to one
Place, may you not well be contented
not to change whilst you are well, and
whilst the will of God is so, rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
without trying new Places. And
if it please God to send sickness, tho'
you were at Home, sickness would tye
you to your own House, or it may be
to your Bed, which is a narrower
Compass than a Prison is. 'Tis worse
being Prisoner to a Disease than to
the Keepers of Common Prisons.
And Diseases, as the worst of Jaylors,
bring their Prisoners into such a close
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107127:25"/>
Custody, as is much more irksome and
afflictive, than any other is. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
others, you are shut up, indeed, but
that is to sit at Ease and Rest. But
under a Disease, you are shut up too,
and likely closer confined, and that
to have constant Pain and Sorrow with
it.</p>
               <p>But whatever Restraints you are under
in Prison, as to your Body; yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that even there your Mind is
Free. Your Thoughts may go abroad,
and run over all the great Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of your Life, and fetch in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enough to busy your self withal,
even all those things thro all your
Life, which you should be sensible
were done ill, and which you have yet
space before you dye, to correct and
make better, You have liberty to
think as much as you please, of
God, and of your Self, of the Joys of
Heaven, and the Terrors of Hell, and
the Vanity of this World, and of all
things else, which may either direct
or comfort you, and be of use either
to your Soul or Body. Nay, the
more your Body is restrained, and the
less you have left to mind of other
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hings, the more liberty you have for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107127:26"/>
these thoughts. And therefore if spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things and employments are your
design, instead of being a place of
Incumbrance and Restraint, your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is a place of Leisure and Freedom.
<hi>Take away</hi> the Name of Prison, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
advises, and <hi>Call it a Recess;</hi>
and that is no Let, but the Greatest
Opportunity and advantage to true
Penitents, and Spiritually and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
minded Persons.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> as for the other
embitterment of <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Poverty;</hi>
when God is pleased to send it too, be
patient under it, and set your selves to
gain as much as you can by it. And if
you please, you may gain abundance
more thereby in spiritual Exercises and
Improvements, than your bearing all its
temporal hardships and inconveniences
will amount to.</p>
               <p>When you are brought therefore to
a poor Estate, be sure you take Care
to be poor in Spirit, or to have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Thoughts or Desires as I hinted before,
after the Fineries and Satisfactions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
this World, but what are suited to
your Poverty. Do not let your Desire
run, or your Fancy please it self with
the Thoughts of what Table yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:107127:26"/>
kept, what Servants you retain'd, what
Garments you wore, what Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
you had, or Respects you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
once. But look now only for
such things, as are fit for a Person in
your present want, and poor estate, to
desire and think of.</p>
               <p>As a poor man then, be Content if
you are reduced to a course and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Dyet, and a mean Habit, and an
hard Bed. Be Content if you have
nothing else but Necessaries, which God
provides for all his Creatures, even the
<hi>Beasts of the Field,</hi> and the <hi>Birds of
the Air,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 26.</note> who, as our Lord observes,
have no Contrivance to <hi>lay up Stores</hi>
for themselves. Nay, esteem and own
your Self unworthy, even of these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Provisions, and think it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be contented with them, but
be Thankful for them. And seek them
without Solicitude, or Mistrusts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
But after a chearful Care
spent in the best ways you have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
them, quietly rely on God; and
trust him for them. Do what you can,
to have them of your own; if that
succeeds not, ask of them, who are
like to Pity and Relieve you, and if
one denies you, try others; but if
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107127:27"/>
that misses too, God will send it, and
put it into the Hearts of those to give
whom you do not ask, and send it to
you, you know not how.</p>
               <p>And in your Poverty, be sure you
be Humble. Be willing and contented
to be maintained what way God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And if he brings your State to
need an Alms, let not your Spirit be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
it. Think not your self too good,
to receive, nor if need be modestly to
ask it. And be Patient where you
meet with Repulses, and Thankful for
all that is given you, whether it be
little or much; yea, even for good
words and compassionate answers where
you receive nothing else. And if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a poor estate, you can, by Gods
Grace, arrive to this true Poverty of
Spirit, you are a very Rich Poor Man;
you are Poor in this World, but <hi>Rich
in Faith and Good Works,</hi> as our Blessed
Saviour Christ, and his Apostles, and
earliest Saints for the most part were;
and may comfortaby hope thro his
Grace, to have your humble, holy, and
obedient Poverty rewarded at last toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with theirs, with unspeakable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Honour, and Happiness in
his Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:107127:27"/>
And having after this sort Received,
and Improved, both your Poverty, and
your Solitude, look upon them again, with
a discerning and impartial Eye, and then
tell me what Cause you have to Repine,
or Complain of them. Judge of them,
not by the Opinions which other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
pass, but by the good Use which
you your Self make of them. They
are certainly Good, exceeding Good
to you, when you Receive and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them after this manner; and
therefore are things, not only for you
to bear, but to Bless God, and be
Heartily Thankful unto Him for.</p>

                        <p>O! Therefore, gracious Father,
suffer me not to yeild to any

my Life. Make me diligent, in
all innocent ways, and means,
for my Preservation, and direct
me to the wisest. But let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to none that is ill, nor say
or do any thing for my own
Defence at my Tryal here, which
will rise up against me, and be
Matter of Accusation, when I
come to be tryed again at thy
dreadful Bar. And the less care
I may seem capable hereby, to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107127:44"/>
take of my self; the more do
thou care for me, O! My God.
And when my Cause comes to
be heard, so order things by
thy Mercy, that there may not be
a full evidence produced against
me; and that neither the Judge,
nor Jury, may be disposed to
stretch things to my Prejudice;
that so thy Servant may escape.</p>

fresh upon my Spirit, and
let me ever be praising thee
for the same, with joyful Lips.
Never suffer me to forget
the vows, which I made in
my distress; but let my whole
life be one acceptable Sacrifice
to thee my Redeemer, and make
all my actions to shew forth thy
Praise. When I was in Trouble,
O! Blessed Lord, it was not so
much out of the love of Life,
as out of the love of innocence,
that I desire to be Respited. Oh!
Grant me Grace now to employ
my Life, as I then designed to
do and to make good now, what
I did then pretend. Fix me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
in all the ways of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
which I have begun. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
me from Repeating any of
my former wickednesses, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
this Great one, which was

so like to bring down vengeance
on my Head for all the Rest.</p>
                        <p>Tho I am cleared thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, yet I know, O! Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Lord, that I shall ever
stand Guilty of it before thee,
unless I shew true amendment
of the same, and make Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
for all the wrongs done
to any thereby, in the best sort
I can. Oh! Keep me ever ready
to do that fully, whatever it
cost me; and carefully to slip
no opportunities of doing the
same. And make me so watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
to spend all the remainder
of my Days, in all holy and
Thankful obedience, that I may
not only have the Purposes and
Promises of Repentance, which,
alas! was a great part of what
I had to shew before, but the
Proofs thereof to produce, and
to comfort my heart withal on
any new Alarm. And then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
O! Gracious God, when thou

Spare not the Rod of Discipline

there is need thereof to make me

be thro present Misery, if that
alone can keep me in the way
to thine eternal Mercy. Which

leave the guilt and curse of ill

with me, to the utmost of that
worldly estate, which I have to
dispose of: And ready to give
every man what I owe him,
tho' I keep nothing to my self,
but am left thereby to live upon
thy good Providence. If want
must be my share, Oh! Let me
want the Conveniences, or even
the necessaries of Life, rather
than the innocence thereof. And
grant good Lord, that the place

if thou pleasest, by thy good

me in my ways, that I may
have enough wherewithal to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
all their just Demands, and
give me an Heart to pay it out
accordingly, and that with
thankfulness for their Forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and without unnecessary
delays. And dispose them to
have patience with me, till
this can be done. And suffer
not me in the least to abuse that
Patience; but make me apply
my self diligently, to raise it
for them, as fast as I can, and
honestly to pay it to them as fast
as I can raise it for them.</p>

But if I am not able to pay

grant them the Heart to forgive

is <hi>given to the Poor;</hi> look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

As they very charitably
consider my Necessities, do thou
carefully prevent theirs: And
whatsoever they abate to me of
my Scores, do thou make up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
to them and theirs
by thy good Providence.</p>
                        <p>And after they have forgiven
me, tho I am no longer answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them in Law, yet make
me ever sensible, O! God, that
I still owe the same to them in
Equity. And give me always
the heart to repay, whatsoever
they Acquit, if ever thou shalt
put me in a Capacity, either
by proper Payments, or by
grateful Offices, so to do. And

by living always in this inward

Mind, to do them all exact
