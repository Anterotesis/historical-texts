            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the Fourth Act come the Messengers with sad Tidings, which, with the reflections and troubles thereupon, and the <hi>Chorus,</hi> fill out this Act.</p>
            <p>In the Last, <hi>Xerxes</hi> himself arrives, which gives occasion of condoling, houling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction enough, to the end of the Tragedy.</p>
            <p>One may imagine how a <hi>Grecian</hi> Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that lov'd their Countrey, and glory'd in the Vertue of their Ancestors wou'd be affected with this Representation.</p>

            <p>Were a Tragedy after this Model to be drawn for our Stage, <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> are too far from us: The Scene must be laid nearer home: As at the <hi>Louvre;</hi> and instead of <hi>Xerxes</hi> we might take <hi>John,</hi> King of <hi>Francc,</hi> and the Battel of <hi>Poictiers.</hi> So if the <hi>Germans</hi> or <hi>Spaniards</hi> were to compose a Play, on the Bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>IN the former Play, our Poet might be the bolder, the persons being all his own Creatures, and meer fiction. But here he sins not against Nature and Philosophy only, but against the most known History, and the memory of the Noblest Romans, that ought to be sacred to all Posterity. He might be familiar with <hi>Othello</hi> and <hi>Jago,</hi> as his own natural acquaintance: but <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> were above his conversation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To put them in Fools Coats, and make them Jack-puddens in the <hi>Shakespear</hi> dress, is a <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> beyond any thing in <hi>Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> The Truth is, this authors head was full of villainous, unnatural images, and histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry has only furnish'd him with great names, thereby to recommend them to the World; by writing over them, <hi>This is</hi> Brutus; <hi>this is</hi> Cicero; <hi>this is</hi> Caesar. But generally his History flies in his Face; And comes in flat contradiction to the Poets imagination. As for example: of <hi>Brutus</hi> says <hi>Antony,</hi> his Enemy.</p>

Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spears</hi> genius lay for Comedy and Humour. In Tragedy he appears quite out of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; his Brains are turn'd, he raves and rambles, without any coherence, any spark of reason, or any rule to controul him, or set bounds to his phrenzy. His imagination was still running after his Masters, the Coblers, and Parish Clerks, and <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Stroulers.</hi> So he might make bold with <hi>Portia,</hi> as they had done with the Virgin Mary.
