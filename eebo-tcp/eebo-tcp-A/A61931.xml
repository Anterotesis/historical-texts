            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Subſtance of the PETITION</head>
            <head type="sub">Of <hi>Henry Farmer, Ralph Sheldon, Thomas Stoner, John Weedon,</hi>
               <abbr>Eſqrs;</abbr> and <hi>Winfird Brooke</hi> Widow, <hi>Papiſts,</hi> praying to be heard by their Council againſt the BILL, for the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of all Lands and Revenues given to <hi>Popiſh</hi> Superſtitious Uſes; and for applying the ſame to <hi>Greenwich</hi> Hoſpital.</head>
            <p>THAT the pretended Diſcovery made upon the Petition of <hi>Lewis Girard</hi> and others, is an Inquiſition taken at <hi>Wheately</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> the 16th of <hi>October</hi> laſt, before <hi>John la Pradel,</hi> and other Strangers and Foreigners, on the Oath of one <hi>Nevil,</hi> and other obſcure means Perſons, whereby without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any Deed, or a Copy of any Deed, their Eſtates (which they hold under Marriage Settlements) are found to be given to Superſtitious Uſes.</p>
            <p>That the Commiſſioners never returned the ſaid Inquiſition into the <hi>Petty-Bag-Office</hi> or <hi>Exchequer,</hi> as by Law they ought, ſo they were deprived of their Traverſe, and ſuch Juſt Mean<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as the Law allowed, to defend their Poſſeſſions and Titles; and that they doubt not, but to make it fully appear, that the ſaid Inquiſition was found by undue Means, and contrary to all Truth; and that <hi>Girard</hi> and his Accomplices (under pretence of Diſcovery) are ſeeking to mend their Broken Fortunes out of their Eſtates.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="response_to_petition">
            <head>Reaſons and Anſwers offered to the Matters Objected in this PETITION.</head>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> IT's admitted ſuch an Inquiſition was taken before <hi>Pradel</hi> and Three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen Commiſſioners, all Strangers in the County, and that the Eſtates of the Petitioners, with others, were fully proved by ſeveral Credible Witneſſes (to the great Satisfaction of the Jury) to be given to Popiſh Superſtitious Uſes, as well by Abſtract, and Copys of Deeds, as otherwiſe by Execution of Conveyances and Deeds of Truſt at the Synod, when the Pope's <hi>Nuntio</hi> was in <hi>London,</hi> in the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Time: And the Commiſſioners being all Strangers, is a great Evidence, and a ſtrong Preſumption, that the Inquiſition was fairly taken, and without any pretence of any ill Practies; and that the Petitioners, or ſome Friends for them appeared, and made great Intereſt to ſtop the finding of the ſaid Inquiſition.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Girard</hi> being adviſed, that the further Proceedings upon the ſaid Inquiſition was very Hazardous and Expenſive, and in all probability he could expect little or no Benefit thereby upon any Tryal, (as the preſent Laws now ſtand, in relation to Popiſh Superſtitious Uſes) was the reaſon the ſame was not Filed, nor are the Commiſſioners enjoined by the Commiſſion, or obliged to return the ſame. And ſure the not Filing thereof, was rather in favour of the Petitioners than a prejudice, and ſaved them the Charge of Traverſing the ſaid Inquiſition; and that three or four Gentlemen concerned with Mr. <hi>Girard</hi> in this Proſecution, are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of undoubted Characters, and lovers of the Proteſtant Religion, and their Country and of plentiful Fortunes.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly,</hi> The Inquiſition is barely an Inqueſt of Office, to give the King a Title, ſo as to ground an Information upon for a Tryal, or to grant the ſame Petitioners not being in any ſort thereby diveſted of their Freehold; the Eſtates thereby found in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> being of great Value.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4thly,</hi> By the Report of the Committee, it appeared that Mr. <hi>Girard</hi> not only produced ſeveral Witneſſes to prove the Allegation of his Petition, beſides the ſaid Inquiſition and Report; but alſo then, and now offers (for the greater Solemnity of the Matter) to try the ſame at the Bar.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5thly,</hi> This Act, as it is now ſetled, is a General Law, and does not in the leaſt relate either to <hi>Girard,</hi> or to the Petitioners, or to any particular Perſons whatſoever, nor does it diveſt the Petitioners or any other Perſon of their Eſtates, without a legal Tryal, (where they will be fully heard as to their Titles.) And a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made for the Proſecutors to give Security, to anſwer Coſts. So the Labouring Oar and Difficulty is upon them: And to avoid all pretences of diſquieting the Subject in his Poſſeſſion, Mr. <hi>Girard</hi> before the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, propoſed to go no further back than the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Time. So it is plain, this Petition is only put in to obſtruct the Paſſing of the Bill, upon the Cloſe of the Seſſion: And by the Bill the Eſtates and Intereſt; of all Proteſtants are ſaved.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6thly,</hi> As the preſent Laws now ſtand, the Papiſts may be diſquieted, and put to Charge and Expence of Suits, and no Proviſion or Satisfaction for Coſts, which this Act has fully provided for, and puts them in a better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as to that Matter, than they were in before, and is the faireſt offer that ever was made in this Nature, and will be of great Advantage, in ſtrengthning the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> in this Kingdom.</p>
