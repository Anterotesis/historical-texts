            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hutchinſon</hi> of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of <hi>Queens Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed your neareſt Relations whom you ſo earneſtly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to pervert: Your <hi>Stile</hi> perſwadeth me that you are <hi>ſerious,</hi> and verily think that your way is right: And I ſuppoſe you ſee that we alſo are as confident of the truth of our Profeſſion, as you are of yours: The Queſtion is, whether it be <hi>your</hi> Zeal, or <hi>ours,</hi> that is according to Knowledge?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60973:3"/>
The Title of your Religion greatly pleaſeth me, and is the ſame that I aſſume: For we are, I perceive, agreed in this, that it is <hi>[the Apoſtolical Chriſtianity]</hi> that is the true and ſafe Religion: And hath God left the matter ſo obſcure as that we cannot come to an agreement in ſo weighty a matter of Fact, as to know what <hi>[the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Chriſtianity]</hi> was; when even Common Hiſtory giveth us notice what the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſophers held, and what the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> held, and ſo of almoſt every literate Nation? <hi>You</hi> ſtudy, and <hi>we</hi> ſtudy; <hi>You</hi> pray, and <hi>we</hi> pray: You would know the truth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt you, and ſo would We. As a Man that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth daily when I am called away to God, I ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, that if I could find that Popery were the true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Chriſtianity, I would joyfully quit all the Friends, Hope, and Intereſts of this World, to embrace it. What is it that is your advantage, and what is our diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? Are you more impartial in your ſearch? I am ſo Conſcious of my Impartiality, that I cannot believe that this maketh the difference. Is it that we have not read the Papiſts writings? I have reaſon to believe that I have read as many of them, at leaſt, as you have done, if you are not much above ſixty years of age (as I hear you are not near it). But you have Converſed with more of them than I have done? It's like you have: But is that the reaſon of my miſtake? You earneſtly invite your Relations to Converſe with the Papiſts, becauſe mens <hi>writings</hi> may be miſtaken: And on this ground I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you build all the certainty of your Faith, That <hi>our Fathers</hi> and <hi>our Grand-Fathers</hi> have told us Infallibly, what they received from their Fathers and Grand-Fathers, and ſo on. This is your certainty.</p>
            <p>I will tell you briefly what I take for the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60973:3"/>
               <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and by what Notices I receive it; and then I will again conſider yours.</p>
            <p>I take not <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to be a thing ſo hardly to be known, as you would make it; either as to <hi>the Being</hi> of it, or the <hi>Publication.</hi> I take it to have its <hi>Eſſentials, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grals,</hi> and <hi>Accidentals;</hi> and that theſe are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded: If it cannot be readily known what Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, how ſhall we preach it to Heathens? or how ſhall Chriſtians be known to others, or themſelves? and who can have the comfort of an unknown Religion?</p>
            <p>You tell us that nothing of it is <hi>written</hi> in the New Teſtament, but the Life of Chriſt by four Men, and a few occaſional Epiſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But do you think that Chriſt himſelf did not inſtitute Chriſtianity, and tell Men plainly what it was? Did not thoſe four Men write <hi>Chriſt's Doctrine</hi> as well as his <hi>Life?</hi> And is he not the <hi>Author of our Faith?</hi> Did he not preach the Goſpel? And do you not call theſe four Books the four Evangeliſts? And doth not the Goſpel contain and deſcribe Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Did not Chriſt oft tell us what it is to be his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? And were not the Diſciples called Chriſtians ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, as words of the ſame ſignification? But what place is there for any doubt, when Chriſt himſelf did inſtitute Baptiſm, and deſcribe it? and command that all Nations being Diſcipled ſhould be Baptized into the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; as being the Faith which Diſciples muſt profeſs? And do not you to this day profeſs, that Baptizing is Chriſtening, and that Baptiſm waſheth away all ſin, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Baptized to receive it as Baptiſm, by true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-conſent at leaſt?) And doth not Baptiſm enter us into the true Church of Chriſt? Sure all this is paſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute; where then is the difficulty? Is not a truly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60973:4"/>
Perſon a Chriſtian? And was it then as hard a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as you make it, to know <hi>what Faith was neceſſary to Baptiſm,</hi> (in the Perſon at age, or the Parent of Infants?) Surely then the Scripture, that mentioneth the Hiſtory of ſo many thouſands baptized, would have told us of that grand Controverſie, and how it was decided. But no ſuch Controverſie was then debated, for ought we there find. If Baptiſmal Covenanting with God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as our God and Father reconciled in Chriſt, our Saviour, and our Sanctifier, be not the <hi>Symbol</hi> or <hi>Badge</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that which viſibly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ſuch; your own Church, and all the Chriſtian World is deceived. And we know that it was not the Cuſtom of the Apoſtles and Paſtors of the ancient Churches, to make a meer Ceremony and dead Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Baptiſm, by baptizing thoſe that would but ſay the words <hi>[I believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,]</hi> without underſtanding what they ſaid: And therefore their ordinary Preaching was the Expoſition of theſe three Articles: And the Creed called The Apoſtles, is the Expoſition of theſe three Articles; which though ſome Clauſes were ſince added, and though the Churches tyed not themſelves juſt to the very ſame words, (as we find by the various forms of this Creed in <hi>Irenaeus, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Marcellus's</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius, Ruffinus, &amp;c.)</hi> yet for the ſubſtance and ſenſe, and moſt of the very words, all Churches uſed the ſame. And when the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> taught them the way of making new Creeds, (which <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Pictav.</hi> ſo ſadly complaineth of,) yet ſtill the matter of the old Creed was the ſubſtance of them all. And the Eaſtern Creed, which was uſed before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, (for that ſuch a one there was, the moſt Learned Antiquaries give us ſufficient proof,) was but the ſame in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60973:4"/>
ſenſe as the Weſtern, even the Expoſition of the Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Faith; and this the Baptized did profeſs before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: And the work of Catechiſts was to teach this and the ſenſe of it to the Catechumens. And that <hi>[He that believeth and is baptized</hi> (that is, truly devoted to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, by the Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned,]</hi> is by Chriſt himſelf made the ſum of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or Law of Grace.</p>
            <p>As the Image of the bleſſed Trinity on mans Soul is <hi>Life, Light,</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> ſo the ſummaries of that ſacred Doctrine which muſt imprint it on us, is the <hi>Symbolum Fidei,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> the ſummary of things to be <hi>believed;</hi> and the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Symbolum</hi> and ſummary of things to be <hi>willed, deſired,</hi> and <hi>ſought;</hi> and the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> the ſummary of <hi>things to be practiſed;</hi> being the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of Mans three Faculties, the <hi>Intellect,</hi> the <hi>will,</hi> and the <hi>Executive Power.</hi> And all this we believe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Churches by the Apoſtles, and received by all Chriſtians, many years (eight at leaſt) before any Book of the New Teſtament was written: And for the fuller underſtanding and improvement of it, and for all the integral parts of Religion that were to be added, the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts more enlargedly preached them to the People in their Sermons, as Chriſt himſelf had done much of them. We receive all that, as Gods Word, which by theſe Apoſtles was delivered as ſuch to the Churches; becauſe they had the promiſe of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to lead them into all truth, and to bring all things that Chriſt taught and commanded to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. We are aſſured that all that is contained in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was written by ſuch <hi>inſpired Perſons;</hi> and that the Spirit of God will knew, that when they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60973:5"/>
were to dye, without written Records, the memory of Mankind would not faithfully retain, and deliver to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, ſuch copious matter as the <hi>Integrals</hi> and uſeful <hi>Accidentals</hi> of Religion, and therefore cauſed them to write it and leave it to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>So that our Chriſtian Religion is contained and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in <hi>three Formulas</hi> or <hi>Preſcripts:</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the <hi>whole Eſſence of Chriſtianity,</hi> and is the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Covenant,</hi> in which we are believingly given up to God the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and God to us, in the Relation of a God and Father, a Saviour and a Sanctifier. This is done initially, <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> in Baptiſm, and after <hi>ad robur</hi> in the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> This is delivered to us by <hi>Tradition Naturally Infallible, de facto:</hi> For <hi>all Chriſtians, as ſuch,</hi> have received and entred this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Covenant;</hi> and full Hiſtory aſſureth us, that the very ſame Form of it is come down in all the Churches to this day.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Formula,</hi> is the <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of this Sacramental Covenant, in the <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Decalogue;</hi> which hath been delivered by memory alſo, and kept unchanged (ſave the foreſaid additions of ſome explicatory words in the <hi>Creed,)</hi> to all the Churches to this day.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Form,</hi> is <hi>all the holy Canonical Scriptures,</hi> (the Old Teſtament being as preparatory to the New,) which contain all the <hi>Eſſentials, Integrals, and needful Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Religion then is all from Chriſt and his Spirit, in inſpired men, commiſſioned to deliver it, and is well called as you do, the <hi>Apoſtolical Chriſtianity:</hi> We own no other. It is all brought down to us by Tradition from the Apoſtles. The <hi>Eſſentials</hi> in the Covenant, and the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60973:5"/>
explicatory Symbols or Summaries, are delivered to us two ways: Firſt by <hi>Memory and Practice</hi> moſt currant and certain from Generation to Generation, being no more than what Memory might well retain, whereto yet the helps of the <hi>Ancients Writings</hi> reciting the Forms were uſed for the fuller certainty of Poſterity. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> where they are contained (as the <hi>Brain, Heart,</hi> and <hi>Stomach,</hi> in the Body) among all the reſt as the <hi>Principal</hi> Parts. The third form is ſo large that Memory could not preſerve it, and therefore God would have it delivered us in that Writing which we all call the Sacred Bible, or Canonical Scripture. This containeth thouſands of words more than are of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to Salvation; but no more than is uſeful or helpful to Salvation.</p>
            <p>In all this I have ſhewed you what our Religion is, <hi>(Objectively</hi> taken) and which way we receive it. Where you are therefore to note, 1. That all our Sermons, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, Church-Articles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but the Expreſſions of our <hi>Subjective Religion,</hi> telling other Men how parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Men, and particular Churches, underſtand thoſe <hi>Divine Forms</hi> which are our <hi>Objective</hi> Religion: Theſe are various as Churches and Perſons are, every one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his own Faith and Religion in different meaſures, and ſuch expreſſions being but our <hi>ſides menſurata</hi> may be altered and amended, and we pretend not to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them: But the former being our <hi>ſides vel Religio menſurans,</hi> our <hi>Divine Objective</hi> Faith or Religion, is inculpable and unalterable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Note that <hi>you Papiſts</hi> do grant all <hi>our Objective Faith and Religion,</hi> even every word of it, to be <hi>true, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of God:</hi> You own, I ſay, every word of <hi>our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> That is, all the <hi>Sacramental Covenant,</hi> all the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60973:6"/>
               <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer, and Decalogue,</hi> and all that which we call the holy <hi>Canonical Scriptures.</hi> But we own not all yours: So that you do not, you cannot find fault with the leaſt Particle of our Religion as to the truth of it; but, 1. You think that it is not <hi>enough:</hi> And 2. That we come not to it the right way, that is, we take not our Faith upon the word of Papiſts, as Papiſts. Is not this the difference? And is not this all that you cry out againſt us for?</p>
            <p>And now let us ſee whether your way be better and ſurer than this of ours is?</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Your Religion is much Bigger than ours.</item>
               <item>II. You hold it on other Reaſons, and plead another way of receiving it.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. Your Religion (Objective) containeth, beſides all our Bible, all the <hi>Apocryphal Books,</hi> and all the <hi>Decrees of General Councils,</hi> and all the other <hi>un-written Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> (if there be any more, who knows what?) you name your ſelf here, <hi>faſting on Frydays, and on the vigils of Saints, Ember-days, Lent, and Images,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Here now we humbly propoſe to your conſideration; 1. Whether you will take all theſe into the <hi>Eſſentials of Chriſtianity,</hi> or not? If not, a Man may be <hi>a Chriſtian;</hi> and conſequently of the Church or Body of Chriſt, and in a ſtate of Salvation without them. Why then do you deny them this, and make them to be as out of the true Church and ſtate of Life? If yea,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Did all that the Apoſtles Baptized, believe all the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> and all the <hi>Decrees of your Councils,</hi> and your Oral Traditions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Did the ancient Fathers and Catechiſts teach all thoſe to the Catechumens before they Baptized them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 4. And were not thoſe all Chriſtians, and in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60973:6"/>
true Church, and in a ſtate of Life, whom the Apoſtles Baptized, without the profeſſion of any ſuch Belief?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 5. What was the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Symbolum fidei</hi> uſed for, if not to diſtinguiſh the Faith of the Chriſtian Church from Infidelity, Hereſie, and all without? And if all the Decrees of Councils be as neceſſary to be the <hi>Symbol of Faith,</hi> why were they not all made up into a Creed? and why is the Creed differenced from them all to this day? And why do you not cauſe the Baptized to recite and profeſs all theſe Councils Decrees, but only the old Chriſtian Creed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 6. Doth not Chriſt at the Inſtitution of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. expreſly promiſe that <hi>he that believeth</hi> (according to Baptiſm, in the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt) ſhall be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 7. Is it not a reproach to God and the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to tell the World that God hath written us by his Spirit ſo great a Book as the Bible is, and yet there is not in it enough to Salvation, but that abundance <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary</hi> to Salvation is in it, and ſome neceſſary things left out?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 8. Have your Oral ſuperadded Traditions more <hi>Evidence of Truth than the Bible,</hi> or more <hi>Evidence of Neceſſity</hi> to be believed? Not more Evidence of <hi>Truth:</hi> For you confeſs the certain <hi>Truth</hi> of all the Bible, and that as fully manifeſt as your Additions. If it have more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> what is it? It is not becauſe it is a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation:</hi> For ſo you confeſs all the Bible to be? And do you pretend to a Tradition that ſaith, [You may be ſaved without moſt of the Bible, though it be of God, but not without faſting on <hi>Frydays,</hi> or on the Vigils of Saints-days, or other ſuch Traditions?] But if you will make both the whole <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Tradition neceſſary to be</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60973:7"/>
               <hi>believed,</hi> it muſt be either Explicitely, or as you call it, <hi>Implicitely:</hi> If Explicitely, (that is, as each Point is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly underſtood and believed,) then it's doubtful whether there be one Man in the World that is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and can be ſaved? If <hi>Implicitely,</hi> that is, <hi>Virtually</hi> as it is in ſome General Propoſition, what is that <hi>General?</hi> Is it that <hi>All that God revealeth is true?</hi> Or that <hi>All that the Spirit of Chriſt in his Apoſtles delivered to the Church as his word, is true.</hi> Theſe we all agree in, if this will ſerve the turn? Is it that the Church is the <hi>Miniſterial Keeper</hi> of the Sacred Doctrine as delivered? This alſo we agree in. Or is it that <hi>the Church de eventu ſhall never corrupt, alter, or loſe, this word, or any part of it?</hi> If you mean it of every particular Church, we are agreed of the contrary. You confeſs that many Churches have fallen to Hereſie, and many Apoſtatized from the Faith: If you ſpeak of the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> we are agreed that the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> ſhall never Apoſtatize; for if Chriſt had no Church, he were no <hi>Head</hi> of it. And we are agreed that they ſhall never turn ſuch <hi>true Hereticks,</hi> as hold not truly <hi>all the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity:</hi> For ſuch alſo are <hi>no Chriſtians;</hi> becauſe each Eſſential part is neceſſary to the <hi>Eſſence.</hi> But whether the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> much more the <hi>Greater part,</hi> may not make or receive ſome culpable alteration by Amiſſion, Omiſſion, or Commiſſion, we have reaſon to queſtion? We never heard any Proof that the Negative was neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor is it held by all your ſelves; and whether by any one man I cannot tell: For you take the Bible to be Gods Word, and your knowledge of the various Readings of the Hebrew and Greek Copies, and the multitude of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in the Vulgar Latine corrected by <hi>P. Clem.</hi> 8. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. do ſatisfie all the World, that you hold that the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60973:7"/>
Univerſal Church, or the major part, even your own, may culpably erre, or alter the very written Word of God. And who would then believe you, if you ſaid, <hi>[But the Unwritten Word it cannot alter?]</hi> It's true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> conſidered, as Written or Unwritten, all the true Church, nor any one Chriſtian, while ſuch, cannot deny: But ſure, if many thouſand Errours may be found in that Book which you take your ſelves for the Word of God, and this through the fault or failing of ſuch as have had the keeping of it; and <hi>all Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> are to be <hi>believed,</hi> and all the <hi>Word of God is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation,</hi> it notoriouſly followeth, That your own Church hath not kept all that is <hi>matter of Divine Faith</hi> from alteration. So that though many of your Wranglers will not diſtinguiſh the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (called Fundamentals) from the <hi>Integrals</hi> and <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals,</hi> (as if Chriſtianity were nothing, and had no determinate Eſſence,) yet this ſheweth, that you muſt do it whether you will or not; or elſe you muſt confeſs that your Church may alter any thing, or every thing, as it hath done all theſe fore-mentioned: Which we will not confeſs of the Church Univerſal.</p>
            <p>But, I ſuppoſe that we have not yet met with the Faith that you account neceſſary to ſalvation: <hi>It is that the Pope of Rome, and a General Council, cannot erre, in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to us the Apoſtolical Doctrine to be believed.</hi> And this is an implicite believing of all that is written in Scripture, and that is delivered orally from the Apoſtles. If ſo, words and names go very far with you as to mens ſalvation. Is this to believe a thouſand things which a man never knew or heard of? if he do but believe the Infallibility of your Church? What! Believe that which I never once thought of? But this is but <hi>Implicite Faith?</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60973:8"/>
A cheating Name for <hi>No-belief of thoſe things:</hi> For by <hi>Implicite</hi> here you can mean only <hi>Virtual,</hi> and that is no <hi>Actual Belief</hi> of that thing at all, but of ſomething elſe, which would infer more were it known: Nay <hi>Virtual</hi> is too high a Name for it.</p>
            <p>But will this ſerve the turn to ſalvation, to believe that <hi>the Pope and his Council are Infallible?</hi> What! though the ſame Perſon believe not in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, nor any of the Articles of his Creed, no not a Life to come? If you ſay, Yea; Then will you call this Chriſtianity, to believe in the Pope, and not in Chriſt? Or do you mean, that men may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſtianity, but not without Popery? If ſo, why was not the Popes Name, rather than Chriſts, put into Baptiſm and the Creed, or at leaſt with Chriſts?</p>
            <p>But the inſuperable difficulty is, How muſt I believe that the Pope hath this Infallibility? From Chriſt, or otherwiſe? If not from Chriſt, tell me which way, and why I muſt believe it? If from Chriſt, can I believe that the Pope hath Power from Chriſt, before I believe that there is a Chriſt, that hath ſuch Power to give? And can I believe in Chriſt, and not believe that there is a God that ſent him? Can I believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, and not believe that he is a Sacrifice for ſin, or a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and Man, and came to ſave his People from their ſins? And can I believe this, and not believe that we are all ſinners, and that ſin deſerveth that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Chriſt came to ſave us from? Is not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and our Sin and Miſery relatives? as a Phyſician, or Medicine and a Diſeaſe? And can we believe that we have ſin and deſert of Puniſhment, without believing that God is our Governour, and gave us that Law which we broke, and which obligeth us to Puniſhment? Can
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60973:8"/>
we believe in Chriſt, and not believe that he is God and Man, that he dyed, roſe, and aſcended into Heaven, and will judge us at laſt? and that he pardoneth ſin, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Souls by his Spirit, and will give us life hereafter? All theſe are included in believing in Chriſt, as Chriſt. And how muſt I believe that Chriſt hath given the Pope this Infallibility or Power? By any written word which granteth it? or by Oral Tradition? If by the written Word, then I muſt believe that that Word is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can believe that the Pope is made Pope or Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by it? If by Oral Tradition, whoſe muſt that be? Then I muſt believe ſome bodies Oral Tradition as true and infallible, before I believe in the Pope at all. If it be the firſt Hearers of the Apoſtles, then either the Pope was one of thoſe, or not. If <hi>yea,</hi> and he hath a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Voice in the credible report, then I muſt believe him as Infallible, before he is proved Infallible, in order to my believing that he is <hi>Infallible,</hi> which is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. If <hi>Not,</hi> Then I muſt believe the Infallibility of <hi>other Hearers</hi> of the Apoſtles, before I can believe the Pope's? And the Queſtion will recur, How I ſhall know them to be Infallible? And who they were that were thoſe Infallible Witneſſes? Whether Paſtors only, or the People? Whether of ſome one Church, or of all the Churches? And how I ſhall prove that they gave ſuch a Teſtimony?</p>
            <p>So that your pretenſe of a Neceſſity of receiving Gods Word, or the Chriſtian Faith, from the Pope and his Council cometh too late: For it ſeemeth that we muſt believe it firſt, before it be poſſible to believe in the Pope and Council as authoriſed by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And if my Implicite Faith be the Belief of this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>[Any Church in all the world, yea, the greater part</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60973:9"/>
               <hi>of all the Churches, may err in matters of Faith, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize, and only the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>and his Council cannot:]</hi> What Proof, or whoſe Tradition doth this reſt upon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 9. Do not <hi>Bellarmine, Coſterus,</hi> and many of your Writers profeſs that the Scriptures contain all things ordinarily neceſſary to Salvation? Yea many Writers, that the Creed hath all that is abſolutely to be believed? Yea ſome, that it hath more than all? Yea abundance (Cited by <hi>Fr. a Sancta Clara)</hi> that the Belief in Chriſt is not neceſſary to all? And will you ſay then, that he that believeth Explicitely the <hi>whole Bible</hi> cannot be ſaved without believing alſo your pretended Traditions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 10. And do you not hereby, inſtead of the <hi>light bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and eaſie yoak</hi> of Chriſt, and his <hi>Commands which are not grievous,</hi> bring Chriſtians under a harder yoak than that which the <hi>Jews</hi> were not able to bear? When it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtles to impoſe but a few and neceſſary things, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. And how large a Law is all the Bible, and all your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Decrees, and Oral Traditions, ſet together? Do all your Prieſts themſelves, or one of an hundred, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them all, or know what they are?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 11. While you pretend a Neceſſity of your nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ceremonies, (as Faſting on <hi>Frydays,</hi> and ſuch other named by you,) do you not lay a ſnare of perpetual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in the Churches? and do you not make as many inconſiſtent Churches, as there be Societies of Chriſtians that differ (and ſtill will differ) about any of thoſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions or Ceremonies?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 12. And do you not lay open your own Church, to the accuſation of <hi>innovation, mutability,</hi> and <hi>corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> when it is not to be denyed, but in ſuch things as thoſe they have been mutable or innovated? Have you
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60973:9"/>
not long left the Cuſtom of <hi>adoring on the Lords-days without genuflexion,</hi> though the firſt great General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>(Nic. Can.</hi> 20.) and the ancient Fathers commonly, made it a Tradition, and Practice of the whole Church? and it was Decreed to be ſo uſed by all? Abundance of ſuch Inſtances may be given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 13. You do very injuriouſly to your own Sect and Cauſe, here to pretend Tradition as coming down from the Apoſtles, for ſuch things as your own Doctors plead but your Churches later Inſtitution for: It's fully proved by <hi>Daleus de jejuniis,</hi> that the Lent Faſt was long but for a ſhort time, before it came to fourty days: And it's an odd thing, if you will pretend Tradition from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for the Holy-days, or the Vigil Faſts, of thoſe Saints that were born many hundred years after the Apoſtles death?</p>
            <p>We confeſs our Faith is not ſo big as yours? We have many ſcore Texts of Scripture that promiſe Salvation to them that believe much leſs than the Bible it ſelf contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Yet we profeſs our ſelves ready to believe as much more as you ſhall ever prove to us, to have been delivered by the Apoſtles, to the Church, to be believed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And for the ſecond, (that we <hi>receive not our Faith the way that you do;</hi> that is, from the <hi>Authority of the Pope and Papiſts,</hi> and from <hi>your Tradition:)</hi> We crave your conſideration of theſe Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the Apoſtles <hi>(and Diſciples, Act.</hi> 8.) were ſcattered, and preached the Goſpel to many Nations, Were they not true Chriſtians, and ſaved, that received the Goſpel from any one of them, or from any Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? If <hi>Aquila</hi> or <hi>Priſcilla</hi> Converted a Sinner, ſuch a one ſaved a Soul from Death, though <hi>Peter</hi> did it not; nor his Authority was known to ſuch a one?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60973:10"/>
2. Do you believe that if the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Revelation or Propoſal were neceſſary to true Faith and to Salvation, that Chriſt would never have told Men ſo? Nor any of his Apoſtles have left it us on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord? When there were Hereſies and Schiſmes ſo wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully troubling the Churches as we find in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles to the <hi>Cor. Gal. Col.</hi> and in the <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. <hi>ch.</hi> ſhould we never have found one word for this ſpeedy way of deciſion, to appeal to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Would <hi>Paul</hi> have rebuked them for ſaying, <hi>I am of Cephas,</hi> and made him but a <hi>Miniſter by whom they believed,</hi> without ever mentioning his Office and Dignity? would he never have told the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of their Miſtriſ-ſhip and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility above the reſt? Would ſo neceſſary a Fundamental of Faith have been ſo much ſilenced?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Did the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, or ancient Fathers, uſe to Convert Infidels by any ſuch Method, and telling them that they muſt believe, firſt the Infallibility of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Clergie, and then believe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel becauſe he ſaith it is true? Had this been the old Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, would there not have been more Books neceſſary, and written, to prove this firſt Fundamental (the <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhop and his Councils)</hi> than to have proved the Goſpel it ſelf directly? Is it not a wonder that we ſhould have ſuch Volumes as <hi>Euſebius</hi> his <hi>Praeparatio &amp; Demonſtratio Evangel.</hi> and ſo many written by thoſe before and after him, to prove the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and none of them hit on this Method, nor write at large to make it good? The Churches Authority and Unity, is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaded againſt <hi>Hereſies and Schiſmes,</hi> but who ever <hi>Converted Infidels</hi> by the Authority of the Papal Church, either proved or aſſerted as the neceſſary <hi>Medium</hi> of Faith?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60973:10"/>
4. Do you not confeſs that all other Churches may erre beſides the <hi>Roman?</hi> And their plea of Tradition you account invalid: Your Book called <hi>[Conſiderations on the Council of Trent,</hi> by <hi>R. H.] p.</hi> 40. ſaith, <q>[<hi>All Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliary Definitions are not only Declarations and Teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of ſuch Apoſtolical Traditions as were left by them evident and conſpicuous in all Chriſtian Churches Planted by them; but are many times Determinations of Points deduced from, and neceſſary conſequents to, ſuch clear Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals, whether written or unwritten.</hi> 2. <hi>If the Acts of General Councils were only ſuch Declarations of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Tradition, yet it is poſſible that ſome particular Church, may in time, depart from ſuch a Tradition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to them; elſe how can any Church become Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal againſt any ſuch Tradition?</hi>]</q>
            </p>
            <p>Do you not at this day accuſe the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Jacobites, Syrians, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Abaſſines,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants, &amp;c.</hi> as having departed from, or corrupted the firſt Tradition? And how <hi>ſmall</hi> a part of the <hi>Univerſality</hi> of Chriſtians are the <hi>Papiſts?</hi> And if the <hi>greater</hi> part of Chriſtians may ſo forſake the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Tradition, why may not the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Council? How ſhall we be ſure of their exemption from ſuch danger? You tell us over and over of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this and that from our Fathers and Grand-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? And is that a certain Proof that it is Apoſtolical? Why is it not ſo then with all the reſt, the <hi>Abaſſines,</hi> the <hi>Armenians, &amp;c.</hi> and the Majority of Chriſtians? But of this I have ſpoken in the former Treatiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And there I have deſired you to tell us, whether your <hi>Grandfather,</hi> or <hi>his Prieſt,</hi> was <hi>Infallible?</hi> If yea, how, came he by it more than <hi>all thoſe Churches?</hi> If not, do you not delude your Relations, by drawing them to build
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60973:11"/>
their Faith on a fallible man, or upon nothing? Your Relations were not at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or <hi>Florence,</hi> or <hi>Laterane:</hi> How ſhall they be ſure what the Pope and Council agreed on? What Foundation, but the words of your Prieſt or Grandfather, have you for your aſſurance? May not one of your Prieſts lye as well as all the <hi>Greek, Abaſſine, &amp;c.</hi> Churches? When Pope <hi>Coeleſtine</hi> himſelf falſly urged the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council for Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the <hi>Carthage</hi> Council? Either tell your Readers plainly, that it's <hi>you,</hi> and ſuch <hi>as you,</hi> that are the <hi>Infallible Foundation</hi> of their Faith; or bid them ſtay, and not go your way, till they are certain what the Pope and his Council ſay; and that he is a true Pope, and it a true Council, and that they are more Infallible than the major part of Chriſtians. And our Faith can be no ſtronger than the weakeſt neceſſary <hi>medium</hi> of it, from whence it muſt ariſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I have ſaid ſo much of this in a ſmall Book, called, <hi>[The certainty of Chriſtianity without Popery,]</hi> which I intreat you impartially to peruſe, where I have alſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the utter uncertainty that Popery would reduce our Chriſtianity to; that I will now only tell you, that after your talk of Tradition, and Church, and Fathers, and Grandfathers, if we had not much more <hi>teſtimony of Tradition</hi> for our Religion than you have for Popery, we ſhould think our Faith were very lame. Compare ours with yours: 1. Yours is <hi>A pretended Authoritative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,</hi> which reſts upon a ſuppoſed <hi>Inſpiration</hi> of ſome Perſons, by virtue of a ſpecial Priviledge peculiar to themſelves. 2. It is the Tradition of the <hi>minor part</hi> of Chriſtians againſt the <hi>major.</hi> 3. It reſts on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Infallibility</hi> of a <hi>Pope, which great General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> have ſaid may be a <hi>Heretick,</hi> and have depoſed divers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60973:11"/>
as Hereticks, and worſe: And upon the Infallibility of <hi>General Councils,</hi> which by Popes and other Councils are pronounced fallible, unleſs confirmed by a Pope (who may be a Heretick.) 4. It reſts upon a Foundation <hi>(viz.</hi> the Popes Divine Right of Primacy and Infallibility) which is expreſly denyed by two of the firſt four great General Councils, approved to this day; <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Calcedon</hi> reciting the ſenſe of that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt the ſaid Divine right, affirming, that the <hi>Popes Primacy was given him by the Fathers, becauſe</hi> Rome <hi>was the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seat.</hi> 5. It reſts upon an Authority (of Popes and General Councils,) which being at firſt but the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> of <hi>one Empire,</hi> hath thence claimed the ſame Power over <hi>all the Chriſtian World,</hi> which they had got in the Dominions of <hi>one Prince.</hi> 6. It reſts on a Claim down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right contradictory to it ſelf, as aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That we muſt believe that the Pope hath this Power and Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity given him and his Councils, by Chriſt and his Goſpel, before we can believe that there is a Chriſt and a Goſpel authorized and true.</p>
            <p>Now our Tradition is this: For all the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of our Religion, the Sacramental Covenant, and the three expoſitory <hi>Symbols,</hi> we have the currant Tradition both of the Papiſts and all the reſt of the Chriſtian World: Yea, that <hi>every Book</hi> that we call Canonical is the true Word of God, not only the Papiſts but almoſt all the Chriſtian World confeſs: And, <hi>defacto,</hi> that theſe <hi>Books</hi> came down from the Apoſtles, at leaſt that the Goſpel was preached by them, we have the Teſtimony alſo of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and Perſecutors. And are not all theſe more than the Teſtimony of one <hi>Sect</hi> alone? 2. And in this we have as much to confirm us as you have, of the <hi>wiſdom, piety, care of the Church</hi> to <hi>preſerve</hi> the Goſpel, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60973:12"/>
much more too; for we have the <hi>Piety</hi> of <hi>all the Churches</hi> to plead, and not <hi>your Sect alone:</hi> And we undertake to prove ſuch a <hi>moral Infallibility</hi> as is alſo <hi>Natural, viz.</hi> That Mans <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Intereſts</hi> ſuppoſed, it is no more poſſible for ſo many Perſons and Nations of croſs Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts to have agreed in their Teſtimony for the Goſpel, than for all the contentious Lawyers in the Land to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed falſly to inform us, that our Statutes were made by ſuch Kings and Parliaments. But a domineering Faction alone might eaſilier have deceived men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea, even as to <hi>Chriſts Promiſe,</hi> we can better prove that the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> or <hi>Body of Chriſtians,</hi> ſhall <hi>never loſe the Faith,</hi> than you can prove it of <hi>Rome alone,</hi> or the <hi>Papal Sect. Bellarmine</hi> himſelf dare not ſay, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall not ceaſe to be the feat of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> or ſhall not be utterly deſtroyed. And then how can there be a <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> when there is no <hi>Rome?</hi> But you'll ſay, that if he dwell at <hi>Avignion,</hi> he may be <hi>called Biſhop of Rome?</hi> But if he be <hi>called ſo</hi> when <hi>he is not ſo,</hi> at leaſt when there is <hi>no Rome,</hi> or <hi>no Chriſtian Church there,</hi> ſure a <hi>falſe Name</hi> is not an Eſſential part of our Religion. If you ſay, that at <hi>Avignion,</hi> or <hi>Ravenna,</hi> or <hi>Vienna,</hi> he may be S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor, and ſo the Univerſal Monarch ſtill. I anſwer, Then it ſeems that the Council of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> as afore-cited, was in the right, (that <hi>Romes Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was given by the Fathers, becauſe it was the Imperial Seat:)</hi> And ſo that the Pope is not S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe <hi>he is Biſhop of Rome.</hi> But if the Biſhop of <hi>Avignion,</hi> or <hi>Vienna,</hi> might become S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor (who never was Biſhop there,) how ſhall we know that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is his Succeſſor <hi>now?</hi> We have hitherto had no better means to prove it, and deceive the World, than by ſaying that S. <hi>Peter</hi> dyed Biſhop
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60973:12"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Pope is Biſhop: But S. <hi>Peter</hi> dyed not Biſhop of <hi>Avignion.</hi> If the <hi>Place</hi> prove not the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> tell us, if you can, what doth? Is it the <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> By whom? Who are thoſe men that have the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of chuſing S. <hi>Peter</hi> a Succeſſor? You know, I ſuppoſe, that the Pope hath been choſen, 1. Sometime by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (witneſs the blood-ſhed at the choice of <hi>Damaſus</hi> in the Church:) 2. Sometime by the People, and the Neighbour Ordaining Biſhops: 3. Sometime by a Synod: 4. Sometime by the Emperours: 5. And laſtly, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Cardinals. If any of theſe may chuſe, then we may have four or five lawful Popes, choſen four or five ſeveral ways, at once. If only one of theſe have the Power, S. <hi>Peter</hi> had no Succeſſors under all the other Elections. So that the Claim will fall rather to <hi>Antioch</hi> than to <hi>Avignion,</hi> or any other Town, becauſe they ſay it was S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s firſt Biſhoprick, from which he removed for a greater. If you are driven with poor Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> alias, <hi>Terret,</hi> to ſay, that <hi>Any way will ſerve which ſerveth for the truth of an Election of Princes, &amp;c.</hi> then ſtill we may have four Popes at leaſt. I doubt you muſt be forced to ſay as ſome, that it is the <hi>acceptance of the Univerſal Church,</hi> which muſt prove who is the <hi>Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</hi> 1. But ſome muſt be <hi>Electors,</hi> before it comes to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</hi> And who hath the Power of <hi>Electing?</hi> And 2. what if now the major part of the Church ſhould prefer the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> I hope you are not ſo ignorant of Coſmography as not to know that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church when they firſt preferred the Biſhop of <hi>Conſt.</hi> was far greater than the <hi>Latine.</hi> 3. And I ſuppoſe you know that it is not near half the Chriſtian World that now accepteth of the Pope as their Governour. 4. And I pray you do but get the Pope to ſuſpend his claim till <hi>the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60973:13"/>
accept him, and we ſhall not be troubled with him: For how ſhall they ſignifie their acceptance? If in a General Council, you know how they of <hi>Conſtance, Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> are reviled by the Pope and thoſe that now go for your Church, for pretending to a power to depoſe and chuſe Popes; and how <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſuch a Depoſition. And if theſe Councils were not your Univerſal Church repreſentative, where ſhall we think to find it?</p>
            <p>In ſum, we have the <hi>Tradition</hi> of a Church as <hi>big as three of the</hi> Roman <hi>for all our Religion;</hi> and of <hi>all the</hi> Roman <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf; beſides the Confeſſion of the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of the Church, Pagans, Infidels, Mahometans, Jews, and Hereticks; we have not one word that's part of our Religion, which your ſelves confeſs not to be true: We believe that the <hi>Faith of the Univerſal Church ſhall never fail,</hi> nor the Gates of Hell prevail againſt it: And ſo you ſee that we may far better tell how Infallibly we have received our Religion from our Forefathers, than you can do of yours: But we believe not that this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church hath any <hi>Head</hi> but <hi>Chriſt;</hi> no Humane Vicarious Monarch or Governour of all the World: We believe that Men muſt Believe in Chriſt before they can know that the Pope is his Vicar, if it had been true: We know, as ſure as Hiſtory can tell us, that the Pope's firſt Primacy, and the reſt of the Patriarchates were but the Humane Ordinances of the Clergie of one Empire, and not of the whole Chriſtian World. And we know not (nor you) but <hi>Rome</hi> and its Church and Biſhop, may yet all ceaſe together.</p>
            <p>But you make me moſt admire at you, that (in this Book alſo) you tell your Relations, and other Readers, of the <hi>uncertainty of notice by Books</hi> in Compariſon of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60973:13"/>
               <hi>converſe</hi> and <hi>talk</hi> with thoſe of your <hi>preſent Party;</hi> yea that your <hi>own Religion</hi> is not to be known by <hi>Books,</hi> as being lyable to be miſunderſtood, ſo well as by talking with Papiſts, and asking them what is their Faith or Religion. Sir, I judge by your Stile that you are a man of zeal and conſcience in your way, and therefore that you write not this fraudulently againſt your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Sure then you muſt needs be a man of more than ordinary ignorance, that can believe what you ſay. 1. Is it your <hi>Objective</hi> or your <hi>Subjective</hi> Faith that we are diſputing of? If it be not the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Object</hi> of your Faith, every man indeed may tell us what <hi>he believeth himſelf,</hi> but no man can tell us what <hi>another</hi> believeth. And then you have as many Religions as men; for every man hath one of his own, and no two men in the world know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve juſt all the ſame things, neither more nor leſs: And what ſhall thoſe of us think of your Religion then, who find that one of you affirmeth what another deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? For inſtance, A worthy Perſon of your Religion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me, that notwithſtanding the Fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>[Honour thy Father and Mother,]</hi> a Mother hath not any Governing Power over a <hi>Child,</hi> nor the <hi>Child</hi> oweth any obedience to the Mother, during the Fathers life, becauſe it were confuſion were there more Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in a Houſe than one, though ſubordinate one to the other. Is this your common Judgment? May I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this is other mens belief? You know that when we alledge the ſayings of your moſt Learned Writers, we are ordinarily told, that it is not the judgment of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctors, but of the Church in Councils, which we muſt call your Churches Judgment. You under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not to juſtifie any more. And if I talk with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60973:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any of my Neighbours and ask him what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, have I any more than a ſingle Doctors opinion? Is his Anſwer, the Faith of your Church? But would you have any one paſt ſeven years old believe you, that <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> is of no more uſe to Memory for conſervation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities? when God would not truſt his <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to the Peoples <hi>Memories,</hi> but would write them in Stone, and put them in the Arke, (which you have ſo little skill in Antiquity as to ſay here was the <hi>firſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi> Sure if you will read your Jeſuite <hi>Euſeb. Nirem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergius de Antiqu. ſcripturae</hi> you will not ſay that your Grand-Father taught you truly that Opinion as the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church.) Why do <hi>you write</hi> to your own Relations, if writing be ſo un-intelligible? Could the <hi>Bible</hi> have been kept as well in Memory as by <hi>Writings?</hi> Why were the Goſpels written then? Do you go to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> or to <hi>Books,</hi> to decide any Controverſie now of the various readings? Did Pope <hi>Clem.</hi> 8. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the vulgar <hi>Latine</hi> by <hi>Memory</hi> or by <hi>Books?</hi> Pope <hi>Pius</hi>'s <hi>Trent</hi> Oath ſweareth Men to Interpret Scripture according to the conſent of the Fathers: Do any of your Doctors know how that is by <hi>Memory and Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or by <hi>Books?</hi> Did <hi>Poſſevine,</hi> and <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> and ſuch others, Correct Books by Oral Tradition, or by Books?

Was the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſophy propagated and preſerved better by Memory, or by Books? Why is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60973:14"/>
not the Stoicks, and Epicureans, and others, as fully known now as <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> and <hi>Plato's,</hi> if Memory without Books could have done? Have you as full notice now of the Acts of <hi>James, John, Matthew, Thomas, Bartholomew, &amp;c.</hi> without Book, as you have of <hi>Paul</hi>'s by the Book? Is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ſufficient to have preſerved to us the Statures of the Land, without Books and Records? Yea, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law without any Records or Book Caſes? Why are all your Councils written? and all the Decretals? to ſay nothing of the Civil <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, Inſtitutes, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dects, and Digeſts. Can you decide the Controverſies about the Decretals, publiſhed by <hi>Iſidore Mercator,</hi> by Tradition? What are all your Libraries for at the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, Florence, Paris,</hi> and in each Learned Mans Houſe, if Books be ſo uſeleſs and unintelligible? If one of your Relations ask you, what is in the Council of <hi>Trent, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Laterane,</hi> and ſo upward, can you tell him fully without Book by Tradition? And are not theſe Councils your very Religion? Doth every Papiſt Neighbour carry them all in his brain, more certainly than in Books? Or could your Grandfather and Grandmother have told us more certainly what is in them, than <hi>Crab, Surius, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Baronius, Juſtellus, Albaſpinaeus, Petavius, Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondus, &amp;c.</hi> could do? Or is all left uncertain becauſe it is written?</p>
            <p>Through Gods Mercy our Eſſentials, and ſomewhat more, are delivered certainly down to us by two hands, by Oral and Practical Tradition, and by the Scripture, becauſe they lye in a narrow room. But yet if you had the front to tell the World, that your immutable Church hath never changed the Creed it ſelf, we could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you, becauſe <hi>Books</hi> contradict you. Tradition from your Great Grandfather cannot aſſure us that <hi>[Filio<expan>

Nor can Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Book yet aſſure us, what were the very words of the Creed uſed commonly by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; nor who wrote that aſcribed to <hi>Athanaſius:</hi> Nor among the various <hi>Formula's</hi> of that called the Apoſtles, found, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, in <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Epiphanius, Ruffinus, &amp;c.</hi> which of them was in conſtant uſe; or whether li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſuch alteration of words was not then uſed.</p>
            <p>And no Unwritten Report of your Grandfather can aſſure us, that your Maſs-Book or Liturgy was the ſame in the Apoſtles days as it is now; nor that it was for 600 years the ſame in all the Churches of one Empire; and that every Biſhop had not power to uſe what Liturgy he pleaſed, in his own City or <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia:</hi> Nor can your Tradition aſſure us, that what the Father and Grandfather uſed, was uſed from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when the Church of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> clamoured at S. <hi>Baſil</hi> for his ſingularity and innovations, and S. <hi>Baſil</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts on them, that they at <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> had ſcarce left any thing unchanged: I hope this is not the leſs credible becauſe <hi>Baſil</hi> hath <hi>written</hi> it.</p>
            <p>At leaſt, I pray hereafter give over your ill practice of leading ſimple Readers into a Wood of <hi>Church-Hiſtory,</hi> to loſe them and the Queſtion there among a multitude of Citations of old Books, when you know not what elſe to ſay (as <hi>William Johnſon</hi> did,)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60973:15"/>
becauſe there the ignorant know nothing themſelves, but may as well believe the Affirmer as the Denyer; and at leaſt the diverſion to voluminous Controverſies about particular mens words may hide your Errours. Do not reſolve all the Controverſie, yea the Faith of your Followers, into a multitude of <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> which they never ſaw. And do not take ſo much care to corrupt and alter Books, for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as inſtances and your <hi>Indices Expurg.</hi> tell us you have done. Reſolve without Book the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie about your great <hi>Laterane</hi> Council, whether Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pierſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> (and Biſhop <hi>Couſins</hi> lately) that ſay <hi>Innocent.</hi> 3. made and publiſhed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and the Council did not conſent to them, be in the right, or rather they that anſwered Dr. <hi>Pierſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> and indeed your Church, which holds the contrary (which Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> ſeemeth to me lately to have fully proved, in his Book about tolerating Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.)</p>
            <p>Nay why may we not expect that you lay by your Book Catechiſms, your Office Books, your Controverſie Books, and teach your People all without Book?</p>
            <p>But by this Counſel to your Relations, you fully ſhew that you would have them to have no certainty at all, either what Chriſtianity is, or what Popery is. For they ſhall never ſpeak with the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> or with a <hi>General Council,</hi> while they live: And all their.

than the <hi>Abaſſines, Greeks,</hi> and others, may build on as well as you; and that we our ſelves have a far ſurer and Univerſal Tradition than the Papacy hath, and have your own conſent to every word of our Objective Religion, I now proceed to conſider of your Character of Parties.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the <hi>old Non-conformiſts</hi> had the name of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes</hi> put on them, by thoſe that were againſt them: For what reaſon, I leave them to anſwer to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and becauſe theſe <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> lived <hi>ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and were for much preaching, and praying, and holy conference, and ſpending the Lords-day in holy Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſerious diligence in working out our Salvation, and were ſharp againſt drunkenneſs, ſwearing, and ſuch other ſins, therefore the <hi>vulgar Rabble</hi> of vicious ones, that durſt not rail at Piety under the name of Piety, took the advantage of the Biſhops diſpleaſure at the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, and of the name <hi>Puritane,</hi> and put that name upon all Chriſtians among them, that were <hi>notably ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in practical Godlineſs,</hi> perſwading themſelves that they were all but <hi>Hypocrites:</hi> And ſo the name among the <hi>vulgar Rabble</hi> grew common to <hi>godly Conformiſts and Non-conformiſts:</hi> And as if <hi>loquendum cum vulgo</hi> had been a Law, by this means the Devil did more hurt both to <hi>godlineſs</hi> (rendring it among the vulgar to he but odious Hypocriſie and Singularity) and to <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> (making Multitudes that diſliked the wickedneſs of the Rabble, to think that all this came from the Biſhops,) and it did more to advance and honour the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the name was formerly <hi>theirs</hi> as ſuch) than by any one thing that I remember in all my younger days.

            <p>Fourthly, and it added Fuel to the Fire when ſome brought up a fourth ſence of the Word (ſome ſay, <hi>Mar. Ant. de Dom.

            <p>Now who can well tell which of theſe ſorts of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes you <hi>were,</hi> and <hi>talk of,</hi> while you Characterize the <hi>ſecond ſort,</hi> as well as the <hi>firſt,</hi> and yet diſtinguiſh them from <hi>Prelatick Proteſtants?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But which ever it is, obſerve here that you own the <hi>Puritanes Religion</hi> ſtill, and ſay, <hi>[I have not ſo much left Puritaniſm, as Prelaticks call it, as added that to it wherein I found it come ſhort of the holy Apoſtles Doctrine and Inſtitutions,] p.</hi> 1. And when you have deſcribed the Puritane as one ſeriouſly conſcionable and regardful of his Salvation, (at large) you add, <hi>[If this be to be a Puritane, would to God all the World were Puritanes! I am ſo far from being Converted from thus much of a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane, that I moſt heartily wiſh I could Convert all the World to it.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But yet your deſcription of him is ſo very falſe, that I may conclude when you turned, as you think, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meer Puritane to be a Papiſt, you never knew what a <hi>Puritane is,</hi> nor indeed ever were a <hi>Puritane</hi> your ſelf, unleſs you take the word as fitted to your ſelf, and ſuch as you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60973:17"/>
If you had meant by a <hi>Puritane</hi> a meer <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> as ſuch, you would not ſo laudably have deſcribed the work of God upon his Soul and Life as you have done: For if moſt Non-conformiſts be ſuch, yet ſo are many others as well as they. And it's eaſie to ſee what a deceitful courſe it is to take up a name of many ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and ſuch as ſignifieth no different Religion at all, as to any one Article of Faith, nor any more difference in, or about Religion, than ſuch as is among moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches; and much leſs than is among your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Beſides that the plainer name of a <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> is of no determinate nor certain ſignification, ſave only in general to notifie one that Conformeth not to all that is impoſed on him; but <hi>what that is,</hi> the <hi>name</hi> doth not ſignifie.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> is one thing, in <hi>England</hi> another thing, as the Impoſitions are different. Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity twenty years ago, or fourty years, was one thing. Non-conformity ſince 1662. is quite another thing. And Non-conformiſts differ among themſelves: If twenty things be impoſed as neceſſary to the Miniſtry, he is a Non-conformiſt who conſenteth but to nineteen of them; and ſo is he that conſenteth but to eighteen, or to ſeventeen, or to ſixteen, and ſo on, as well as he that conſenteth to none of them. And that there is ſo much difference among them is no wonder to them, nor any conſiderate Man; for they hold Chriſtian Love and Communion with thoſe that agree with them in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid common Principles and Practice of Chriſtianity, (as far as they require not them to ſin:) And they are not of a different Religion from every one that <hi>faſteth not on Fridays,</hi> or <hi>Saints Vigils, &amp;c.</hi> as you ſeem to be, nor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60973:18"/>
from every one that doth ſo; nor from every one that thinketh not in every thing as they think, or that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in other words than they; for no two Men in the World ſhould on ſuch Terms be of one Religion: They believe <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> who tell us of the great diverſity of Rites and Orders in the ancient Churches, which all conſiſted with the ſame Religion, Faith, and Love. They abhor the Principle of hating, perſecuting, yea and ſeparating from one another for ſuch differences as will unavoidably adhere to the imperfect condition of Chriſtians here on Earth.</p>
            <p>At this time in <hi>England</hi> a conſiderable part (if not the far greateſt) of the <hi>ſilenced Miniſters</hi> are for the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Epiſcopacy,</hi> and <hi>ſome Liturgie,</hi> as you may ſee in their offer of A. Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s <hi>Reduction</hi> to the King, and their deſires of a <hi>reformed Liturgie.</hi> Among the <hi>old Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,</hi> there were divers degrees: ſuch as Dr. <hi>Regnolds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Dr. <hi>Humfrey, Paul Bayn, &amp;c.</hi> did yield to more than ſome others could do. How can you tell then by the name of a <hi>Puritane,</hi> what to charge any ſingle Perſon with?</p>
            <p>But it ſeemeth you take their <hi>Non-conformity in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and their <hi>temper of mind and life together.</hi> But then you greatly wrong them, and ſeem not at all to know what their Religion is.</p>
            <p>There are two things which you ſay they miſtake in: 1. Their Doctrine of <hi>Imputed Righteouſneſs, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and not ſolicitouſly endeavouring after the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Virtue,</hi> becauſe they truſt to the <hi>Imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;]</hi> your words are too large to recite: You partly here unworthily injure them by aſcribing to them the very <hi>opinions</hi> and <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> whom they have better confuted than ever you did. And as to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60973:18"/>
of <hi>Imputed Righteouſneſs,</hi> even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in one ſenſe owneth it: And whether our ſenſe be ſound I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke you to try particularly by your peruſal of my own Writings on that Subject, eſpecially a late <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>[Juſtifying Righteouſneſs</hi> and Imputation,] and a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe called <hi>[Catholick Theologie:]</hi> In which if there be nothing which you <hi>dare</hi> or <hi>can</hi> confute, judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your meer deriſion of <hi>[Imputative Righteouſneſs]</hi> be not deluſory: If you dare ſay, that <hi>you truſt not to Chriſts Sacrifice, and meritorious perfect righteouſneſs,</hi> as procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you <hi>pardon and life, (Jus ad Impunitatem &amp; Regnum Coelorum,)</hi> enjoy your ſelf-confidence while you can. But if you ſay in this <hi>as we,</hi> then make publick Confeſſion of the injury of your reproach of ſuch <hi>Imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> as you truſt your ſalvation upon your ſelf.</p>
            <p>I imagine you will ſay, that <hi>my judgment</hi> is no certain ſignification of the judgment of the Puritans; for I am <hi>ſingular,</hi> and therefore what I ſay in theſe Books is no proof of the ſenſe of the Non-conforming Puritans. But, 1. <hi>my</hi> judgment of their ſenſe is as good as <hi>yours.</hi> 2. Do you know of any one Nonconformiſt that hath publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any diſſent to what I have written? (Dr. <hi>Tully</hi> was a <hi>Conformiſt.)</hi> 3. You profeſs (before) to borrow the name <hi>[Puritan]</hi> from the <hi>Prelatiſts.</hi> And I have this to ſay for my Authority in declaring the ſenſe of Puritans, that one or more (whoſe <hi>genius</hi> is of kin to the <hi>Roman,</hi> but far <hi>leſs mild</hi> than <hi>yours)</hi> who are Prelatical or ſuper-Prelatical, have about 17 years ago (being Maſters of that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) branded me with the Name of <hi>[Purus putus Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, &amp; qui totum Puritaniſmum totus ſpirat.]</hi> (The <hi>Pſeudo-Tilenus</hi> hath juſt the ſame ſtile as the late <hi>Unmasker of the Presbyterians, who revileth modeſt, judicious, pious, and peaceable J.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60973:19"/>
wrath and malice doth valiantly militate againſt <hi>Love.)</hi> Therefore Prelatiſts being Judges, I may as credibly as another tell you what is the <hi>Puritan Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Your ſecond accuſation of the Puritan is, that <hi>[He begins to quarrel with all external Worſhip and Ceremonies.]</hi> But this is alſo ſpoken ignorantly and untruly: You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore miſtook the <hi>Antinomian</hi> for the <hi>Puritan,</hi> and here you ſeem to take the <hi>Separatiſt</hi> for the <hi>Puritan.</hi> Read the Reformed Liturgy, and other Papers offered at the <hi>Savoy</hi> to the Biſhops, and you may ſee that though they are not for <hi>ſilencing, excommunicating,</hi> and <hi>damning men</hi> for a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> nor for making as many Religions, as there are differences about Ceremonies, yet they are for doing all things to edification, decently and in order; and for <hi>external</hi> as well as <hi>internal</hi> Worſhip of God: As know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Body</hi> is his, and made to Worſhip him as well as the <hi>Soul,</hi> and therefore ſhould fall down and <hi>kneel</hi> before him, and reverently and holily behave it ſelf in his Service.</p>
            <p>You ſay, p. 5. <q>
                  <hi>[He is much confirmed in this his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by conſidering the open profaneneſs, and little ſenſe of God, he obſerveth generally in zealous Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. But do you not here and in your former deſcription quite contradict your ſelf, when you charge them as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting <hi>inherent righteouſneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We are not ſo fooliſh as not to know, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60973:19"/>
hypocritical abuſe of Gods external Worſhip, by others whoſoever, will not excuſe us for neglecting it. Of the Conformiſts we muſt ſpeak anon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the way I would you could impartially conſider, if the Puritans be ſo good men, as you fairly confeſs them to be, what the reaſon is that Papiſts generally are far more fiery againſt them than againſt thoſe whom you ſpeak ſo meanly of as <hi>Prelatical Proteſtants?</hi> Remember how your Writer after the <hi>London</hi> Fire, anſwered by Dr. <hi>Lloid,</hi> did flatter theſe as more ſuitable to the Papiſts <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> in compariſon of the Puritans: And the <hi>Unmasker</hi> againſt <hi>J. Corbet</hi> will tell you out of <hi>Watſon</hi> (an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Witneſs hanged for Treaſon in <hi>Cobham</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy) how bad the Puritans are, (comparing them with the Jeſuites:) And if your Laws took place in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> what abundance of theſe Puritans would you make Bonfires of? yea your own Relations were not like to ſcape you. They have told me to my face, how quickly they would otherwiſe ſilence me than the Prelates do, if I were in their power. And the Decrees <hi>De Haereticis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burendis &amp; exterminandis</hi> more fully tell it us. Yea, whence is it, that moſt certain experience proveth it, that by how much the nearer any Proteſtants genius is to the Papiſts, by ſo much the more <hi>bloody, cruel, malicious,</hi> or <hi>ſlanderous</hi> and <hi>unmerciful</hi> he is to the <hi>Puritanes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You'll ſay for both, that it is becauſe the <hi>Puritans are moſt againſt them, and Intereſt ruleth the World.</hi> But I anſwer, 1. God's Intereſt is higheſt with every true Chriſtian: 2. I confeſs it's true, that Puritans are moſt againſt Popery: But truly as far as I have been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them, they are not moſt againſt your <hi>Perſons,</hi> nor would have any injuſtice or cruelty exerciſed againſt you: But the fear of your <hi>Faggots,</hi> or <hi>Powder-Plots,</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60973:20"/>
ſuch <hi>Maſſacres</hi> as were in <hi>France,</hi> (of Thirty Thouſand, or Forty Thouſand;) or in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (of Two Hundred Thouſand,) hath made them think your <hi>Power</hi> incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their ſafety: 3. And you muſt remember that the <hi>Poſitive Additions</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are in the Judgment of the Puritans very great ſins: But you have truly no charge againſt the Puritans, for any one Article of their Religion; but only for <hi>not receiving,</hi> and for <hi>proteſting againſt your Additions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But I perceive, <hi>p.</hi> 5. your Inſtances of their defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs are, that they are not for <q>
                  <hi>[faſting days, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Garments for Prieſts, ſet Forms, Chriſtmas-day, Good-Friday, Aſcenſion, Whitſuntide,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which they take for meer Humane inventions and Will-worſhip; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think that the New Teſtament was written to inſtruct us Chriſtians in the whold Body of Goſpel-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But you are beſt prove this only by telling us that you know ſome perſons of that mind: And when you have done, I will demand your Proof that thoſe Perſons are <hi>no more</hi> than Puritans: They have oft told you that their judgment is, that for all that ſubſtance of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is of Univerſal neceſſity to the Church, and is of Divine Inſtitution, the holy Scripture is a ſufficient Rule: But that very many Circumſtances and outward Acts have in Scripture but a General Law (that they be all done to edification, decently, orderly, in Concord, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and it is left to Humane Prudence to order them by ſuch Rules: We condemn no one that uſeth holy Faſts or Feaſts, but think them needful: We judge not thoſe that celebrate the Memorial of God's great Mercies to his Church, by giving him thanks for the holy Life and Doctrine of his Eminent Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But will you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have our judgment?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60973:20"/>
We think Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was in the right that taught the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, both the <hi>Rulers</hi> and the Flocks, that they muſt neither <hi>judge</hi> nor <hi>deſpiſe</hi> each other for differences about Meats and Days, but <hi>receive each other</hi> (to Communion notwithſtanding ſuch differences) as <hi>Chriſt received us, Rom.</hi> 14. and 15. And we will not believe your Grand-Father, nor Great-Grand-Father, if they told us that the Apoſtles by Tradition did inſtitute Holy-days, and Vigils for St. <hi>Tecla,</hi> or St. <hi>Bridgit,</hi> or St. <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> or any that were not born till they were dead: And any one <hi>Day</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> which you truly prove to us that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by Tradition ordained for the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> we profeſs our ſelves ready and reſolved to obey.</p>
            <p>But if you plead not <hi>Tradition</hi> for any of <hi>theſe things,</hi> but the <hi>Churches Commands,</hi> (as you muſt do, or be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, or aſhamed;) here you come to the quick of our difference: 1. We know not of any <hi>Univerſal Vicarious Law-giver</hi> under Chriſt that hath any power to make Laws to the Univerſal Church throughout the World: and we dare not own any ſuch <hi>Uſurper</hi> leſt we be guilty of Treaſon againſt the only Head of the whole Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We know not of any power that the chief Biſhop in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire hath over other Empires, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, or Churches.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But to our own <hi>true Paſtors</hi> which are ſet over us according to Chriſt's order and his Apoſtles recorded in Scripture, we Puritanes will ſubmit in all ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials, as aforeſaid, which are left to their prudent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, not putting us on any ſin.</p>
            <p>But, 4. We deteſt making ſuch things as you here name to be taken for the Characters of <hi>diſtinct Religions,</hi> or <hi>diſtinct Churches,</hi> as if we might not with Love, Peace, and Chriſtian Communion, differ about a Garment, a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60973:21"/>
Holy-day, Faſt, or Vigil. Thus far then you ſeem not to know what a meer Puritan is.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But, Sir, I have much more than all theſe little things againſt your Deſcription of a Puritane: I plainly perceive in your greateſt praiſes of him, that you know not what his very Religion it ſelf is; or elſe you would never deſcribe him as only taken up with <hi>fears and cares, and good deſires to be better,</hi> having yet <hi>greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the things of the World,</hi> without any mention of the <hi>Love of God above all,</hi> and of his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and a <hi>holy and heavenly Mind and Life,</hi> with <hi>ſelf-denyal, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Either you judge of a <hi>Puritane</hi> by what you were <hi>your ſelf,</hi> or by what your <hi>acquaintance</hi> were, or by what they <hi>commonly profeſs</hi> to be their Religion.</p>
            <p>For the firſt you have no reaſon: It followeth not that <hi>they</hi> have no better a Religion, becauſe <hi>you</hi> had no better.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond you had no reaſon: For it's ten to one you knew not the hearts of your acquaintance, ſo well as to be able to know that they had not the <hi>Love of God, &amp;c.</hi> And if you were ſo unhappy in your acquaintance, what's that to other Men?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Therefore as you look that your own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be deſcribed, not as we find it in this or that man, but as your Church profeſſeth it, ſo do we: And I have told you before what our Religion is. I have the more boldneſs in ſpeaking the ſenſe of others, as I ſaid, both becauſe I am as aforeſaid ſtigmatized for a <hi>total Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> and becauſe the generality of all of them of my acquaintance as far as I can diſcern are of this mind.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Puritan</hi> then, as the Word is commonly taken by the Rabble, is a <hi>ſerious Chriſtian Proteſtant, who truly believeth and practiſeth what he doth profeſs,</hi> and doth not mortifie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60973:21"/>
that Profeſſion which ſhould help to mortifie his Sin: His Religion is, to be underſtandingly and ſincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted in the Sacramental Covenant to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; renouncing the Vanities of the World, the Luſts of the Fleſh, and the Deluſions of the Devil: He believeth that all that truly conſent to this Covenant, have a right, and part, in, and to, the Love of God the Father, the Grace of the Son, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Holy Choſt; and that he that hath the Son hath Life, Pardon, Adoption, Juſtification, and Right to Life Eternal; and that this Right is continued, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Covenant, and continuing in that Faith which worketh by Love, and not living impenitently in ſin, but ſincerely obeying God his Father, Saviour, and Sanctifier: He taketh the <hi>fear</hi> of Gods Juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

Advocate and Witneſs to them of his Truth and Love; and their Witneſs, Earneſt, Seal, Pledge, and firſt Fruits of endleſs Life: They take Eternal Glory for their full Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and this World, and Fleſh, (Pleaſure, Riches, and Honour,) to be ſo far uſeful as they ſignifie Gods Love, and further our Love and Service to him; but to be <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> as ſeparated from God in our Hearts, and Enmity, or Miſchief, as Competitors, or as againſt him. In a word, Faith working by Supream Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and Brotherly Love to Man, by Honour to our Superiours, Juſtice to all; and by all the good that we can do in the World, and by Repentance for our Sins, patience in ſufferings, and by a Heavenly Mind, and Life, is the Sum of their Religion; or plainlier as is ſaid at firſt, The Goſpel-Covenant as expounded in the Creed, Lords Prayer, and Decalogue, as the Summary of things to be believed, deſired, and practiſed; and the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as the full and comprehenſive Records of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Promiſes, and Laws of God, containing the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials, Integrals, and neceſſary Accidentals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is the Chriſtian Religion, and the Puritan in queſtion is but the SERIOUS CHRISTIAN di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the HYPOCRITE, or dead Formaliſt.</p>
            <p>But if you add <hi>Non-conformity</hi> to the ſenſe of the Word, and to his Character; ſo I need not tell you what the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are which ſome deny Conformity to, as to Oaths, New-Covenants, Subſcriptions, Declarations, Practices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he proteſteth that he would never deny Conformity to, if after his beſt enquiry he did not believe that God forbiddeth it: (As you may ſee at large in their <hi>Savoy Petition for Peace</hi> to the Biſhops.) Theſe two it ſeems you join together; and what their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Religion is, I have better told you, than you have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60973:22"/>
told your Relations. But as to the clearneſs of their Judgment in it, and the meaſure of their Practice of it, there are, I think, as various Degrees as there are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, no two Men in the World being in all things juſt of the ſame Degree.</p>
            <p>And now Sir give me leave patiently to ask you theſe two Queſtions: 1. Why would you by temerity go about to deceive your Relations, and other Readers, by talking to them againſt that which you did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand? Even then, when you blame others as dealing ſo by the Papiſts? And why do you diſhonour your own Relations ſo, as to make ſo bad a Deſcription of them? Are they ſuch as have <hi>no Love to God as God, no delight in Holineſs, no Heavenly Minds? nothing almoſt but fear and its effects?</hi> Have they <hi>ſtill the Flames of Concupiſcence,</hi> and greedy <hi>deſires of Money</hi> and the <hi>things of this Life, &amp;c.</hi> If it be not ſo, you ſhould not have told the World ſo of them: If it be ſo, I am ſorry for them: I ſuppoſe it is contrary to their profeſt Religion; and you may have the greater hopes to make them Papiſts?</p>
            <p n="2">II. What wonder is it that you that were no better a Puritan than you deſcribe, are turned Papiſt? You that profeſs you were a Puritan, muſt needs be judged to tell us what a one you were your ſelf, when you tell us what they are? Alas poor Man! How came you to be ſo falſe to your own Profeſſion, againſt your Baptiſmal Vows, as to keep ſo much of the World at your Heart, in gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſires after Money, and to have no more Love to God and Man? no more Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt? Could you think that a Man could be ſaved without <hi>Love and good works?</hi> Were you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by ſuch <hi>Antinomian</hi> conceits as you deſcribe, and took that for Puritaniſme? How elſe did you quiet your
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60973:23"/>
Conſcience in ſuch a ſtate of Hypocriſie? If God and Holineſs had not your chief Love (as well as Fear) you were but an Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>And here give me leave to repeat what I have oft written: What wonder is it at any Mans turning Papiſt? when according to your own Principles, no Proteſtant, Puritan, or other Chriſtian turneth Papiſt, that doth not thereby declare that he was a falſe-hearted Hypocrite before, and had no true Love to God in his Heart: And was not this your caſe? For, 1. You affirm that all Men that have true prevalent Love to God are in a ſtate of Grace, and have right to Salvation, (till they loſe it:) 2. You affirm that none of us are in a ſtate of Grace and Salvation, that are not of your Church, that is, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the King, or Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> 3. Therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that you take none but ſuch Subjects or Members of your Church, to have the true prevalent Love of God. But you know that in our Chriſtian Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion we all take God for our God, the infinite and moſt amiable Good, our Father in Chriſt, and Love it ſelf, and that Faith working by Love is our Religion: <hi>And if any Man,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Maranatha:</hi> And he <hi>that loveth the World, the Love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. So that by turning Papiſt you confeſs that before you were no true Chriſtian, nor had any true Love to God and Godlineſs, nor to Jeſus Chriſt: And if ſo, you were a falſe-hearted Hypocrite: For as a Chriſtian you profeſt and Covenanted it. And what wonder then if God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook you and gave you up to ſtrong deluſions, when you would not receive the Truth in the Love of it, that you might be ſaved, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>And note here, that if any Man know that he truly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60973:23"/>
loveth God and Goodneſs, you tell him that he is none of thoſe that you perſwade to Popery: For you perſwade none to it, but thoſe that are ungodly Hypocrites, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no true Love of God within them.</p>
            <p>But can you think, Sir, in good earneſt, that Popery tendeth more to fill Men with the Love of God, than our ſimple Chriſtianity doth? Is not Popery a Religion of Bondage and Servitude, conſiſting mainly in Terrour, and its ſuperſtitious effects? What are moſt of your Tasks of Pilgrimages, Penances, and abundance ſuch, but the effects of ſervile fear? The beſt of Religion next Heaven ſhould be that which is neareſt to Heaven. And do you think you can love God better in the <hi>Fire</hi> of Purgatory Torments, than if he took you unto Chriſt in Paradiſe? Could you love God better in this Life, if he tormented you in the Fire, than if he give you comfort by his mercies?</p>
            <p>You ſay that the Puritan <hi>[is made negligent</hi> (by his truſt in Chriſt) <hi>to adorn his Soul with Piety, Charity, Meekneſs, Patience, Humility, and other Chriſtian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; partly thinking them impoſſible to be attained, partly deeming there is no abſolute neceſſity of them to his Salvation, he having nothing to do but to believe that Jeſus Chriſt hath done all for him.] Anſw.</hi> I had hoped there had been few ſuch left in <hi>England:</hi> Even <hi>Criſp</hi> and <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> were ſcarce ſo erroneous: And <hi>were you</hi> ſuch a one? O miſerable Man that was ſuch a Puritan! Who did bewitch you ſo groſly to contradict the whole Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Goſpel? It is juſt with God to leave you, to ſet now as light by the <hi>Meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> as procuring you Pardon, Grace, and Glory, as you did then ſet by <hi>Chriſtian Virtues, Piety, and Love?</hi> But what if it was ſo with you, will that allow you to belie ſo many others? How many ſcore Volumes have the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60973:24"/>
written which aſſert not only the poſſibility, but the abſolute neceſſity of Piety, Charity, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without which none can ſee God, (Infants Caſe is not here medled with.) I know not one Perſon in all the Land, or World, that will not abhor, as falſe, what you here charge in common on the Puritans, unleſs he be a very groſs Antinomian, or ſome groſſer Heretick here unknown: Proteſtants, Puritans, Separatiſts, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, yea, Quakers, all abhor it: And yet you feared not to put this in Print? Perhaps you will pretend for it the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone? But they that ſay that Faith alone going firſt with Repentance, doth juſtifie them, by procuring the pardon of their ſins, and their Union with Chriſt, do ſay that at the ſame moment of time it alſo ſanctifieth them, by procuring from Chriſt the Spirit of Sanctification, giving them Love, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that this is of abſolute neceſſity to their Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. 6. 7. 13. So much of your falſe ſelf-condemning deſcription of a Puritan.</p>

            <p n="2">II. YOU next Characterize the <hi>Prelatical Protestant:</hi> Having ſaid before <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>[Their Preachers in their Sermons have little Life or Zeal; and ſeldom diſcourſe of ſuch Truths as are apt to awaken Mens Conſciences, and make them lay to heart the great concern of the Salvation of their Souls.

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60973:24"/>
               <hi>very coldly and imperfectly, and ſeem to talk like Parrots, of what they have learnt by rote or out of others Books, and not what they have had any experience of in their hearts.]</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>[Generally ſpeaking, (I wiſh it were a ſlander) Prelatick Proteſtants are very Prophane, and give no ſigns of any interiour trouble of Conſcience: And if any of them begin to be heartily troubled for his ſin, he is obſerved either to turn Fanatick or Papiſt.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by a <hi>Prelatick Proteſtant</hi> you ſhould unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly mean only ſuch as are <hi>worldly Clergy-men,</hi> like too many of your <hi>Roman</hi> Prelates and their Curates, who take Gain for Godlineſs, and who allow their Fleſh, their Pride, their Covetouſneſs, and Voluptuouſneſs, and Sloth, to chuſe their Religion; whoſe God is their Belly, who glory in their ſhame, and who mind Earthly things, and are Enemies to Croſs-bearing; and through Enmity to thoſe that are better than themſelves, are Croſs-impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and Perſecutors, and Silencers, of ſober faithful Miniſters, becauſe they croſs their Pride and worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; ſuch it's like may be no better Men than you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them. But why ſhould you take the Word in ſo narrow a ſenſe?</p>
            <p>But if by <hi>Prelatick Proteſtants</hi> you mean all ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants whoſe judgment is for Epiſcopacy, 1. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and I ſuppoſe are deceived, in your diſtinguiſhing theſe from <hi>Non-conformiſts:</hi> It's true that there are envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falſe-hearted Prelatiſts in the World, that make falſe names for their Brethren, to procure the belief of their falſe reports of them: And God will cut out the lying Tongue. But I will tell you the truth, whoſe malice ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is againſt it; there are <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> as well as <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> and <hi>Independent Non-conformiſts</hi> now: Yea, divers that are againſt the late Wars of the Parliament, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60973:25"/>
againſt the Covenant, and never took it, and ſome that have been Souldiers for the King, and ſuffered for him: Yea ſo conſiderable is the number of them that are <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi> that in 1660. when the King called them to treat in order to agreement, they offered him <hi>no other Form of Church Government, than A. Biſhop</hi> Uſher's <hi>Reduction,</hi> in which not a <hi>Pin of Honour,</hi> nor one Farthing of <hi>their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue</hi> was deſired to be taken from Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Archdeacons; but only the Pariſh Miniſters ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under them, to have done ſomewhat more that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to their Office, inſtead of Lay-Chancellors, <hi>&amp;c. Moſt Non-conformiſts</hi> of my acquaintance would be glad of the terms contained in the Kings Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, where Biſhops and Archbiſhops are left as rich and high as they were before: So far are <hi>Non-conformiſts [Epiſcopal Proteſtants.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And though <hi>Conformity</hi> be very much changed from what it was heretofore, <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> is not. And I muſt tell you, that I do not think that the Chriſtian World hath more godly learned worthy Miniſters, than many of the Epiſcopal were heretofore. Do you know what men Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> A. Biſhop <hi>Grindall,</hi> and many more of old were? And A. Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and many more of late? Who hath written more earneſtly and hotly for Epiſcopacy, than Biſhop <hi>Downame</hi> (who wrote the great Latine Book to prove the Pope An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt;) yet who that knew him did ever queſtion his piety or diligence? And if you look to the old Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Presbyters, read their Books, and enquire of the Lives of many of them, and then confeſs that they were better men and better Preachers than you deſcribe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the Writings of Mr. <hi>Rob. Bolton, William Whateley, William Fenner,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sibbes,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:60973:25"/>
Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Gataker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crook,</hi> and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch others, and enquire how they laboured and lived, and you may hear that they were neither ſuch <hi>Parrots</hi> nor <hi>prophane</hi> ones as you mention.</p>
            <p>There may be ſome proportionable alteration ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be now made in the perſons of the Conformiſts, anſwerable to that which is made in Conformity it ſelf: But ſurely, if you know <hi>London,</hi> and many Miles near it, and many Pariſhes in the ſeveral Counties, you muſt confeſs that now there are many Learned, Pious Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, who Preach zealouſly, and live religiouſly, and hate Covetouſneſs and Perſecution, and long to ſee the promoting of Piety, Peace, and Concord.</p>
            <p>But if you expect a better Vindication of them, I muſt deſire you to conſider of two things. 1. That in moſt Countries and Ages the <hi>worldlieſt men</hi> (that is, the <hi>worſt)</hi> have been the greedieſt ſtrivers and ſeekers for Church-Power and Perferments; and he that ſeeketh moſt diligently is the likelieſt to find: And that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Vulgar do dance after the Pipe of him that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, and will be of the Religion of them that can help or hurt them, be it what it will be. Moſt will be of the Religion which is owned by Law, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the Greateſt, be it right or wrong. In the beſt Countries, the moſt are too bad: And bad men will have a proſpering Religion, and not one that will expoſe them to Death, Baniſhment, Impriſonment, Beggary, Contempt, or Silence. Moſt will be on the upper ſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And remember that you your ſelf here confeſs the ſcandals of ſome of your Romiſh Party, and what carnal prophane ones they are. Had you not confeſſed it, I would have deſired you to read two Books, 1. <hi>Joſep. Acoſta,</hi> of the wicked ſlothful Prieſts in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60973:26"/>
the great hindrance of their Converſion. 2. <hi>Stephanus</hi> his World of Wonders, taken moſt out of the Book of the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> of the horrid Villanies of your Prieſts.</p>
            <p>And one thing I cannot diſregard: I marvel not if the Papiſts be moſt bad in <hi>Spain, France, Italy, &amp;c.</hi> or the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> in <hi>Denmark, Saxony,</hi> or <hi>Sweden;</hi> or the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> or the Prelatiſts and Conformiſts in <hi>England;</hi> becauſe the <hi>moſt</hi> (who are commonly the <hi>worſt)</hi> will be of the ſtronger ſide. But that <hi>Greeks</hi> ſhould be ungodly in <hi>Turky,</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> where they are <hi>ſingular,</hi> and under the diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Times, and moſt hold their Religion with ſome <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> this ſeemeth to me a more grievous thing. And if it prove true, that even in <hi>England,</hi> where you make the World believe that you have ſuffered grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, your Followers are too often found meer <hi>Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> living in Swearing, Drinking, Lying, Uncleanneſs, or ſome of <hi>theſe,</hi> what ſhall we think of ſuch a Religion as this, as in a Land of uprightneſs would teach men to do unjuſtly? I wonder not what ſhould make a Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Fornicator, or other debaucht Sinner to be a Papiſt in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> or <hi>Italy:</hi> But what ſhould make ſuch a one be a Papiſt in <hi>England,</hi> unleſs his Religion favour ſenſuality, <hi>or elſe</hi> he think that it will yet prove the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſide, I cannot eaſily conjecture.</p>
            <p>But you accuſe the <hi>Prelatick Proteſtant</hi> for <hi>agreeing with the Puritan in expecting Salvation by the extrinſical righteouſneſs of Chriſt without him, not by any interior righteouſneſs in his own Soul.] Anſw.</hi> I told you your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory faileth you: Why did you before then deſcribe the Puritan as ſo well qualified within, and deſiring after more? But were you bred among Puritans, and yet talk ſo ignoranly and falſly? This had been more tolerable in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60973:26"/>
a <hi>Cochleus,</hi> a <hi>Genebrard,</hi> or other tranſmarine Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that never knew us here. Read but <hi>Davenant de Juſt.</hi> and ſee how you ſlander the Conformiſts. And read my fore-named Books, and Mr. <hi>Trumans,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woodbridges,</hi> the Morning Lectures at S. <hi>Giles</hi> of <hi>Juſtif.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wotton de Reconciliat.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw de Juſtif. Praefat. &amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> in many Books, <hi>Jo. Goodwin</hi> of Juſtif. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſee how you ſlander the Puritans. In a few plain words, Sir, the Proteſtants do not expect Salvation by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal righteouſneſs as coordinate with Chriſts, but as ſubordinate to it, nor as a Righteouſneſs ſo denominated from the ſame <hi>Reaſon</hi> as Chriſts is, but from a lower Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo as of a lower ſort. That is,<q> [We all hold, that Gods Law to perfect man was perfect, being the Effect of his perfect Holineſs, and required perſonal perpetual perfect innocency and obedience in man: And that man breaking this Law, was according to the Juſtice of it lyable to its Penalty, which is temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal death, or to be forſaken of that God whom he forſook, and to be under the ſenſe of his diſpleaſure, or Juſtice: We believe that Chriſt Redeemed us from this Puniſhment, by the merit of his perfect Holineſs and Obedience, and the ſatisfactory ſacrificing of himſelf on the Croſs, where he was in his meaſure forſaken of God, as in our ſtead and for our ſins; whoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as far as was fit for him to undergo, he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily undertook to ſuffer. We believe that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended by this Redemption, to take man from under his ſubjection to God, or make him an ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawleſs Wight; but that by purchaſe he himſelf, as Mediator, became his Lord and King, and Gods chief Adminiſtrator of the Redeemed World: And his Lord-Redeemer, with the Will and Authority of God his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60973:27"/>
Creator, made him a new Law and Covenant, <hi>freely giving Right to Impunity</hi> (ſaving paternal healing Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and temporal death, and degrees of deſertion if men neglect Grace) and <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Heavenly Glory,</hi> as thus merited for us by Chriſt; and alſo the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghoſt on Earth, to fit us by Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Heaven, and to conquer our ſins; and this to all that will by a true effectual Faith, accompanyed with Repentance, unfeignedly accept the Gift of God, that is, that will truly conſent to the Baptiſmal Covenant, taking God for their reconciled God and Father, Jeſus Chriſt for their Saviour, and the Holy Ghoſt for their Sanctifier and Comforter, renouncing the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, and engaging themſelves as in a Holy War againſt them, as the Enemies of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, and them. And this Covenant they muſt keep: For as it giveth Right to Life to ſuch Believers, ſo it denounceth certain damnation to Unbelievers and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful Neglecters of ſo great Salvation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So that when by [RIGHTEOUSNESSE] we mean that which anſwereth Gods perfect Law, having no ſinful imperfection, we all profeſs that we have no ſuch Righteouſneſs of our own to truſt in, there being no man without ſin; and all ſin by the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency denominating the ſinner unrighteous and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by death: But inſtead of ſuch a Righteouſneſs, Gods Juſtice is ſo far ſatisfied by the Sacrifice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as that he freely giveth us the foreſaid Covenant, and its Free Grace and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: But becauſe we muſt be judged by the Redeemer according to his Law of Grace, therefore we muſt in our ſelves perſonally have the Righteouſneſs which that Law or Covenant hath made neceſſary to our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60973:27"/>
firſt, and our Salvation afterwards; which is firſt our foreſaid Faith or Covenant-Conſent, and after (to our ſalvation) our keeping of that Covenant in true Obedience and Holineſs to the end, and our Victory over the three Enemies which we renounced. So that briefly, God juſtifieth as the Donor and the Judge: Chriſt God and Man, as Mediator, juſtifieth us <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,</hi> as aforeſaid, and by <hi>donation</hi> and <hi>final</hi> ſentence; our <hi>Jus ad Impunitatem &amp; Gloriam,</hi> our Right to <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and the <hi>Heavenly Glory,</hi> juſtifieth us as our <hi>Formal Righteouſneſs</hi> (which is a Relation) againſt the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we ought to be ſhut out of Heaven and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Hell. The Covenant of Grace juſtifieth us, by giving us Right to the Love of the Father, the Grace of the Son, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt: Even as Gods Donative and Condonative Inſtrument, or Act of Grace. Our Perſonal Faith including Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance juſtifieth us, as the matter of our Formal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, againſt that particular Accuſation, that we are <hi>Impenitent Unbelievers,</hi> and ſo have no part in Chriſt and his Covenant Gift. And our ſincere, though imperfect, Holineſs added to our Faith, is our material Righteouſneſs, againſt that particular Accuſation, that we are unholy, and ſo unqualified for Heaven: So that the formal Nature of Righteouſneſs being Relative, and the word having various ſenſes according to the variety of reſpects, and all theſe fore-mentioned ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ſeveral parts or offices, to the Being of our final perfect Juſtification, all theſe may accordingly be the Reaſons of our expectation of ſalvation. I forgot to adde, that we are ſo far juſtified by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> alſo, as he is the Author of this Holineſs, which is our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualification for eternal life.</q> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>

I have here truly, diſtinctly, and plainly told you the Proteſtant and Puritan, that is, the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine</hi> of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>As to the ſenſe of the word <hi>[Imputing]</hi> ſee how we do, or do not own it, briefly in Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s Preface, or largely in my <hi>Treat. of Juſtifying Righteouſneſs and Imputation.</hi> And in my <hi>Cathol. Theolog.</hi> I have done you and Chriſtianity the ſervice, to prove by plain Citations, that many of your Learnedeſt Divines do ſay herein the ſame as we, or very little differ from us; and if you will as a Make-bate prove the contrary, you will do it to the Diſſenters ſhame. If you truſt not Chriſt alone, as we do, you will find the want of a Saviour in your neceſſity, and Purgatory will not ſerve your turn.</p>
            <p>But you tell us, that <hi>[Some of the Prelatick Clergie begin to ſcoff at the Doctrine of Imputative Juſtice: One of them lately, in a Sermon before his Majeſty, called it, and not improperly, the Mummery of Imputative Juſtice.]</hi> I will tranſcribe no more of your Scoff: It's dangerous mocking at ſuch matters: <hi>Imputed Righteouſneſs</hi> is oft mentioned by the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture. It is not ſome mens miſ-expoſition that will juſtifie your deriſion. It's no ſtrange thing for men of undigeſted thoughts on both ſides, publickly and privately to revile at each other as erroneous, when if they had but the skill of ſpeaking diſtinctly, and underſtanding one another, they would preſently profeſs that they are agreed; or if it be for want of underſtanding the matter, it's pity but they ſhould be quiet till they underſtand it. I am of their mind that think it is here ſafeſt to keep cloſe to Scripture phraſe; for want of which many wrangle about their own ambiguous or ill made words, that in the matter diſagree not.</p>

But, Sir, when you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 6. <q>
                  <hi>[An Imputative holy man is a meer Chriſtmas Mummer;</hi>]</q> And after your jeaſting with the Boys and Girls, and the Coblers and Botchers Regal Attire, and the Daw and her fine Feathers, you conclude <q>
                  <hi>[ſuch will be the ſad Lot of meerly Imputative Saints, who to themſelves and their Brethren ſeem very fine in the extrinſical Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, put on by their phantaſtical Faith, whilſt God and his Angels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all this conceited aſſumed Bravery ſee a laſcivious, wanton, covetous Miſer.]</hi>
               </q> I muſt crave leave to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Conſcience, to judge whether a man that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that while he ſeemed a Puritan he was <hi>but an unholy, laſcivious, wanton, and covetous miſer,</hi> and ſince his turning Papiſt tells the World in Print, that he is now a <hi>moſt falſe calumniator,</hi> be a fit perſon to invite his Relations to ſuch a pitiful change, to ſave their Souls? While you talkt but of <hi>[Imputative Juſtice]</hi> ſome mens ambiguous words gave you an excuſe: For ſome Proteſtants think that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be called <hi>Juſtifying Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is not ſinleſs and perfect: But this is but a Controverſie about a <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Name</hi> of Righteouſneſs. But when you here pretend, that they are for <hi>meerly Imputed Holineſs,</hi> I muſt ſay that I remember not that ever I read a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Slander: And he that will dwell in Gods holy Hill muſt not receive a falſe Report, eſpecially in deſpight of the fulleſt evidence that man can deſire: Are not our Bookſellers Shops full of Books for the neceſſity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Holineſs? and that none can be ſaved but Saints? Is it not one of our diſlikes of your Way, that Saints muſt be made rare Canonized Perſons, when all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hold, that without Holineſs none ſhall ſee God? When almoſt all the Sermons that ever I heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> by any man of ſenſe in my life profeſt this, and almoſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60973:29"/>
all our Books are on this very ſubject, who would have thought that a man on earth could have been found, that would deny it in the open face of the Sun? Yea, one that ſaith he was a Puritan, and an Univerſity Student? Even when the poor Puritans are ruined, and hunted about, and caſt into Goals, becauſe they dare not give over preaching the <hi>neceſſity of Perſonal Holineſs to ſalvation</hi> (for that is the moſt of all their Sermons that ever I heard) dare you ſtand forth with ſuch an accuſation as this? as if they held no Holineſs neceſſary but Imputative? Why then are we devoted in Baptiſm to the Holy Ghoſt? Yea what are the very Separatiſts more accuſed of, than that they would have none but real Saints in their Communion, too far preſuming to judge the Heart? You ſeem a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous man, though very ignorant; I pray you ſtudy not to excuſe this, but let us hear that you as openly repent as you have ſinned.</p>
            <p>The moſt of your further dealing with the <hi>Prelatick Proteſtant,</hi> is to tell him that his Ritual Principles lead him to turn Papiſt, or elſe he cannot anſwer the Puritan: I take not my ſelf any further fit to interpoſe herein, than to tell you, that in all things truly Indifferent, there is a juſt middle between any miſtaken Scruplers that hold them ſinful, and a Papiſt that maketh them a part of his Chriſtianity or Religion, and will not be of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Church with thoſe that be not of his mind, nor will willingly ſuffer them to preach or live. I told you that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Churches deſcribed by <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> (about <hi>Eaſter)</hi> were of this middle way: They neither thought Liturgies or Ceremonies ſo bad (or unlawful at all,) as ſome on one ſide called Puritans do, not ſo neceſſary as to make them a Partition Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Churches and Churches, or to forbid Communion,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60973:29"/>
or the Preaching of Chriſts Goſpel, or Chriſtian Peace, to thoſe that differ about them. And I think this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way is approved by God and Angels, and by many at death, or after long experience, who were againſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in proſperity and paſſion.</p>
            <p>The Inſtances which you give, are,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That <hi>[the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Proteſtant is very angry with the Puritan, that he will not abſtain from Fleſh in</hi> Lent, <hi>on</hi> Frydays, Ember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, <hi>and</hi> Vigils <hi>of Saints—Though practically ſpeaking no body takes leſs notice of them than himſelf—And the poor Puritan, becauſe he will not ſolemnly invite the People to obſerve, what himſelf never intends to take the leaſt notice of, muſt for this be ſilenced and ſuſpended both from Office and Benefice.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here you ſhew what things they be that you turn Papiſt for: Is not eating Fleſh on <hi>Frydays, Lent,</hi> or <hi>Vigils,</hi> a worthy matter to make another Religion of, or to prove men to be of differing Churches?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I told you before, that the Puritans judgment is as <hi>Paul</hi>'s, that ſuch things ſhould be left indifferent, or at leaſt make no breach among us; by our <hi>judging</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing</hi> one another: And that neither the Pope, nor any men on Earth, have Authority to make Univerſal Laws for them to all the Chriſtian World; and that there is no true Tradition of Apoſtolical Inſtitution of them: But yet that ſuch Faſts and Feaſts as are appointed by true Authority of Prince or Paſtors, not againſt the Laws of God, and ſuch as ſhall be proved to be inſtituted by the Apoſtles, they will obſerve.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But the <hi>poor Puritan</hi> is indeed in hard Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were there no life after this! Some of them have no Fleſh to eat, either on <hi>Frydays,</hi> or any day in the Week, but live thankfully upon Bread and Milk, and ſome ſuch
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60973:30"/>
things; Fiſh they would gladly eat, if they could get it. There are now among them ſuch as with many Children have for a long time lived almoſt only on brown Rye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread and Water: Many of them take it for a ſufficient quantity to eat one temperate Meal a day, though they are in no want; and the Papiſt that forbeareth Fleſh, and eateth better than the Puritan feaſteth with, or that faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with one Meal a day, which is many Puritans fulleſt Dyet, doth condemn the poor Puritan as an Heretick, and perhaps burn him at a Stake, or caſt him into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, for not Faſting. Poor <hi>John Calvin</hi> did eat but one ſmall Meal a day, and the Papiſt who faſt much at the rate as <hi>Calvin</hi> feaſted, record him for a gluttonous perſon. And ſo did the Phariſees by Chriſt and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; <hi>why do not thy Diſciples faſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Your ſecond Inſtance is, <hi>[The Prelatick Proteſtant wonders the Puritan ſhould ſcruple adorning the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table, with two Wax Tapers, &amp;c.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The former Anſwer ſerveth to this: Hear, O ye Puritans, wherein the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion doth ſurpaſs yours! Their Altars have lighted <hi>Tapers on:</hi> Do you not deſerve to be burnt your ſelves, if you will not burn Candles on your Altars?</p>
            <p>Yea the Pope, who hath power to ſet up and take down Emperours and Kings, being not only the King of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Monarch of the whole World, doth appoint theſe Lights as a Profeſſing <hi>ſign</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>[before God and Man that he is of that Church which in the Primitive Times for fear of Perſecution ſerved. God by Candle-light in Dens and Caves,</hi>]</q> And is not this to prove the <hi>immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of their Church, that vary not in a <hi>Circumſtance</hi> from the <hi>Apoſtolioal Inſtitution?</hi> Doth his domineering over Kings and Nations, and the Hoſts of Great Princes,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60973:30"/>
Cardinals, Prelates, Abbots, Clergy, Regulars, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that obey him, ſhew alſo that he is of that <hi>old Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-lighted Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while you ſeem ſtill to plead <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition</hi> for all theſe Great Parts of your Religion, tell the poor Puritan, whether it was by Propheſie, or how elſe, that the Apoſtles delivered to the Church the uſe of theſe <hi>Lighted Tapers,</hi> in commemoration of that which was done in <hi>Dens</hi> long after the death of theſe Apoſtles? I doubt rather, the Pope doth by this practice condemn himſelf, and ſets up theſe Lights to ſhew the World how much he and his Church are changed ſince thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned days.</p>
            <p n="3">III. You next ſay, <hi>[The Prelatick Proteſtant wonders what hurt the Puritan can ſee in making the ſign of that on the forehead of a new baptized Infant, yet ſmiles at a Papiſt when he makes it on himſelf, or his Victuals, &amp;c.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> None of us are aſhamed of the Croſs of Chriſt, nor loth to profeſs this as openly as you: But if we do it by <hi>Word,</hi> by <hi>Writing,</hi> by <hi>Obeying,</hi> or by <hi>Suffering,</hi> we are of another Religion from you, (it ſeems by you,) unleſs we will do it alſo by <hi>croſſing:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were the <hi>Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers:</hi> And there are now ſo many <hi>Croſs-makers</hi> in the World, whoſe Trade we like not, that we are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſet up <hi>their ſign</hi> at <hi>our doors.</hi> But yet there are Puritans and Prelatiſts, that were they among the Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a Crucified Chriſt, where the uſe were not a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, or worſe, but convenient to tell the Infidels their mind, that they are <hi>not aſhamed of the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> would not refuſe ſeaſonably to Croſs themſelves. But the Puritans think, that when it is made <hi>[a ſolemn ſtated ſign of the Duty and Grace of the New Covenant, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there by the perſon to God, as one hereby obliging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60973:31"/>
               <hi>to profeſs the Faith of Chriſt Crucified, and manfully to fight under his Banner</hi> againſt the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh to the death, <hi>in hope of the Benefits of his Croſs and Covenant, and ſo is made a Badge or Symbol of our Chriſtianity,]</hi> then it is made a <hi>Sacrament of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, added to Chriſts Sacrament of the ſame uſe;</hi> or at leaſt <hi>too like it,</hi> though the <hi>Name</hi> be denyed it: And they think that Chriſt hath given none power to make <hi>ſuch new Sacraments or Symbols of Chriſtianity;</hi> he having done that ſufficiently himſelf. They have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that the King would not be pleaſed with them that either frame a new <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> added to his, as the <hi>Badge</hi> of his <hi>Subjects Loyalty,</hi> nor yet that would make a new <hi>Badge</hi> of the <hi>Order of the Knights of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> without his conſent. At leaſt, the Puritans think that <hi>Baptiſm, and Chriſtianity, and Chriſtian Burial ſhould not be denyed to thoſe Children, whoſe Parents do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be baptized with this additional Symbol:</hi> And if the poor men be deceived in ſuch thoughts, it is but in fear of ſinning againſt Chriſt, and not that they are more aſhamed of his Croſs than you, or more diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Authority.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Your next inſtance is, <hi>[The Prelatick Proteſtant wonders that the Puritane can doubt the holy Euchriſt is really and truly the body of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.] And you cite Dr. <hi>Coſins Hiſt. Tranſub. p.</hi> 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The <hi>Prelatick Proteſtant</hi> and the <hi>Puritane</hi> differ not at all about the real preſence of Chriſts body in the Sacrament, as I have ſhewed you elſewhere. What need you more proof than King <hi>Edwards</hi> old Rubrick againſt the Real Preſence in a groſs ſence, lately reſtored to the Liturgie. And as for Dr. <hi>Coſins</hi> words and book, I again tell you, all the Doctors of the Roman Church
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60973:31"/>
are never able to anſwer his full proof that Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation is a late innovation; and none of the doctrine of the ancient Churches. We challenge you all to give any reaſonable anſwer to that book: And you ſtill Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly bawke the main Controverſie between us and you, which is not whether <hi>Chriſts Body be</hi> there, but whether <hi>Bread and Wine be</hi> there. For I have told you, 1. That we who know not how far a Glorified Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body is extenſive and inviſible to us, cannot tell you where it is preſent or abſent, no more than of an Angel. 2. But we all hold, as a piece of Plate or Silver Barrs, is really and truly turned into the Kings Coine, ſo the Bread and Wine is really and truly turned into Chriſts <hi>Sacramental Body and Blood;</hi> and yet one is <hi>Silver</hi> and the other is <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> ſtill: The change is <hi>true, but Relative</hi> by its Separation to that holy uſe: as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon may be Really Changed into a <hi>King,</hi> or a <hi>Lord,</hi> or a <hi>Judge,</hi> or a <hi>Captain,</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or a <hi>Doctor,</hi> and yet be a <hi>man</hi> ſtill. This <hi>real</hi> change we all Confeſs. But the queſtion is, whether there be <hi>no Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. You ſay <hi>[The Prelatick Proteſtant wonders</hi> that the <hi>Puritan when he is going out of this world ſhould find diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to make a particular Confeſſion of his ſins, if any grievous matter lye on his Conſcience, and humbly deſire the Prelatick Prieſts abſolution, ſaying &amp;c.].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know of no difference between the Prelatiſt and the Puritan about <hi>Confeſſion</hi> or <hi>Abſolution.</hi> Dr. John <hi>Reynolds</hi> a true Puritan, received <hi>Abſolution</hi> before he dyed: Meer Puritans believe that it is a duty to Confeſs our ſins to men. 1. In Caſe of ſuch injury to any as muſt have a Confeſſion towards the injured perſons <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs.</hi> 2. In Caſe of ſuch difficulty about either the nature of the <hi>ſin,</hi> or <hi>Conſequent dangers</hi> or <hi>dutyes,</hi> as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60973:32"/>
make a particular Guide neceſſary, who cannot reſolve our doubts till he know the Caſe. 3. In Caſe that the Conſcience be ſo burdened with the ſin, as that the ſinner cannot by other means find eaſe, till he have disburdened himſelf by ſuch Confeſſion. 4. In Caſe it be neceſſary to heal any ſcandal given to others; It is a very great duty for drunkards, fornicators, deceivers, and ſuch others to go to their Companions, and lament their ſin, and perſwade them no more to do as they have done: And if required by the Paſtors to take publick ſhame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Congregation, and acknowledg that the doctrine of Chriſt never countenanced them in any ſuch ſin, that Religion and the Church may not bear the reproach of their delinquency. And to beg the prayers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation for their pardon, and that the Paſtor by virtue of his office will pronounce it.</p>
            <p>But we are not aſhamed to confeſs that neither Puritans nor Prelatiſts think it lawful to make the people believe that they muſt needs tell the Prieſt of all the ſins that they commit, and dutyes that they omit; Nor to uphold pragmatical Prieſts in the trade of knowing all mens thoughts and ſecret actions, even Princes, by which they may betray them. 1. The number of people and of their ſins, is ſo great as render it impoſſible: In this Pariſh it's thought there is above threeſcore thouſand ſouls: How many thouſand ſinful thoughts, or words or deeds a great part of theſe may commit in a year, I leave to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture: only I muſt tell you that if all men High and Low, that are called Papiſts about us, ſhould but tell the Prieſt of every time they are drunk, and every Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have committed, every prophane Oath they have ſworn, every Lye they have told, (eſpecially againſt the Proteſtants,) and of every filthy and prophane Word
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60973:32"/>
that they have ſpoken, and every Oppreſſion of the poor, and every filthy or covetons thought that hath been in their hearts, they had need of a very Traditional Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to remember them, or great plenty of Ink and Paper to record them, and a whole Dioceſs of Clergy-men in one Pariſh to hear them. How many hundred Prieſts muſt this Pariſh have, if all ſhould thus confeſs all ſins of Commiſſion and Omiſſion? every cold Prayer, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prayer, Exhortation, Alms, Example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the great Omiſſions of the Soul, in the defects of the exerciſe of Faith, Hope, Love, and Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And what good will it do a man, that is himſelf of ſound underſtanding and integrity, to open his Conſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to an ignorant or unconſcionable man, that will call evil good, and good evil, and will put him upon ſin; as you here do by your Relations; or that dare himſelf ſin as boldly as you here do, when you accuſe Puritans and Prolates as holding <hi>meer Imputed Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And how great a temptation and injury may this be to your Prieſts, in ſuch inſtances as <hi>Montaltus</hi> the <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi> mentioneth, with which I will not defile my Paper? when, alas! moſt of them are not men fit to bear ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations: What if twenty thouſand People in one Pariſh ſhould each make this Confeſſion to a Papiſt Prieſt, <hi>[I am afraid I have ſinned in believing the common Report, that you are a very ignorant drunken ſot; and a common whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and a proud, covetous lying man;]</hi> would it not be like to enrage the Prieſt into an enmity againſt his Flock? If all the Fornicators in ſuch a Pariſh ſhould tell ſuch Prieſts of all their filthy thoughts, and words, and their <hi>immodeſt actions,</hi> and <hi>actual Fornications;</hi> how like were it to make ſuch impreſſions on the poor Prieſts Phantaſie, as would pollute him with many filthy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>

Your laſt Inſtance indeed toucheth the quick of our Controverſie with <hi>Rome:</hi> You ſay <hi>[The Prelatick Proteſtant wonders at the Puritan's Pride, that he will not ſubmit his judgment in matters of Faith, to the determination of a Council of all the Reverend Biſhops of the Land, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty as Supreme Head and Governour preſiding,]</hi> yet ſubmit not <hi>[to the determination of a General Council of all the Learned Biſhops of the Chriſtian World, his Holineſs the Pope as Supreme Paſtor preſiding, and believe as the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church of Chriſt believeth: It's fitting, ſays the Conformiſt, that for Order ſake in Chriſts Church, there ſhould be in every Nation ſome Supreme Governours, to whoſe Directions in matters of Divine Worſhip, all ſhould ſubmit; elſe we ſhall have as many Chriſtian Religions and ways of Worſhip, as there are Pariſhes, Families, or Perſons. The Puritan replyeth, It ſeems as rational that Chriſt ſhould for the ſame Reaſons of conſerving union, decency, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his Church, appoint one Supreme Paſtor over all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, diſperſed in all the Nations of the World, whom all ſhould obey in the vacancy of General Councils.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This deſenveth our wakeful Remarks: I. So your
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60973:34"/>
ſacred Cardinal <hi>Bertrand</hi> (in <hi>Biblioth. Patrum)</hi> ſaid, that <hi>God had not been wiſe elſe, if he had not placed one Supreme, as his Vicar over the World.</hi> And ſo you can tell what <hi>God hath done,</hi> by your ſuperlative Wit which can tell us what he <hi>ought to do.</hi> God doth all wiſely: But if he had not made an Univerſal Head of the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, he had not done wiſely; <hi>ergo,</hi> he hath made ſuch an Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is Hiſtorical Logick.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But is this Monarch the Head in <hi>Civil</hi> Government, or only in <hi>Eccleſiaſtick?</hi> Why is your <hi>One Church</hi> no more <hi>One</hi> in anſwering this Queſtion? Nay why were poor <hi>Barclay, Withrington,</hi> and ſuch others, whoſe Writings <hi>Goldaſtus</hi> hath preſerved, ſo hardly judged of, for plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Kings Supremacy in Civil Government? And if you are of their mind, tell us if you can, why God muſt not be judged as unreaſonable and unwiſe, if he have not made <hi>One Univerſal Civil Monarch of all the World?</hi> I undertake, when you will come to a due tryal, to prove, that <hi>Civil Government</hi> is ſuch as may as well, and <hi>far better,</hi> be done by <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Deputies</hi> than the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Government</hi> can: And I pray who is the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Monarch? Or who muſt be he? Or how muſt he be choſen? I would have our King have no mortal King ſet over him, at leaſt without a chuſing Vote. And ſhall they meet in a General Council of Kings to chuſe one? By that time the Place and Time be agreed on, and the Kings have all left their Kingdoms, and be come from the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and the <hi>Terra Auſtralis incognita,</hi> and all other Kingdoms to that Council to chuſe a Monarch of the World, they will be too old to return home again. Or ſhall they fight it out, till one have Conquered all the reſt? Alas, who ſhall bear the charge of the Conqueſt at the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and who ſhall anſwer for all the Blood?
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60973:34"/>
When one cannot get all <hi>Europe</hi> at a cheaper rate, than will be expreſſed by many Kingdoms groans, and the Soil dunged with mens fleſh and blood. I have long ago on this ſubject given (in my <hi>Key for Catholicks)</hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and to <hi>Carol. Boverius,</hi> who wrote for the Honour of Eccleſiaſtick Monarchy, from the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Civil, to have perverted our late King; as if he would have made him believe, that the World muſt have one mortal Monarch.</p>
            <p>Contrarily, If it be <hi>Madneſs and Hoſtility to all Kings and States, for any one man on earth to claim and ſeek to be the Monarch of all the World in Civil Government, it is madneſs and hoſtility to Kings, Paſtors, and People, for any one man to claim and ſeek to be the Monarch of all the World in Eccleſiaſtick Government. But the former is true:</hi> Ergo, <hi>ſo is the latter.</hi> I am ready to make good the Compariſon.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But, Sir, if the Pope be S. <hi>Peter's</hi> Succeſſor, is not his <hi>Apoſtolick office</hi> as Univerſal as his <hi>Monarchy</hi> or Ruling office? Surely the <hi>firſt part</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles office</hi> was to preach and <hi>baptize,</hi> and <hi>make Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>gather Churches,</hi> and the Governing of them was but the ſecond part: And is the Pope the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of all the world? Then it ſeemeth that he is a betrayer of moſt of the whole earth to the Devil, that neither preacheth to them <hi>per ſe vel per alios.</hi> But S. <hi>Peter's</hi> Charge was not <hi>Vniverſal</hi> but <hi>Indefinite.</hi> And even as to <hi>Government,</hi> why did he never ſo much as ſend his Deputies to govern the Abaſſins for ſo many hundred years? Nay hence it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to follow, that all the preaching and Church-order that hath been for ſo many hundred years, either there or in any other Nation, by which millions have been turned to Chriſtianity and edified, without the miſſion or
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60973:35"/>
Commiſſion of the Roman Monarch, ſhould have been left undone, and all was unlawful?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. But muſt your <hi>Pope</hi> be obeyed as Supreme but in the <hi>Vacancy of General Councils?</hi> Dare you preach this at <hi>Rome?</hi> 1. How then come the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> for ſuch Doctrine to be <hi>unapproved or reprobate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils?</hi> How came Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> to keep up and continue the ſucceſſion, when ſo great a General Council had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him as Heretical, Simoniacal, and many ways flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious? 2. And what? Have we a Catholick Church with two Heads? that are <hi>pervices</hi> the Vicars of Chriſt? A <hi>Pope</hi> one year, and a <hi>Council</hi> another? Then ſure they are <hi>two Churches,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Pars imperans</hi> is the <hi>ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part.</hi> 3. But the beſt is, it is at the Pope's will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever there ſhall be a General Council more? And he knoweth which ſide his Bread is Buttered on? Nay, they ſay, no Decree is valid without his approbation: And if ever a <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Eugenius</hi> of them all will approve of his own Depoſition for Hereſie, Simony, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is not the Man that I took him for. 4. But if the name <hi>[General Council]</hi> be not a Cheat, and taken for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil very far from being General, as to the <hi>whole Chriſtian World,</hi> let the Pope ſet his heart at reſt, I will undertake to ſecure him from the danger of ſuch a Council, and to prove that ſuch there never <hi>ought</hi> to be, <hi>will be,</hi> or <hi>can be,</hi> unleſs Chriſtianity come much nearer to be rooted out of the Earth, and the Church brought into a narrower room.</p>
            <p n="5">V. But you have a reflecting Compariſon between the <hi>Kings preſiding</hi> and the <hi>Popes,</hi> and between a <hi>National Council</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops of the whole Chriſtian World.</hi> To begin at the later part. Alas poor <hi>ignorant Man,</hi> if you believe this your ſelf? And alas <hi>unfaithful Man,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60973:35"/>
if you believe it not and yet dare ſay it? Do you yet know no difference between the <hi>orbis Romanus,</hi> and the <hi>orbis univerſalis?</hi> Or will you with <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> alias <hi>Terret,</hi> prove your Councils to be Univerſal, becauſe ſuch places as <hi>Thracia</hi> had Biſhops there, as if <hi>Thracia</hi> had been without the Empire? or becauſe ſuch a name as <hi>Johannes Perſidis</hi> is found at <hi>Nice?</hi> Read all the ſubſcribed names, and return to a ſounder mind! <hi>Theodoret</hi> knew what he ſaid, when he gave the reaſon why <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Niſibis</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> or near it, was at the Council of <hi>Nice, Becauſe</hi> Niſibis <hi>was then under the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you not know that moſt of the Chriſtian World (two to one) are not of the Pope's Subjects; and are <hi>All the Biſhops of the Chriſtian World</hi> then on your ſide? And do you not know that when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> preſided at <hi>Nice,</hi> his Dominion was full as large as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s was, and a little larger.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But becauſe you ſhall find us reaſonable, we will tell you, that we conſent to General Councils where the Pope conſenteth not? We conſent to what the great Councils at <hi>Calcedon</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, ſay of the <hi>Humane Inſtitution of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> and the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Mutability</hi> of it; and ſo doth not the Pope? We conſent to the Councils at <hi>Conſtance, Baſil, Piſa,</hi> that the Pope may be depoſed as a Heretick, and worſe; but the Pope doth not: Is it not he then that diſſenteth from <hi>all the Biſhops of the World?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. And for the Kings preſiding we wholly own it: He is the Governour of <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> as well as of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and he is to ſee that they abuſe not their Function
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60973:36"/>
to the common hurt. The difference is here, 1. Our King Governeth but his own Dominions: But your Pope would Govern all the World. 2. Our King hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Title: Your Pope is an Uſurper. 3. And as to your name <hi>[Head]</hi> he hath given the World full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that he did never claim to be a <hi>Prieſt-Head</hi> or <hi>Governour,</hi> a <hi>Conſtitutive</hi> Head of a <hi>properly called Church,</hi> nor to have the power of <hi>Word, Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Keys,</hi> ſo as to adminiſter them; but to be a Civil <hi>Head</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of Prieſts, and the Churches in his Dominions; as he is of Phyſicians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. And you miſtake the Puritans, if you think they are not for this Government: Why elſe take they the Oath of Supremacy? Yea, and if you think that they are not for as much Unity and Concord of all the Churches in a Kingdom, as can be had without a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hurt, than the leſſer particularities of their concord will do good: And they are not againſt National Synods for ſuch Concord: And they hold the King to be the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Head or Governour, or</hi> Principium <hi>of that Concord:</hi> But not <hi>principium eſſentiale ipſius Eccleſiae:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Puritans differ from judicious <hi>Ric. Hooker,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>[If the King be the Head of the Church, he muſt needs be a Chriſtian:]</hi> For we hold that an <hi>Infidel King</hi> may be ſo the Head, that is, the <hi>Rightful Governour</hi> of the Chriſtians and Churches in his Dominion; or elſe how ſhould they be obliged to obey him?</p>
            <p n="9">IX. And you are miſtaken, if you think that the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans and the Prelatiſts differ about ſubmitting our Faith to the judgment of the Church: We ſubſcribe the ſame Articles, which ſay that General Councils may erre, and have erred, even about matters of Faith.</p>
            <p n="10">X. But I muſt tell you, that the Puritans, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60973:36"/>
of <hi>diſorder</hi> and <hi>confuſion,</hi> do many of them loath <hi>diſorder</hi> and <hi>confuſion,</hi> even in <hi>words</hi> and <hi>doctrine.</hi> And they diſtinguiſh here between the <hi>Churches keeping</hi> and <hi>teaching</hi> the Chriſtian Faith, and the <hi>Churches judging in matters of Faith.</hi> The firſt they are wholly for: We muſt receive our Faith from our Teachers, and <hi>oportet diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem fide humana credere.</hi> But if by <hi>Judging</hi> you mean ſtrictly a <hi>Deciſive judgment,</hi> in which we muſt reſt, which way ſoever the ſentence paſs, as if the Church might not only teach us the truth of our Religion, but judge <hi>in partem utramlibet,</hi> whether it be true or not, the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans own no ſuch power in the Church, nor will ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Faith to the judgment of it. They believe that Paſtors in Councils have power to judge that there is a God, Almighty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Chriſt, a Holy Ghoſt, that Chriſt dyed, roſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Scripture is true, that there is an abſolute neceſſity of Holineſs, that there is a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Life everlaſting, that Gods Commandments muſt be kept, and ſin not committed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that no Council hath power to judge that there is no God, no Chriſt, or the contrary to any one of theſe, or any other revealed Truth of God.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. And I muſt not let paſs your Schiſmatical inference, that <hi>[elſe there ſhould be as many Religions and ways of worſhip as Pariſhes or perſons]</hi> if ſome ſupreme Governour determined not in matters of worſhip: For 1. It was not ſo, when no Supreme Governour determined, on earth: 2. But either you mean the <hi>Subſtantials</hi> of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or the <hi>Circumſtantials:</hi> In the firſt as <hi>faith</hi> is not to be got by force, ſo neither is <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> but yet Governours ſhould here do their beſt: But as to the other we abhor the Conceit, that there are as <hi>many Religions,</hi> as there is difference about <hi>veſtures, geſtures, days and meats:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:60973:37"/>
But perhaps you take the word <hi>Religion</hi> in the Romane ſenſe, as you confine it to thoſe that you call <hi>[the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious]</hi> (as if you took the people of your Church to be irreligious:) And ſo <hi>you</hi> have indeed <hi>too many Religious,</hi> however they come to make one Church: The Religion of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> is one, and of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> another, and of the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> another; I cannot name them all: One eateth Herbs and Fiſh, and another eateth Fleſh ſeldom, another often; one weareth one habit, and another weareth another; one Religion hath one Rule of Life, and another hath another. But with us there is but <hi>one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> (which is the <hi>Chriſtian)</hi> though one man wear cloth and another ſtuffe, one white and another black, one eat Fleſh and another Fiſh, and another can ſeldom get either; though one wear his Hair long and another ſhort, though one be old and another be young, yet we are all of one Religion: Yea, though one preach and pray in Engliſh, another in Welch, another in French, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Dutch, yet we take not theſe to be ſo many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: No nor though one think <hi>Free praying</hi> fitter for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters than an <hi>impoſed Form,</hi> and another think an <hi>impoſed Form</hi> only fit, and a third think as the meer Puritan, that <hi>both</hi> having their Conveniences and Inconveniences, there ſhould be ſeaſons <hi>for both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I pray you here tell me two things if you can. 1. Whether the great <hi>difference of Liturgies</hi> (which are the very <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Churches Worſhip)</hi> be not liker a <hi>difference of Religions,</hi> than the <hi>colour</hi> of our <hi>cloaths,</hi> or the <hi>meat</hi> we <hi>eat,</hi> or the <hi>lighting</hi> of a <hi>Candle, &amp;c.</hi> And yet do I need to tell you how many Liturgies are recorded in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum?</hi> Yea, that it was ſix hundred years and more before the Churches in <hi>one Empire</hi> uſed all one and the ſame Liturgy? and for ſome
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60973:37"/>
hundred years, that every Church uſed what the Biſhop pleaſed? Yea, that the firſt reſtraint of <hi>free-praying</hi> that we find was, by a Council ordaining that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter ſhould firſt ſhew his Prayer to the Fathers that they might be ſure it was ſound? And had <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and all others that varyed, as divers <hi>Religions</hi> as <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether all the <hi>doctrinal</hi> Controverſies among your ſelves, as between all your School <hi>Doctors</hi> about Predeſtination, Grace, and free will, about Perſeverance, about the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> about the Power of the Pope over all Kings in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and about the killing of excommunicate Kings, and the abſolving their Subjects, and whether after excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication they <hi>are Kings</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> (of which <hi>Hen. Fowlis</hi> hath cited great ſtore on one ſide,) and all the Moral Controverſies about loving God, about Perjuries, Vows, Murder, Fornication, Lying, Stealing, Drunkenneſs, Gluttony, (of which you may ſee great ſtore in <hi>Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s Letters, The Myſtery of Jeſuitiſme, and Mr. <hi>Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> late Book called <hi>The Practical Divinity of the Church of Rome:)</hi> I ſay, is not Religion as much concerned about all theſe differences, and all the reſt among you which make many Horſe-loads, yea I think Cart-loads of Volumes, as it is in the colour of the Preachers Cloaths, or the Meat he eateth? And are not Proteſtants (that is, <hi>meer Chriſtians</hi> diſowning Popery) as juſtifiable in their Unity and Charity, for taking Men to be of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who uſe not the ſame Garments, Geſtures, and Ceremonies, and that bear with differences herein, as your Church that beareth with all theſe loads of different Doctrines in your moſt Learned Famous Doctors (and not in the weaker Prieſts alone) even whether excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60973:38"/>
Kings may be killed or no; and whether the Pope hath Power to put down and ſet up Emperours and Kings? If you ſay that your <hi>One Religion</hi> and <hi>One Church</hi> hath no ſuch difference, it muſt be by ſaying that you all agree to <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh in <hi>Concil. Rom. &amp; Innoc.</hi> 3. in <hi>Concil. Lateran.</hi> on the worſer ſide, and all own the Doctors cited by <hi>H. Fowlis</hi> aforeſaid: But indeed I muſt ſpeak better of you, even that ſome are of a better mind, whom <hi>Goldaſtus</hi> hath gathered and preſerved, and divers of the Learned Men of <hi>France,</hi> and ſome in <hi>Spain.</hi> But we think the difference even between the Prelatiſts, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, Independants, yea and the moderate Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, to be far leſs than theſe which your unanimous agreeing Church doth conſtantly bear with, without Silencing, Impriſoning, Ejecting, or Condemning, or ſo much as <hi>diſowning</hi> the judgments of the worſer ſide.</p>
            <p>He that readeth <hi>Parſons</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Watſon's Quodlibets</hi> on the other; <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Witherington</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Zuarez</hi> and the far greater prevalent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the other, will either wonder at the <hi>ſtrength of your Unity</hi> which no doctrinal differences even about the Blood of Kings can at all diſſolve; or elſe he may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the laxe and ſandie temperament of ſuch Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as cannot bear with a Man that readeth not in their Book, and ſingeth not in their Tune; and is ſtill crying out againſt others as Sectaries, becauſe they <hi>have piped to them and they have not danced;</hi> and ſuch as no Man can live quietly within reach of, unleſs they ſwallow every Morſel which they cut for them, having Throats neither wider, or at leaſt no narrower than theirs. As if King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's days were the meaſure of true Diſcipline, when one Man was burnt for being too far from Popery, and another hanged, or beheaded, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60973:38"/>
Popiſh, and it was hard to know the middle Region, and harder to know how long it would be calm? till ſtrangers cryed, <hi>Deus bone, quomodo hic vivunt Gentes.</hi> But as none are more cruel in Wars than Cowards, (nor in Robberies than Women,) nor any more gentle and pitiful than valiant experienced Souldiers; ſo few are ſo inſolent and bloody obtruders of their Dictates and Wills upon the World, as thoſe that being leaſt able to prove them good, have nothing but Inquiſitions and Priſons, Silencings and Baniſhings, Fire and Faggot, effectually to make them good.</p>
            <p>But if St. <hi>James</hi> be in the right, who ſaith, that <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their adverſity, and to keep our ſelves unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the World,</hi> then certainly the <hi>Jeſuits Morals,</hi> and the <hi>Myſtery of Jeſuitiſm,</hi> and <hi>Clarkſon</hi>'s <hi>Roman Practical Divinity,</hi> and <hi>Fowlis</hi>'s Treaſons of the Papiſts, contain more of the concerns of Religion, than preaching in a conſecrated or unconſecrated place, and than eating Fleſh, Fiſh, or neither, in <hi>Lent</hi> or on <hi>Fridays,</hi> doth. O the ſtrange difference between your Unity and Concord, and the Proteſtants! How faſt is yours? How looſe is ours?</p>
            <p>And it is to be conſidered we pretend not to ſo much perfection in this world, as ever to expect that all Men ſhould be juſt of the ſame Size and Complexion, or ſpeak the ſame Language, or have all the ſame Opinions, Thoughts, or Words: If we can keep the <hi>Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</hi> in the ſeven Points named by the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6. ſo far as we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained do walk by the ſame Rule (of Love and Peace) and mind the ſame things, till God reveal more to ſuch as differ, <hi>(Phil.</hi> 3.) we ſhall be glad of ſuch a meaſure
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60973:39"/>
of Union: For we believe it impoſſible to be perfect in Concord, while moſt, yea all are ſo wofully imperfect in Knowledge, Faith, Love and Obedience. We wait for perfection of all in Heaven; and we find that few things in the World ever did ſo much againſt Unity, as pretending to more than is to be hoped for, and laying ill on ſo high terms, and ſo many as we know will never be received. Therefore our Mutual Love and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with different Forms and Circumſtances, is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Principles of our Religion.</p>
            <p>But for you that pretend to <hi>Unity, Concord, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judgement,</hi> to tolerate Cart-loads of Doctrinal Controverſies, divers Expoſitions of many hundred Texts of Scripture, divers readings of the Text it ſelf, contrary Doctrines about God's Grace, about all the Ten Commandments, about the Eſtates and Lives of Kings, and never ſo much as to condemn either ſide nor ſilence the Preachers, never impriſon them, or baniſh them five miles from Cities and Corporations, never put them to any diſgrace, but ſtill honour them as renowned Doctors, as if the Lives of Kings, and the reſt of theſe things were leſs than a Form of Prayer, or a Ceremony, yea when your Inquiſition torment poor Proteſtants for ſmaller matters, (as reading the Bible, or a Proteſtant Book;) methinks all this ſheweth that Chriſtian Concord is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on better Principles than yours, and that yours is but the Bond of your Clergy intereſt.</p>

Is it not a meer deceiving trick to word your own Accuſations ſo in the Proteſtants name, as you know you can eaſilyeſt plead, <hi>Not Guilty?</hi> May not one alter ſome <hi>one word</hi> in every Verſe of any Chapter in the Bible, and then proteſt, that <hi>not one of all thoſe Verſes is in the Bible?</hi> So if the Printer have ſome <hi>Errata</hi> in each Leaf of your Book, may you not proteſt that not one Leaf of it is yours?</p>
            <p n="2">2. And is it not deceitfully done to appeal to the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> as the Accuſers, that thus charge you, when you know how vain it is to expect, that, (how ſound ſoever their judgments be) the Vulgar ſhould ſtate any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies ſo exactly, as not to miſs it in a <hi>word</hi> or <hi>more;</hi> when they hit the ſenſe? And you knew how hard it is to diſprove you: For who ſhall judge what is the opinion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60973:40"/>
of the Vulgar? If I ſhould ſay that <hi>few</hi> or <hi>none</hi> of my acquaintance do charge you to ſpeak thoſe very words, you may ſay that <hi>you know ſome that do,</hi> and I cannot confute you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And have you not the Differences between you and us voluminouſly ſtated and handled long ago, by many whoſe Books have been received by the Churches, and Licenſed by Authority, when the <hi>Vulgar ſtating</hi> of them was never Licenſed nor owned? Why did you not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>Jewel, Uſher</hi>'s <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuites Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,</hi> Dr. <hi>Challoner, Chillingworth,</hi> Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenthorp,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reignolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>John White,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames, Sadeel, Chamier, Whitakers,</hi> or ſuch others, what the things are that Proteſtants charge you with? And anſwer what is there charged on you?</p>
            <p>I my ſelf have enumerated many of the things which we take for Popery, and not to be defended, in my <hi>Key for Catholicks,</hi> and in my <hi>Safe Religion,</hi> and in One <hi>Sheet againſt Popery,</hi> almoſt twenty years ago; and ſince then in my <hi>[Full and eaſie ſatisfaction which is the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,]</hi> and in my <hi>[Certainty of Chriſtianity without Popery.]</hi> And you have given no anſwer to any one of them that I ever heard of: But you can better diſpute, it ſeems, with your <hi>Relations,</hi> and with the <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Country-Labourers,</hi> or <hi>Tradeſmen,</hi> that never uſe to ſpeak in that ſtictneſs of words as ſhall prevent the Cavils of a ſtudied Sophiſter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for the A. B. of <hi>York,</hi> I am almoſt a Stranger to him, and more to his Book, which I never ſaw: But two things I can ſay, 1. That we are no more obliged to juſtifie his words, than you to juſtifie the words of any one of your Doctors. 2. That no man is ſo fit to anſwer for him as he is for himſelf: Becauſe no man knoweth ſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60973:40"/>
well in what ſenſe he took the word <hi>[Papiſt.]</hi> I ſuppoſe you know that <hi>Grotius,</hi> who perſwadeth us all to an <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Union with your Church, under the Popes Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the Canons, owning the Decrees of all the Councils, even that of</hi> Trent, yet for all this doth ſpeak againſt <hi>Papiſts:</hi> But he tells you that by <hi>Papiſts</hi> he meaneth <hi>thoſe Flatterers of the Pope, who approve of all that he ſaith or doth.</hi> And that it was not the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>Doctrine</hi> of that Church that was to have been <hi>reformed,</hi> but the <hi>Opinions</hi> of ſome <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and the <hi>exceſſes,</hi> and <hi>ill lives</hi> of <hi>many</hi> of the <hi>Clergie.</hi> Now could not <hi>Grotius</hi> eaſily have produced ſuch <hi>Papiſts</hi> as theſe, as having ſaid as groſs things as you recite?</p>
            <p>And how far Biſhop <hi>Bromhall,</hi> and the Doctor that lately publiſhed him, own <hi>Grotius,</hi> I will not tell you, but refer you to their own words: To which many more might eaſily be added. Now ſuppoſe that Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> or A. Biſhop <hi>Bromhall,</hi> or his Prefacer ſhould ſay, that by <hi>[Papiſts]</hi> they mean ſuch as <hi>Grotius</hi> did, do you think that they could not prove as groſs words, as any cited by you, in ſome ſuch Flatterers of the Pope? And you know, I ſuppoſe, that ſome of late would not have the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> called <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or at leaſt ſo charged, but only the <hi>Court of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us take notice of ſome of the Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Your firſt Article is, That <hi>Papiſts are ſaid to Worſhip Stocks and Stones, Medals, and Pictures of Jeſus Chriſt as Gods, and pray to them, and put their whole confidence in them, as the ancient Heathens did in their dumb Idols of</hi> Jupiter, Mars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Your Doctors are oft charged with maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Image of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Croſs</hi> muſt be <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with latria,</hi> which is the Worſhip called Divine:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60973:41"/>
And inſtead of this you put in the word <hi>[as Gods.]</hi> It is not <hi>[as reputing theſe Images to be really Gods,]</hi> but <hi>[wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping them as God only ſhould be worſhipped,]</hi> contrary to the ſecond Commandment, which forbiddeth ſuch <hi>Bodily actions</hi> as were ſymbolical of Idol-Worſhip, though the <hi>Mind</hi> were kept never ſo free from accounting God to be like Idols, or Idols to be Gods.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who chargeth you of putting your <hi>Whole truſt in Images?</hi> Is not <hi>part of it</hi> too much?</p>
            <p n="3">3. How prove you that the Heathens ordinarily did ſo? Or that they took <hi>Jupiter, &amp;c.</hi> to be nothing but <hi>the Image,</hi> and not a <hi>Coeleſtial Power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But inſtead of ſaying any more on this point, I again tell you, that Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath in his new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt <hi>T. G.</hi> ſo fully proved that the generality of the Heathen Nations did worſhip one Univerſal Supreme God, and worſhipped their inferior Gods much like as you do Angels, and worſhipped their Images, not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods themſelves, but with ſuch a Relation to the Deity, as you do your Images; and that your Image Worſhip is ſuch as the ancient Fathers condemned in the Heathens; that none of you will ever be able ſolidly to confute him, or defend your Idols any more: So dear do you pay for <hi>T. G.</hi> his temporary triumph.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Your ſecond feigned Charge is, <hi>[That the Pope can give men leave to commit any ſin for money—or ſo pardon any ſin after, as you ſhall not be in the leaſt danger of any puniſhment for it temporal, or eternal, in Purgatory, or in Hell.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will take your part in this, and prove that the Squib-maker, who drew up this Charge, doth do you wrong. What a Sot was he to think that any Pope would ever be ſick, or ſore, or dye, if he could forgive
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60973:41"/>
               <hi>all temporal puniſhment?</hi> Unleſs the unhappy man can forgive all others, and not himſelf? At leaſt he would preſerve ſome of his Friends in health and immortality on Earth? And the Whores, that <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf ſaith made Popes at their pleaſure, would have found ſome Popes ſo grateful as to have ſaved them from dying, if not from bringing forth in pain. And truly I ſhould hope that at leaſt the Pope that by a Council was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for an Infidel, and believing not any life to come in Heaven or Hell, would have been ſo tender-hearted as to forgive all the world the puniſhment in Hell. And it was a great miſtake in theſe Slanderers of you, to except no ſin: As if the Popes could forgive them that would diminiſh their Kingdoms, or reſtrain their Domination; much leſs that would depoſe them. Could Pope <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ever forgive the Univerſal Church, as it's called, that is, the great General Council which in vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and depoſed him? When he can ſcarce forgive a poor Proteſtant the Rack and Fire, for reading the Bible or ſerving God out of the <hi>Roman</hi> way.</p>
            <p>And doubtleſs he is wronged by this Charge, that he can nullifie all <hi>pain, death, Purgatory, and Hell;</hi> for I think you will ſay, that <hi>quoad potentiam ordinatam</hi> Chriſt cannot do it, or at leaſt he will not. And were this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by all the World, no wonder if they willingly obeyed him, and called him, <hi>Our Lord God the Pope.</hi> For he could conquer any Kingdom, by ſaving all his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from hurt and death.</p>
            <p>It is enough that he can forgive ſome <hi>part</hi> or <hi>time</hi> of Purgatory Torments, and that (as great Doctors ſay) he can (and leſſer Prieſts than he) forgive the pains of Hell to a ſinner that hath no true <hi>contrition</hi> for ſin (that is, repenteth not out of any Love to God or Goodneſs)
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60973:42"/>
but only <hi>Attrition</hi> and the <hi>Sacrament of Penance and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi> (that is, repenteth only for fear of Hell, and would ſin ſtill if he durſt.)</p>
            <p>And though you may hope that there are no Copies of the old Pardons yet to be ſeen, or any of <hi>Tecelius</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe now extant, yet the ſure Hiſtory of them is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and if you deny it, it will be proved to your ſhame. What a multitude of Writers have better cited your practice and confuted it?</p>
            <p>But yet I remember (to do you right) that even <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi> himſelf <hi>(Greg.</hi> 7.) in a <hi>Roman</hi> Council ſaith, that <hi>[neither the Sacrament of Baptiſm, nor Penance is of any force to pardon any impenitent Hypocrite,]</hi> which is well ſaid; and as for true <hi>Penitent Believers,</hi> we verily believe that they are pardoned <hi>ipſo jure</hi> by the Goſpel, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive or helliſh Puniſhment; and that every true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt may validly deliver this pardon miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, by true abſolution, in the Sacrament, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. But in what <hi>meaſure</hi> God himſelf will remit <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Chaſtiſements,</hi> few men can know till the event tell it them: And neither Pope nor Prieſt can forgive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; nor know what God will remit, any more than another man may know, that is, by Gods Word, and by the event.</p>
            <p>And again, I ſay if it were in the Popes power (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may abſolve him from Bribery or the Love of Money) that there would be more difference in point of bodily ſuffering, between his Subjects or Favourites and other men, than was ever yet perceived. It's policy therefore to confine the buſineſs to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that no witneſs may be able to diſprove it.</p>
            <p>You add to the Charge, <hi>[That of all Chriſt's Merits the Pope is the Supreme Lord, to diſpoſe of them to the</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60973:42"/>
               <hi>living and the dead, as he by his unerring Spirit thinks fitting.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here the Charger wrongs you too: For ſeeing all mens Lives and Mercies are the Fruits of Chriſts <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> if this were true, the Pope could kill all his Enemies at his pleaſure, and when he hath killed them could caſt them into Hell, or keep them out of Heaven: And then no one in his wits would be againſt him, or diſpleaſe him. It's enough to be able to do as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Your next is <hi>[the Papiſt honours the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>much more than he does her divine Son, or God the Father: for one Prayer he ſays to God, he ſays ten to the Virgin.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is injurious too, whoever made it: The Pagans honour not their Inferiour Gods, ſo much as the Supreme! And for the <hi>number</hi> of Prayers, it's not like that all Papiſts uſe the ſame, or by the ſame Beads: But whether you give <hi>inordinate honour</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and put not up a very large proportion of your Prayers to her; if Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and abundance before him, may not be truſted in their Citations, I hope your own Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-books may be believed. It's bad enough to make her like <hi>Juno,</hi> though you ſhould not equal her with <hi>Jove.</hi> Angels have refuſed ſmaller honour.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. You add <hi>[His Prayers are a company of Latine words, he neither underſtands, or cares to underſtand them, which if he do but patter over in ſuch a number, though his heart and mind be wholly taken up with worldly thoughts and deſires, he thinks,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> At the firſt line one would have thought you had grown paſt bluſhing, and had <hi>denyed</hi> your <hi>Latine Prayers,</hi> not underſtood; but you never want <hi>one word</hi> to help you out in renouncing the whole Sentence: You make me think of that ſorry Religion which teacheth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60973:43"/>
men, that if <hi>one Article in a Vow,</hi> among many, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, they may renounce all Obligation to any thing elſe that there is Vowed; and ſo a Knave may be diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to all Vows and Covenants, if he will but drop in any thing that is unlawful. Do not your unlearned Multitude join in your <hi>Latine Prayers?</hi> Do Maſs-books, and your daily Maſſes, all deceive our Eyes and Ears? No, that's not it; what then! muſt all be <hi>deſirous</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, if they cannot? I rather think the Calumny is, that <hi>[his mind and heart may be wholly taken up with worldly deſires?]</hi> But who was it that put in that into the Charge? was it not your ſelf? We know that you ſay, <hi>There ſhould be ſome General kind of Devotion and good Deſire, though he know not what is ſaid;</hi> and <hi>a General Belief,</hi> called <hi>Implicite,</hi> which is <hi>no Belief of any of the Particulars,</hi> and a <hi>General Implicite Deſire,</hi> which is <hi>no Deſire of any expreſs Particular,</hi> being <hi>a Faith</hi> that is <hi>no Faith,</hi> and <hi>a Prayer</hi> which is <hi>no Prayer,</hi> would make a Religion which is no Religion, if you had no better.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The next is <hi>[If he do but believe as his Church-men believe, though he be wholly ignorant of their Belief, his Soul is ſafe enough.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What is a Man but his Wit? The Word <hi>(wholly)</hi> craftily put in by your ſelf, enableth you alſo to renounce this Charge: For we all confeſs that your Doctors commonly hold, that this one Article muſt be believed, <hi>[That the Church is to be believed and obeyed,]</hi> and that's one Particular. But I pray tell us if you can: 1. Dare your Church ſay that every word revealed muſt be believed Explicitely of neceſſity to Salvation? No: 2. And have they in any General Council determined what thoſe Particular Articles are that are ſo neceſſary, (ſince you departed from the ſufficiency of the Creed?)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60973:43"/>
Or do not your Doctors, without any Decree of the Church, uſe to debate it as a free opinion? 3. And do they not differ among themſelves, as all in pieces about the Point? And do not your chief Learned School-men cited at large by <hi>Fr. a Sancta Clara</hi> on our Articles hold that the Particular Belief of Chriſt himſelf, or the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Articles of the Creed are not of neceſſity? And I know not of any one thing that you are agreed to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, beſides the Belief that the <hi>Church,</hi> (that is, the <hi>Pope and his Council) are Infallible,</hi> or to be believed and obeyed; and it is a Learned School Doctor and Jeſuite <hi>Fran. Albertinus Corol. p.</hi> 250. that juſtifieth a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſhould believe a falſhood if twenty Biſhops tell it him, and that the Command of Faith doth oblige to believe falſhood, it being <hi>not per ſe, but per accidens, &amp;c.</hi> And I think the old man is now among you at <hi>London, (Fr. a Sancta Clara,)</hi> who having cited abundance of Doctors againſt the neceſſity of believing in Chriſt or any Supernatural Point, or in ſome caſes knowing the Law of Nature and the Decalogue, ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 20. <hi>[To ſpeak my ſence freely, I think that the Common People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to the inſtruction of the Paſtors, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their knowledge and goodneſs, if they be deceived, it ſhall be accounted invincible ignorance, or probable at leaſt:</hi> So Herera; <hi>which excuſeth from fault: Yea, ſome Doctors give ſo much to the Inſtruction of Doctors on whom the care of the Flock lyeth, that if they teach</hi> hic &amp; nunc <hi>that God would be hated, that a rude Pariſhioner is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</hi> See abundance more in him cited, <hi>Deus, Nat. Grat. Probl.</hi> 15, <hi>and</hi> 16. And that you may know that this opinion is not rare, he addeth, <hi>p.</hi> 123. <hi>[It ſeemeth to be the common opinion of the Schools and Doctors at this day, that the Laity erring with their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:60973:44"/>
               <hi>or Paſtors, are altogether excuſed from all fault: Yea, by erring thus many wayes materially they merit for the Act of Chriſtian Obedience which they owe, their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as</hi> Valentia <hi>ſaith</hi> To. 3. Diſp. 1. q. 2. p. 5. <hi>and others with</hi> Angles, Vaſ. quez. <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this be true, what Prince, Lord, or any other Lay-man, that would be out of all danger of Sin and Hell, would not be a Papiſt, and be ſure to chuſe a Prieſt that is ignorant enough to take Perjury, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Gluttony, Adultery, Fornication, Perſecution, Opreſſion for no Sin, and then he may be ſure that it's none to him, but he meriteth by obeying him that will perſwade him to it?</p>
            <p>And what if theſe bid Subjects kill their Kings, would it not be ſinleſs and meritorious by this Rule?</p>
            <p>But you'll ſay, Theſe be but the words of Writers, and Books may be miſunderſtood, when they ſay that this is the common Opinion of the Doctors. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps if I talk with you, or another, you will proteſt that this is none of your belief. But how ſhall I know that <hi>W. H.</hi> or his Neighbour, or Grandfather, know better what is the Faith or Religion of the Papiſts than the old Queens Confeſſor, and all thoſe famous Doctors, whom he citeth, and all that I my ſelf have read?</p>
            <p>And remember your Undertaking, cited in my Title Page.</p>
            <p>Is it not the moſt common Opinion of your Doctors, that all men are bound to know and believe according to their opportunities, and probable inſtructions? But what is commonly neceſſary your Learned Church-men cannot tell us, no not the Pope or Councils? And who can tell what other mens capacities and opportunities have been? and ſo whether he be a Believer indeed, or not? or bound to be ſo?</p>
            <p n="6">

VI. Your next part is, <hi>[He makes Gods of—ſinful men:—He maketh leſs ſcruple of violating Gods Laws, than he doth any Ordinance of the Pope, or any Law of his Church]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That one word <hi>[any]</hi> is either the falſhood of your Accuſer, or the <hi>craft</hi> of the Clark that drew up the Inditement: And I think it ſhould not be drawn up of theſe Laws compared <hi>formaliter,</hi> but <hi>materialiter:</hi> For I cannot think you ſo unreaſonable, as to think that the Pope is above God; but that when you caſt away God's Laws to keep the Pope's, it is becauſe you think that the Pope hath power to change and abrogate God's Laws, or diſpenſe with them; or that you are bound to believe that it is none of Gods Law, if the Pope ſay it's none: For Inſtance, 1. I know that you caſt away Chriſt's Law for receiving his Body and Blood, the Cup as well as the Bread in the Sacrament: But <hi>why</hi> you do ſo, I am no Judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I know that you break the Second Commandment, and uſually leave it out of the Decalogue too: But why you do it, I am no Judge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I know that the Pope and his approved General Council at <hi>Laterane</hi> make a Law againſt Gods Law for obedience to the higher powers, and this Papiſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to receive as part of their Religion: But on what reaſons you do it, I leave to you.</p>
            <p>You Inſtance <hi>[If he commit Fornication it is but a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sin]</hi> Do You hold that any of your approved Councils have defined it to be a Mortal Sin? If ſo, I hope you will take thoſe for Heretical that think it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo: I refer you to Mr. <hi>Clarkſons Practical Divinity</hi> aforeſaid, and the Jeſuites Morals. But doubtleſs all of you have not the ſame Judgment either of Fornication or Murder, (as is there proved;) for you are not bound
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60973:45"/>
to be ſo far agreed, in ſuch little things: But your craft put in the <hi>ſaving word</hi> next, <hi>[and ſprinkling himſelf with a little Holy Water he is as free from all ſpot as a new Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Infant.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They ſay, <hi>No Man wrongeth himſelf:</hi> You may lay a falſe Charge againſt your ſelf that you may the eaſier deny it; There muſt be ſomewhat more than <hi>Holy Water,</hi> elſe what need of <hi>Attrition</hi> and Confeſſion, and Penance, if it pleaſe the Prieſt, or Commutation of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? what need the Cruſado's to have killed ſo many thouſands of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes</hi> to procure the pardon of their ſins (O dreadful way to pardon!) What room for Pilgrimages, ſatisfactions, or for Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or for Maſſes to be ſaid for the Souls in Purgatory, or for praying to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and abundance ſuch, if <hi>Holy Water alone</hi> would do all the Buſineſs? Was not he much overſeen, or did groſly prevaricate, that drew up this Charge? Might I but chuſe my Adverſaries Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and agree with him to ſay nothing but what I can diſprove, I would certainly have the better, and be juſtified.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60973:45"/>
hardly bluſh, when you have the face to bring in ſuch an inſtance, and by the inſerting of a word or two of your own, to dare to waſh off from your Religion the blot of Perfidiouſneſs and Rebellion, when it is part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of your approved General Council. The Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator wrongeth you, 1. By making <hi>[not of his Religion]</hi> to be all that's neceſſary to free you from allegiance. 2. By putting in <hi>[or any other Oath for a piece of Money:]</hi> I have not yet found that the Pope undertaketh to diſpenſe with a man that will ſwear to <hi>believe the Roman Church,</hi> or the reſt in Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his <hi>Trent</hi> Oath, nor yet with the Vow of Baptiſm, if ſeconded by an Oath. 3. By ſaying only <hi>[If his Prince perſecute him;]</hi> for the Doctors ſay that he muſt be firſt <hi>excommunicate,</hi> or a Heretick at leaſt, and ſome ſay he muſt have the Pope's Order before he may kill a King; and the Council only ſpeaketh of <hi>Depoſing,</hi> and not of killing. 4.

            </p>
            <p>In this third ſenſe now I am to tell you what we Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants mean by a <hi>Papiſt</hi> more particularly. And firſt I muſt tell you what a <hi>POPE</hi> is, before I can well tell you what a Papiſt is: Which I ſhall do, I. <hi>De facto Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically:</hi> II. <hi>De jure</hi> as to the <hi>Power</hi> which he <hi>claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. A long time the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſeldome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Popes,</hi> and other Biſhops were ſo called as well as they: At firſt the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were pious perſecuted Men, and many of them Martyrs, and uſurped no Power over any Churches but their own; which with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> were the two firſt that brake <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Teſt of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who ſaith, <hi>[To every Church there is one Altar, and one Biſhop with his fellow Presbyter and Deacons.]</hi> But <hi>Rome</hi> having long called her ſelf the Miſtris of the World, and being the Seat of the Empire and Senate, and of the Governing Power of the <hi>orbis Romanus,</hi> the Chriſtians there grew greater than others, and the Biſhop as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed kept it under his Power: And when Chriſtians had peace (which was under the far greateſt part of the Heathen Emperours, and for the far longeſt time) the Greatneſs of <hi>Rome</hi> giving Greatneſs to that Church, and ſo to the Biſhop, and great opportunity to help other Churches, becauſe the Governing Power of the Empire was there, this Biſhop grew to be of <hi>greateſt wealth</hi> and <hi>intereſt:</hi> And in times of Peace the Strife which Chriſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60973:47"/>
once ended was taken up among the Biſhops <hi>[which of them ſhould be the greateſt:]</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> having taught Chriſtians that they ſhould not <hi>go voluntarily to Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other before Heathens,</hi> if there <hi>were but a wiſe man among them to be an Arbitrator;</hi> the Chriſtians ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that they had none wiſer or fitter than their Biſhop, made him their Common <hi>Arbitrator</hi> in things Civil, as well as Eccleſiaſtical: By which means Cuſtom making it like a Law, Biſhops became <hi>de facto Church-Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates:</hi> But they had no Power to execute any <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> either <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> or to make any of their own, except as Arbitrators or Doctors to thoſe that would voluntarily receive them: And they had no Power of Life and Death, nor to diſ-member any, nor to beat or ſcourge them, nor to Fine them or Confiſcate their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: But being entruſted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> as his Miniſters with the Power of the <hi>Church-Keys,</hi> and by the <hi>People</hi> with the Power of <hi>Civil Arbitrations,</hi> they were by this the <hi>ſtated Governours of all Chriſtians;</hi> who yet obeyed the <hi>Roman</hi> Heathen Magiſtrates, but brought none of their own differences voluntarily before them.</p>
            <p>And becauſe that Multitudes of Hereſies took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Churches liberty, and ſwarmed among them to their great weakning and diſgrace, and chriſt had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Servants to ſerve him in as much <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> as they could, duty and neceſſity drove the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Churches to <hi>Correſpondencies,</hi> and to <hi>meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> on all juſt occaſions, and at laſt to <hi>Aſſociations</hi> for the ordering of theſe Meetings! In which they agreed in what <hi>Compaſs</hi> and in what <hi>Place,</hi> or by <hi>whoſe Call</hi> ſuch Meetings ſhould be held, and what Biſhops in thoſe Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhould <hi>preſide</hi> or ſit higheſt, and firſt ſpeak and ſubſcribe: And uſually they thought that to follow the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60973:47"/>
Order of the Civil Government, and give precedency to thoſe that were Biſhops of ſuch Cities as had precedency in the Civil Government, was the moſt convenient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: And in theſe Meetings they agreed on ſuch Canons or Orders for all in that Compaſs to obſerve, as they thought beſt tended to their ends: And having no forcing Power (as is aforeſaid) they formed their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions on voluntarily penitents ſo as might ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Power of the Sword: Even Murderers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous, Adulterers, they could not puniſh with Death, Stripes, or Mulcts, and they were loth to diſgrace Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſo much as to accuſe ſuch to the Heathen Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; and therefore they laid the greater ſhame upon them, forbidding them Communion with Chriſtians for ſo many years as they thought meet, and before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored them they were humbly to beg the Prayers and Communion of the Church. But yet theſe Synods were ſmall and few and rare, and never any dreamt of them as a Council of all the Church on Earth.</p>
            <p>But when God bleſſed the <hi>Rome</hi> World with a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperour after the ſharp Perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and this Emperour had by Religion and Intereſt made the <hi>Chriſtian Souldiers</hi> his <hi>chief confidents</hi> or <hi>ſtrength,</hi> he ſtudied the utmoſt <hi>increaſe of the Chriſtians,</hi> and to that end invited all to Chriſtianity, by the favour of the Court, and by ſuch Honours, Commands, Wealth, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as they were capable of; and above all he exalted the Chriſtian Biſhops, whom he <hi>found</hi> the Rulers of the Chriſtian Societies: He gave them Honours, and Wealth, and Power: He made a Law that no Chriſtians ſhould be forced to go to the Civil Heathen Judicatures, from their Biſhops, and gave Power to the Biſhops to be the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Judges, ſome few hainous Crimes being in time
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60973:48"/>
excepted: And ſo the Biſhops were by <hi>his Law</hi> made <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrates</hi> or <hi>Arbitrators;</hi> yet not with any Power of Life, or Limbs, or Eſtate: So that all that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, and would be ſubject to the Biſhops Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and Church Diſcipline, were freed from Death, Stripes, and Mulcts, for many Crimes which all others were lyable to, and Excommunication and ſome Penance was inſtead of all: By ſuch means Multitudes of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men, and by the Preaching of the Goſpel Multitudes that were ſound Chriſtians, came together into the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: And Biſhopricks being now very deſirable for their Power, Honour, and Wealth, Men that moſt loved <hi>Power, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Wealth,</hi> (that is, <hi>Proud, Worldly, Carnal Men)</hi> did earneſtly ſeek them, and ſtrive for Precedency in them: But yet while the People had the choice, or a Negative therein, and the old Spirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity remained in many of the Biſhops, in many places bad ones were kept out, and many excellent Men were preferred.</p>
            <p>The Hereſie of <hi>Arrius</hi> and the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereabout, required a remedy for the Churches Peace: The Biſhops could not end it themſelves: It ſpread ſo far that it was <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s great grief to ſee Chriſtians ſo quickly diſgrace themſelves, and weaken their Religion in the Eyes of the Heathens: Therefore he called a Council of Biſhops conſiſting moſtly of thoſe of the Eaſtern parts where the troubles aroſe: Two Prieſts of <hi>Rome</hi> were there, but not the Biſhop, nor but few of the Weſt: Where the Emperours open Rebukes and Lamentation for their Contention, and his earneſt Exhortation to Peace, and his burning all the Libells or Accuſations which the Biſhops brought in againſt each other, and his continual preſence and moderating over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60973:48"/>
of them, brought that meeting at laſt to that good and peaceable End, which elſe it was never like to have attained.</p>
            <p>It never came into <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s mind to call this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil as an Univerſal Repreſentative of the whole Chriſtian World, or as the Governours of the Churches that were out of his Dominions; but as a fit expedient to end the ſtrife that was raiſed in thoſe Parts: For as few of the Weſt were there, ſo none of all other Kingdoms were once called. For who ſhould call them! <hi>Conſtantine</hi> that called the Council neither did it, nor ever pretended to a power to do it. The Pope called not the Council, much leſs did he call the reſt of the Chriſtian World: <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15. that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew</hi> to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> to the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> though the middle <hi>India</hi> was not Converted till <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s days, by <hi>Frumentius,</hi> and <hi>Edeſius,</hi> and <hi>Iberia</hi> by a Maid:] And ſo <hi>Euſeb. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. who ſaith, that St. <hi>Andrew</hi> Preached to the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and <hi>in Vit. Conſtant. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8. that there were many Churches in <hi>Perſia:</hi> And no doubt theſe Apoſtles Preached not in vain: <hi>Scotland</hi> and other Countries that were out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had Churches. Yet any Neighbour Biſhop that deſired it, might voluntarily be preſent. When <hi>Theodoret</hi> (in his Life) tells us that <hi>[James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Niſibis</hi> (in the borders of <hi>Perſia)</hi> was <hi>at the Council of</hi> Nice: <hi>For</hi> Niſibis <hi>was then under the Government of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire,]</hi> he plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that none but the Subjects of the Empire were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: And the names yet viſible, of the Subſcribers prove it.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this Councils deciſions, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions continue, and the Major part of the Biſhops
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60973:49"/>
went that way uſually as the Emperours went: And ſo in the Reign of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> they moſt turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> at leaſt in words: And many General Councils (ſo called, of the Empire) the <hi>Arrians</hi> had, in which they prevailed, and made Creeds for their turn as they at <hi>Nice</hi> had done againſt them, and brought Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution on the Orthodox, ſilencing, and ejecting them, and ſcattering their Meetings as prohibited Conventicles, the Emperour himſelf ſometime executing their diſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reſtraint: And among other <hi>Liberius</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt his Conſcience Subſcribed to them.</p>
            <p>The Fathers at the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did determine of the bounds of the Patriarchs of the Empire, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at firſt but three, <hi>(Rome, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,) Jeruſalem</hi> was after added, and after that <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> having now ſtrengthned himſelf by the Chriſtian Intereſt, and being further out of the danger of mutable Souldiers, than his Predeceſſours, did that which none of them was ever able to do, by removing the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seat from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſo leaving that Famous City as naked and almoſt neglected: Whereby two great changes befell the Clergie, 1. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was left more abſolute and uncontrouled in the Weſt; 2. And the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſet up againſt him for the <hi>Primacy</hi> in the Empire: At firſt he claimed but an <hi>Equality,</hi> but afterward a <hi>Priority as Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop,</hi> becauſe his Seat was the Imperial Seat.</p>
            <p>The Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſo far from the Court, and of ſo ſmall power, that he made the leaſt ſtir of any of the five, though he had the faireſt pretenſe incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably for a claim of Supremacy on Religious reaſons, if a <hi>Supreme</hi> there muſt have been <hi>(Chriſt</hi> himſelf having been there a <hi>Miniſter to the Circumciſion,</hi> and Shepherd
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60973:49"/>
of the Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his Kinſman <hi>James</hi> then Biſhop after, and that being the <hi>Mother-Church</hi> out of which ſprung all the reſt.) But the other four Patriarchs (eſpecially three of them) became as ſo many <hi>Generals of Armies</hi> militating frequently againſt each other: and he that got the <hi>ſtronger</hi> Party of Biſhops and Court-favourers carryed all, againſt the reſt. But no place more turbulent, nor no Biſhop more unquiet than thoſe of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> Pride and Worldlineſs now grew apace, and ſo corrupted the Clergie, that in their Synods the <hi>fleſhly</hi> part too oft prevailed againſt the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual!</hi> When Court and Councils were for the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the whole Eaſtern part of the Empire was embroiled in the Contention, and the Orthodox in the greater Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks caſt out: When they were down and caſt out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the temporizing and turbulent Biſhops uſually got the Major Vote: Excellent <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> for the great ſervice that he had done againſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> was choſen by the People, and made Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:</hi> But the Synod of Biſhops envyed him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him, to whom he gave place and would not ſtrive. <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and his party fought it out at the General Council, and killed <hi>Flavianus:</hi> And being after overcome and outed of his Seat, did ſtill claim and keep the Title with his followers, and the moſt of his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate of the People ſtuck to him; ſo that he propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Opinion and Intereſt in all thoſe remote parts of the Empire: Yea among Volunteers in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and other <hi>extra-</hi>imperial parts, which no Law or Canon had ſubjected to him; while the Patriarch that ſucceeded him by the Councils Decree, had his party only as the reſt, <hi>within the Empire:</hi> So that to this day the <hi>Syrians, Ethiopians,</hi> and abundance others profeſs themſelves the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60973:50"/>
followers of <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> as the true Biſhop injuriouſly, ſay they, caſt out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> afterwards was caſt out of his Patriarchate of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by a Synod of Biſhops and the Court.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> the Biſhoprick was ſuch a prey, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for it troubled the Publick Peace: At the choice of <hi>Damaſus</hi> they fought it out in the Church, and his party won that ſacred Field, leaving many Carcaſſes there to the Church-Communion of the dead.</p>
            <p>But it became the great advantage of <hi>Rome,</hi> that when the Empire was divided, the Weſtern Emperour proved Orthodox while the Eaſtern were oft <hi>Arrians:</hi> Which kept up the honour of the Weſtern Biſhops who had not the temptations of the Eaſt; where ſharp perſecutions and the deſolation of their Flocks, and the boaſt of the <hi>Arrians</hi> as the Major part, that was alſo ſetled by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, cauſed the ejected Biſhops ſometime to ſolicite them of the Weſt for help, by ſending them ſome to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the <hi>Arrians</hi> that their Cauſe was owned by the Weſtern Biſhops, or to put ſome Countenance on their depreſſed Cauſe (and indeed the Weſtern Emperour did reſcue them.) This occaſioneth the Papiſts to this day to pretend that this was an Act of their ſubjection to the Pope: St. <hi>Baſil</hi> was the chief in this ſolicitation, and you ſhall read his words (Tranſlated.)</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Verily the manners of proud men</hi> (ſpeaking of the Weſtern Biſhops) <hi>uſe to grow more inſolent, if they be honoured: And if God be merciful to us, what other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition have we need of? but if Gods anger remain on us, what help can the pride of the Weſt bring us? when they neither know the truth, nor can endure to ſpeak it; but being prepoſſeſſed with falſe ſuſpicions they do the ſame things now which they did in the Caſe of</hi> Marcellus, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiouſly</hi>

                  <hi>diſputing againſt thoſe that taught the truth, but for Hereſie confirming it by their Authority?</hi> Indeed I was willing, <hi>(not as repreſenting the Publick Perſon of the Eaſt) to write to their Leader</hi> (Damaſus) <hi>but not about Church-matters; but that I might intimate that they neither knew the truth of the things that are done with us, nor did admit the way by which they might learn them. And in general, that they ſhould not inſult over the calamitous and afflicted, nor think that Pride did make for their dignity, when that one ſin alone is enough to make us hateful to God.</hi>
               </q> But this Epiſtle of <hi>Baſil Andr. Schottus</hi> the Jeſuite left out of <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Works when he publiſhed them, <hi>Antw. Lat. A. D.</hi> 1616. <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> had made as bold with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>lib. de Pudic. pag.</hi> 742. againſt <hi>Zepherinus:</hi> So had <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Firmilian</hi> againſt <hi>Stephen: Hilary Pictav.</hi> with <hi>Liberius</hi> and the Councils, even that of <hi>Nice:</hi> But moſt notable was the ſharp Conteſt of the <hi>Carthage</hi> Council, of which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was one, againſt <hi>Zoſimus,</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine;</hi> when the Pope falſly alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Canon of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council for Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> they denyed his claim, and evinced the forgery, and ſtood it out againſt him to the laſt.</p>
            <p n="1">I. And here you may ſee that they took not the Pope's Power to be of God <hi>(jure divino:)</hi> For they ſearched only all the Archives to find out the <hi>true Copies of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Council, (Piſanus</hi> Canons being not then made;) and did not go to the <hi>Scripture</hi> to decide the Caſe, nor to <hi>Tradition Apoſtolical,</hi> only pleading <hi>Church-Laws</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> as on their ſide.</p>
            <p>And that they never dreamt of a <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> of this <hi>Roman</hi> Papacy or Primacy, but only as the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>England</hi> hath precedency by the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60973:51"/>
King's Laws, and not by God's; ſo <hi>Rome</hi> was the firſt Seat by the meer appointment of man, even Emperours and Councils, is yet fully evident; 1. In that the <hi>ſame Power</hi> that made the other <hi>four Patriarchs,</hi> made the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> a Patriarch; and he was not made Pope or <hi>Prime Patriarch</hi> before he was made <hi>Patriarch:</hi> But no man dreameth of a Divine Inſtitution of the <hi>other four</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the whole Eaſtern Church, which was far greater than the Weſtern, firſt equalled the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to him of <hi>Rome,</hi> and after preferred him; when yet they never dreamed of a Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Patriarchate of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> For it was but lately made: And no man of reaſon can judge, that all the Catholick Emperours, Biſhops, and People of the far greateſt part of the Imperial Church, would profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly equal or prefer a <hi>Humane</hi> Office before one which they believed to be of <hi>Divine</hi> Inſtitution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To this day all the <hi>Greek</hi> Church ſhew themſelves to be of that judgment, by adhering to the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whom they confeſs to have been made ſuch by Emperours and Councils. And in the Conteſt with them the caſe is commonly pleaded accordingly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> would never have wiſhed ſo earneſtly that there were no <hi>inequality, ſuperiority,</hi> or <hi>prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Seats,</hi> if he had taken them to be of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: Durſt he have ſo oppoſed the Law and Order of God?</p>

               <hi>was the Imperial Seat;</hi> and therefore they give <hi>equal</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becauſe it is the Imperial Seat. The words of the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> (oft cited) are theſe (tranſlated.)</p>
            <p>Act. 16. Binii pag. 134. <q>[<hi>We following always the definitions of the holy Fathers and the Canons, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that have now been read of the</hi> 150 <hi>Biſhops moſt beloved of God, that were congregated under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, of pious memory,</hi> Theodoſius <hi>the Greater, in the Royal City of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>New</hi> Rome, <hi>have our ſelves alſo defined the ſame things, concerning the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the ſame moſt holy Church of</hi> Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>New</hi> Rome: <hi>For to the Seat of old</hi> Rome, <hi>becauſe of the Empire of that City, the Fathers conſequently gave the Priviledges.

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Council</hi> was called by the Emperour <hi>Martian;</hi> and his Lay-Officers were called the Judges: And the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to ſhew what they thought of <hi>Rome,</hi> cryed out <hi>[They that contradict it are Neſtorians: Let them that contradict it walk to</hi> Rome. <hi>Bin. p.</hi> 98.]</p>
            <p>If ſuch a General Council <hi>be not to be believed,</hi> fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well all the Papiſts Infallibility, Authority, Tradition, and Religion: If it <hi>be to be believed,</hi> the Pope is a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Creature, and not a Divine.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Binius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Rome receiveth not the Canons of this Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which this confirmeth, <hi>but only their condemnation of</hi> Macedonius: And he ſaith <hi>[That every Council hath juſt ſo much ſtrength and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>

               <hi>as the Apoſtolick See beſtoweth on it: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unleſs this be admitted, no reaſon can be given why ſome Councils of greater numbers of Biſhops were reprobated, and others of a ſmaller number confirmed,]</hi> Vol. 2. p. 515.

II. And as the <hi>Roman Primacy</hi> was but of <hi>Man's devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> ſo I next prove, that it was but <hi>over one Empire,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs any Neighbours for their own advantage did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward voluntarily ſubject themſelves. 1. Becauſe the Powers that gave him his Primacy, extended but to the Empire. The Emperour and his Subjects ruled not other Lands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the four other Patriarchs, made by the ſame Power, had no power without the Empire: As appeareth by the diſtribution of their Provinces in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and afterward: <hi>Piſanus</hi>'s Canons we regard not, that take in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>The</hi> Abaſſins <hi>now receive their chief Biſhop from the Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria.</p>
            <p>That proveth not that ever they were under <hi>Rome:</hi> For there is not the leaſt proof that ever they did ſo, till <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> and his Succeſſors ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> being rejected by them as Hereticks, and by long and ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees enlarged their power over many Neighbour Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the <hi>General Councils</hi> in which the Pope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, were but of the Empire. And the Popes never claimed a more general extenſive power then, than the <hi>Councils:</hi> Who indeed with the Emperours made the Papacy in its firſt ſtate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe when the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Primacy, yea called himſelf <hi>Univerſal Biſhop,</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> ſharply reprehendeth as Antichriſtian, yet he never claimed the Government of the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World, but only of the Empire. And in all their Conteſts there is no intimation of any ſuch different Claim of the Competitors, as if <hi>Rome</hi> claimed <hi>all the World,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> but the Empire, or <hi>Roman-</hi>World:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60973:53"/>
Their Conteſt was about the ſame Churches or Circuit, who ſhould be Chief.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Inſtances of the ſeveral Countries that were never under the Pope, do prove it: Even the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Abaſſia,</hi> and all the reſt fore-named without the Empire. Of which and the Exception more under the next.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>General Councils</hi> were all ſo called only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the generality of the Empire, and not as of all the Chriſtian World; which was never dreamed of. Proved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Emperours that called them <hi>(Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Martian, &amp;c.)</hi> had no power out of the Empire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no credible Hiſtory that mentioneth any further call; much leſs of all the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was the Affairs only of the Empire that the Councils judged of, as is to be ſeen in all their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Names of the Biſhops yet to be ſeen, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, fully prove it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It was not a thing probable, if poſſible, that the <hi>Indians, Perſians,</hi> and other Nations, ſhould ſend their Biſhops into the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which was uſually at War with them, or dreaded and deteſted by them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s foreſaid words of <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibis</hi> ſheweth it <hi>[that he was at the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>for</hi> Niſibis <hi>was then under the Roman Empire.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. I have oft cited the words of <hi>Reynerius,</hi> ſaying, that the outer Churches planted by the Apoſtles were not <hi>under the Church of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. The <hi>executive</hi> part neither could, nor ever was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon the Churches without the Empire. When did any Patriarch, or any Provincial, or General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60973:53"/>
ſend for any Biſhop or other perſon out of <hi>India, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, Ethiopia,</hi> or any other exterior Nation, to anſwer any Accuſation? or paſs any Sentence of Depoſition, or Suſpenſion againſt them? or put any other into their places?</p>
            <p n="9">9. General Councils are confeſſed by Papiſts to be but a <hi>Humane</hi> and not a <hi>Divine Inſtitution:</hi> and what Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power could ſettle them in and over the Church Univerſal? If you ſay It is by <hi>Univerſal Conſent;</hi> prove to us that ever there <hi>was</hi> ſuch a <hi>Conſent,</hi> or that ever there was any meeting or treaty for ſuch Conſent, of all the Chriſtian World, and we will yield it to you. Surely if there be any Chriſtians at the <hi>Antipodes</hi> they were not ſent to in thoſe days when <hi>Lactantius, Auguſtine,</hi> and others, denyed that there were any <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and derided it; nor when the Pope by our Countryman <hi>Boniface</hi> his Inſtigation excommunicated <hi>Virgilius</hi> for holding that there were <hi>Antipodes.</hi> Hear their great diſputer <hi>Pighi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Hierarch.

            <p n="10">10. But to end all the Controverſie, the names of the Subſcribers are yet to be ſeen, who were not the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the Chriſtian World, but of the <hi>Empire,</hi> as is notorious.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No wonder: So is all that is againſt him.</p>
            <p>The Exceptions which we grant are theſe. 1. There were ſome Cities of the Empire that were near to other Nations, where the Princes being Heathens, Chriſtians were underlings and few: And the Biſhops of theſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties extended their care to as many of the Neighbour Countries as would voluntarily ſubmit to them: So the Biſhop of <hi>Tomys</hi> was Biſhop of many <hi>Scythians,</hi> and ſo ſome that were on the Borders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> had many <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and were at <hi>Nice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There were ſome Countries that were ſometimes under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, and ſometime under the <hi>Perſian,</hi> or others, as Victory carried it; and theſe when they had been once of the Imperial Church, took it (when they fell under Heathens) to be their Honour, Strength, and Priviledge to be ſo accounted ſtill, and ſo would come to their Councils after if they could: So it was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60973:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the <hi>Armenians;</hi> and the <hi>Africans,</hi> when the <hi>

                  </gap>
               </hi> had conquered them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There were ſome Biſhops that lived on the Borders of the Empire, under Heathens, that needed the help of Neighbour Churches, and accordingly were oft with them, craving their help: So it was with the old <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> as to the Biſhops of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There were ſome ſmall Countries adjoining to the Empire, who took the Friendſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power for their great Honour and ſafety, and therefore were glad to conform in Religion to the Empire, and to let their Biſhops join with them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And there were ſome Neighbour Countries who were turned to Chriſtianity by the Emiſſaries of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> who therefore (rejoicing alſo in ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a Patronage) were willingly his Subjects: But this was long after the firſt great Councils. Theſe two laſt were the <hi>Saxons</hi> caſe in <hi>England.</hi> Accordingly you may ſometimes find two or three out of ſuch Countries at ſome of the General Councils of the Empire. Which yet were called <hi>General</hi> but as to the <hi>Empire,</hi> and not as to the World.</p>
            <p>To proceed in the Hiſtory: When Chriſtians were (moſtly) exempted from the Magiſtrates Judicatures (that were moſt Heathens, though under a Chriſtian Prince,) and ſo the <hi>Biſhops Canons</hi> were to them, as the <hi>Laws of the Land</hi> are to us, it is no wonder that Councils muſt then be very frequent, and Canons of great eſteem; and hereupon Biſhops by proſperity growing more and more worldly and carnal, made uſe of their Synodical Power, as is aforeſaid, to accompliſh their own Wills: So that the Synods of Biſhops became the great Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries and Troublers of the Empire. You need no more
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60973:55"/>
to ſatisfie you of this, but to read the Acts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the words of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> (called <hi>Theologus)</hi> againſt Synods and contentious Biſhops, and the ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of <hi>Hillary Pictav.</hi> They that had too little zeal againſt Ungodlineſs, Unrighteouſneſs, Pride, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, were ſo zealous againſt any that withdrew from their Power and contradicted them, that they eaſily ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized them for Hereticks, and made even godly ſober Chriſtians ſuſpected of Hereſie for their ſakes; while no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Vice was uſed gently in thoſe that adhered unto them. Even holy <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith <hi>[Drunkenneſs is a mortal ſin, ſi ſit aſſidua, if it be daily or conſtant;</hi> (what, not elſe?) <hi>and that they muſt not be roughly and ſharply dealt with, but gently and by fair words:]</hi> Vid. Aquin. 22. q. 150. a. 1. 4. ad 4. &amp; a. 2. 1.</p>
            <p>And their Great <hi>Gregory, [That with leave they muſt be leſt to their own wit,</hi> (or diſpoſition,) <hi>leſt they grow worſe if they be pulled away from ſuch a Cuſtom,]</hi> (as Drunkenneſs.)</p>
            <p>But when it came to ſuch as withdrew from under them, they were not ſo gentle. <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> is made the Head of a Hereſie, becauſe he was but too much againſt the receiving of ſuch as had been <hi>Arrians.</hi> The large Catalogues of Hereſies contain many that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver erred in Fundamentals. They proſecuted the <hi>Priſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianiſts</hi> ſo hotly, that if godly men were but given to faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrictneſs of life, they were brought into ſuſpicion of Priſcillianiſm: And the Vulgar took advantage of the Biſhops turbulency and ill diſpoſition to abuſe the godly. S. <hi>Martin</hi> therefore ſeparated from the whole Synod of the Biſhops about him, and neither would join with them, nor have any Communion with them, as ſuppoſing them proud men that ſuppreſſed piety, and ſtrengthened the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60973:55"/>
wicked, by their intemperate proſecution: Whereupon they ſuſpected and accuſed him alſo as an unlearned Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and a Favourer of the Priſcillianiſts. They did not only bring in the uſe of the Magiſtrates Sword in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion againſt Hereſie, which <hi>Martin</hi> could not bear, but they owned and flattered an uſurping Emperour, that they might have the help of his Sword to do their work: So that in all thoſe parts of <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and the Borders of <hi>Italy,</hi> I find not a Biſhop that refuſed to own the Uſurper, ſave S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Martin,</hi> and one <hi>French</hi> Biſhop: And <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> tells us that they were men too bad themſelves, and that upon his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Ithacius</hi> the Leader of them ſcarce cared what he ſaid or did. S. <hi>Cyril</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> is noted by <hi>Socrates</hi> as the firſt Biſhop there that uſed the Sword; and his Kinſman S. <hi>Theophilus</hi> went beyond him, and took upon him even to favour the Errour of the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> that he might have their help againſt ſuch as he hated, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> till he had procured his ejection, which made a rupture in that Church, and cauſed the ſeparation of his Adherents, whom the Biſhop would have taken for a new Sect, and called them <hi>Joannites;</hi> ſuch skill had the domineering ſort of Prelates in making and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying Hereſies and Sects; and calling themſelves ſtill the Catholick Biſhops becauſe they kept the upper hand, and major Vote, except where the <hi>Arrians</hi> over-topt them, who then claimed the Catholick Title to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And by what Arts ſome of them kept the favour of the Emperours, to do their work and keep up their greatneſs, <hi>Socrates</hi> tells you in the inſtance of the ſaid S. <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who ſent one before the great Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Eugenius</hi> another Uſurper, with two Letters, and a rich Preſent, and bid him ſtay till the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60973:56"/>
Battel was over, and then give the flattering Letter and the Preſent to him whoever that got the better.</p>
            <p>But though ſtill ſince the <hi>World</hi> came into the Church, and the Greatneſs, Power, and Honour of Prelacy made that Office a very alluring bait to the deſires of the moſt worldly fleſhly men, yet God kept up ſome that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their integrity, and bare their teſtimony againſt the pride and carnality of the reſt; and though the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of the Catholicks turned many to the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and other Sects that profeſt more ſtrictneſs, (yea <hi>Salvian</hi> makes the <hi>Arrians, Gothes,</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> themſelves to be men of more honeſty and temperance than the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Clergie) yet ſound Doctrine had ſtill ſome holy Men that did maintain it.</p>
            <p>But what were the <hi>Popes</hi> doing all this while? Sound Doctrine by the advantage of the ſoundneſs of the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Emperour as is ſaid, yet kept out Arrianiſm, Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme and ſuch other Hereſies there: but they were ſtill ſtriving to be the <hi>Greateſt: Leo</hi> one of the beſt of them was one of the firſt that laid claim to an Univerſal Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip within the Empire: I told you how <hi>Zoſimus</hi> and his Followers ſtrove with the <hi>Africans,</hi> to have Appeals made to <hi>Rome</hi> from the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops and Councils: which the <hi>Africans</hi> ſtifly oppoſed as contrary to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, to Cuſtom, and to the reaſon of Diſcipline, which required that Caſes ſhould be judged and ended where perſons and things were known, and not by Strangers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, where Witneſſes could not without intolerable charge and trouble be brought beyond Sea to proſecute the ſuite.

            <p>Qu. <hi>But if moſt did not favour them, how did they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to ſo great power? Anſ.</hi> 1. The old Name of the <hi>Imperial Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Popes Primacie</hi> in the <hi>Empire,</hi> kept up a Veneration for him in the ignorant. 2. The Eaſtern Emperours ſeated at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with Wars, Rebellions, and other Difficulties
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60973:61"/>
at home, that they could not take ſufficient care of the Weſt; but left the Popes too much advantage to grow great: and wickedneſs alſo increaſing among them (though the Princes preſence kept <hi>their Patriarchs</hi> in more order and ſubmiſſion, than the Popes that were become maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) provoked God to give them up to be conquered by the <hi>Mahometan Turks:</hi> And by the Ambition of the Popes, the Emperours wanted the due aſſiſtance of their Weſtern Subjects, to reſiſt their Enemies. And the Pope took the advantage of the Eaſtern Emperours weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to lead the Weſt into a ſettled Rebellion, offering the King of <hi>France</hi> the Weſtern Empire, which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, the Pope making his Bargain with him for his own advantage. 3. And in the Wars of Chriſtian Princes, the Pope uſed to obtrude his Arbitration, in ſuch a manner as tended to his gain: ſo that he ſhortly got to be a temporal Prince of a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to have Crowns and Kingdoms made feudatary to him. 4. And he got <hi>Germany</hi> to be broken into ſo many ſmall Republicks and Liberties, as that they were not able to unite to reſiſt him. 5. And he took great advantage of the religious humours of any that were devout, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſo many and various Societies, and with ſo great Priviledges, as obliged them generally to uphold and ſerve him. Though he cruelly perſecuted all that were againſt his Power and Intereſt, yet he allowed almoſt all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of ſuch as would but unite in him and ſerve him. 6. And as he ſo twiſted his own and all his Clergies Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that they were all ready to obey and defend him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſeveral Princes, and thereby had a great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in every Chriſtian State in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo, keeping all his Clergie unmarryed, their wealth ſtill accumulated and flowed into the Church: And the Eaſtern Empire being
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60973:61"/>
firſt weakned and then overthrown, and the Weſtern Nations kept weak, and in continual Wars againſt each other, there was none well able to reſiſt his Pride, but one party ſtill was ready to flatter him, partly to keep their own Clergy in Peace, and partly to have his help againſt their Enemies.</p>
            <p>And the grand Cheat by which they were commonly deceived was, that they lookt more at his preſent poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Primacie, than at the reaſon and right by which he claimed it; and ſo he that had been Prime Patriarch in one Empire, ſet up by the Prince, ſtill claimed the right of the ſame places when the Empire was diſſolved: as if the Subjects of the Kings of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. muſt obey him, becauſe they did ſo when they were the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Valentinian</hi> &amp;c. For by little and little he changed his Title mentioned in the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> into a pretended <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and ſo they that would not have obeyed him as ſet up by <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Councils, obeyed him as if he had been ſet up by God: For the name of St. <hi>Peter and his Chair and Succeſſour</hi> was uſed as the common blind.</p>
            <p>And next to that he did by degrees change his claim of a <hi>Primacie in the Empire</hi> into a claim of Primacie in <hi>all the World:</hi> and his claim of a meer <hi>Primacie,</hi> into a claim of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> or <hi>Governing Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you ask me, how could he blind Men ſo far as to make ſuch a change? You ſeem not to know Man-kind, nor to obſerve common experience. Do you not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what power the Clergie had every where got with the People? What an advantage poſſeſſion and St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> name were?

Divines, the evident diſtinction between their <hi>Humane Right</hi> and their pretended <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and between an <hi>Univerſal Council or Church of the Empire,</hi> and of the <hi>whole World,</hi> have not been ſufficiently obſerved in our Diſputes againſt them?</p>
            <p>And the additional Countries of voluntary Subjects in <hi>Brittain, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> &amp;c. which of later times, ſince his Imperial <hi>Primacie,</hi> have fallen in to him, have much helped to blind the people herein, and to ſerve his Claim as by Divine Right. For which ends his Emiſſaries have taken great pains, at the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Japan</hi> and <hi>Congo,</hi> (and once they made an attempt in <hi>Abaſſia,)</hi> and among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and in many other Nations of the World; lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably ſeeking to win ſome Heathens to Chriſt, that they might win them to the Pope; and turbulently ſeeking to diſturb the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Chriſtian Churches, to draw them to the obedience of the Pope.</p>
            <p>The Doctrines by which they promote their deſign are more than I may now ſtay to open.</p>
            <p>I. One of the chief is, by depreſſing the Honour of the ſacred Scriptures, as inſufficient to acquaint us with all Gods will that is neceſſary to our ſalvation, without <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental Tradition;</hi> that ſo all men might be brought to depend on them as the Keepers of Tradition.</p>
            <p>But 1. Is their Tradition yet written in any of their <hi>own Books,</hi> or not? If not, where are they kept? And who knoweth what they are? Is it not ſtrange that ſo many Doctors in ſo many Ages, all remembring them, would none of them ever write them down? Are they in the Memory of the Pope only? (What of thoſe that could not read, or that were condemned as Hereticks of Infidels?) Then all the World muſt receive them from
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60973:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Popes Memory. If ſo, muſt it be <hi>Word or Writing?</hi> And had he no Memory of them before he was Pope? But if it be in <hi>other Mens</hi> Memories that your unwritten Traditions are kept, in whoſe is it? If in all the Doctors of your Church, why did not <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Pet. Martyr</hi> and the reſt that turned from you, know them? Or did they ſuddenly <hi>forget</hi> them all when they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtants? And how vaſt muſt your neceſſary Religion be, if yet it muſt have more in it unwritten, than is to be found in all your great Volumes of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and your huge Library?</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe you will ſay that all your unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are <hi>now written:</hi> If ſo, they are not <hi>unwritten:</hi> And <hi>how long</hi> have they been written, and by whom? If Fathers and Sons could keep them unwritten in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory a thouſand years, why not 1100, and why not 1600? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they were written in the beginning, where be the Books? Are they not ſuch as other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans can read and underſtand as well as you, (or an illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Pope?) If there be a neceſſity of having them in writing now, was there not the ſame neceſſity to former Ages?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſuppoſe you will ſend us to your <hi>Councils</hi> for thoſe <hi>Traditions:</hi> But if the Biſhops know them not before they come to the Council, how do they begin to know them then? Do they go thither for a new miraculous Revelation of an old Tradition left with the whole Church?</p>
            <p n="1">1. But do not Councils oft determine things confeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncertain to the Church before; and yet out of utter uncertainty, it ſuddenly becometh an Article of Faith? For Inſtance, the great Council at <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith <hi>(Bin. ſeſs.</hi> 30. <hi>p.</hi> 80.) <q>[A hard Queſtion hath been in divers parts
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60973:63"/>
and before this Synod, about the Conception of the glorious Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the beginning of her Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: Some ſaying that the Virgin and her Soul was for ſome time, or inſtant of time, actually under Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin: Others on the contrary ſaying, that from the beginning of her Creation God loving her gave her Grace, by which preſerving and freeing that bleſſed Perſon from the Original Spot—We having diligently lookt into the Authorities and Reaſons which for many years paſt have in publick relation on both ſides been alledged, before this holy Synod, and having ſeen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things about it, and weighed them by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſideration, do <hi>Define</hi> and <hi>Declare,</hi> That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine affirming That the glorious Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, by the ſingular preventing and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace of God, was never actually under Original Sin, but was ever free from all Original and actual Sin, and was holy and immaculate, is to be approved, held and embraced of all Catholicks as godly and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Church-worſhip, Catholick Faith, right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſacred Scripture: and that henceforth it ſhall be lawful for no Man to Preach or Teach the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Where was this Tradition kept before, that was ſo hard a Controverſie till now?</p>
            <p n="2">2. And do not General Councils bring in Novelties? I cited formerly the words of <hi>Cajetan</hi> in his Oration in the Council at the <hi>Laterane</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> 10. charging the Council of <hi>Conſtance, Baſil</hi> and <hi>Piſa</hi> with Novelty, and ſuch Novelty as would have quite defaced the Church and was inconſiſtent with it. And <hi>Pighius</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with the like. Yea I told you before where he ſaith that General Councils themſelves are a Novelty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60973:63"/>
3. Be not General Councils themſelves approved or reprobated at the pleaſure of the Pope? What a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of reprobated Councils were there? that yet were as numerous as the approved, and as lawfuly called and aſſembled. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inſtanceth in the 2. of <hi>Epheſus, Conſtance, Baſil,</hi> and many more: Of which more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another of their deceits is by pretending to <hi>Vinc. Lerinenſis</hi> Rule, <hi>quod ab omnibus, ubique, ſemper,</hi> &amp;c. as if <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Univerſality</hi> were on their ſide. I muſt remember that I have long ago confuted theſe and the reſt of their deceits in my <hi>Key for Catholicks:</hi> Yet I will briefly ſpeak here to theſe two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Antiquity</hi> we willingly ſtand to it, and to the rejecting of all Novelty in Religion: But we muſt have better proof than the word of our Grand-fathers, or a Prieſt. 1. Is any of their Books or Traditions elder than the holy Scripture? 2. Either the <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Abaſſines, &amp;c.</hi> have been ſure Keepers of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or not: If yea, then we may take their Teſtimony as well as the Church of <hi>Romes.</hi> If not, why may not you prove as ill Keepers of it as they?</p>
            <p n="3">3. But are they not <hi>certain Novelties</hi> that you would impoſe on us under the colour of <hi>Antiquity?</hi> Read but <hi>Pet. Moulin de Novit. Papiſmi,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Th. Doelittles</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the <hi>Morning Lectures</hi> againſt Popery, and you ſhall ſee the Novelty of your Religion fully proved. Take now but theſe few inſtances. 1. Your very <hi>Patriarchate, Primacie,</hi> Claim of Univerſality, General Councils, are all proved Novelties before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your own Writers confeſs that the denying the People <hi>Chriſts Blood</hi> (or the Cup) in the Lords Supper is a Novelty, that prevailed by Cuſtom by little and little,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60973:64"/>
and was not common long before the Council at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> Dare you ſay that it was ſo from the beginning, or of old?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Can you poſſibly believe that your forbidding men to read the Scriptures in a known Tongue without a Licence is not a Novelty, if ever you read <hi>Chryſoſtom, Auguſtine, Jerome,</hi> or any thing of the Ancients?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it not a Novelty for the publick Prayers of the Church to be ordinarily made in a Tongue not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the generality of the People? But I muſt ſtop.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as to <hi>Univerſality</hi> I have before proved, 1. That by their own Confeſſion moſt of the Churches and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the World have been againſt them. 2. That at this day they are not above the third part of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Too ſmall an Univerſal Church for any man of Charity and Conſideration to be a member of: A Sect that call themſelves <hi>All the Church. Jacob. a Vitr. Hiſtor. Orient. Cap.</hi> 77. tells us that, <hi>the Churches in the Eaſterly part of</hi> Aſia <hi>alone exceeded in multitude both the Greek and Latine Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for their telling us that all theſe followed <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> a Heretick, or were <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and that all the <hi>Abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, Armenians, Georgians, Syrians, Coptics, Greeks, Proteſtants, &amp;c.</hi> are Hereticks, or Schiſmaticks, I have anſwered it ſo oft at large that I muſt not repeat what I have ſaid. Only, 1. I ſay that if the Cenſures and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings of Adverſaries can un-chriſten all others, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the Church to them that have leaſt Charity, perhaps the Qualiers may ſhortly have as fair a Title as the Papiſts. If <hi>General Councils</hi> be not to be believed when they Hereticate Popes, I will not believe a Railer when he Hereticates moſt of the Chriſtian World, whom he never ſaw or ſpake with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sure that man judgeth perſons
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60973:64"/>
unheard. 2. I repeat the words of <hi>Barchardus</hi> one of your own, that long lived among them, and ſpake what he ſaw, <hi>p.</hi> 325, 326. <hi>[And is for thoſe that we judge to be damned Hereticks, as the</hi> Neſtorians, Jacobites, Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Georgians, <hi>and the like, I found them to be for the moſt part good and ſimple men, and living ſincerely towards God and Men, they are of great abſtinence, &amp;c.—</hi>And p. 324. he ſaith, that <hi>[the</hi> Syrians, Greeks, Armenians, Georgians, Neſtorians, Nubians, Jubeans, Chaldeans, Maronites, Ethiopians, Egyptians, <hi>and many other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtians there inhabit; and that ſome are Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks not ſubject to the Pope, and others called Hereticks, as the</hi> Neſtorians, Jacobites, <hi>&amp;c. but there are many in theſe Sects that are very ſimple, knowing nothing of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; devoted to Chriſt, materating the Fleſh with Faſtings, and clothed with the moſt ſimple Garments, ſo that they far excel the very</hi> RELIGIOUS <hi>of the Church of</hi> Rome.] And, <hi>p.</hi> 323. of the Papiſts, whom he calleth by the Name of Chriſtians, as if it were proper to them, he ſaith, <hi>[There are in the Land of Promiſe men of every Nation under Heaven, and every Nation liveth after their own Rites; and to ſpeak the very truth to our own great confuſion, there are none found in it that are worſe and more corrupt in Manners than Chriſtians;]</hi> (that is, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. If greater Errours and Vices than are among the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Abaſſines, Syrians, &amp;c.</hi> will allow us to reject men from our Communion, how much more cauſe have we to renounce Communion with Popes and Papiſts than with theſe Churches?</p>
            <p n="4">4. How can any man ſay that Nations and Countries are to be rejected as Hereticks, unleſs the ſingle perſons guilty were tryed and heard? when there is no Hereſie
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60973:65"/>
but what is in individuals, and no Law of God or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon condemneth the innocent for the guilties faults; much leſs all Poſterity for their Anceſtors.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But they never gain more than by aggravating the Diviſions that are among other Chriſtians, and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Unity of their Church: And the Contentions that have been among us have given them ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as that ſome in the ſenſe of their former guilt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Sect-maſters themſelves, have turned Papiſts, as thinking it the ſtate of Union; and having found no ſettlement in thoſe ways, which they have tryed, becauſe they never rightly underſtood the true temperament of the Chriſtian Religion which they profeſſed, they think to find it in that way that they never tryed; as ſick men turn from ſide to ſide for eaſe, while the cauſe of their wearineſs and pain is within them, and turneth with them.</p>
            <p>Here let the Reader note, 1. That Fools judge of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in Religion by the <hi>noiſe</hi> that it makes in the World; but men of Reaſon judge of it by the <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of the points of Difference. Verily our Differences here in <hi>England,</hi> and the Neighbour Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches, have ſhewed in us much perſonal pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, unskilfulneſs, and other faults; but in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are ſuch as greatly commend our <hi>real concord</hi> in the ſame Religion, and partly our <hi>Conſcience</hi> in valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and being loth to loſe it.</p>
            <p>If you ſee Latine Grammarians reviling one another, about the <hi>ſpelling</hi> or <hi>pronunciation</hi> of a word or two, and critically contending with <hi>Varro, Gellius, &amp;c.</hi> which is the right, when a man that never knew a word of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine but Welch or Iriſh, never ſtrove about ſuch Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his life; which of theſe will you think have more
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60973:65"/>
agreement in their Language? I would ſay that thoſe men that diſagree but about the pronunciation of a few words are very much agreed, in compariſon of a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, that agreeth not with them in a Sentence or a Word. Even the old Schoolmen were in Language more agreed with <hi>Eraſmus, Faber, Hutten,</hi> and other Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Grammarians that derided them, than any illiterate man was with any of them. All <hi>Gruterus</hi> his Volumes of Grammatical Controverſies, ſhew not ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Language, as the peaceable ſilence of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned man doth.</p>
            <p>And no one ſtrives much about that which he doth not much care for: Countrymen can contemptuouſly laugh at Logical Diſputes or Criticiſms. Horſes or Oxen will not ſtrive with us for our Gold or Jewels, Clothes or Food, as we do with one another; and yet they are not ſo like us in the <hi>eſtimation</hi> of ſuch things, as we are to one another.</p>
            <p>When I hear religious perſons contentiouſly cenſuring each other, about ſome little points of Ceremony, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Diſcipline, or Form, which are but the <hi>fimbria,</hi> or the Welts and Laces of Religion, I am angry at their weakneſs and defect of love; but I muſt needs think that there is very great concord in the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> (Objective) of theſe men, who differ about no greater matters than ſuch as theſe. If men that were building a Palace would fall together by the Ears, only about the driving of a Pin, I ſhould marvel at their concord that differed in no more; though I could wiſh them, like wrangling Children, whipt for their folly and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs till they were quiet. The <hi>great</hi> things that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> have paltrily wrangled about, are, 1. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Controverſies called <hi>Arminian:</hi> 2. And the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60973:66"/>
of Diſcipline. and Ceremonies. The former I have ſhewed lately in a large Volume, hath much more of <hi>verbal</hi> than of <hi>real difference,</hi> and is cheriſhed by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of words, and the unskilfulneſs of too many to diſcuſs thoſe ambiguities, and find out exactly the true ſtate of the Controverſie: It is oft but Stubble that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the greateſt blaze.</p>
            <p>And as for the other, I would not undervalue the leaſt things of Religion, but I will ſay, that <hi>Engagement, Faction</hi> and <hi>worldly Intereſt</hi> are magnifying Glaſſes to many men, and make a Mote to ſeem a Beam, and a Gnat to ſeem a Camel. And it is one of the Devils old Wiles, to keep men from learning of Chriſt, how to Worſhip the Father of Spirits, in ſpirit and truth, by ſtarting ſuch Queſtions, as, <hi>whether in this Mountain or at Jeruſalem men ought to worſhip?</hi> and to hinder <hi>godly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying by doting about queſtions that gender ſtrife.</hi> And fighting for Shoo-buckles may ſhew the quarrelſomneſs of men, but it proveth not the Greatneſs of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Note further that though <hi>Subjective Religion</hi> (the <hi>meaſures</hi> of our belief, Love and Obedience) be as various as perſons are; yet the <hi>Objective Religion of all true Proteſtants</hi> is the ſame: Not only the ſame in the Eſſentials <hi>(one God, one Saviour and Lord, one Baptiſmal Covenant, one Creed, one Spirit, one Body of Chriſt, and one Hope of Glory, Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6.) but alſo the ſame in all the <hi>Integral parts:</hi> For it is <hi>Integrally</hi> the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> which containeth all that they take (with the Law of Nature) to be the whole Law of God, and ſo the Rule of Divine <hi>Faith, Deſire</hi> and <hi>Duty.</hi> They may <hi>ſubjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> have ſome difference in underſtanding ſome Texts, (as the moſt Learned and holy in the world have:)
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60973:66"/>
But <hi>Objectively</hi> they have no other Divine Faith or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And note, that the Church that <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> yea <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Syrians, Abaſſines</hi> are of, are all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one and the ſame Church: For a Church is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of the <hi>Ruling</hi> and the <hi>Ruled</hi> Parts. And they perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the only Eſſentiating and Univerſal Head; In him they all unite, and confeſs that there is no other. Even the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as I have ſhewed, claimeth but a Primacie in the Empire, and not the Government of all the World, no not of us in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the Ruled Conſtitutive part, we are agreed that it is All <hi>Baptized Chriſtians</hi> that have not apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, nor forſaken any Eſſential part of Chriſtianity, nor are excommunicate by Power from Chriſt. So that we are clearly all of one and the ſame Church.</p>
            <p>But how far the Papiſts differ in the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of their Controverſies, I think to tell you a little more anon.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I may not ſtay to ſhew at large, how they vary their ſhape and courſe as may fit their Intereſt: How ſometime they put on the perſon of Infidels or Atheiſts to plead men into an uncertainty of all Religion, that they may be looſe enough to follow them into theirs: For even ſo <hi>Car. Boverius</hi> would have perſwaded our late King, <hi>Apparat. ad Conſult. [The firſt thing is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſeeing true Religion is to be inquired after by you, that before you addreſs your ſelf to ſearch for it, you firſt have all Religions in ſuſpicion with you; and that you will ſo long ſuſpend</hi> (or take off) <hi>your mind and will from the Faith and Religion of the Proteſtants, as you are in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the truth.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60973:67"/>
Reader, doth not this tell you whence much of our late Atheiſm and Infidelity cometh, and what it tendeth to? I tell thee not the words of a Novice, but a perſon choſen to have ſeduced our King, when he was Prince, in <hi>Spain.</hi> And is not this way very ſuitable to the end? How muſt men become Papiſts? <hi>Boverius</hi> will teach you: <q>Firſt <hi>ſuſpect</hi> all Religion, and with your very <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>will</hi> ceaſe to believe that there is a God, or that he is Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, Wiſe or Good, or that we are his Creatures and Subjects, or that there is any Heaven or Hell or Life to come, or that Chriſt is not a Deceiver but a Saviour, or that any of the Bible is true: Ceaſe from Loving, Fearing, Obeying or truſting God, and from loving man for his ſake: Ceaſe praying to him, and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any wickedneſs, injuſtice, cruetly, perjury or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs as being forbidden by him, and this as long as you are ſearching after the truth.]</q> Verily this devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh counſel is ſo notoriouſly followed now by ſome, that we may fear what truth it is that they are ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after. Certainly this way is of the Devil, and how it can lead to God I know not. I love <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy the worſe becauſe its principle is ſo congruous to this.</p>
            <p>And their Doctrine of lawful hiding their Religion by Equivocation is commonly known. And what they ſay about coming to our Churches I have formerly cited at large out of <hi>Thom. a Jeſu,</hi> and the lawfulneſs of denying the perſon of a Clergie-man or a Religious man: And the ground of all, <hi>[becauſe humane Laws for the most part bind not the Subjects Conſcience when there is great hazard of life, as Azorius</hi> hath well taught, <hi>Inſt.

            <p n="5">V. <hi>The pretended ground of this his Claim is, that St.</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:60973:69"/>
Peter <hi>received this power from Chriſt, and that St.</hi> Peter <hi>was Biſhop last at</hi> Rome, <hi>and that the Pope ſucceedeth him in his Biſhoprick, and Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is profeſſed commonly by them.</p>
            <p>But 1. It is falſe that St. <hi>Peter</hi> received any ſuch Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from Chriſt, as to be the Governour of all the reſt of the Apoſtles and Chriſtians in the World: He never exerciſed or claimed ſuch a Government, but in caſes of Controverſie <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2, &amp;c. He dealeth but on equal terms with the reſt. And they that ſaid <hi>I am of Cephas,</hi> are as well rebuked as they that ſaid, <hi>I am of Paul.]</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29, &amp;c. Apoſtles are ſaid to be but <hi>chief Members</hi> of the Church, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the only <hi>Head:</hi> And when the Diſciples ſtrove who ſhould be the greateſt, Chriſt giveth it not to <hi>Peter,</hi> but forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to them all: And <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf as a fellow Elder exhorteth all Elders to overſee and feed the Flock, <hi>not as Lords over the Heritage,</hi> &amp;c. and never claimeth a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty to himſelf. No word mentioneth any Power that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had greater than his Apoſtleſhip: And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> profeſſeth that the Pope hath not his power as ſucceeding him in his Apoſtleſhip, but as an ordinary Paſtor over the whole Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no certainty that ever <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> (as <hi>Nilus</hi> hath ſhewed;) but a humane Teſtimony of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny later Fathers, upon the words of uncertain Reporters before them, which are to be believed indeed as probable but no more; There being as great a number of Papiſt Writers I think (about 60) that tell us there was a Pope <hi>Joane,</hi> and yet it is uncertain if not leaſt probable. But if he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> Apoſtles were no where proper Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. Biſhops were the fixed Elders or Paſtors of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches: Apoſtles were moveable and Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60973:70"/>
having an Indefinite Commiſſion to go preach the Goſpel to all the world as far as they were able. Though the ancient Fathers uſed to call them Biſhops becauſe <hi>pro tempore</hi> they Ruled (perſwaſively) where they came: Though indeed their work was to ſettle Churches and Biſhops, and not to be ſettled Biſhops themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Paul</hi> was certainly and long at <hi>Rome,</hi> and liker to be as a Biſhop there of the two: If <hi>Paul</hi> was not one, <hi>Peter</hi> was not; for there is no more, but leſs proof of his Government there. If <hi>Paul</hi> was one, then one City had two, contrary to the old Canons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is no proof that <hi>Peter's</hi> being <hi>laſt at Rome</hi> gave his Power to all or any following Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> any more than to the Biſhops of <hi>Antioch</hi> who are ſaid to ſucceed him in his firſt Biſhoprick; or any more than Chriſts dying at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Mother Church, did fix the Supremacie there: or any more than the other eleven Apoſtles did leave their power which they had above all ordinary Biſhops, to the places where they abode (either laſt or firſt.) If <hi>Peter's</hi> dying Biſhop at <hi>Rome</hi> prove ſuch a ſucceſſion of Univerſal Monarchy, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Succeſſions will be proved by the ſame Reaſon, which yet none affirm: Even <hi>Alexandria</hi> claimed but from St. <hi>Mark</hi> who was leſs than thirteen Apoſtles: But no <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> declaring any conveyance of ſuch a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is pretended by the Popes (which is a wonder:) Nor any word that ever he uſed of ſuch importance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I have ſhewed that General Councils <hi>(Calced.</hi> and <hi>Conſtant.)</hi> have declared that <hi>Romes</hi> primacy had a later humane riſe.</p>
            <p>Yet would they have exerciſed no other Government than St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, the world would not have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by them as they have been.</p>

VI. <hi>The Papiſts ſeem not reſolved themſelves whether the Pope have an Univerſal Apoſtleſhip or Teaching office, as well as the Univerſal Monarchy or Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſay that he ſucceedeth not <hi>Peter</hi> as an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> but as a <hi>Pastor;</hi> yet moſt others that I have ſeen medling with it, ſay otherwiſe. If he ſucceed not in the Apoſtleſhip, he is no true Succeſſour of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at all, in any ſuperemience of Power: For what he had was as an Apoſtle: If he do, then he is bound to go preach himſelf to the Nations of the world as <hi>Peter</hi> was: To ſend others to preach, and not do it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was no <hi>Apoſtleſhip:</hi> They were ſent themſelves. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſet up Prieſts, and yet were themſelves no Prieſts: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſent and ſet up Preachers, and yet undertook not that office themſelves.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>This Pope claimeth the ſole Power of calling Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils of all the Chriſtian world (yet never did it) And conſequently of being the Judge when any ſhall be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo whether ever there ſhall be any or not. And though former General Councils voted that they ſhould be every ten years, yet he prevaileth to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Alſo he claimeth the ſole power of preſiding in ſuch Councils, and alſo of making their Decrees either valid by his approbation or null or invalid by his Reprobation, as he pleaſe: ſo that nothing that they Decree is of force but as it pleaſeth him; whence we have diſtinct Catalogues of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and Reprobate Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet no mortal man knoweth oftentimes how much of a Councils Acts and Decrees the Pope approveth. When <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth had conſented to all done by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the word <hi>[Conciliariter acta]</hi> ſeemed to the Council to mean <hi>[all that they did de facto as a</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:60973:71"/>
               <hi>Council.]</hi> But the Popes ever ſince yet reject that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil on pretenſe that by <hi>[conciliariter]</hi> was meant <hi>all that</hi> de jure <hi>as a Council they might do. Gregory</hi> the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the four firſt General Councils, receiving them as the four Goſpels (and if his Predeceſſors did not, it was becauſe their conſent was not taken to be neceſſary, nor much ſought.) And yet now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> raileth at the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and they tell us how much of it they receive and how much not. And ſo of many others.</p>
            <p>And nothing is more evident in ſuch Hiſtory, than that the Emperors and not the Pope, were they that called divers of the firſt Councils.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. <hi>The Pope accordingly claimeth a ſupremacy above General Councils; that he may diſſolve them; but they cannot queſtion or depoſe him; though General Councils have decreed the contrary.</hi>

            <p>Proved: If there be any poſſibility of knowing it, it muſt be either, 1. By perſonal qualifications of mind; 2. Or by right of election; 3. Or of Ordination; 4. Or of Poſſeſſion; 5. Or of Acceptance by the Church after Poſſeſſion. I cannot Imagine any other way. But there is no poſſibility of knowing who is Pope by any of <hi>theſe wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt is not pretended by them: But anon we ſhall thence prove their <hi>Nullity</hi> for want of neceſſary Qualifications.</p>

Not the later; For if any <hi>one way of Election</hi> be neceſſary, Popes were no Popes when that way failed: Sometime they were elected by the <hi>People of Rome</hi> (and were <hi>they</hi> the Chuſers for <hi>all the World?)</hi> Sometimes by the People and the <hi>Presbyters:</hi> Sometimes by the <hi>Neighbour Biſhops</hi> and Ordainers: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Emperours: And laſtly by the Cardinals. If one way only be valid, the reſt were invalid: And how ſhall we prove which?

            <p n="3">III. If <hi>Ordination</hi> be the notifying Title, then, 1. Thoſe Lay men that were put in full poſſeſſion unordained were

no Popes; and where then is the Succeſſion? 2. And who is it that hath that <hi>ordaining Authority?</hi> If ſome Biſhops ordain one, and ſome another, and ſo twenty (as they long did divers in many years Schiſm) which of theſe is the true Pope? or is it <hi>all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. If <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> were the Title, then the <hi>Turk</hi> may be Pope; or he that can get it by the Sword: Then there can be no Uſurper, but the ſtrongeſt hath beſt Right. Then he that kept at <hi>Rome</hi> had better title than he that was in <hi>Germany,</hi> or at <hi>Avignion.</hi>

            <p n="5">V. If it be the Churches <hi>after acceptance;</hi> then, 1. He was an Uſurper before. 2. And what or who is that <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Church?</hi> Sure they that muſt make a Pope of no Pope, by after acceptance, ſhould have the antecedent Election: Elſe Popes muſt all be firſt Uſurpers, before they are true Popes. But, 1. If it muſt be the <hi>major part</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> then there is no Pope, becauſe two parts are againſt him. If it muſt be one Sect of Chriſtians only like the Papiſts, that will but think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Church, or better than the reſt; who is it that can prove their title to this Choice? And muſt it be <hi>All of them,</hi> or but <hi>Part?</hi> If <hi>All,</hi> 1. How ſhall we ever know it? Never ſuch a thing was tryed. 2. And then there was no Pope in the 40 or 50 years Schiſm. If it muſt be <hi>Part,</hi> how ſhall we ever know <hi>which part</hi> it muſt be? If the <hi>major</hi> or the <hi>melior,</hi> how ſhall it be ever tryed and known in a diviſion? None to this day knoweth who had the <hi>major</hi> or <hi>melior</hi> part in many a Schiſm.</p>
            <p>If they ſay that <hi>ſilent non-oppoſition</hi> is <hi>Conſent.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That's a known Falſhood, when moſt men, even a thouſand to one, have neither Call nor Opportunity to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their diſſent effectually; and when no wiſe men that love their time and peace, will run to <hi>Rome</hi> by thouſands
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60973:83"/>
out of all Kingdoms, to tell them their diſſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But it was no <hi>ſilent ſubmiſſion,</hi> when <hi>ſeveral Popes</hi> were upheld by <hi>ſeveral Kingdoms.</hi> So that there is no way of certain notice who is the true Pope, but he muſt go for the man, as <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. did after his Depoſition, who can keep poſſeſſion, which is no title at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea, I prove certainly, according to their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that <hi>there is no Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>hath been</hi> for many an hundred years.</p>
            <p>For they hold themſelves, that the Right muſt be derived by an uninterrupted Succeſſion from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> (and call us no Miniſters for want of Succeſſion:) But that they have no ſuch uninterrupted Succeſſion is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>For, 1. An Infidel and Heretick Pope, ſo openly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, can be no Pope: Elſe a <hi>Turk</hi> might be Pope. For he that is no Chriſtian, is no Chriſtian Biſhop. But Popes (before mentioned) have been judged Infidels, Hereticks, incarnate Devils.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Pope actually depoſed as an uncapable wicked Heretick, by a General Council, was no Pope: Yet ſuch was <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. who yet kept the place, and the reſt are his Succeſſors.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There have been ſometimes ſeveral years without any Pope at all: And if two or three years make no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, how ſhall we know how long time doth it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Baronius, Genebrard,</hi> and others aforementioned, confeſs that for 50 of them together they were Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and deſerve not to be named among the Popes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked men, made and ruled by Whores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where then is the ſucceſſion?</p>
            <p>And if it were poſſible for thoſe at <hi>Rome</hi> to know that there is a Pope, and to know who and which is he, yet
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60973:83"/>
how ſhould all the reſt of the world have any aſſurance of it? You'll ſay, it is not neceſſary: Poſſeſſion and common Report muſt ſatisfie them in <hi>China, Congo, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſia,</hi> and the <hi>Phillipines,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="1">1. There are ſome that believe that the <hi>Pope</hi> is but a <hi>Humane Creature,</hi> that hath run up his power into Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny by abuſe, and it were well if he were either down, or reduced to his firſt ſtate: But they take themſelves to be as thoſe that live under other abuſive, oppreſſing or tyrannical Governours, who muſt live in Patience and Submiſſion, and are not bound to ruine themſelves, by oppoſing him in vain; and though he impoſe on them
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60973:84"/>
many things which they like not, but had rather they were reformed, yet it being not in their power, and Princes and Magiſtrates commanding them the ſame, they take <hi>Conformity</hi> to be orderly, and <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to be unpeaceable and of ill fame; And if any of the things commanded them prove ſinful, they hope God will forgive them (for bowing in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon)</hi> and will lay it on Popes, Princes and Prelates, and not on them that are not bound to ſtudy Controverſies; and who do what they do but in obedience and for peace (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes that quiet their Conſciences in ſelf-ſaving Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:) I verily think that the greater part of thoſe called Papiſts in all the world, are of this <hi>ſelf-ſaving ſort.</hi> As we ſee in all Countries that the greater number are or ſeem to be of the Religion of thoſe in power, be it what it will be. And we ordinarily hear that the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will thus talk againſt the Popes Doctrines and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yet quiet themſelves on ſuch terms of <hi>Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> as I here deſcribe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another ſort called Papiſts do believe that the Pope is a meer humane creature alſo, not over all the world but in the Empire and where Princes let him: And conſequently as men ſet him up, men might take him down. But yet that it is an <hi>Orderly</hi> Inſtitution, as Kings and Emperors, and that his place is <hi>Lawful,</hi> and that it is the duty of the Church to obey him, eſpecially when Princes alſo do command it: And that men have power from God to make, as <hi>National, Provincial,</hi> and <hi>Patriarchal Churches</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> ſo alſo an <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> and <hi>Ruler for Order and Unity ſake</hi> over many Countries, and that it is good and deſirable to theſe ends.</p>
            <p>Of theſe there are two ſorts. 1. One ſort take the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60973:84"/>
               <hi>Papacie</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs</hi> to be a lawful and laudable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> confirmed by other Princes. 2. The other ſort take them to be laudable Inſtitutions of <hi>General Councils,</hi> or elſe of <hi>particular conſenting Biſhops</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt General Council (whom thy call the <hi>Church.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Another ſort called Papiſts, do believe the Pope (as the former) to be a <hi>humane Creature, viz.</hi> of the firſt or ancient Biſhops by mutual conſent; but that it was a <hi>neceſſary thing,</hi> which by Gods General Laws, and his ſpecial Inſpiration, they did well, and were bound to do for the Churches concord and ſtrength; and that it is not lawful for the Church now to alter it, or any Prince in his Dominions.</p>
            <p>Theſe alſo are of three ſorts: 1. Some think that the <hi>Roman</hi> Seat may be altered, and the Church upon juſt cauſe may remove the Primacy to another Biſhop. This ſeemeth to be the opinion of Cardinal <hi>Cuſanus</hi> afore cited <hi>de Concord.</hi> who ſaith, The Church might make the Biſhop of <hi>Trent</hi> chief. 2. Others ſeem rather to think, that God hath by Decree annexed the Supremacy to <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet (as <hi>R. Smyth,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and Ruler of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Popiſh Clergy afore cited) think, that it is not <hi>de fide,</hi> that the Pope is <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor. 3. Others ſay that they are not ſure but <hi>God</hi> may deſtroy <hi>Rome,</hi> and remove the Primacy; but <hi>Men</hi> may not do it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The whole <hi>Greek</hi> Church ſeem yet of the ſecond or third opinion, (that the Pope had a juſt Primacy in one Empire, which was juſtly removed to <hi>Conſtantinople:)</hi> But there are ſome that think the Pope had alſo a juſt Primacy in all the <hi>Christian World,</hi> and yet that he hath it but by <hi>Humane Inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. There are other that think the Pope is the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60973:85"/>
Head by <hi>Divine Inſtitution;</hi> even as S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, by derivation of the Power which Chriſt gave <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as about the <hi>Foundation,</hi> ſo about the <hi>Subject</hi> and the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of Power, yea <hi>who is the true Chief Ruler</hi> over the Uuniverſal Church, there are theſe ſeveral ſorts of Popery.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Some believe that it is <hi>General Councils</hi> that are the Subject or Poſſeſſors of <hi>Supreme Church Power</hi> and <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> and that the Pope is but the firſt in order of the five Patriarchs in ſuch <hi>Councils;</hi> who hath no neceſſary right to call them, nor no negative Voice in them, nor any Government over the other Patriarchs, or their Churches; but only the firſt Seat, if he be there; juſt as the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> firſt, and of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> after had when the Patriarch of <hi>Rome</hi> was abſent. And thus indeed it was in the Empire, for a long time. But thoſe five Patriarchs ruled not <hi>all the World;</hi> no more than our two Provincial Archbiſhops do.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Others called Papiſts do go farther, and believe that General Councils indeed have the ſupreme Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, and the chief Executive while they ſit, and are the Seat of Infallibility: But becauſe they are not to be <hi>always</hi> or <hi>ordinary,</hi> God hath not left the <hi>four Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> and <hi>all the World,</hi> ungoverned in the Intervals; but the <hi>Roman</hi> Pope is the <hi>Supreme Governour of the World,</hi> when there is no General Council: Yet ſo that he muſt Govern by <hi>their Laws</hi> or Canons.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another ſort (and I think the moſt numerous among the Learned) called Papiſts, hold that <hi>Neither the Pope alone, nor the Council alone, are the Seat or Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of the ſupreme Legiſlative Power,</hi> or the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, nor of the ſupreme judging and executive power</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:60973:85"/>
ſedente concilio; <hi>but it is both of them agreeing</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct: And two Fallibles joyning, become one Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Another ſort of Papiſts, and very numerous eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Italy,</hi> hold, that the Pope alone is Supreme and Infallible in Legiſlation and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are but his Counſellors, to prepare Laws, to which his <hi>Fiat</hi> giveth <hi>Authority and Infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe indeed are commonly called PAPISTS, becauſe that more or leſs they are Subjects of the Pope. But who can give <hi>one definition,</hi> or the ſame <hi>marks</hi> of men that are really of ſo many minds? If I deſcribe one ſort, the other will ſay, this is not our Opinion; you do us wrong. And ſo of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>And here you may ſee, that when the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether a Papiſt may be ſaved?</hi> and <hi>Whether a Papiſt be a Heretick?</hi> or the like; that it cannot be well anſwered, till we know of which ſort of Papiſts you ſpeak.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I find that already my Writing is ſwelled beyond my firſt intent, I will give you the Properties or <hi>inadequate conceptions</hi> of only one ſort of Papiſts, which is the third ſort in the laſt diſtribution, who hold the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Infallibility to be in the Pope and Council conjunct, and that by Divine Right.</hi> Becauſe if I ſpeak of any of the other ſorts, I find they fly for refuge hither, and moſt Writers go upon this ground, and will own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as their Religion but what is in <hi>Approved General Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I deſire the Reader to peruſe what I have ſaid in my <hi>[Full and eaſie ſatisfaction, &amp;c.]</hi> out of <hi>Veron,</hi> and others, as they deſcribe their Faith themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>A PAPIST of this ſort is one that believeth that the Pope and his Council, or Church, is Infallible in propoſing</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:60973:86"/>
               <hi>the will of Christ; and believeth in Chriſt, and receiveth the Goſpel as true, for the Authority and Infallibility of this Pope and Council, and hereon layeth all the hopes of his ſalvation, as on the Churches Faith: And all this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Infallibility he believeth before he believeth that there is a Pope or a Church of Chriſt, or a Chriſt indeed, or a promiſe or gift from Chriſt of any Authority or Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility to them: Much more before he knoweth who is the true Pope, and which are true General Councils, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever there were any ſuch, or what it is that they have decreed to be believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That they take all their Faith in Chriſt and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel on the credit of the Church (that is, the Pope and Council) propoſing it, the moderateſt of all this ſort profeſs; as out of <hi>Veron,</hi> and others, I proved as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. Hence it is that one tells us that the Scripture is ſo full of ſeeming Contradictions and Improbabilities, that he would no more believe it than <hi>Eſop</hi>'s Fables, were it not for the Authority of the Church. Another ſaid [Would I ever believe the Trinity, the Incarnation, that if you lay a man to dye in a cloſe Cheſt of Lead or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Soul could get out to Heaven, that the Body ſhall riſe again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were it not for the Authority of the Church?]</p>
            <p n="2">2. They believe this Infallibility and Authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> before they can believe that there is any Pope at all. For to be a <hi>Pope</hi> is eſſentially to be <hi>Christs Vicar</hi> as they deſcribe him: And, as I ſaid, it is impoſſible to believe that <hi>Chriſt hath a Vicar,</hi> before they believe that he is <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As it is to believe a <hi>Son</hi> without a Parent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They believe the <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> (as they profeſs) before they believe that there is any <hi>Church:</hi> For to be a <hi>Church</hi> is eſſentially to be a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60973:86"/>
               <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> And he that yet believeth not that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is truly <hi>Chriſt,</hi> cannot believe that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are truly <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſave <hi>de nomine;</hi> nor that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath a Church: For they are Relatives, as <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. They <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, the Pope and <hi>Council,</hi> before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Jeſus is the Chriſt;</hi> For they profeſs to believe in him, becauſe of the ſaid Churches Authority and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility: And the Premiſes go before the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They believe the ſaid Infallibility and Authority of the Church, before they believe that ever <hi>Chriſt gave</hi> them ſuch <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility:</hi> For they cannot believe that Chriſt gave it them, before they believe that there is a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>Word of gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now is not here a Riddle hard enough to poſe the wiſeſt? <hi>Which way do all theſe Believers, through all the world, come to know that the Pope and Council, or Church, are authorized and Infallible, before they believe that Chriſt ever gave it them? Which way do they think that they came by it?</hi> Let him unriddle it that can.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They believe thus in the Pope, before they know <hi>what a Pope is,</hi> or <hi>who is he</hi> that they muſt thus believe in. For alas, how can all or any in the world know what is neceſſary to make a Pope? what <hi>Election?</hi> what <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> what <hi>Qualification?</hi> and whether the man <hi>had</hi> all theſe? And of divers Pretenders <hi>which is he</hi> that hath the proofs of a true title?</p>
            <p n="7">7. They believe thus in <hi>Councils,</hi> when they know not what <hi>Councils</hi> are true, and what not; nay whether ever there were any: For I have elſewhere fully proved that there never was any, nor ever will be, that are truly Univerſal as to all the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:60973:87"/>
8. Much leſs do theſe beginners know certainly, what General Councils have decreed to be believed by thoſe that will be ſaved.</p>
            <p>That which will be ſaid to all this is, that <hi>It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all men receive their Faith from Councils; it is ſufficient if it be from the Church-real, though not from the Repreſentative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Very good: 1. Elſe no man was a Chriſtian, nor could be, before the firſt General Council, which was above 300 years.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſtill this anſwereth none of the Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about believing in and from the <hi>Pope:</hi> May we all take our Faith from the Church-real, without taking it from the Pope, or not? If <hi>yea,</hi> we may poſſibly be good friends at laſt. If <hi>not,</hi> all the Contradictions about him are ſtill upheld by you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And if you muſt take it from the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church Real,</hi> ſtill all the Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will follow as if you took it from <hi>Councils:</hi> For can you believe that this Church is <hi>Chriſts Church,</hi> and hath this power and gift from him, before you believe that he is Chriſt, and that ever he made ſuch a gift or promiſe to them?</p>
            <p n="4">4. And <hi>who</hi> or <hi>what</hi> is this <hi>Real Church,</hi> that muſt be <hi>firſt known</hi> to be thus impowered and <hi>infallible:</hi> Is it <hi>ſome few,</hi> or <hi>many,</hi> or muſt it be the <hi>moſt?</hi> If a <hi>few</hi> or <hi>many,</hi> you profeſs that they may be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and have not that authority or gift. If it muſt be <hi>all,</hi> or the <hi>greater</hi> part; 1. Then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> goeth down, that is at moſt but a third part. 2. How ſhall every poor man (or any man) know which is the judgment of the major part? Can he take the Votes of all the Chriſtian World? 3. And have all that were converted in the Apoſtles days
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60973:87"/>
and ſince, firſt known the Major Vote of the Chriſtians, or were they converted by the foreknown Infallibility or Authority of the Majority? (or of the Pope?)</p>
            <p>Some will ſay, we ſee the Madneſs of this Popery, but how then do you ſay that the <hi>faith muſt be received, if not from</hi> the Church? I anſwer I have told you at large in a Treatiſe called <hi>The Reaſons of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and briefly in a ſmaller Treatiſe called <hi>The certainty of Chriſtianity without Popery</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly, <hi>Judging is one thing,</hi> and <hi>Teaching is another thing.</hi> Before I ſubmit to the <hi>Deciſion</hi> of a <hi>Judge</hi> I muſt know his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> or <hi>Authority;</hi> and I muſt then ſtand to his Sentence which way ever he decide the Caſe. Men be not converted to Chriſtianity by ſuch <hi>Judges,</hi> but by <hi>Teachers;</hi> Nor will I believe the Judge if he ſay <hi>there is no Chriſt, no Life to come, &amp;c.</hi> But a <hi>Teacher</hi> is to make intelligible to his Hearer or Scholar, the <hi>evidence of truth</hi> which is in the matter taught, and to draw men to believe by telling them thoſe true reaſons upon which he did believe himſelf: And no man takes him for his Teacher that he is perſwaded knoweth no more than himſelf. And the greater reputation of Knowledge and Honeſty the Teacher hath, the eaſier we apply our minds to learn of him, and a humane truſt or faith prepareth us to receive that evidence of truth which may beget a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith by the help of Grace. But ſtill the Learner truly believeth no more than he thus learneth. And I may hear a ſtranger tell what he hath to ſay, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the evidence that he giveth me of the truth, though I know not of any <hi>Authority</hi> that he hath to teach me, much leſs <hi>judicially</hi> to <hi>decide</hi> the Caſe. I little doubt but moſt that were converted by the Apoſtles themſelves, were perſwaded to believe in Chriſt by the <hi>evidence of</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:60973:88"/>
               <hi>truth propoſed</hi> (the Spirit co-operating) before they knew of any <hi>Authority</hi> of the Apoſtles; much leſs before they heard what they ſaid in a <hi>General Council,</hi> or what was the Vote of the <hi>Univerſal Church;</hi> or what <hi>any Pope</hi> ſaid as <hi>Ruler</hi> of the reſt. Theſe things are very plain and ſure, and they that will be wilfully blinded by faction, and prejudice, and worldly intereſt againſt plain truth, have no excuſe if they periſh in darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>A PAPIST (of this ſort) is one that believeth that the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>is the rightful Governour of all the world; that is, that all Chriſtians immediately, and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Heathens mediately, are bound by God to obey him, as Chriſts Vicegerent on Earth: And that he, with his Council, is thus an Univerſal Lawgiver and Judge to all Kings, States, and Perſons, that dwell round about the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a Proteſtant denyeth this, and holdeth that there is no Univerſal Monarch, or Legiſlator, to all the world, but God and our Saviour; and that he hath made no ſuch Vice-Chriſt, or Vicegerent; and that ſuch a Claim is High-Treaſon, as uſurping his Prerogative. And that if Pride had not <hi>in tantum</hi> made them mad, no men could think themſelves thus capable of Governing all the World. Proteſtants believe that there is no ſuch thing on Earth, as an Univerſal Church headed by any mortal Head, Pope or Council, but that Chriſt is the only Univerſal Governour or Head.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>This Papiſt is one that holdeth, that the Church of Chriſt on Earth is no bigger than the Popes Dominion, and that it is neceſſary to ſalvation to be ſubject to the Pope; and conſequently he unchurcheth two or three parts of the Chriſtian world, and damneth moſt of the Body of Chriſt, and robbeth him of the greateſt part of his Kingdom, as</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:60973:88"/>
               <hi>far as denying his Right amounts to: And conſequently is a notorious Schiſmatick or Sectary, appropriating the Church title only to his Sect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is proved before from the Maſters of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>This Papiſt is one that holdeth, that thoſe Councils which were General as to one Empire, were General as to all the Chriſtian world: And that ſuch General Councils there muſt be, (if it pleaſe the Pope to call them,) though they muſt come from all the Quarters of the Earth, and whence they have no Sea paſſage, and out of the Empires of many Princes, and many that are Enemies to the Chriſtian Name, and perhaps at Wars with Chriſtians; and when the Voyage or Journey is ſuch, that if the Churches be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of a thouſand Biſhops, twenty of them are never like to live to return home to the remoteſt Nations. Nor could they converſe as a Council, by reaſon of the number and diverſity of Languages, if they were equally gathered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or they hold, that if a ſmall part of the Chriſtian World aſſemble (as at</hi> Trent) <hi>when the rest cannot come, this is an Univerſal Council of and to all the Chriſtian World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>This Papiſt is one that holdeth, If a fallible Pope and a fallible General Council do but agree, their Decrees are infallible: As if an unlearned Pope</hi> (e. g. <hi>that underſtands not the Text of Scripture in the Original) and an unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Council (as to the moſt) ſhould agree, their Decrees would be learned;</hi> e. g. <hi>in judging which is the true Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of a Tongue which they never underſtood.</hi> As if ten purblind men if they meet together might produce the Effects of the cleareſt ſight, or Fools by conjunction become wiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <q>He holdeth that Tradition from Fathers to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60973:89"/>
Children is the ſure way of conveying all the matter of Faith and Religion; and yet that the greateſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, which are the Church repreſentative, may erre in matter of Faith, and have erred; unleſs a Pope (who is fallible) approve of their Decrees.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. <q>And when he hath truſted to this way of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he denyeth the Judgment and Tradition profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the greater half or the Chriſtian World.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <q>He believeth that all men are bound on pain of damnation to believe that the Senſes and perception of all men in the World are deceived, in apprehending that after Conſecration there is true Bread and Wine in the Sacrament. And he that will ſo believe his own and others Senſes, ſhould ſuffer as an Heretick, and be rooted out of all the Dominions of all Chriſtian Lords on Earth. So merciful is he to his Neighbours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For an approved General Council hath decreed this, and ſuch Councils are his Religion. Were it his own Father or Mother, Wife or Child, that cannot thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all his own and other mens Senſes, and believe that there is no Bread or Wine in ſpight of his ſight, taſte, touch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he believeth that they ſhould be <hi>burnt as Hereticks,</hi> or <hi>exterminated.</hi> He may be a <hi>good nae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd</hi> man that is loth it ſhould be ſo; or he may be one that is <hi>ignorant</hi> of his own Religion, and doth not know that this is one Article of Popery; or he may be an <hi>unconſcionable</hi> man, that will not obey that which he knoweth to be his Religion; or he may be <hi>unable</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſuch Laws: But <hi>it is his Religion</hi> to believe that he ought to do it.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. <q>If he be a Temporal Lord of a Proteſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it is part of his Religion to take himſelf obliged to root out, deſtroy, or burn all his Proteſtant Subjects, and all others that deny Tranſubſtantiation.</q>

            <p>WHat their CHURCH is may ſo eaſily be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from what is ſaid, that I ſhall ſay but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more of it.</p>
            <p>In General, <hi>It is a Society called Eccleſiaſtical, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſuch a Head, and ſuch Members, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly, I. <q>It is a Humane Church as to the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cauſe of its Form; made by Man, as diſtinct from that Church-form which was inſtituted by Chriſt; even by the Fathers, becauſe that <hi>Rome</hi> was the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Seat. As is proved before.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <q>It is a Humane Church as to the conſtitutive Head, as diſtinct from the true Univerſal Church, which hath no Head (ſingle or collective, Pope or Council) that is not God.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <q>It is a Sect conſiſting of about the third part of the Chriſtian world, calling themſelves the whole Church, and condemning all the reſt for not ſubjecting themſelves to this Uſurping Head.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <q>It is a new Church in compariſon of Chriſts Univerſal Church, as having a new Humane Original. (As is proved.)</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <q>It is a treaſonable Church, as ſet up without Chriſts Authority, and challenging his Prerogative, and weakning his Kingdom, by unchurching the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part.</q>

            <p n="6">VI. <q>It is an unholy Church, as diſtinct from the

holy Catholick Church, and that both in the eſſential Matter and Form. 1. In the Matter, its Head which is a conſtitutive part, having been oft a condemned Heretick, Infidel, Murderer, and other flagitious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man. 2. As to the Form, being not of God it is not holy. 3. Beſides that, as to the Head, he was long made by the moſt wicked Whores.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All this is before proved at large.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <q>It is a Church that hath had its pretended ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion interrupted <hi>(as is proved;)</hi> ſometimes by long Vacances, ſometimes by long Schiſmes, when no one was the Univerſal Head; ſometimes by the Incapacity of the Perſons, being Lay-men, or Infidels, Simoniaoal, condemned depoſed Hereticks, and therefore no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <q>It is a Schiſmatical Church, that cuts off it ſelf from all the reſt of the <hi>Chriſtian Church:</hi> And by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a falſe Head and Principle, and conditions of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> never did, never will, or can unite in, is the grand cauſe of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Schiſm.</q>

            </p>
            <p>All this is expreſly proved before.</p>

            <p>I have ſhewed out of many Doctors cited by <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> that many that believe not in Chriſt are of their Church. He ſaith himſelf pag. 113. <hi>(Deus, Nat. Grat.)</hi> 
               <q>[What is clearer than that at this Day, the Goſpel bindeth not, where it is not authentically preached; that is, that at this Day men may be ſaved without an explicite belief of Chriſt?

And that men that hold all the different Opinions in the <hi>Jeſuites Morals,</hi> and the Schoolmen, beſides many various Religious Sects, make up their Church, is not denyed.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. <q>It is a <hi>Church</hi> that pretendeth to have a Judge and end of Controverſies; but indeed hath a Judge that for the moſt part dare not decide them, and that can make no end of them when decided.</q>

And you cannot aſcertain men what is an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Propoſal. You alſo tell men of the neceſſity of their own <hi>ſatisfactions</hi> for the ſin that Chriſt forgiveth, and that in the Fire of Purgatory; ſo that (as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) none ſuch can dye comfortably, that look to go hence into ſuch a Fire, where torment may make it hard to you to love God that tormenteth you. It is a ſpirit of bondage that ſeemeth to actuate your very auſterities, and to turn your Religion into ſuperſtitious tasks of ſelf-made Services; Ceremonies, and expectations of the expiating Flames in Purgatory: But you ſhew too little of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption, of power, love and a ſound mind,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. of <hi>righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Terrour</hi> and <hi>Torments</hi> are temptations to you to deſire the miſerableſt life on Earth (much more a life of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) rather than to dye, when ſuch Flames muſt next follow.</p>

The Prince of darkneſs leadeth men in the dark to do the works of darkneſs, that they may be caſt into outer darkneſs. How the caſe is with yours I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. <q>Our Religion is for ſo much faſting and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities as is truly neceſſary to the ſubduing of Pride, Worldlineſs, or fleſhly luſts, or to expreſs our ſelf-abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in due times of humiliation, <hi>(preſcribed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on publick occaſions, or diſcerned by our ſelves in private;)</hi> and ſo much as is truly helpful to us in Gods ſervice, or our preparations for death.</q> But how much you have turned theſe into unreaſonable Ceremony, and how much into a pretended ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice by puniſhing our ſelves, as if our hurt delighted God when it tends not to our healing, I ſhall not now ſtay to open. See <hi>Dallaeus de Poenis, Indulgentis, &amp; de Jejuniis,</hi> of it at large.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. <q>Our Religion teacheth us that all that truly believe in, and are heartily devoted to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as their God, and Saviour, and Sanctifier, forſaking the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, ſhould be taken by Baptiſmal profeſſion hereof into the Church, and ſhall be ſaved, if they prove not Hypocrites or Apoſtates: And that we muſt judge men by this their Profeſſion, till they plainly or provedly nullifie it, ſuppoſing every man, under God, to be the beſt Judge of his own heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But your Religion teacheth you to hold and ſay, that if men are never ſo fully perſwaded in themſelves that they truly love God and holineſs, and are thus devoted to him, yea and if their lives expreſs it, yet if they be not Papiſts, they are all deceived, and none but Papiſts
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60973:98"/>
ſo love God: And every Papiſt thus knoweth the hearts of others, better than we can know our own.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. <q>Our Religion leaveth us room for Repentance, and hope of Pardon, if we miſtake.</q> For we take not our ſelves to be impeccable or infallible in all that we hold; though we are ſure that our <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Objective</hi> Religion is infallible. But your Church being founded in the falſe conceit of the Popes and Councils Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, you ſhut the door againſt repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when once a falſe Decree is paſt, you take your ſelves obliged to defend it, leſt by Reformation you pluck up your Foundation, and all ſhould fall. Were it not for this I am perſwaded your Church would recant at leaſt the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, if not that of depoſing Princes, and ſome others.</p>
            <p>And now I humbly preſent what I have written to <hi>W. H.</hi> and not without hope (if he will but impartially read it) of his reduction: For the man ſeemeth to me to ſin through Ignorance, and to have an honeſter zeal than many others. For my own part, 1. I profeſs to him I write as I think; and that after forty years reading I think as many of the Papiſts Books as of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. 2. And that I would joyfully recant, whatever it coſt me, if I could find that I do erre. But I have ſhewed him that I differ not from them, without that which to me appeareth to be conſtraining Reaſon. 3. And that if he will prove to me that I have in one word of this Book unjuſtly accuſed, either their POPE, PAPISTS, RELIGION, or CHURCH, I ſhall thankfully receive his conviction, and repent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:60973:99"/>
And I agree with him wholly in profeſſing my Religion to be, The APOSTOLICAL CHRISTIANITY, and whatever he proveth to be truly ſuch I will receive. The Name of <hi>[The Proteſtant Religion]</hi> I like not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe meer <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is all our <hi>Religion,</hi> and our <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation</hi> againſt Popery denominateth not our Religion it ſelf, but our Rejection of their Corruptions of it. But the Name of <hi>[The Proteſtants Religion]</hi> I approve and own, that is, APOSTOLICK CHRISTIANITY CLEANSED FROM POPERY.</p>
