         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thus:</p>

his own affections: against whom, whensoeuer he
got the victorie, there was a whole man in him: he
was of the sword, and knewe better how to ende
quarrels, then to beginne them; yet was more apt
to begin, then other (better bearded) were to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
with which (some that were euer bound to
the peace) vpbraided him as a blemish. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
barring him (for want of action) of that which
he was borne to inherit, (same) he went in quest
of it into the Low Countries, where (by his deare
<pb facs="tcp:5532:36"/>
earnings) hee bequeathed that to those of his
name, with nothing, but his name seemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
him of in England. Ost-end beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
hee lost one of his eyes, whilst hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ouer the walles, which first storme did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
driue him on to more dangerous aduentures,
though to the hazard euen of a shipwracke, (then
like a fearefull Merchant) to runne his fortunes
and reputation on ground, for the boysterous
threatnings of euery idle billow. So this his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
set vpon his rest, to leaue all the remainer of
his body to that Countrey, which had take from
him one of the best iewells of his life, since it had a
peece of him, he would not so dishonor the place,
as to carry away the rest broken. Into the field
therefore comes he, the sates putting both his eies
into one, (of purpose) because he should looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
none but his enemies: where, a battaile being
to be sought, the desert aduanced him to aduance
the Colours; by which dignitie, he became one of
the fairest markes, which was then to be shot at:
and where a great part of that daies glory was to
be wonne; for the Regent that followed his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
(by being hardly set to) giuing ground, and
the enemies ambition, thirsting after his Colours,
threw at all, in hope to winne them. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinies
(who fought on their side) mistooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and in steede of striking the Colours out
of his hand, smote him: in so much, that hee was
twice shot, &amp; twice runne through the body, yet
wold not surrender his hold for al those breaches,
<pb facs="tcp:5532:37"/>
but stripping the prize for which they stroue, off
from the staffe that helde it vp, and wrapping his
dying bodie in it, drewe out his weapon, with
which before his Collours could bee called his
winding sheete, he threwe himselfe into the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
of danger: where after he had slaine a horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and two other; most valiantlie, hee came
off (halfe dead, halfe aliue,) brauely deliuering vp
his spirit in the ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that (as if Fortune had beene iealous of her
owne wauering,) death (at her intreatie) tooke
him away, in the noone-tide of a happinesse; lest
anie blacke euenings ouercasting should spoyle it
with alteration. He was married to the honour
of a fielde in the morning, and died in the Armes
of it the same day, before it was spoyled of the
mayden-head: so that it went away chaste and
vnblemishable. To conclude, (Father Sculler)
because I see wee are vppon landing, heere is as
much as I can speake in his praise: he dyed <hi>Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
in the very middest of his youth.</p>
