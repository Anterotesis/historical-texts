            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶To the Courteous and Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch and so great (Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) is the obstinate and peruerse blindnesse of the fond and fantasticall Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, that vnworthely they chalenge vnto them selues all Ecclesiasticall Rites and Priuiledges, vnderpropping their ruinous ROMAINE Church with such fayre, but rotten, postes, and extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (euen aboue God) their whorish Antechrist with such glorious titles of holinesse &amp; honor, that if God did not turne their wordly wisedome to follie, and cause them by running headlong into grosse &amp; pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable errors, to discouer their owne dotinges, many true and perfect Christians might by their charming allurements be sinisterly seduced. As I was thus sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully meditating of these their polliticke illusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, there came to my handes a Copie of the Oration or Sermon pronounced at Roome ouer the Corps of GREGORIE the xiij. their last and leaud Pope: which taking in my hand &amp; thinking to finde some excellent (though erronious) shewe of skill and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: after I had vewed and reuewed it ouer careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I found such a confused Chaos of doting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, such an absurd fourme both of learning, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb facs="tcp:6195:3"/>
and methode, that I could not but wonder how either Mas Doctor the Preacher could bee so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to vtter such balde stuffe afore so many stately Cardinalles: or such mightie Potentates suffer the Corps of their new Sainct GREGORIE: or their owne reuerende grauities to bee abused with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of such fantasticall toyes. But seeing their owne wordes may bee best witnesses of their follies, I thought good to translate it into English, that euen the simplest may see how simplie GOD wot these great Schoolemaisters deale in their greatest &amp; most waightie affaires. For who would haue thought that the Cardinalles would not haue appointed such a learned Prelate to preach at the Funerall of so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a man: nay, as they say, more then a man, that his excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue bene a glorie to the dead Corps of their good Pope GREGORIE: but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such waightie affayres they bring forth such weake Diuinitie, let the world iudge how carelesly and vnskilfully they will gloze ouer their small and ceremonious tromperies. This shewe of their owne dotings then I hope shall bee a proofe or caueat for the godly to beware of their poysoned potions, and to leane only to the true Church that is builded on the Rock Christ Iesus: which happie successe in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse wishing to al men, I commit you to the Almightie.</p>

griefe doth still secretly creepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mirth. And any person troubled with cares or vexed in mind, doth rather dye then liue, wee must therefore take from the sixtie yeares afore said the one halfe, and so there remaine but thirtie.</p>
            <p>Now, let vs see whether in the space of sixe score yeares a man may not passe away tenne at the least in sicknesse, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunces, or other infirmities? I may tell you there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that liueth sixe score yeares in the world, but at seuerall times and during his sayd age he hath aboue tenne yeares infirmitie: and therfore we must take from the thirtie yeares which are the remainder of mans life yet tenne yeares, and then there are but twentie left.</p>
            <p>Which are now the twentie yeares of his life? We must take them at his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and in his oldest age: that is, tenne yeares from his very childhood, and the other tenne from his extreme olde age: but sith aswell in Infancie as in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of age there is no life, but rather a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing death, I conclude, that man hath not one only howre of life in this world,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6195:6"/>
also that whosoeuer seeketh life in this world doth much deceiue himselfe. In heauen therefore it is that wee must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure our selues to liue, and seeke for life, but not vppon earth where death doth continually haunt vs. For wee ought to dye to the world, to the end to be borne in Iesus Christ.</p>

the losse: nay, rather to doe two things which seeme to repugne each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for if it bee true that nothing doth more aggrauate the griefe of the losse, then the remembraunce of the valew of the thing lost; then doth nothing seeme more contrary to the comfort of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the praises of him that is dead, as in this cace, wherein so farre doe the merites of the deceased exceed, that the arrowes which pearce his heart that is depriued of him are the more sharp and grieuous.

Among the which my Lords and ye my hearers, I doe freely confesse, that I haue greatly doubted whether I were best to begin, as I take the maner to be, at the greatenesse and eminencie of the famely from whence he is extract: and at the first I was purposed so to doe, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rather because it is not yet scarce two monethes sence that my selfe heard him in this Temple, discourse how our Sauiour Iesus Christ was content to bee borne of a Mother though poore, yet Noble, and discended of a Noble race, also that Nobilitie was very effectuall euen to spirituall life, as it may be sayd of him that is noble, that whether it bee through conformitie or resemblance of mind with his predecessors, either tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the remembrance of such things as they haue done, either els through the effect of good bringing vp, or for whatsoeuer other reason, hee is better

disposed to doe well: that nobilitie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him as a spurre to goodnesse and a bridle to euill, also that as the precious stone being ser in Gould maketh a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shew then in Iron, euen so the same vertuous deedes doe giue a more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall example when they proceede from noble personages then from men of base estate, with other things which hee spake to the same purpose.

            <p>When he was a litle childe he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deuoute, and it is well knowne that God euen in his first youth wrought in him merueilous signes of singuler good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The like is read of <hi>S. Basile, S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, S. Dominick, S.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6195:11"/>
to take in any other thing, he tooke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in framing of little Aulters, adorning of small Chappels, and counterfaiting of holy thinges. Matters, which although the wisest may thinke too base for this place, &amp; for the occasion now ministred, yet would I not onely not disdaine, but also take great and singuler pleasure in the same. And although some doe say that among such serious affayres such small trifles should haue no place, yet do I delight to shewe how commendable, not onely graue matters, but euen such small thinges were in him. Concerning the rest, according to the proportion of his age, or rather beyond the reach of that age (as occasions doe encrease so must my stile arise) his holinesse beeing past the inferiour Schooles, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to studie the Law, it is not possible to make an ende of writing with what modestie and grauitie hee there passed the yeares of his studie:<note place="margin">The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie and virginitie of the Popish Clergie doth consist in keeping of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines.</note> he was apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Clarkes attire, but, which was of greater importaunce, he obserued Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie maners, much continencie, (as it is supposed) perpetual virginitie, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

behauiour, no vanitie, continual stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: These were his exercizes: and to be briefe, although through our mishaps the Vniuersitie wherein he studied were not vsually either the quietest or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest in the world, yet might the writing of <hi>Naziauzene</hi> concerning the <hi>Great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sille</hi> and the towne of <hi>Athens</hi> be applied to him. Like as, there is one riuer which flowing through the Sea, taketh no bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse thereof: also a certaine beast that liueth in the fire &amp; consumeth not, euen so he with great quietnesse passing these troubles, and with soueraigne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue such vices, did first and most worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atteine to the doctorall degree, and afterwarde was called to <hi>Roome,</hi> and made <hi>Cardinall</hi> onely through desert, for his learned studies, and not by fauour as the most part doe now vsually practize.</p>
            <p>A happie departure, a blessed iorney for al the holy Church, but especially for this great Citie of <hi>Roome,</hi> which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued so great benefites and so much comfort at his hands. Notwithstanding whatsoeuer affayres he had in hand, yet did hee daylie applie his studie at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6195:12"/>
howre, and so continued his studie euen to his death, with so deepe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good successe, that although his intellectuall habitudes had not very farre beene surmounted and darkened through the merueilous brightnesse of his morall and theologall vertues, yet in respect of his learning and studie onely, he deserued great praise, and in troth he was neuer other then most learned and a great fauourer of learned men. Who did euer shewe them more pleasure, or receiue them more courteously? Besides the Seminaries and Colledges, as well at <hi>Pauy</hi> as here, the Lectures, the Stipends, with such and so many thinges done to behoofe of learning, &amp; besides the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes which hee hath of himselfe written: and now that the bridle of his modestie doth no longer deteine, I hope, as my selfe haue seene them, so comming to light, all the world shall behold them, &amp; in them perceiue as in him selfe whether were more the holy writinges or good maners.

During his Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie he liued so religiously and deuoutly, that the whole life of a man were little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to rehearse the same. But herein I repose my self vpon that zeale which I perceiue in euery one to commend him, wherby I may shortly see so many proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, verses, and rithmes, with such histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, so many Orations, and volumes to his honor, that all these thinges, as well such as I cannot touch, as the rest which I mention and speake of, shall briefly be disciphered and liuely coloured foorth. For now to rehearse all the holy workes of our good Sheepheard, or to endeuour to set foorth that very patterne of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop which he hath expressed in himself, to say trueth, I thinke vnpossible, and much lesse to beleeue that the very sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie of those things that he hath done may be drawne into any anales or chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle.
