            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THIS Famous Country has its preſent Name, as by moſt Authors is agreed, from the <hi>Franci,</hi> or <hi>Franks,</hi> a People of <hi>Germany,</hi> who ſeized upon thoſe parts of it neareſt the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Third, and having afterward ſubdued <hi>Paris,</hi> and made it the Seat-Royal of their growing Empire, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Country thereabouts to be called <hi>FRANCE.</hi> Which Name, as they enlarged their Borders, they communicated to the reſt of the Country, and thoſe parts of <hi>Germany</hi> alſo that were Conquered by them. The Ancient Name was <hi>Gallia,</hi> or <hi>Gaul,</hi> and the people were called <hi>Galli</hi> or <hi>Gauls,</hi> and with thoſe that write in Latin, the ancient name is ſtill in uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95022:7"/>
It is ſcituated between the degrees of 15 and 29 <note place="margin">Climate.</note> of Longitude, and between 42 and 51 of Latitude, in the Northern Temperate Zone, between the middle Parallel of the fifth Clime, where the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt day is 15 hours and 12 Minutes, and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Parallel of the Eighth Clime, where the longeſt day is 16 hours and a half.</p>
                  <p>It is bounded on the North with the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bounds.</note> Ocean, and ſome parts of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> on the South with part of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea; on the Eaſt with a branch of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and the Countries of <hi>Savoy, Switzerland,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and on the Weſt by the <hi>Aquitanian</hi> Sea, and the reſt of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains.</p>
                  <p>The figure of it is, according to moſt, ſquariſh, <note place="margin">Dimenſions and Figure.</note> and to others roundiſh, or tending to an Oval, but all agree that it is almoſt of equal extent every way; and much about 200 Leagues, or 600 Miles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common account of 3 Miles to a League, which is an account by which moſt Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers mightily inlarge the extent of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and make <hi>England</hi> much leſs than it is: for I have obſerved, they reckon all by 3 Miles to a common League, whereas, I never could find, that a common French League was more than 2 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Miles; and if it be ſaid that in ſome places they have much longer Leagues, that is balanced by anſwering, that in ſome parts of <hi>England,</hi> there are likewiſe very long Miles. An eminent Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher reckons it 660 Italian Miles in length, 570 in breadth, and 2040 in compaſs; and makes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 200 Millions of Arpens of Land, (which is a meaſure ſomething more than an Acre.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The modern Diviſion of <hi>France</hi> is threefold. Firſt, According to its Eccleſiaſtical Government. Secondly, According to its Civil Government, or Adminiſtration of Juſtice. And thirdly, Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its military Government.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. According to its Eccleſiaſtical Government, it is divided into 17 Archbiſhopricks, containing 106 Biſhopricks and Dioceſſes, beſides the Archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks of <hi>Cambray, Beſançon,</hi> and the Biſhopricks of <hi>Arras,</hi> St. <hi>Omers, Ypres</hi> and <hi>Perpignan,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, which are ſubdivided into Pariſhes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. According to the Civil Government, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice, it is divided into 10 Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, beſides ſeveral other Sovereign Courts, and into many Bayliwicks and Seneſchalchies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. According to the Military Government, it is divided into twelve Governments within <hi>France,</hi> and four in the Conquered Countries, being ſixteen in all: Of theſe ſixteen,</p>
                  <p>Four lie Northward, <hi>viz. 1. Picardy. 2. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi> 3. The Iſle of <hi>France. 4. Champaign.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Four are Southern and beyond that River, <hi>viz. 9. Guienne. 10. Languedoc. 11. Dauphiny. 12. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The four laſt lie Eaſtwards towards <hi>Germany,</hi> and are 13. The <hi>French Low Countries,</hi> or <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. 14. Lorrain. 15 Alſatia. 16. Franche Comte,</hi> or the County of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are reckoned in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> beſides the Conqueſts, 32 Cities, above 4000 Towns, 27400 Pariſhes, 1450 Abbies, 540 Arch-Priories, 12320 Priories, 567 Nunneries, 700 Convents of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95022:8"/>
Fryers, 259 Commanderies of <hi>Malta;</hi> ſeveral Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Jeſuits and other Religious Houſes of later Foundations not reckoned, and 10 Univerſities: Of all which, we ſhall ſpeak more particularly elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>The Air is every where generally temperate and <note place="margin">Air.</note> pure, and ſo healthful, that it is obſerved to be leſs ſubject to Plagues and Sickneſs than any other Country in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Air particularly about <hi>Montpelier</hi> is held Medicinal for Conſumptions. The North Wind reigns much there, a great part of the Year, which is thought to contribute much to the ſalubrity of the Air; the Winter in the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of it, is rather fiercer and ſharper than in <hi>England,</hi> though not altogether ſo long, but the Summer much hotter; and at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and ſome parts that way, obſerved to be hotter than in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is of an extraordinary fruitful Soil, as well in <note place="margin">Soil.</note> the Mountains as the Vales; every where watered with wholeſom Springs and Streams, and with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great Navigable Rivers, and to ſay the truth, there are not many Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> to which Nature has imparted ſo rich a Portion of her choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Bleſſings: the Woods there afford great plenty of Timber and Fuel-Wood, and abound with Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts and Walnuts; the former producing excellent Pork and Bacon, the latter great Quantities of Oyl, which in ſome parts of <hi>France</hi> they uſe inſtead of Butter: The Fields are large and open, interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Vines and Corn, and bordered and interli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with choice of Fruits; and the ſteep ſides of Hills, and moſt ſandy ſtony grounds there produce often the ſtrongeſt and richeſt Wines. In fine, it is every where ſo cultivated, that it ſeems like the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Its Commodities, Merchandiſes, and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures <note place="margin">Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> are many, and ſo neceſſary to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that of late they hardly barter them but for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95022:9"/>
Money: For from this Kingdom, are Exported vaſt quantities of Salt, Wine, Brandy, Corn, dried Fruits, Silks, Stuffs, Canvas, Linnen, Sciſſars, Nuts, Nut-Oyl, Box-Wood, Paper, Skins, Hats, perfumed Gloves, and all manner of Toys and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles; and beſides, they have within themſelves, and from their own Conqueſts, and Plantations, ſuch quantities of Oranges, Lemmons, Oils, Sugars, Wooll, Stuffs, Cloths, Sea-fiſh, Stone for Building, and all other things for neceſſity, or pleaſure, that they will hardly barter of late years, but Trade only for Money, for the moſt part. The Country is every where well ſtocked with freſh Fiſh, ſtore of Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though little eaten by them; Wildbores there much priſed, with Rabbits, Hares, and all ſorts of Wild-Fowl, and ſome unknown to us: They want not good Beef, which is very ſweet, nor Mutton, which is generally ſweeter than in <hi>England,</hi> nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pork; and as for tame Fowl they have it in much more abundance than in <hi>England,</hi> and the Provinces of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Brittany,</hi> furniſh great ſtore of good Butter, ſalt and freſh; but for Cheeſe, they buy conſiderable quantities from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Suitzers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By what has been ſaid, their Riches cannot but <note place="margin">Riches and Trade.</note> be very great and inexhauſtible, conſiſting in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rich and inland Commodities, that like ſo many Loadſtones attract the greateſt part of the riches, both of <hi>Europe</hi> and of the whole World into <hi>France.</hi> For their Wines, Brandy, Salt, Canvas, Silks, Stuffs, and Toys, are Commodities which conſtantly bring them vaſt profits from <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and all the Northern Regions; and then in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, they vend ſo much Corn, Linnen, Flax, Canvas, Cordage, Stuffs, and all ſorts of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, that they fill their Country with the Coin of that Nation in return; they likewiſe diſperſe great quantities of the ſaid Commodities in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> and of late, they drive a conſiderable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95022:9"/>
Trade in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and have made ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their uſual accounts are kept by Deniers, Sols, <note place="margin">Money and Coins.</note> and Livers; a Liver is twenty of their Sols, or Pence, which is a little more than eighteen pence of our Money, and their Denier is the twelfth part of a Penny, and very convenient for buying ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of things, and reckoning Fractions; but theſe Deniers in Specie or Coyn, are uſed but in the parts of <hi>France,</hi> remote from <hi>Paris.</hi> Next are their Doubles, which are worth two Deniers, and are the ſixth part of a Penny, though formerly they went for Liards or Farthings, and ſtill bear that Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their <hi>Carolus</hi>'s, or pieces of five Doubles, are abſolute, though ſtill uſed in reckoning, their Sols or Pence called Sols Marqués, or marked Pence, of a mixt Metal, that went in the War time for five Farthings, but now but for a Penny; then they have their three pence half-penny pieces, that go in <hi>England</hi> but for three pence, half three pence half-penny pieces, five penny pieces; fifteen pence pieces, or Quart-D'ecu's, Half-Crowns, or thirty pence pieces, and Crowns, which are reckoned here at four ſhillings ſix pence, or fifty four pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, though they be worth ſixty Sols French: whereas an Engliſh Crown is valued there at ſixty five pence, and a pound Sterlin at thirteen Livers <hi>Tournois,</hi> or pounds French, contrary to what is ſet down in moſt Books. Their Golden Coins are at preſent, Crowns of Gold weighing a Dram, and are worth five Livers and fourteen pence, <hi>Lys D'or,</hi> which are but rare, worth ſeven Livers ten pence; half <hi>Lewis</hi>'s worth five Livers ten pence, whole <hi>Lewis</hi>'s worth eleven Livers, and valued here at ſeventeen ſhillings and a groat, and ſometimes ſix pence; Double <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, Quadruples, and Octuples; but the two laſt are unuſual. Beſides theſe, moſt of the Monies of <hi>Spain,</hi> both Gold and Silver, are here current, and the gold pieces are more numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95022:10"/>
than the French, <hi>viz.</hi> the Piſtols, half Piſtols, double Piſtols, Quadruples, and Octuples, of the ſame value as the <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, half <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, double <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>'s, &amp;c. The ſilver Spaniſh Coins are Crowns, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, and other leſſer pieces: Gold Coins are more frequent in payments than Silver, and though the Peaſants be poor, there is a vaſt quantity of money always moving in the Kingdom, among the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, Tradeſmen, and Merchants; but Spaniſh pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſeldom taken without weighing firſt.</p>
                  <p>Their Weights are different, as are likewiſe their Meaſures, the moſt remarkable, and neceſſary to be <note place="margin">Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</note> known by Merchants and Strangers, are thoſe of <hi>Paris, Roüen, Bordeaux, Lyons,</hi> and <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Weights of <hi>Paris</hi> are, the Ounce, the Pound, and the Quintal, which is accounted a hundred Groſs, but is found to make a hundred pound of <hi>London</hi> Suttle, two <hi>per Cent,</hi> more or leſs, and is of <hi>Lyons</hi> weight, of ſixteen Ounces, a hundred and ſixteen. Laſtly, There is the Cargo or Great Quintal, which is three hundred pound <hi>Troy</hi> weight.</p>
                  <p>Their Meaſures of length called Aulns or Ells, are two, one for Linnen, and the other for Silks, and are much about the length of the vantaged and unvantaged Aulns, but ſeldom uſed in Groſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Silks and Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this City, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſold by weight; which makes recompence to the Buyer, for any defect in them. Their Concave Meaſures for Wine, are the Pint, which is about a <hi>London</hi> Quart, the Chopine, which is a <hi>London</hi> Pint, and the Demyſthier, which is half a Pint; the Citern, which is eight Pints, or a <hi>Paris</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, ninety ſix of which make a Tun, and a Muid, which contains two hundred and eighty Pints. But in the Country about, theſe Meaſures are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt double to <hi>Paris</hi> liquid Meaſure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. At <hi>Roüen,</hi> their Weights are chiefly the Kings Beam, or Viconte, being about a hundred twenty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95022:10"/>
ſix pounds Engliſh: Their Meaſure of length, is the Auln, accounted ſomething better than forty ſix Inches: their other Meaſures are ſuch as are common through <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. At <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> their Weight called a Quintal of a hundred pounds, makes a hundred and ten pounds Engliſh: their Wines are computed by Hogſheads and Terces, and ſold in Retail by Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures more than doubling thoſe of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. At <hi>Lyons,</hi> the Weights moſt in uſe, are the Kings Beam, containing a hundred pounds, which is larger than the largeſt Town-Beam by eight <hi>per Cent,</hi> by which, the Cuſtoms are proportioned, than there is in the greater Town-Beam, weighing a hundred pounds of ſixteen Ounces to the pound, uſed for groſs goods: And the leſſer Town-Beam called the Pound-Mark, containing a hundred pounds, at fifteen Ounces to the pound, uſed for weighing Silks. The Meaſure of <hi>Lyons</hi> for length, is the Auln, which is forty ſix Engliſh Inches, ſeven of them making nine Engliſh Yards, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds ſuttle of <hi>London,</hi> makes in <hi>Lyons</hi> ninety ſix pounds and a half ſilk weight.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. At <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> their weight is the Pound of ſixteen Ounces, a hundred of which make a Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, three Quintals the Cargo; the Quintal is eighty eight and a half Engliſh pounds. Their Meaſures of length are the Cane, which they divide into eight Palms, which make two Engliſh Yards and one eighth part. Their Concave Meaſure for Corn, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the Mine which makes little above the third part of the Engliſh Quarter.</p>
                  <p>But Weights and Meaſures general for the whole Kingdom, are the Mark, by which, are weighed Gold, Silver, and great Pearls, containing eight Ounces, each Ounce containing twenty four De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, and each Denier twenty four Grains. The Mark weighs three Carats, each Carat being reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the third part of an Ounce, and is uſed by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95022:11"/>
the Changers: For Corn and Salt they have their Minots, their Muids, and their Boiſſeaux, or Buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; the Boiſſeau, or Buſhel, is little more than an Engliſh Peck. Their Inch is ſomething bigger than ours, and conſequently their Foot, which is larger by half an Inch than the Roman Foot: their Lands are meaſured by Arpents; an Arpent of <hi>Paris</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a hundred Perches ſquare, every Perch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining twenty two Feet: the diſtances of places are meaſured by Leagues, the leaſt Leagues contain twelve thouſand <hi>Paris</hi> Feet, and the greater twenty thouſand like Feet.</p>
                  <p>As for their Buildings in <hi>France,</hi> they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <note place="margin">Buildings.</note> of Stone, and at <hi>Paris</hi> very high, made mighty ſtrong with Timber, and the Floors of Plaiſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> or paved with pretty Tiles, or elſe covered with Wood wrought with inlaid work; all which the better and neater ſort keep well rub'd. Their Noblemens Houſes are all very ſpacious, regular and magnificent, with ſtately Portals, and fine Courts and Gardens, and handſome ſtabling behind, or on the ſide. The chief Buildings in <hi>France</hi> are the Palaces of the Kings, of which more in their place; ſome Cathedrals, Colledges, Hoſpitals, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſes of Modern Foundation, in which the perfection of Architecture is to be ſeen; the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of many of which, is attributed to the Engliſh.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Inhabitants, of their Laws, Religion, Manners, and puniſhments, of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Language, Stature, Diet, Attire, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, Names, and Surnames, and of their Computation, and manner of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE preſent Inhabitants are the <hi>French,</hi> who <note place="margin">Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> are a mixture of the ancient <hi>Gauls, Romans, Goths, Burgundians,</hi> and <hi>Francs,</hi> from which laſt they derive their name, who ſometime before they ſeiſed on <hi>France,</hi> had ſeated themſelves about <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and hovered about the <hi>Rhine</hi> a long time, being till then, no ſetled, but an Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory People, as many Authors of note affirm; nay ſome make them to have been but ancient Colonies of the Old <hi>Gauls,</hi> who after they had rambled through ſeveral parts of the world, and could fix in no place, returned at laſt to this their ancient home, finding ſo fair an opportunity to recover it from the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had been the firſt occaſion of their rambling.</p>
                  <p>They are governed chiefly by the Civil Law, <note place="margin">Laws.</note> though they have likewiſe their Cuſtomary Laws, peculiar to ſeveral Provinces, as the Laws in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> which were the foundation of ſeveral Laws in <hi>England</hi> ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>Their Religion is the <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> but yet <note place="margin">Religion.</note> they are ſtiff Aſſertors of the Rights and Priviledges of their particular Church, which they call the <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>The Manners of the ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> as they are <note place="margin">Manners.</note> deſcribed by <hi>Caeſar</hi> and other Hiſtorians, ſeem to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95022:12"/>
have been inherited by the preſent <hi>French,</hi> and to be effects of the Climate: for they are very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted, and of a nimble apprehenſion, but withal, they are generally raſh and precipitate, impatient, haſty, inconſtant, eager and full of fire at the firſt onſet, but better at a puſh than at an obſtinate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; thus they are naturally; But the preſent King, who has much of the ſober mixture of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> in him, has made it appear to all <hi>Europe,</hi> That His <hi>French</hi> well moderated, are capable of making as wiſe, diſcreet, and ſedate Counſellours as any in the World, and as capable of managing ſecrets, which has been thought a thing almoſt incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the temper of this Nation: Then, as for Souldiers, by providing well for them, as for Cloths, Victuals, and exact pay, by good Diſcipline, and by frequent, but cautious fleſhing them in Wars, under experienced and fortunate Commanders; and laſtly, by intermingling Foreign Forces of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with them, to ſtir them up to emulation, He has made both his Infantry and Cavalry formidable, and it can no more be ſaid now, that the <hi>French</hi> know not how to ſtorm a Town, endure the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of a Siege, or rally again when their Ranks are broken: As for Commanders, they always had ſtore of them, and have now the greateſt plenty of them, and the beſt of any one Country in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Country has in all Ages produced great numbers of Learned Men, of which, and of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Artiſts, their Princes and great Men, have in this laſt Age been very great Encouragers; and all the Sons of their Gentry, as well thoſe that are deſigned for Military Employments, as for the Gown, are bred up at leaſt to a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Latin Tongue: So that as uſually it happens under Great and Fortunate Princes, they now abound with Great Scholars, Great Stateſmen, and Great Souldiers; and their <hi>Paris</hi> is become the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95022:12"/>
Rendezvous of all the famous Wits and Artiſts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> who flock thither from all places. Their Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is accompliſht, polite and civil, to the higheſt degree. They keep up their State and Magnificence with ſuch a Decorum, as hinders them not from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing familiar and courteous to all; the Ceremonies they obſerve ſeem natural, and they love nothing that is crampt and preciſe. Their Citizens, Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Artiſans, and very Peaſants, are generally more civil and courteous to Strangers, and in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary converſation, than thoſe of other Nations. They are very airy, amorous, and full of talk, and always in action or motion: In bargaining, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of cuſtom, they will ask three or four times as much as a thing is worth, and will have it if you bargain not, and when they buy, bid as little, but if you ſtand with them, you may buy cheap enough, and ſell dear enough. They are very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and good natured, and will do any thing for you by ſpurts, if you take them when they are warm: They are very quarrelſome, and given to Duelling, were they not ſeverely reſtrained, but they are eaſily reconciled and diſpoſed to forget in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries: But above all things, they are moſt given to Law-Suits and Contentions, there being more Lawyers and Law-Suits there than in all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom beſides, and that between the neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by which it comes to paſs, that the Lawyers, Judges, and other Officers of Juſtice, with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans or Farmers of Taxes, are reckoned the richeſt Body in the Kingdom, excepting the Church-men. The Women partake leſs or more according to their Sex, in all the Qualities of this Character, and are generally very talkative, but yet very pleaſing in Diſcourſe, of a graceful and winning deportment, generally good Singers, and ſo free in converſe, that many Strangers, ignorant of their genius, are apt at firſt to miſtake them to be what they are not.</p>

Their puniſhments for Nobles, among which, all <note place="margin">Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Gentlemen are reckoned there; for ſmaller offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are Fining and Impriſoning, and for greater, Confiſcation of Lands and Goods, Degradation, and after that Hanging, or Condemnation to the Gallies, as meaner perſons, otherwiſe Beheading; thoſe that are not Gentlemen are Fined or Whipped, as here, or Hanged for Thefts and ſome other Crimes; but Highway-men, Aſſaſinators, or wilful Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, are generally broken on the Wheel, of what Quality ſoever, unleſs they be favoured. Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors not noble, are drawn to pieces by wild Horſes, or otherwiſe tormented; but Gentlemen are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Beheaded, Poyſoners and Sorcerers are burned: Many Crimes there are for which the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals are Condemned to the Gallies; falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in Capital Caſes are put to Death: They uſe there the torture or Queſtion, which is ordinary or extraordinary, which is by giving the Party Drenches of Water till they almoſt burſt, and tying them up in painful poſtures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>France</hi> is very populous, the number of people <note place="margin">Number.</note> being reckoned to be about fifteen Millions, of which two hundred and ſeventy thouſand are ſaid to be Church-men, beſides Nuns, about five Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fit for War.</p>
                  <p>Their Language is a mixture of the old <hi>Gauliſh,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Language.</note> 
                     <hi>Gothiſh, Roman,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Tongues, not without ſome ſmack of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and is now ſo poliſhed, that it is become the ſweeteſt, the moſt courtly, and moſt modiſh Language of <hi>Europe,</hi> but moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the fair Sex, and politer part of men. It is tender, amorous, and delicious to the Ear, quaint and charming in expreſſion, eaſy enough to learn in part, but moſt difficult to attain in perfection: It is rather elegant than copious, being not ſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant and comprehenſive as the Engliſh in proſe, nor ſo fit for numbers, and ſtrong and lofty in Verſe, yet very melodious when ſung, and very obedient
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95022:13"/>
and plyable to any variety of Airs and Tunes, of which they have ſome of the beſt and moſt aiery and ſprightly that can be invented. Many neat, elegant, and ingenious works there are in this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but ſolid and profound Writers, not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as in ſome other Tongues.</p>
                  <p>Their Stature and Complexion is different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Stature and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</note> to their quality, and according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Provinces they inhabit: The common people that are expoſed to the Sun, and hard labour, and fare hard beſides, are commonly not very tall, and are tawny, tan'd and wither'd, both Men and Women, but hardy and ſtrong; and the Women for their Sex more than the Men. The perſons of Quality are generally tall, ſtraight, well-ſhaped, and very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and well complexioned, both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: the middle ſort of people are generally ſlight timber'd, but indifferently well ſhaped and complexioned, the Men more than the Women, as if they had in ſome ſort rob'd the Female Sex of their chief Prerogative: Yet the Women there among the Gentry and better ſort of Citizens, are for the moſt part, tall, and well ſhaped, and many of them very fair hair'd and complexiond, very white skin'd, and blue-eyed, which is reckoned there a Beauty; and ſome there are as perfect Beauties as any are in the World: But the major part are black or pale, yet well featured, and are almoſt all ſo aiery, ſo well carriaged, as we have already remarked; and withal ſo witty and dextrous at their Tongues, that they charm without Beauty: Thoſe of <hi>Normandy, Picardy,</hi> and <hi>Brittany,</hi> are moſt like the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Germans;</hi> but yet at and about <hi>Angers</hi> and <hi>Blois,</hi> are reckoned to be both the handſomeſt and wittieſt Women in all <hi>France:</hi> Thoſe in <hi>Languedoc, Provence,</hi> and other Provinces towards <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> come nearer the temper and complexion of thoſe two Nations: And in a word, we may ſay of the whole Nation in general,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95022:14"/>
that they are of a Sanguine and airy temper and complexion.</p>
                  <p>Their Diet among the Peaſants is very miſerable, who feed on black Bread, Sallets, and Broth made <note place="margin">Diet.</note> of a little Salt and Herbs, fatned with the rinds of Ruſty-Bacon, and on Apples and other Fruits, and drink Water almoſt all the Year, daring not to eat their own Fowls, nor drink the Wine of their own growth, for fear of being taxed the more, they being very envious one againſt another, and apt to betray one another, and carry tales on ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the Aſſeſſors of Taxes, making them believe their Neighbours are richer than they think, and conſequently able to bear a heavier burden, by which, they became the mutual inſtruments of their own miſery: But in Towns and Cities, Tradeſmen and Artificers diet well enough, only they eat their meat freſh and freſh, having conſtantly boiled meat, and Broth they call Soupe, for Dinner, made gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a little piece of Mutton, Beef and Veal, and ſometimes a Fowl; and at Night, they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a joint of meat roaſted, or ſome good Fowl, with Fruits and Sallets; on Fiſh-Days they have their meager Broths of Herbs, with Fiſh or Pulſe in proportion; and always a competent quantity of Wine.</p>
                  <p>The Noblemen, Gentry, and richer ſort keep very good Tables, though not ſo profuſe as the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, they chuſing rather to ſhew their riches in Coaches, Horſes, Liveries, Attendants, and other Equipage, than in Diet: Yet at Feaſts and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, they are generally more Magnificent than the Engliſh: They uſe great variety of Haſhes, Entries, Kickſhaws, Poignant Sawces, and other made Diſhes: But in Paſtry, they uſe only Paſties and no Pies, among which, the Hare and Wild-Boar Paſties are much in eſteem; they eat much young Kid, but Veniſon they prize it not. They are in general, great Eaters of Sallets, Fruits, and Bread:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95022:14"/>
they uſe no ſalt meat but Pork and Bacon, but they uſe much Salt and Pepper in their Haſhes and other Diſhes: Thoſe of the Female Sex ſeldom drink Wine there, till they come to be Married.</p>
                  <p>Their Attire being ſo much imitated by the <note place="margin">Attire.</note> Engliſh, cannot be unknown, whoſe Nations, little or much, following of late years their Mode, and therefore I ſhall refer you to your own Eyes for that; but this may be ſaid in general of them, both Men and Women, that are more neat, curious and coſtly in their Habit than in any thing elſe, and put them on after ſuch a manner, that they always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them; and that they look upon a fair outſide as one of the firſt and moſt neceſſary ſteps to any that would live, and make a figure in the World.</p>
                  <p>Their Recreations and Exerciſes are Tennis, every <note place="margin">Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Village affording a Tennis-Court, and <hi>Paris,</hi> many hundreds; Dancing which is natural to them, Maſques, Playes, Muſick, Singing, Fencing, Riding the Great Horſe, Vaulting, Bowls, Biliards, Dice and Cards, to which they are much addicted. It is accounted a mean and ſcandalous thing to ſmoke Tobacco at <hi>Paris,</hi> or in any of the Inland Towns, and they will drink briskly enough for good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Divertiſement, but ſeldom to Drunkenneſs, at leaſt the better ſort, and never drink without eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome good bit. Their Gentry uſe much Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hawking, and for the former ſport, buy many Horſes and Hounds out of <hi>England,</hi> having them in great eſteem: At Court, they uſe too, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Ring, at a Head, and Carouſels, where theſe and other nobler Divertiſements are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed.</p>
                  <p>They have Chriſten-Names and Sur-Names as in <note place="margin">Names.</note> 
                     <hi>England.</hi> Their Chriſten-Names are generally Saints-Names, of which, they join many times two or more, and ſometimes a Mans and Womans Name both in one compound, as <hi>Lewis-Marie,</hi> or <hi>Marie-Lewis:</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95022:15"/>
Their Surnames have generally the Particles <hi>du, de la, le</hi> or <hi>la,</hi> that is to ſay, of, of the, or the, before them, and are taken from the name of ſome Quality, Trade, or other matter or thing, or accident; if they be not noble, as <hi>le Blanc,</hi> White, <hi>la Fleur</hi> the Flower, <hi>le Fevre,</hi> the Smith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Noblemens, or Gentlemens Names, are generally taken from ſome chief or ancient Land of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance or Poſſeſſion, and their Sons that are not Heirs to the whole Eſtate, or ſucceed to any Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips newly acquired by their Father, many times Quit their Fathers Name, and take up the Name of that Land or Lordſhip which they Inherit from him, which in proceſs of time breeds obſcurity in the Genealogies of Families, notwithſtanding the help of Heraldry, which yet is very much cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among them.

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Preſent King, is named <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, the Fourteenth of that Name, King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> Son of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, Surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Juſt, and Grand-child of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great. Many have called our Moſt Auguſt Monarch, <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,</hi> for his happy Birth granted to the Prayers of the French after twenty three years expectation. He was Born of Queen <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans en Lay,</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1638. and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the King his Father the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1643. He was declared Major, or at Age, the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 1651. Conſecrated at <hi>Reims</hi> 1654, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at St. <hi>John de Luz</hi>'s, the <hi>9th</hi> of the ſame Month 1660.</p>
                  <p>As to his Conſecration, or Anointing, (for ſo the French call the Coronation of their Kings) though the Medals made on that occaſion bear date the <hi>31th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> you are to remark that it was not performed till the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> of the ſaid Year 1654.</p>
                  <p>I thought I could not give you a more faithful Draught of the Perſon of our Invincible Monarch, than that which I have borrowed from the words of the late Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Hiſtory that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95022:16"/>
Illuſtrious and Learned Prelate compoſed of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yes, Sir,</hi> (ſaith he to him) <hi>Heaven has given you a generous, good, and bounteous Soul, a Wit ſublime, and capable of the greateſt things, an happy and eaſy Memory, an Heroick and Martial Courage, a clear and ſolid Judgment, a ſtrong and vigorous Body, and over and above all this, another very particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and that is, That Majeſtic Preſence, that Air and Gate almoſt Divine, that ſhape and that beauty worthy of the Empire of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the Eyes and Reſpect of the whole World, and which without the Force of Arms, and without the Authority of Commands, wins you all thoſe to whom your Majeſty is pleaſed to ſhew your Self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> is called <hi>Moſt Chriſtian,</hi> for the great and Signal Services, received by the Church and the Holy See, from this Crown.</p>
                  <p>He is alſo, for the ſame reaſon, ſtiled the Eldeſt Son of the Church, and by ſeveral Bulls of <hi>Popes,</hi> a priviledge has been granted to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> that they ſhould not be liable to Excommunication, nor their Subjects abſolved of the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance due to them.</p>
                  <p>This Monarch is [in point of precedence] the firſt <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> notwithſtanding the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> who never diſputed, or did ſo much as take place next after our Kings before the time of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and then other Kings preceded them. It is true indeed, that that Emperour, being likewiſe King of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe his Miniſters and Ambaſſadours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> as repreſenting the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; the Spaniards under his Succeſſour <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, who was only King of <hi>Spain,</hi> endeavoured under that pretence in the Year 1558. at <hi>Venice,</hi> to gain the Precedence of <hi>France;</hi> but that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick regulated that diſpute, and ordered the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence to be continued to the Ambaſſadours of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95022:16"/>
                     <hi>France,</hi> as Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth had done before: And <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth the King of <hi>Spain</hi> laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, agreed to it, by the ſatisfaction he cauſed to be made to the King of <hi>France</hi> by the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> his Ambaſſadour Extraordinary, in the preſence of eight Ambaſſadours, and twenty two Reſidents or Agents, the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1662. for the Aſſault made by his Ambaſſadour on ours in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> 1661.</p>
                  <p>The Title of the King of <hi>France</hi> is ſo Excellent, and ſo much exalted above that of other Kings, that <hi>Suidas,</hi> an ancient Greek Author, writes, that in the World, when it is ſaid, only <hi>the King,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naming who, it was meant of the King of <hi>France: Matthew Paris</hi> calls him, <hi>Terreſtrium Rex Regum,</hi> the King of Earthly Kings; And <hi>Bodin</hi> ſays, that that King is Emperour in <hi>France:</hi> and many aſſert it to be a common notion of all the Nations of the World, that the Quality of King is much more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime than that of Emperour. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, <hi>lib. 9. Ep.</hi> 6. Writing to <hi>Childebert</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> ſays, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> as much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs all other Kings of the Earth, as the Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is exalted above the reſt of men.</p>

                     <p>THE Preſent <hi>Great Almoner</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is the Cardinal of <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who by his Place, is Commander of the Kings Orders: He was named to this Office of <hi>Great Almoner</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1671. And after having taken the uſual Oath on that occaſion, to the King, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly took poſſeſſion of it the <hi>12th</hi> of the ſame Month. He ſucceeded therein, the late Cardinal <hi>Barberin,</hi> Nephew to Pope <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the VIII. High Chamberlain of the Holy Church, Archbiſhop and Duke of <hi>Reims,</hi> and firſt Duke and Peer of <hi>France,</hi> who died the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1671.</p>
                     <p>He has of ancient ſtanding Wages fixed in the <note place="margin">Wages.</note> general Pay-Book of the Houſhold, 1200 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and 1200 more under the name of a Penſion; 6000 <hi>l.</hi> for his Table and Livery; 3000 <hi>l.</hi> paid him by the Treaſurer of the Mark of Gold, on the <hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> and 3000 more by the ſame Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, as Commander by his place, of the Kings Orders, making in all 14400 <hi>l.</hi> French, which is about 1108 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling.</p>

The <hi>Great Almoner</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> is by vertue of his <note place="margin">Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> Place Commander of the Kings Orders: And He, or his Great Vicars, are commonly appointed to make the Inqueſts of the Lives and Manners of the Knights of thoſe Orders, and to receive their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Roillard</hi> and <hi>Loiuſeau,</hi> and ſome other Authors affirm, that he is an Officer of the Crown. This Office is in <hi>France</hi> the <hi>Solſtitium honorum,</hi> or higheſt Pinacle of Eccleſiaſtical Honour, and has accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly been almoſt always honoured with the Purple, and poſſeſt by Cardinals.</p>
                     <p>Though in all times there always was a Head of the Court-Clergy, yet he never bore the Title of <hi>Great Almoner</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> tell the time of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, who Created <hi>Antony Sanguin</hi> Gardinal of <hi>Meudon, Great Almoner</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> though even in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII, <hi>Geffrie</hi> of <hi>Pompadour</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Perigneux,</hi> began to take that Title, as appears in the Chamber of Accounes, by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he gave of the Kings Alms, in the year 1489, but was not followed in it till the ſaid Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Great Almoner</hi> takes an Oath of Fidelity to <note place="margin">Oath.</note> the King.</p>
                     <p>He gives the uſual Certificates of the Oaths of Fidelity taken by all new Archbiſhops, and Biſhops in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>in partibus infidelium,</hi> as likewiſe, by any General of the Order, by Grand Priors of the Order of <hi>Malta,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who are Grand Priors of <hi>France,</hi> by thoſe of St. <hi>Giles,</hi> or of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> of <hi>Champagne,</hi> of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and by ſome Abbots: for formerly, all Abbots and Abbeſſes, did likewiſe take Oaths of Fidelity to the King. He likewiſe preſents to the King, the Book of the Holy Goſpels, when he is to ſwear ſolemnly to any Alliance; as appeared in the Church of <hi>Noſtre Dame</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> at the Renewing of the Aliance with the 13 <hi>Swiſſe-Cantons,</hi> performed the <hi>18th</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:95022:37"/>
of <hi>November</hi> 1663. He marches at the Kings right Hand in all Proceſſions, and when the King permits any Officers to ſit down in his Preſence, during Sermon, or other Church-Service, the Great Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Seat is on his Majeſties right Hand.</p>
                     <p>The Great Almoner has the Charge of Goal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveries, <note place="margin">Office.</note> uſually made by Kings at their coming to the Crown, at Kings and Queens Coronations, at their Marriages, at their firſt Entries into any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Kingdom, at the Birth of any Children of <hi>France,</hi> at the great Annual Feſtivals, at Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, upon any ſignal Victory or Conqueſt, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other occaſions.</p>
                     <p>'Tis he that Diſpoſes of the Revenue appointed for the Kings Alms, and that gives Order for the making the neceſſary Ornaments ordinarily uſed in the Chappel; he goes when he pleaſes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Service, as at the Kings riſing, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Bed, to aſſiſt at the Kings Prayers, at Royal Feaſts, or at the Kings ordinary Meals, to crave a Bleſſing, and give Thanks; and at Maſs, where he takes the Kings Prayer-Book from the Clerks of the Chappel of the Oratory, to preſent it to the King, as likewiſe the ſpringſing Bruſh when Maſs is done, to give the King ſome Holy Water. He Accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the King when he goes to the Offertory, from his praying Desk to the Altar. The ſame Functions are alſo performed by the Chief Almoner, or in his abſence, by the other Almoners.</p>
                     <p>He does likewiſe other Functions, if he pleaſe to be preſent at all the Ceremonies that are done, as on the days the King touches for evil.</p>
                     <p>He adminiſters the Communion to his Majeſty, and other Sacraments of which he has need.</p>
                     <p>He is the Biſhop of the Court (as the Abbot of <hi>Peyrat,</hi> one of the Kings Almoners, ſhows in his Antiquities of the Chappel Royal) and performs ſeveral Epiſcopal Functions in any Dioceſs where-ever it be, that the Court is, without asking leave of the Biſhops of the places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:95022:38"/>
He Baptizes the <hi>Dauphins,</hi> the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>France,</hi> the Princes, and all others for whom the Kings and Queens, or any Children of <hi>France</hi> are pleaſe to ſtand Godfathers or Godmothers for, whether in perſon, or by Proxy, He affiances and marries in the Kings Palace, Princes and Princeſſes. You are to obſerve, that on a Communion-day, the Great Almoner, with his Croſier and Miter, gives the Abſolution, without asking leave of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or elſe appoints another Biſhop to do it in his ſtead, according to the practiſe uſed in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals.</p>
                     <p>'Tis he, if he be in the Chappel, that gives the King the Goſpel, and the <hi>Pax</hi> to kiſs on certain Feſtivals, and when his Majeſtry Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.</p>
                     <p>He gives the Aſhes to their Majeſties, and the uſual Diſpenſation for eating Eggs and Fleſh in Lent.</p>
                     <p>The Abbot of <hi>Peyrat</hi> in his Book of the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Chappel Royal, brings Examples to ſhow, that the Great Almoner gives permiſſion to the Court Clergy, to Contract and Marry and Officers in the Kings Service, without any need of their going to a Pariſh Church.</p>
                     <p>He apoints thoſe of the ſame Clergy to hear the Confeſſions of the Kings Officers, eſpecially on the great Feſtivals of the year, and at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and to adminiſter the Sacraments to them when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, and when they are ſick.</p>
                     <p>The power of the great Almoner extends it ſelf yet further out of the Kings Chappel, and Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
                     <p>He has the diſpoſing of all places in the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of <hi>France,</hi> and he has power to appoint Vicars throughout all the Provinces and Dioceſſes of the Kingdom, to take an account of the Revenues of the ſaid Hoſpitals; but he appoints one Vicar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who has power over the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:95022:38"/>
The Great Almoner has likewiſe power in the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> over the 17 Lecturers of the Royal Colledge, over the Colledge of Mr. <hi>Gervaſe,</hi> and over that of <hi>Navarre.</hi> He has the gift of the Scholars and Principals Places in thoſe Colledges, where he has the right of Viſiting.</p>
                     <p>He has alſo the Super-Intendance of the Hoſpital of the Fifteen-ſcore blind People at <hi>Paris,</hi> of that of the ſixſcore blind at <hi>Chartres,</hi> and of that of the <hi>Haudriettes</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> which are now the Nuns of the <hi>Aſſumption.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the firſt Almoner, and other Almoners, according to their Quarters.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE firſt Almoner, when he pleaſes, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Great Almoner, performs all the ſame Functions; and he Adminiſters the Oath of Fidelity to the other Officers of the Chappel, and of the Oratory: which the other Almoners do not do.</p>
                  <p>In the abſence of the Great Almoner, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gives to Biſhops and other Eccleſiaſtical Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries, a Certificate of their having taken the Oath of Fidelity, or Allegiance to the King during Maſs.</p>
                  <p>He has 1200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> Wages, paid by the Treaſurer of the Houſhold, and 6000 <hi>l.</hi> more for his Table at Court, paid by the Maſters of the Chamber of <hi>Deniers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On <hi>Sundays,</hi> if he be at Chappel, he preſents Holy Bread to the King, to the Queen, to the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin and Dauphineſs, to Monſieur, the Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to Madame. Then the Almoners of that Quarter, give it to the other Princes and Princeſſes of the Blood, or to thoſe that are Legitimated, which are near the Kings Foot-Cloth.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Almoner, and another of that Quarter, hold the two Corners of the Communion Napkin, on that ſide next the Altar, when the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives; and commonly two Knights of the Orders, or two other Lords hold the two other Corners, on his Majeſties ſide; But if the <hi>Dauphin</hi> happen to be there, then he only is to hold the Communion Napkin on his Majeſties ſide.</p>
                  <p>The Maſter of the Oratory, has 1200 <hi>l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:95022:39"/>
Wages, paid by the Treaſurers of the Houſhold, and 3600 <hi>l.</hi> more for his Table at Court, paid him by the Maſters of the Chamber of <hi>Deniers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kings Confeſſor, who is the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> a Jeſuit, has 1200 <hi>l.</hi> a year by Name of Wages 2654 <hi>l.</hi> at the Chamber of <hi>Deniers,</hi> and 3000 <hi>l.</hi> more to maintain his Coach.</p>
                  <p>On the great Feſtivals of the year, and when the King Communicates, the reverend Father Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor is always at Church near his Majeſty, Clothed with a Surpliſs under his Mantle.</p>
                  <p>On other days, he aſſiſts, if he pleaſes, at the Kings Maſs, but without a Surpliſs.</p>
                  <p>By an Order of <hi>Philip</hi> the Long, made at <hi>St. Germain en Laye,</hi> in the Month of <hi>June</hi> 1316. The Kings Confeſſour has power to Order all Letters for Collating of Benefices to be made ready for the Royal Signature and Seal, and the Great Almoner, thoſe of Royal Gifts and Alms; according to Mr. <hi>Tillet,</hi> Tom. 1. <hi>f.</hi> 434, <hi>&amp;</hi> 435.</p>
                  <p>By a Charter of the ſame <hi>Philip</hi> the Long, made at <hi>Bourges,</hi> the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1318. All per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were forbidden to ſpeak to the King while he was hearing Maſs, except his Confeſſour, who might ſpeak to him, only about things concerning his Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>And after Maſs, he might ſpeak to him about the buſineſs of Collating of Benefices.</p>
                  <p>The King has eight other Almoners, whereof two wait every Quarter, and of thoſe two, at leaſt he that is to wait that Day, is to be preſent at the Kings Riſing, Dinner, and Maſs, during which laſt, the Almoner of the Quarter, or ſome other, is to hold his Majeſties Hat and Gloves, or in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the next Chaplain or Clerk of the Chappel, to be found in the way, is to receive them. The Almoners are to be afterward at the Kings Supper, and at his going to Bed, to perform the following Ceremonies, as to open the <note n="*" place="margin">A Box containing the Kings Plates, Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, Knives, &amp;c.</note> Nave on the Table,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95022:40"/>
if there be one, and to take it away when Supper is done, to crave a Bleſſing, and to give thanks.</p>
                  <p>The Almoners are preſent on ſolemn Feſtivals, and when the King Communicates, Clothed with Rotchets under their Mantles, both at Maſs, and at Veſpers. They Preach in Rotchets, both before the King and elſe where. They adminiſter the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the King. They go and preſent the Holy Bread; they alſo deliver Priſoners, give Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Lent to eat Eggs and Fleſh, give Aſhes to the King, Queen, and other Royal Perſons; they give Holy Water to the King and Queen, when Maſs is done; and in fine, in the abſence of the Great, or the firſt Almoner, perform all Functions which they ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>They have each a Salary 300 <hi>l.</hi> a piece for ſerving the King, and their Diet at the Table, called the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners Table. And for ſerving at the Dauphins, by turns, one year in two, they have half the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they have in the Kings Service, and half a Piſtol a Day for their diet, which one year with another, makes 600 <hi>l.</hi> to each, beſides their diet at Court.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not mention thoſe many titular Preachers and Almoners, that the King is pleaſed to admit only, <hi>ad honores,</hi> becauſe they have no rank here. There is one Chaplain in Ordinary, who has 1200 <hi>l.</hi> a year under the name of Wages, and 1098 <hi>l.</hi> for his diet, at the Chamber of <hi>Deniers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides whom, there are eight Chaplains that ſerve quarterly, two to each Quarter: Who are to ſay every day (excepting the High-Maſs dayes) a low Maſs before the King; they ſerve commonly Weekly, and he that is not in Waiting any Week in the Kings Service, may, if he pleaſes, when he is preſent at the Kings Maſs, kneel in Maſs-time next behind the Almoners, on the Kings right hand. They ſerve alſo the Dauphin, and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95022:40"/>
They have each 240 <hi>l.</hi> Wages a year, for three Months waiting in the Kings Service, and their diet at the Almoners Table, during their ſaid three Months Service, and 120 <hi>l.</hi> to ſerve by turns at the Dauphins, and their diet at Court, at the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers,</hi> or Water-Servers belonging to the Dauphin. They have likewiſe 120 <hi>l.</hi> Recompenſe for ſerving every other Year at the Duke of <hi>Burgundies,</hi> and 270 <hi>l.</hi> for their diet, at the end of their quarter. And beſides, you are to take notice, that at the Dauphins, they are allowed half a Piſtol a day a piece for their diet, every day there is no Table kept, which one year with another makes 495 <hi>l.</hi> yearly Revenue to each, beſides their diet at Court, and ſome other profits.</p>
                  <p>The Chaplains, beſides the ordinary Ceremonies, go before they begin Maſs, and give their Majeſties Holy Water: and when Maſs is done, they preſent the Corporal, on which they have Celebrated, to their Majeſties to Kiſs.</p>
                  <p>There are eight Clerks of the Chappel and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that ſerve Quarterly, two each Quarter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, or before the Dauphin and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>They have each 180 <hi>l.</hi> a year Wages paid by the Treaſurers of the Houſhold, for three Months Service to the King, and Diet at the Almoners Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at Court, during their ſaid three Months Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice 75 <hi>l.</hi> a piece paid by the Treaſurers of the Offrings, for Furniture for the Kings Chappel, 90 <hi>l.</hi> Wages, or recompenſe at the Treaſure Royal, for ſerving every other year at the Dauphins, and their diet at the <hi>Serdeau's</hi> or Deſervers Table at the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, and when no Table is kept, half a Piſtol a day for their diet, as have the Chaplains, 100 <hi>l.</hi> for Furniture for the Dauphins Chappel: They have likewiſe every other year 90 <hi>l.</hi> recompenſe paid at the Treaſure-Royal, for three Months ſerving the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> 270 <hi>l.</hi> for their diet, at their

quarters end, paid at the Chamber of <hi>Deniers,</hi> and 100 <hi>l.</hi> for the Furniture of that Chappel, paid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at the Treaſure Royal, which makes up one year with another 580 <hi>l.</hi> Revenue yearly, beſides their diet at Court, and ſome other profits; as for Fees due to them from Biſhops and others, at their taking the Oaths of Allegiance to the King, in his Chappel and Oratory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides all this, when his Majeſty gives Mourning at any time to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Houſhold, and of his Chappel, the Clerks of the Chappel and Oratory, have an equal allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Chaplains, as it was confirmed in 1684. at the Mourning for the late Queen <hi>Marie-Tereſa</hi> of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> the Clerks of the Chappel ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving allowed them, on that occaſion, 50 Crowns as well as the Chaplains for every Marriage Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Kings Preſence, his Majeſty allows them 20 golden <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, paid by the Principal <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> then in Waiting, which are at preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between the two Chaplains, and the two Clarks of the Chappel, who are in waiting at the time of ſuch a Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>The Chaplains and Clarks of the Chappel, in the abſence of the Almoners, may perform almoſt all the Functions, which they might do, if preſent, being as it were, their Vicars by their places.</p>
                  <p>You are to obſerve, that of the three Officers laſt named, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Almoners, Chaplains, and Clarks of the Chappel, when they go out of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the King, there enters into waiting with the Dauphin, one Almoner, one Chaplain, and one Clark of the Chappel; and with the Dauphins Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, only one Chaplain, and one Clark of the Chappel.</p>
                  <p>You are likewiſe to obſerve, that in the general Account-Books of the Kings Houſhold, the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Officers are called Maſters: and in the Book of Accounts of the Chamber of <hi>Deniers,</hi> the firſt eight Chaplains, and the eight other Clarks of the

Chappel, are equally placed under the Title of the Kings ſixteen Chaplains.</p>
                  <p>There are two Grooms of the Chappel, who have 600 <hi>l.</hi> a year each.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1669. the King Created an Office of Maſter of the Eccleſiaſtical Ceremonies of his Chappel and Oratory, which is at preſent vacant.</p>
                  <p>He began firſt to exerciſe the Functions of his place, on <hi>All Saints</hi> day in 1668. and bore for a mark of his Office, a Staff about the length of a Singing Mans Staff, covered with Violet-coloured Velvet, wrought with <hi>Flower de luces,</hi> and headed with a Crown Royal, and uſed to ſerve principally at high Maſſes, Veſpers, and other Eccleſiaſtical Ceremonies where his Majeſty was preſent, or that were performed by his Order. He had 1500 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Wages, paid quarterly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1681. The King Created an Office of Veſtry-Keeper of his Chappel and Oratory, who has 900 <hi>l.</hi>—a year, Wages, and 1095 <hi>l.</hi> a year for his Diet, and takes an Oath of Fidelity, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord Great Almoner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> The manner of taking the Oath of Fidelity is thus: The Party who takes the Oath, kneeling on his Knees, puts his hands joined between the Kings, or any other dignified perſons hands, who receives the ſaid Oath, and ſo pronounces the Oath, and after, Kiſſes the Goſpels, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him; and this is the reaſon of the French Phraſe, <hi>Prèter ſerment entre les mains du Roy,</hi> to take an Oath between the Kings Hands, when they ſpeak of taking one to him.</p>

                     <p>Of the Muſick of the Kings Chappel.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Muſick of the Kings Chappel is compoſed of a Maſter of the Kings Chappel-Muſick, who is at preſent the Archbiſhop of <hi>Reims,</hi> &amp;c. and has under the name of Wages 1200 <hi>l.</hi> and 3000 <hi>l.</hi> more for his Table at Court, paid at the Chamber of <hi>Deniers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He receives the Oath of Fidelity from the four Chaplains, for the High-Maſſes, from five Clerks, from the Muſick-Maſters, Organiſts, and Singers, and others of the Chappel-Muſick.</p>
                  <p>Four Maſters of the Muſick that ſerve each their quarter.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe performs all the Eccleſiaſtical Functions of a Muſick-Maſter, during the half year, beginning from <hi>January,</hi> and beſides, during all the ſame time, he has care of the nouriſhment, Education, and maintenance of the Pages of the Muſick. And the ſecond has the like care of them, during the other half year.</p>
                  <p>You are to take Notice, that in the Account-Books of the ſmaller expences, by which all Wages of the Chappel-Muſick are payed, they are only ſtiled Under-Maſters of the Muſick.</p>
                  <p>Two Compoſers of the Muſick, 50 Crowns.</p>
                  <p>Four Organiſts 600 <hi>l.</hi> They ſerve quarterly.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral Muſicians that ſerve all by the half year, at the ordinary allowance for Diet and Maintenance of 900 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and the Pages of the Muſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two <hi>Fouriers,</hi> or Harbingers of the Chappel of the Kings Muſick; ſerving by the half year.</p>
                  <p>Two Grooms, and one Landrer of the Muſick Chappel.</p>

                     <p>Thus much of the Eccleſiaſtical Officers that ſerve about the King, and other Royal Perſons. There are beſides them other Eccleſiaſtical Officers appointed for the Kings Houſhold, and the whol-Court in general, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>Six Almoners of the Kings Houſhold, ſerving every ſix Months, whereof the laſt was added in 1670. whereas there were but five before.</p>
                     <p>They have for their Wages a <hi>Denier</hi> being the twelfth part of a penny upon every <hi>Liver,</hi> or twenty pence <hi>French,</hi> out of the Wages of all the Officers Commoners of the Kings Houſhold, each receiving 331 <hi>l.</hi> 2 pence, and 48 <hi>l.</hi> beſides at the Chamber of <hi>Deniers</hi> for every half year.</p>
                     <p>Formerly they uſed to Bleſs the Meat at the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Table of the great Maſter, and at that of the Stewards of the Houſhold, when they had their diet at Court, and they likewiſe rendred thanks there, placing themſelves at the upper end of the Table. At preſent they eat at Court, at the Table called the Almoners Table.</p>
                     <p>The Confeſſor and Preacher of the Houſhold, or of the Commoners, as they are called, have an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of 300 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and likewiſe his diet at the Almoners Table: He takes an Oath to the Great Almoner.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, there are the Almoners belonging to the great and little Stables, and to the other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Kings Houſhold, and the Chaplains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſeveral Companies of Guards, and of the Gentlemen-Muſqueteers, and others, of which we ſhall ſpeak in their places.</p>
                     <p>The New Chappel of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> was Conſecrated the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1659. by the late Biſhop of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> ſince Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris;</hi> and that of

                     <p>The Kings Eccleſiaſtical Officers keep always on his Majeſties right hand in the Chappel; and the Biſhops, Abbots, and Eccleſiaſtical Officers of the Queen, on his left. Now, on his Majeſties right hand, the Great Almoners Place is next to the Kings Perſon, then follows that of the firſt Almoner on the right hand of the Great Almoner: As for the Kings Father Confeſſour, he places himſelf at the Great Almoners left hand, more within the Kings Praying-Desk: The Maſter of the Chappel-Muſick takes his place on the left hand, next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to the Kings Praying-Desk. The reſt of the Almoners rank themſelves to the right-hand-ward, from the foot of the Kings Praying-Desk, toward the Altar, and after them, the Chaplains and Clerks of the Chappel, and Oratory, and the other Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Kings Houſhold, every one in their Order.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> is at preſent Grand Maſter of the Kings Houſhold, and his Son the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> has it in Reverſion.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Maſter has yearly, under the name of Wages, 3600 <hi>l.</hi> for Liveries 42000 <hi>l.</hi> paid quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, for his Collations 1200 <hi>l.</hi> and 1800 <hi>l.</hi> for his Steward.</p>
                  <p>Under the firſt Race of our Kings, the Great
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95022:43"/>
Maſter of <hi>France,</hi> was called the <hi>Mayor of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> who was a Lieutenant-General over the whole Kingdom; and according to the ancient Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the State, as there was a Duke placed over twelve Earls, and ſometimes, a Duke over whole Provinces, ſo the Mayor of the Palace, was the Duke of Dukes, and ſtiled himſelf Duke or Prince of the <hi>French.</hi> His Authority was not confined only within the Kings Houſhold, where he diſpoſed of all Offices, but he had a great power over all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of War, and Juſtice, over the Managers of the Revenue and Treaſury, and indeed over all Affairs of State; and grew ſo great at laſt, that it Eclipſed the Kings, and gave <hi>Pepin,</hi> who was but <hi>Mayor of the Palace,</hi> opportunity to aſſume the Crown, which having done, and fearing, that if he continued any longer any ſuch great Authority as this, in an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, his own practice might be returned on him and his Succeſſors, he ſuppreſſed this Office of <hi>Mayor of the Palace,</hi> and Erected in its ſtead, that of <hi>Seneſchal,</hi> for the Government only of his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, reſerving all the other powers, of that former Office, to himſelf. Yet it has happened ſince, that the <hi>Seneſchal</hi> for all that, has taken upon him ſome Command in the Armies, even ſo far as to have the Guard of the Kings Perſon: Some have called him the Great <hi>Gonfanonïer,</hi> or Standard-Bearer.</p>
                  <p>This Office became Hereditary to the Counts of <hi>Anjou,</hi> from the time of <hi>Geffry Griſegonelle,</hi> to whom King <hi>Robert</hi> gave it about the year 1002. and thoſe that exerciſed it about the King, held it in Fee, of thoſe Counts, to whom they did Homage for it, and paid certain acknowledgments, as going to meet the Count of <hi>Anjou,</hi> when he came to the Palace, Lodging him, letting him ſerve the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and furniſhing him in the Armies, with a Tent big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hold a hundred Knights, as <hi>Hugh de Clé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> reports at large.</p>
                  <p>This Officer alſo retained ſtill a part of the power
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95022:44"/>
of the Mayors of the Palace in other things, and decided all differences ariſing among the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the Court, and among the Officers of the Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>After the Kings Death, he throws his Staff up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Functions and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives.</note> the Coffin, before all the reſt of the Officers Aſſembled together, to ſhow that their Offices are expired; but the ſucceeding King, ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores them, out of his ſpecial Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>The Great Maſter Regulates every year the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Mouth of the Kings Houſhold. He has an entire Juriſdiction over the ſeven Offices, the moſt part of which places he diſpoſes of, and the Officers thereof take the Oath of Allegiance to the King, between his hands: Nevertheleſs, the Great Maſters have voluntarily reſign'd the Office of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of the Gobelet, and of the Mouth, into the Kings hands, ever ſince <hi>Monſieur de Soiſſons,</hi> Great Maſter of the Kings Houſhold, under <hi>Henry</hi> IV. refuſed to trouble himſelf any longer with the care of them.</p>
                  <p>He receives the Oath of Allegiance from the firſt Maſter of the Houſhold, from the Maſter of the Houſhold in Ordinary, and from twelve Maſters of the Houſhold, that wait Quarterly, from the Great and Chief Pantler, Cup-Bearer, and Carver; from the thirty ſix Gentlemen Servitors, from the three Maſters of the Chamber of <hi>Deniers,</hi> from the two Controulers-General, from the ſixteen Controulers Clerks of Offices, from the Maſter of the Kings Chappel-Muſick, and from the Maſter of the Kings Oratory, from the Almoners of the Kings Houſhold, from the Great Maſter, the Maſter, and the Aid of the Ceremonies; from the Introductor of Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, and from........ from the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Horſe in Ordinary, and of the twenty other Maſters of the Horſe that ſerve quarterly; from the four Lieutenants of the Guards of the

Kings Gate, from the Keepers of the Tents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he ſerves in Ceremony, and that he goes along with the Meat, he marches nearer the Kings Meat than all the Stewards of the Houſhold, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Staff ſtrait, and bolt upright, like a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the other Maſters of the Houſhold hold theirs more downward, in his preſence.

                     <p>Of the firſt Maſter of the Houſhold, and of the other Maſters under him.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE firſt Maſter of the Houſhold is at preſent the Marquiſs <hi>de Livry,</hi> who has a Juriſdiction over <hi>the ſeven Offices,</hi> as far as relates to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but has not the diſpoſal of their places. He may alſo receive the Oath of Fidelity from the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eers of the Cup or Goblet, and of the Mouth, and of the other Officers, and in the Great Maſters ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, of thoſe other Officers which ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Ceremony to him. He has his Lodging in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and has yearly for Wages 3000 <hi>l.</hi> for Liveries 7968 <hi>l.</hi> and for the Counters 60 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He keeps the Great Chamberlains Table, and has the laſt courſe of it for his Fee. The priviledge of the ſaid Table is an acquiſition that has been made to this Office, by ſome preceding Firſt Maſters of the Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>When the King has at any time received the Communion, he preſents to the Prieſt a Cup of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95022:45"/>
Wine for his Majeſty, and at the ſame time, a Napkin to the King, to wipe his Mouth. But if a Prince of the Blood, or any Prince Legitimated, be preſent, then that Prince preſents the Napkin.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Maſter of the Houſhold, or the Maſter of the Houſhold then in Waiting, goes along with the Broth that is carried to the King when he takes any: He receives the Kings Orders concerning his Majeſties Diet, and the hours he preſcribes for his Repaſts, and gives notice of them to the Officers of the Goblet, and of the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>The next Officer is the Maſter of the Houſhold in Ordinary, who has yearly 1200 <hi>l.</hi> ordinary Wages, 1420 <hi>l.</hi> Liveries, and 60 <hi>l.</hi> for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>In the abſence of the firſt Maſter of the Houſhold, he doth the ſame Functions, as he, both in the Kings-Office or Counting-Houſe, and in his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
                  <p>It was Order'd in 1669. that whenever the King, being at a Ball, a Comedy, a <hi>Balet,</hi> or an <hi>Opera,</hi> or the like, ſhould take a Collation without ſitting down at Table, that the Maſter of the Houſhold in Ordinary ſhould ſerve his Majeſty. In the abſence of the Captain of the Guards, he renders for him the ſame Honours at the Great Maſters Table.</p>
                  <p>There are twelve more Maſters of the Houſhold, that wait three and three by quarters, who formerly had 900 <hi>l.</hi> a piece yearly, of the Treaſurers of the Houſhold, but now they have but 450 <hi>l.</hi> beſides which, they have at the Chamber of <hi>Deniers,</hi> each Man 300 <hi>l.</hi> at the end of their quarters waiting, and 64 <hi>l.</hi> for Counters, beſides ſeveral other profits, and he that ſerves the Dauphin in the ſame quality, has 225 <hi>l.</hi> Wages at the Treaſure-Royal, and 150 <hi>l.</hi> more at the end of his quarters waiting, out of the Chamber of <hi>Deniers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majeſty by a Declaration in <hi>April</hi> 1654. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the number of the Maſters of the Houſhold to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95022:45"/>
twelve, and that of the Gentlemen-Walters, or Servitors, to thirty ſix.</p>
                  <p>By another Declaration of the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> The Maſters of the Houſhold are ſtiled Counſellers, and Maſters in Ordinary, of the Houſhold, Knights and Squires; They may bear their Coats of Arms timbred, and enjoy, as do their Widows after them, an exemption from all manner of Taxes and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions whatever.</p>
                  <p>They have a Command over all the Offices called <hi>the ſeven Offices,</hi> and in the Kings Houſe, when they Conduct the Meat to his Table, they carry Staves garniſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with ſilver and gilt Vermilion, having on the tops a Crown ſet with <hi>Flower-deluces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They preſent to the King the firſt wet Napkin, with which his Majeſty waſhes his hands, before he eats, and they yield this honour to none but the Princes of the Blood, the Legitimated Children of <hi>France,</hi> and the Great Maſter: They are preſent at all buſineſs that paſſes in the Kings Office, or Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe, as we shall ſhow afterward.</p>
                  <p>In the abſence of the firſt Maſter, or Maſter in Ordinary, they go every Night to ask his Majeſty what hours he will pleaſe to eat at next day; and eſpecially, when the Court is upon a Journey, they ask the King the time and place he would pleaſe to dine at, that they may give Order to the Officers of the Goblet, and of the Mouth, to provide ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                  <p>The Officers of the <hi>ſeven Offices,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that are accuſtomed to take the Oath of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in the preſence of the Great Maſter, may take it in an Aſſembly of this Office, and then thoſe who preſide there, which are the Maſter of the Houſhold in Ordinary, or the Maſters of the Houſhold then in Waiting, may in the abſence of the Great Maſter, or the firſt Maſter, receive the ſaid Oaths of Fidelity. On Fiſh-Dayes a Maſter of the Houſhold is to be preſent at the taking in of the Fiſh.</p>

When the King is to give any Holy, or Bleſſed Bread in any Pariſh or Society, the Maſter of the Houſhold in Waiting that day, holding his Staff in his hand, is to accompany the Holy Loaves to the Church, which are commonly ſix in number; The Almoner that goes to preſent them from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, marches between the Maſter of the Houſhold, and the Comptroller, at whoſe left hand goes the Treaſurer of the Offerings.</p>
                  <p>The Maſters of the Houſhold keep the Table cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Maſters of the Houſholds Table, or elſe eat at the Table of the ancient Great Maſter; and at the Dauphins, they keep the Table of His Highneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Ser-d'eau,</hi> or Water-ſerver, that is, his Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or Voider, that takes away, when Meals are done.</p>

                     <p>In the Letters Patents for their places, they are ſtiled <hi>Eſquires;</hi> and by a Declaration of the King, of the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1656. they may take the Titles of <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Eſquires,</hi> and may bear their Coats of Arms timbred.

thoſe who are called the Children of the Holy Supper. They have rank and place at all great Ceremonies, as at the Kings Coronation, his ſolemn Entry into <hi>Paris,</hi> and at the Chriſtning of the Dauphin. They wait with their Swords by their ſides, and may be preſent in the firſt Office of every quarter in which they have place and voice next after the Maſters of the Houſhold, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Regulations ſet down in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances made for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>They were formerly more in number, till his preſent Majeſty, by a Declaration of the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1654. they were reduced to thirty ſix, who take the Oath of Fidelity in preſence of the Grand Maſter, or of thoſe, who as we have ſaid, in his abſence ſupply his place. They likewiſe, and their Widows, enjoy an exemption from all Taxes and Impoſitions; They are ranked upon the Book of the Eſtabliſhment at the rate of 700 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Wages, though they receive but half that ſum, and they have all their Diet at Court, at the Table, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Kings Water-Servers, or Voiders Table, and thoſe that ſerve at the Dauphins, eat likewiſe at his Highneſſes Water-Servers, or Voiders Table.</p>

                     <p>After them are the Uſhers of the Hall, who after they have Conducted the Kings Meat from the Kitchin of the Mouth to the Anti-Chamber, where his Majeſty dines in publick, take on them the keeping of that Door from the time the Table is ſpread, till the Cloth be taken away; they are twelve in number, waiting three and three quarterly: they have 300 <hi>l.</hi> a piece yearly Wages, and eat with the Gentlemen-Waiters: and he that ſerves the Dauphin in the ſame quality, has 226 <hi>l.</hi> Wages.</p>

to attend the Preparatives, cuts out the Eſſays or taſts of the Bread already prepared at the Goblet, and cauſes one of the Officers of the Goblet to take a taſte of the Kings two little Loaves, and of his Salt, he touches likewiſe, with one of his Slices of Eſſay, the Kings Napkins, Spoon, Fork, Knife, and Tooth-pickers, giving afterward the ſaid Eſſay to an Officer of the Goblet, to eat, which is called, making the Preparatives: And the ſaid Gentleman Server, having thus taken poſſeſſion of the <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory-Table,</hi> continues to keep it.</p>

                     <p>After the <hi>Serdeau,</hi> or Water-Server, has given Water to the Maſter of the Houſhold, to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Waiter, and to the Comptroller, to waſh their hands with, in the <hi>Office of the Mouth.</hi> The Uſher of the Mouth places the Diſhes upon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-Table, and preſents two Eſſays, or taſts of Bread, to the Maſter of the Houſhold, that is, to taſt the firſt Service, who after he has touched the Meat with the ſaid two Eſſays of Bread, eats one himſelf, and gives the other to the ſaid Uſher of the Mouth, to eat. Then the Gentleman-Waiter takes the firſt Diſh, the Comptroller the next, and the Officers of the Mouth the reſt. In this Order, the Maſter of the Houſhold, with his Staff in his hand, marches at the head of them, ſome ſteps before whom, goes the Uſher of the Hall, with his Wand in his hand, which is the mark of his Office, and when the Meat is brought to the Table, guarded by three of the Life-Guards, with their Carabines on their Shoulders. The Maſter of the Houſhold makes a bow to the <hi>Nave,</hi> and the Gentleman-Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that carried the firſt Diſh, ſets it on the <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory-Table,</hi> and having received an Eſſay of the Gentleman-Waiter that makes the Preparatives, he eats it, and ſets his Diſh upon the ſaid Table, after which, the Gentleman-Waiter that makes the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives, takes the reſt of the Diſhes out of the hands of the Comptroller, and others that brought,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95022:49"/>
and places them likewiſe on the ſaid Table, giving every Man a taſt of the Diſh he brought; which done, the other Gentlemen-Waiters take the ſaid Diſhes off the <hi>Preparatory-Table,</hi> and carry them to the Kings Table. The firſt Courſe being thus ſerved up upon the Table, the Maſter of the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, with the Uſher of the Hall going before him, with his Wand in his hand, goes and gives his Majeſty notice: the ſaid Maſter of the Houſhold, when there, carries his Staff as a mark of his Office, but in his abſence, the Gentleman-Waiter that offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates his place, carries only for a mark of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Function, a wer Napkin between two golden Plates, that his Majeſty may ſee by that, the Meat is on the Table; then he comes back, marching before the King to the Table, where his Majeſty being arrived, the Maſter of the Houſhold, or in his abſence the Gentleman-Waiter preſents him the ſaid wet Napkin to waſh withal, according to an Order of the King for that purpoſe, of the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1676. upon occaſion of the diſpute that happened thereon in the Queens Houſhold; the ſaid Maſter of the Houſhold, or Gentleman-Waiter, ought likewiſe when he takes the ſaid wet Napkin of the Officer of the Goblet, to make him make trial of it. Thus much for the firſt courſe; as for the others, you may obſerve, that the Gentleman-Waiter that has the charge of the <hi>Preparatory-Table,</hi> continues all along, to make the Officers of the Mouth and Goblet, taſt of every thing they bring up at each courſe, which the other Gentlemen-Waiters come and take, and ſerve up to the Kings Table, when his Majeſty calls for them.</p>
                     <p>But the other Gentlemen-Waiters, after they have brought up the firſt courſe, go no more down to the Office, but having waſhed their hands with Water given to them by the Officer of the Goblet, at the Side-Bord in the Anti-Chamber, or ſome other place, come back and wait at the Kings Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95022:49"/>
on that ſide oppoſite to his Majeſty, and not behind, where commonly Noblemen and Ladies ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Upon <hi>New-Years-Day,</hi> in the year 1674. his Majeſty having been pleaſed to Order, that for the future, none but the Gentlemen-Waiters ſhould ſerve him at Table, and that they ſhould wait five at a time, that the Service might be the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly performed; Since that time, one of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways waits at the <hi>Preparatory,</hi> or <hi>Teſting-Table,</hi> as we have ſaid, till the laſt courſe be ſerved up, after which, he quits it, and going to the Officers of the Goblet, or Buttery, he takes of them the ſecond wet Napkin, after he has made them make trial of it, and holds it ready for the King, to waſh his hands with at the end of his ſtepaſt; and the other four wait always at the Kings Table, while his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is eating.</p>
                     <p>He that ſerves as Cup-Bearer, when the King askes for Drink, cryes out preſently, aloud, <hi>Some Drink for the King,</hi> and then bowing to his Majeſty, goes to the Side-Bord, and takes from the hands of the Chief Butler of the Mouth, a golden Plate, on which are placed a Glaſs with a Cover, and two <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Caraffes</hi> are large Glaſſes, in form of thoſe uſed for Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, at our Tables.</note> 
                        <hi>Caraffes,</hi> or larger Glaſſes of Chriſtal, one of Water, and one of Wine, and then comes back the Chief Butler and his Aid, or Aſſiſtant of the Goblet of the Mouth going before him to the Kings Table, where being all three come, and having made Obeiſance to the King, the ſaid Chief-Butler ſteps on one ſide, and preſents a Vermilion-Taſter to the Gentleman-Waiter, who likewiſe turns himſelf toward him, and pours out of the two <hi>Caraffes,</hi> ſome Wine and Water into the ſaid Taſter, being a little Cup of Vermilion gilt, in the Chief-Butlers of the Goblets hands; after which, the ſaid Chief-Butler pours out the half of what was filled into the Taſter in his hands, into another like Vermilion preſented him by his Aid, or Aſſiſtant, then giving the firſt into
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95022:50"/>
the Gentleman-Waiters hands, and taking the other out of his Aſſiſtants, he drinks that off firſt, after which, the Gentleman-Waiter drinks his, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns it to the Chief-Butler, who returns them both to his ſaid Aſſiſtant: Having thus taſted the drink, in the Kings ſight, the Gentleman-Waiter bows again to his Majeſty, and giving him the Glaſs, takes off the Cover, and preſents him at the ſame time, the Plate or Stand, on which are the <hi>Caraffes,</hi> out of which, his Majeſty fills himſelf Wine and Water, or Wine alone, as he likes, and when he has drunk, ſets the Glaſs on the Stand again, which the Gentleman-Waiter covers again, and taking up the Stand, with what is upon it, bows once more to the King, and then gives it back into the Chief Butlers hands, who carries it to the Side-board.</p>
                     <p>It is to be remarked, that when the <hi>Nave</hi> is placed on the ſame Table on which the King eats, when the King asks for drink, the Gentleman-Waiter goes to the Side-board, with a Guard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and fetches the Plate or Stand, with the Glaſs as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Nave</hi> be placed on the ſame Table at which the King eats, every time the King changes Napkins, which is at every courſe, at leaſt, after the Almoner has opened the <hi>Nave,</hi> one of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen-Waiters is to lift up the ſweet or perfumed Bag which lies over them, to make room for another of his Companions to take them out, after which, the firſt Gentleman is to put in the Sweet-Bag again, and the Almoner to ſhut the <hi>Nave.</hi>

                     <p>From the time the Cloth is laid, till his Majeſty riſes from Table, the Uſher of the Hall is to keep the Door of the Room where his Majeſty Dines in Publick at Home; and if the <hi>Nave</hi> be there, then he keeps the Door of the Anti-Chamber.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Serdeau,</hi> or Water-Server, receives all the Diſhes that are taken off the Kings Table, which are carried thence to the Office, or elſe to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen-Waiters Hall, commonly called the <hi>Serdeau</hi>'s Hall, where he ſerves up the ſame Diſhes, to the ſaid Gentlemen-Waiters, and to thoſe who have their Diet at the ſame Table with them: Under the <hi>Serdeau,</hi> there are likewiſe ſeveral Servants that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Office; and the Gentlemen-Waiters Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, eat afterward, of what is taken from their Table.</p>

When any Officer of the Kings Houſhold is Arreſted, or made Priſoner, the Fuel-Officers are charged with the Priſoner, and the Fuel-Office is made their Priſon.

                  <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Great Chamberlain, and all Officers under his dependance.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF the honour of Officer, may be rated from the frequency, and nearneſs of their approaches to the Kings Perſon, then certainly the Great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain muſt needs have the greateſt ſhare therein of any, ſince it is at all times in his power, to be near his Majeſty, and that he has a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rank in all the moſt Magnificent Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>This Office is almoſt as ancient as the beginning of this Monarchy, and one may judge of its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the Nobility of the Perſons that always have enjoyed it. He had formerly a great Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the Mercers and other Trades that deal in Clothing, and for that purpoſe, he ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted under him a Surveyor of thoſe Merchandizes, who was commonly called <hi>the King of the Mercers,</hi> that is to ſay, their <hi>Syndic,</hi> or Comptroller, who alſo Examin'd the Weights and Meaſures of the ſaid Merchants: His Court of Juſtice was held at the Marble Table in the <hi>Palais,</hi> or Palace at <hi>Paris,</hi> by a Mayor-Judge, Commiſſionated by the Great Chamberlain, and ſome other Officers.</p>
                  <p>The Great Chamberlain was formerly of the Great Officers that Signed all Charters, and Letters of Conſequence, and has ſtill a Right to ſit in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the King at the Tryal of any Peers.</p>
                  <p>He had formerly the Keeping of the Kings Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers and Treaſury in his Chamber, and had the management of the Exchequer, as he has to this day, in ſeveral places, where the <hi>Camerlingue,</hi> or Chamberlain (for in different places, he is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95022:60"/>
ſtiled) is likewiſe Treaſurer, and receives all the Revenues; and it belonged to him, or his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Treaſurers, to carry Money about them for the Kings Liberalities, and other neceſſary Expences: He uſed to have for his Fee the tenth part of what came into the Kings Coffers, and was wont to deal out the Annual Gratuities to the Souldiers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Preſents for all Ambaſſadours.</p>
                  <p>He has been indifferently ſtiled, <hi>Cubicularius, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarius,</hi> or <hi>Cambellanus,</hi> that is, <hi>Bedchamber Man, Chamber-man,</hi> or <hi>Chamberlain;</hi> But the Office of <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> and <hi>Chamber-man,</hi> were afterward made diſtinct Offices, as, among other proofs, will appear by an ancient duty upon Merchants, who paid 16 pence, whereof ten pence went to the Chamberlain, and the other ſix to the Chamber-Man; But the Office of Chamber-Man was ſuppreſt in the Perſon of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans, Anno</hi> 1544. or to ſpeak more properly, we may ſay, that it aſſumed under <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, the preſent Title it is now known under, of Chief Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber.</p>
                  <p>The preſent Great Chamberlain is the Duke of <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who has yearly 3600 <hi>l.</hi> under the name of Wages, and a Penſion of 20000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the King ſits on his Bed of Juſtice, or in a general Aſſembly of the Eſtates, the Great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain <note place="margin">Function and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note> ſits at his Feet, upon a Violet-Coloured Velvet Cuſhion, Embroidered with <hi>Flower deluces</hi> of Gold. He is preſent at all Audiences of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, where takes his Place behind his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Chair of State, between the Chief Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, who is on his right, and the Great Maſter of the Wardrobe, whoſe Place is on his left.</p>
                  <p>Antiently, in the Queens abſence, he was wont to lie in the Kings Bed-Chamber.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Coronation-Day, he takes the Royal Buskins from the Abbot of <hi>St. Denis,</hi> and puts
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95022:60"/>
them on the Kings Legs, and then inveſts him with the <hi>Dalmatick</hi> Robe of Azure Blue, and with the <hi>Mantle Royal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Great Chamberlains have the honour to be neareſt the ſacred Perſons of their Kings while they are alive; ſo when nature has exacted from them her Tribute, and they come to die, they with the Chief Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber, interre their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>The homage done to the King, by any Dukes or other Perſons of higher Rank, holding their Lands, or <hi>Seignieuries</hi> of his Majeſty, was antiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Bed-Chamber, whither being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Great Chamberlain, Bare-headed, and without Sword, Belt, or Spurs; and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, and putting their hands between the Kings Hands, they promiſed him Fealty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
                  <p>Of which Ceremony, we have a fair Example, in <hi>Froiſſard,</hi> in the <hi>25th</hi> Chapter of the Firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of his Hiſtory, namely, in the Homage done by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third King of <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> to whom being brought in, and in the poſture as aforeſaid, the Great Chamberlain-ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered theſe words: <hi>You become the Liege-Man of the King, my Lord, that here is, (as Duke of</hi> Guienne, <hi>and Peer of</hi> France) <hi>and you promiſe Fealty and Loyalty to him, to bear:</hi> Say, <hi>Yes:</hi> And the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as Duke of <hi>Guienne,</hi> anſwered, <hi>Yes, and the King received him for his Liege-Man:</hi> Thus <hi>Froiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard,</hi> who likewiſe tells us, that this Homage had better have been let alone, it being ſo Stomached by that Couragious King, that it cauſed thoſe long and bloody Wars between the two Nations, of which all Hiſtories reſound, and which are hardly yet well extinct, but lie couched under Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, till opportunity ſhall raiſe them into new Flames.</p>
                  <p>At preſent, when any Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                     <p>There are four Officers that are called the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or Chief <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi> which laſt Title, though omitted in their Patents, was ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them by a Brief from his Majeſty. Their places are worth counting all things, about 2000. Crowns a Year. They ſerve indifferently, as they can agree, one in the place of another, and have all things common among them, though the Eldeſt uſually chuſes his Quarter. They perform ſeveral honourable Duties in the Chamber, as keeping the Door of the Council, and giving the accuſtomed Orders to the Uſhers, in the abſence of the Chief Gentlemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They lie at the Kings Beds Feet, and keep the Keys of his Trunks; They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed at preſent, in Money for their Table 1750 <hi>l.</hi> each.</p>
                     <p>Under theſe, there are thirty two other <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi> that ſerve quarterly, eight each Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, their Salary is 660 <hi>l.</hi> yearly; they diet at the Table, called the <hi>Valets de Chambrés</hi> Table.</p>
                     <p>The quality of Eſquires has been confirmed to them by ſeveral Orders, and particularly by an Order of the Council of State of the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1669. By which the <hi>Sieur de la Faye,</hi> one of the Kings <hi>Valets de Chamber,</hi> was maintained in the ſaid Quality of <hi>Eſquire.</hi> They perform ſeveral Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about the King, when he is Dreſſing, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing; as, giving him his Chair, holding his Morning-Gown, and putting it on his Shoulders, preſenting the Looking-Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They make the Kings Bed, the Upholſters ſtanding at the Beds-Feet to help them. The <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> that is in Waiting, is to keep all day within the Rails of the <hi>Alcove,</hi> to watch the Kings Bed. They are to ſee the Officer of the Goblet taſt the Wine and Bread that he brings up to the Kings Chamber, before it

is preſented to his Majeſty: When the Court is on the march in the Country, one of the <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi> goes before, to conduct the Kings Bed; and is then allowed a Crown a Day Extraordinary. When the King quits only for a few days, any of his Royal Palaces, the <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> that ſtays there, to keep the Kings Bed, is allowed a Crown a Day for his Diet.</p>
                     <p>The three <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi> that wait on the Dauphin, have each of them likewiſe, a Crown a Day for their Diet.</p>

If any ſpeak too loud in the Chamber, the Uſher Commands Silence. They carry Flambo's overlaid with Vermilion gilt, before his Majeſty, when he goes out or in any where, or from Chamber to Chamber, or when he goes up or down Stairs, in any of the Apartments of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> but when he goes any further into the Courts, they quit him at the Door, and leave only the Pages to light him, to whom it only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.</p>

The Uſhers have the Priviledge, to wait with their Swords by their ſides, and their Cloaks on their Shoulders.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Annual Feſtivals, and on all Dayes of Solemnity, as at <hi>Te Deums,</hi> on the Dayes of the Kings Majority, Coronation, or Marriage, when he touches for the Evil, when he follows the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, when he fits on his Bed of Juſtice in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or at the Creation of the Knights of his Orders, and at all the Kings firſt Entries into any Towns, two of theſe Uſhers carry before his Majeſty two ſilver guilt Maces, letting the tops of the ſaid Maces, lean gently on their Shoulders; and every time they carry theſe Maces, there is due to them a Fee of 150 <hi>l.</hi> which is punctually paid them, by expreſs Order, at the <hi>Treaſure-Royal:</hi> But when the King goes to Parliament, beſides the 150 <hi>l.</hi> they have out of the Treaſure Royal, the Chief Preſident Orders a like ſumme to be paid them out of the Fines. In like manner, at the Kings firſt Entry into any Cities, there is due to them from the Officers of the ſaid Town, a Mark of Gold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the value of 400 <hi>l.</hi> beſides their ſaid conſtant Fee of 150 <hi>l.</hi> out of the Treaſure Royal.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two Maces are carried every where after the King in the Cheſts of the Wardrobe. At Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and Creations of Knights, the two Uſhers that bear the Maces, are habited in white Sattin Doublets, with Sleeves ſlaſhed in ſeveral rows, and their Shifts ſwelling out of the ſaid ſlaſhes, with Trunk-Breeches, and Cloaks of the ſame, with ſilk Pearl-Colour'd Stockings, Shoes covered with white Sattin, and white Velvet, or Sattin Caps, or Bonnets. They have their ſhare in the Fees and Preſents given by Governours and Lieutenants, of Towns or Provinces, Great Officers of the Crown, and thoſe of the Kings Houſhold, the Chief Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Parliaments, the <hi>Eſchevins,</hi> or Sheriffs of <hi>Paris,</hi> or others, when at their ſeveral admiſſions,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95022:64"/>
they take the Oath of Fidelity to his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the Uſhers Duty, to make them that are in the Chamber get out of the way, whether it be to keep them from ſtanding in his Majeſties light, when he is Dreſſing, or Undreſſing him, or to clear his paſſage when he goes from his Chair to his Praying-Desk, from that to his Cloſet, or when he goes from one ſide of his Chamber to the other.</p>
                     <p>No Body ought to have his Hat on in the Kings Bed-Chamber, though it be at certain hours when there is but two or three Officers there. And the Uſhers are to ſee too, that no Body Combs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there, or ſit down upon the Seats, the Table, or the Rails of the Alcove. They have their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary at the old Table of the Great Maſter, which is now that of the Maſters of the Houſhold, and thoſe four that are in Waiting, have every day to their Breakfaſt, a Bottle of Wine, and a Loaf; They are allowed every day out of the Eruitry, a Flambo of white Wax of half a pound weight.</p>
                     <p>On Council-Days, if the Council be held in the Bed-Chamber, they go from his Majeſty, to give notice to the Secretaries of State, and in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the chief <hi>Valets de Chambreſ,</hi> they keep the Doors of the Council-Chamber. They have the Honour to carry in their Arms the Children of <hi>France,</hi> during their Infancy.</p>
                     <p>The two Uſhers of the Chamber, that wait at the Dauphins, have each of them a Crown a day for their Diet; one of the four Uſhers that are in Waiting at the Kings, goes every day and waits on the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and he that ſtays with that Prince, in the Kings abſence, has a Crown a Day for his Diet: and the Officers of the Kings <hi>Counting-Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Green-Cloth,</hi> diminiſh ſo much as his Ordinary comes to, at the Table, he ſhould otherwiſe eat it, and diſcount it to his Majeſties profit. Another Uſher likewiſe appointed to wait

on the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> has the like allowance, which will be the rule for all the Children the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin ſhall have.</p>
                     <p>When the Uſher asks any one, that would come in, his Name, whoever he be, he ought not to take it ill, becauſe he is obliged by his Office, to know who he lets in.</p>
                     <p>It is to be obſerved, that any perſon that would enter into the Bed-Chamber, the Anti-Chamber, and the Cloſets, when the Doors are ſhut, muſt ſcratch gently at the Door, and not knock hard, and when he would go out, he is not to open the Door himſelf, but to call to the Uſher to open it for him.</p>
                     <p>When the King, any Queens, Children of <hi>France,</hi> and their Wives, or any Ambaſſadors, that go to, or come from Audience, come in or go out of the Chamber, the Uſher preſently opens to them both the Leaves of the Door, the ſame is done by the Uſher of the Anti-Chamber, and by the Sentinel at the Door of the Guard-Chamber.</p>
                     <p>There are beſides, two Uſhers of the Cloſet, that wait ſix Months each, who have 660 <hi>l.</hi> Salary, and a gratuity of 600 <hi>l.</hi> at the Treaſure Royal. They eat at the Maſters of the Houſholds Table.</p>
                     <p>If on a Council-Day, the Council be held in any of the Cloſets, then 'tis the Uſher of the Cloſets Duty, to give notice of it from the King, to the Secretaries of State.</p>
                     <p>There two Uſhers of the Anti-Chamber, who have a yearly Salary of 500 <hi>l.</hi> each. They eat at the <hi>Valets de Chambrés</hi> Table, and are allowed Bread and Wine too for their Breakfaſt.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>New-years-tide,</hi> the Queen, when there is one, gives for a New-Years Gift, 4 <hi>l</hi> to the Uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a 100 <hi>l.</hi> at each Station, that is to ſay 100 <hi>l.</hi> among the Uſhers of the Anti-Chamber, as much to him that keeps the Cloſet, and as much among thoſe of the Bed-Chamber.

that keeps the Cabinet that day, and that is in waiting the firſt half year beginning in <hi>January,</hi> has as much alone, as the two Uſhers of the Anti-Chamber, and the four Uſhers of the Bed-Chamber.

                     <p>There is at preſent but one Great Maſter of the Wardrobe. He has likewiſe the Honour to have place in his Majeſties Coach. He has by way of Salary, together with other allowances, 19600 <hi>l.</hi> yearly.</p>
                     <p>He has the Charge of the Kings Cloths, Linnen, and Shoes and Stockings, and what he leaves off he has for his Fees.</p>
                     <p>In the abſence of the Princes, the Great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, and the Chief Gentlemen of the Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he gives the King his Shirt, and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when his Majeſty Dreſſes himſelf, he puts on his Waſt-Coat, his Blue-Ribban, and his ſtrait Coat, and preſents him his Sword, and at Night when he is going to Bed, he preſents him his Night Waſtcoat, Cap, and Handkercher, and asks him what Cloths he pleaſes to wear the next day.</p>
                     <p>You are to take notice, That the Kings Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher is always preſented him upon a Vermilion guilt Salver, which is a kind of Plate-Stand.</p>

They are likewiſe preſent at Audiences of Ambaſſadours, and mount upon the higheſt part of the Cloth of State. He of them that is in waiting, has an Apartment in the Kings Lodgings. In the Morning when the King riſes, he preſents him his Cravat, his Gloves, his Cane and his Hat. The King himſelf empties the Pockets of the Suit he leaves off, into thoſe of the Suit he intends to put on, but the Maſter of the Wardrobe is to hold thoſe Pockets to him while he empties them. At Night, when the King goes out of his Cloſet, the Maſter of the Wardrobe waits for him at the Door, and takes his Gloves, his Cane, his Hat, his Belt and Sword.</p>

                     <p>This Muſick ſerves the King commonly at Nights when he goes to Bed, and at his Dinner; and at Hymns of Praiſes and Thanks Sung on Feſtival Days, and on <hi>Corpus-Chriſti</hi> Day, they alone Play and Sing at the repoſing Altars erected for that Solemnity.</p>
                     <p>At great Ceremonies, it joins with the Chappel-Muſick, as at the Kings Coronation, and Marriage, at the Creation of Knights, at Funeral Pomps and Tenebras, and is placed always on the ſide of the Epiſtle.</p>

                     <p>The laſt King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. having exiled one of theſe Gentlemen, and given his place to another, the Queen <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> being Regent, re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht him that was Exiled, without Diſcarding the other that held his place, ſo that, and ſince that, another place was added, by way of recompenſe, to a Gentleman for Voyages he had made to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> both which places are ſtill continued, ſo that there are at preſent 26, but the number to which <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. reduced them, was but 24.</p>
                     <p>They ought to keep near the Kings Perſon, to receive his Commands; and when the King has any buſineſs to negotiate in Foreign Countries, any Troops to be conducted to the Army, or to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of into Winter-Quarters; when he has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to have his pleaſure Communicated in the Provinces of his Kingdom, and in the Parliaments and Soveraign Courts, he commonly makes uſe of theſe Gentlemen in Ordinary. He likewiſe makes uſe of them in all Complements of Congratulation or Condoleance he has a mind to ſend to other Kings and Sovereign Princes upon any ſubject of Joy or Affliction befallen them; or when he would ſound their intentions in any actions that ſeem to have been done by their Miniſters, and owned by them; as alſo when he is pleaſed ſo far to honour any of the Princes and great Lords of his Kingdom, ſo far as to ſend to viſit them, or to preſent them

When the King goes to the Army, they have the honour to be his <hi>Aids de Camp,</hi> and if any Priſoners of note be taken, his Majeſty charges them with the Conduct of them ſo far as to the Fortreſſes where his pleaſure is to have them kept. They are alſo appointed by the King to attend on Princes and Princeſſes Exiled, that come into <hi>France.</hi> At the Funeral Solemnities of any Children of <hi>France,</hi> they have the Honour to hold up the Corners of the Pall. The King uſually commits to them the Government of ſome young Prince or other.</p>
                     <p>They have every of them a Salary of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a year which is paid them at the Treaſure-Royal, upon an eſtabliſhment apart.</p>
                     <p>They had formerly too, a Table to themſelves; but at preſent they eat at the old Table of the Great Maſter, otherwiſe called the Table of the Maſters of the Houſhold.</p>
                     <p>They had once a Chief over them, who was the Conſtable of <hi>Luynes,</hi> who had been one of them, but they deſired his Majeſty, they might have no more.</p>
                     <p>Nor has this Order of Gentlemen onely produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced one Conſtable, but ſeveral Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> and Knights of the King Orders; as the Marſhal <hi>de Toiras,</hi> the Marſhal <hi>de Marillac,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe in all Books of Eſtabliſhments made for the Kings Houſhold, the Phyſicians and other Officers relating to the preſervation or recovery of health, are always placed next after thoſe of the Chamber; we ſhall therefore obſerve the ſame Order, and ſpeak now</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Great Maſter of the Horſe, and of the Kings Stables.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Preſent Great Maſter of the Horſe is <hi>Louis de Lorrain</hi> Count of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> his Standing Salary is 3600 <hi>l.</hi> beſides which, he has 2400 <hi>l.</hi> Board-Wages, upon the Eſtabliſhment of the Great Stables, and 6000 <hi>l.</hi> Board-Wages more, upon the Eſtabliſhment of the Chamber of <hi>Deniers;</hi> and many other Fees and Perquiſites.</p>
                  <p>It was formerly the Great, or High <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <note place="margin">Antiquity of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> 
                     <hi>France,</hi> that had the Super-intendance over the Kings Stables, who therefore was called <hi>Comes Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli,</hi> that is, Count of the Stable; but when that Great Officer came to be entruſted with the general Command of the Armies, the Care of the Kings Horſes was wholly left to him who then was called <hi>Eſcuier,</hi> that is, Uſher or Squire, who was an Officer, that under the ſaid Count of the Stable, or Conſtable, took care of the Horſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:95022:78"/>
For ſome time, there were ſeveral of theſe Squires, or Maſter of the Horſe, of equal Command in the Kings Stables, as in the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the Long, when there was no Great Maſter, but only four Maſters of the Horſe entred in the <hi>Book of the Eſtabliſhment;</hi> for though the ſame King in 1319. made one <hi>Henry de Braybant,</hi> Great and Chief Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of his Stables, yet he had not the Title of Great Maſter, neither do we find any mention of the ſaid Title, till the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, who made <hi>Pothon de Saintrailles,</hi> and <hi>Tanneguy du Chatel,</hi> Great Squires, or Maſters of the Horſe of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Great Maſter of the Horſe, or Grand Squire, <note place="margin">Preſent Functions and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note> or Querry of <hi>France</hi> (for ſo his Title imports in <hi>French,)</hi> carries, as a Mark of his Office, the Royal Sword in the Scabbard, with the Belt, both which are covered with Purple-Velvet, ſet with <hi>Flower deluces</hi> of Maſſy Gold, and the Handle of it is of Maſſy Gold, with <hi>Flower-deluces</hi> of the ſame: the Buckles of the Belt are likewiſe of Gold: And he bears the Figure of the ſaid Sword on each ſide of his Coat of Arms.</p>
                  <p>He takes the Oath of Fidelity to the King Himſelf, <note place="margin">Oath.</note> and he receives it from almoſt all the reſt of the Officers of the Stables.</p>
                  <p>He has, by his place, the power of Depoſing of almoſt all the vacant Offices in the great and little Stable, of the <hi>Haras,</hi> or Nurſery of Horſes, and their Dependencies: As of the Places of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Horſe, or Querries of his Majeſties Great Stable, of Bearers of the Swords of State, of Heralds, and Purſuivants at Arms, of Cloak-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, and Carriers of <hi>Gabans,</hi> or Felt-Coats, or Cloaks, of Governour, Under-Governour, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Pages of the Stables, of the Almoners, Chief <hi>Valets,</hi> Harbingers, Coach-men, Farriers, Great Foot-men, Grooms, and other places of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that actually ſerve in the great and little Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95022:78"/>
and in the <hi>Haras,</hi> or Nurſery of Horſes; of the Ordinary and Extraordinary Riders of both Stables; of the Hoboys, Violins, Bag-Pipers, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters, Drummers, and Flutes, and of all Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Workmen, that make or furniſh any thing to either of the Kings Stables. And though the Great Maſter happen to be imployed elſewhere, out of Court, or out of <hi>France</hi> it ſelf; nay, though he ſhould happen to fall under the Kings Diſpleaſure, and be made a Priſoner of State, yet till the very Day of his Death, he has ever been known to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the power of Diſpoſing of the ſaid places; the Reſpect of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> to the dignity of this Office being ſo great, that they have not yet taken it from any in poſſeſſion of it, till they took their Lives; as was well ſeen in the time of the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, during the Diſgrace of <hi>Monſieur de Belle-garde,</hi> and the Impriſonment of <hi>Monſieur de Cinq-mars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Great Maſter of the Horſe, has the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Monies allowed for the Expences of the Kings Stables, and Nurſery of Horſes, as likewiſe for the maintenance of the Gentlemen-Querries, Pages and Officers ſerving, and retained in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and of the Great-Horſes, Race-Horſes, and Horſes belonging to the Kings Coaches and Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons; and for the Wages, Fees, Gratuities, and Payments of all the Officers of the Stables, and of the Merchants or Tradeſmen, for neceſſaries they have furniſhed for any uſe thereunto belonging; as alſo for Liveries and other Cloths order'd for any of the ſaid Officers; and for the <hi>Hoquetons,</hi> or Coats, Strait-Coats, and Cloaks of the Kings Life-guard-men, for the Coats of his Guard of 100 <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> for the Strait-Coats of Guards of the Gate, for the Coats called <hi>Hoquetons</hi> of the Guards, of the Provoſt of the Houſhold, and for the Campagn-Coats of the Musketeers; and laſtly, for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of Coaches, Waggons, and Coverings of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95022:79"/>
Mules of the Kings Chamber, and of the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>All the Officers above-named are ſworn by him, and cannot enjoy any Priviledges and Exemptions annexed to their places, till they be Entred upon the Eſtabliſhments that are fixed and ſigned by him.</p>
                  <p>No Querry, or Profeſſor of Horſemanſhip, can ſet up an Academy to inſtruct young Gentlemen in Warlike Exerciſes, or any other things proper for noble perſons to learn, without the Order and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Great Querry, or Maſter of the Horſe of <hi>France,</hi> firſt obtained.</p>
                  <p>The Office of Poſt-Maſter General was annexed to that of Great Maſter of the Horſe, but was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred from it by <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſo, being at preſent enjoyed by the Great Secretary of State, <hi>Monſieur Louvois,</hi> who has, as Poſt-Maſter General, 1200 <hi>l.</hi> a year Board-Wages, paid at the Chamber of <hi>Deniers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The late King had once promiſed <hi>Monſieur Cinq-mars,</hi> then Great Maſter of the Horſe, to re-annex the Poſt-Maſters Office to that of the Great Maſter of the Horſe; but the ſaid <hi>Monſieur Cinq-mars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards Impriſoned and Executed for High-Treaſon, that intention came to nothing.</p>
                  <p>The Great Maſter of the Horſe has the Honour to have place in his Majeſties Coach, next the Princes of the Blood; and when he is abroad on Horſeback, he rides next his Perſon. He makes uſe of the Pages, Footmen and Horſes of the Kings Stables, at his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>When the King is on the march for any Warlike Expedition, or in the Body of an Army, the Great Stable is lodged neareſt him, before the little Stable, but in any Journey, wherein he marches not upon any Warlike deſign, nor in a Body of an Army; the little Stable is placed neareſt his Majeſties Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:95022:79"/>
When the King makes his firſt Entry on Horſe-back; into any City within his Kingdome, or into any Conquered Town, where he is to be received with great Ceremony, the Great Maſter of the Horſe rides directly before the Kings Perſon, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his Majeſties Royal Sword in a Sheath of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Velvet, ſet with <hi>Flower-deluces</hi> of Maſſy Gold, hung in a Belt of the ſame Stuff and Colour, and on a Horſe Capariſon'd with the ſame. And the Canopy born over his Majeſties Head; on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is his Fee.</p>
                  <p>He rode in this manner, at the Solemnity made for the Majority, and at the Entry of their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties into <hi>Paris;</hi> and it is to be noted likewiſe, that at the Ceremony of the Majority, he took his Seat in the <hi>Palais,</hi> or Parliament-Houſe, on the right hand of the Great Chamberlain, who always ſits at the Feet of the Kings Bed of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>He alſo bears the ſaid Sword at Funeral Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. At the publick Entries of Kings, and other great Solemnities.</p>
                  <p>He Orders the Trumpeters, Hoboys, Violins, Flutes, Tabourins, Sackbuts, Cornets and Drums, to ſound and Play, for the greater State and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>At the Kings Death, all the Horſes of the Stables and Nurſery, and all the Harneſs and Furniture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, fall to the Great Maſter of the Horſe.</p>
                  <p>Every time the King Orders any Money for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any new Coaches for himſelf, he grants out a Warrant for a thouſand Crowns, to the Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Horſe, for a new Coach for him too.</p>
                  <p>All new Horſes that are brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> do, or ought to go and do homage to the King, at his Great Stables, that is, ought firſt to be carried and ſhown to the Great Maſter of the Horſe, before they are offred to Sale, who retains ſuch of them,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95022:80"/>
as he thinks his Majeſty may have need of, or that may be uſeful for his Service; paying very juſtly a good price for them to the Owners.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Great Marſhal of the Lodgings, or Knight-Harbinger, and of the other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals of the Lodgings, and Harbingers.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE <hi>Great Marſhal of the Lodgings</hi> is <hi>Monſieur Lewis Doger de Cavoye;</hi> he has 3000 <hi>l.</hi> Salary, 4000 <hi>l.</hi> Board-Wages at the Chamber of <hi>Deniers, 600 l.</hi> a Month extraordinary allowance, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other perquiſites.</p>
                  <p>His Office is, to receive the Kings Orders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Lodging, and thoſe of his Court, and to communicate them to the other Marſhals of the Lodgings and Harbingers.</p>
                  <p>There are twelve Marſhals of the Lodgings, or chief Harbingers, who have every one a Salary of 800 <hi>l.</hi> a yearly gratuity of 400 <hi>l.</hi> and 900 <hi>l.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; and when the Court is on the march, a hundred pence a day for their Diet, which is paid them from the day they have Orders to ſet out. They ſerve quarterly, three every quarter, and in the time of their Waiting, have their Diet at three different Tables; the firſt at the old Table of the Great Maſter, the ſecond at the Table of the Maſters of the Houſhold, and the third at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners Table. They have beſides, in the Armies, every one their <hi>rations,</hi> or allowances of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Bread.</p>
                  <p>They are ſworn by the Great Marſhal of the Lodgings, or Knight-Harbinger, and bear in the Kings Houſe Canes after the faſhion of a Majors Staff, or elſe a Staff garniſhed with Silver at top and bottom, with the Arms of his Majeſty on the Pommel, and this Inſcription, <hi>N..... Marſhal of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95022:94"/>
the Kings Lodgings.</hi> The Staff of the Great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of the Lodgings is garniſhed with Silver, both on the handle and the top, having on the Pommel or Handle, the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> and the reſt of the Handle ſet with <hi>Flower-deluces,</hi> wrought in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</p>
                  <p>Three Marſhals of the Lodgings, or chief Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers, and four other Harbingers, when they come out of Waiting with the King, enter into Waiting with the Dauphin, and have there the ſame allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they had with the King.</p>
                  <p>There were formerly four Harbingers of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but they were ſuppreſſed in 1680. in whoſe room, the King eſtabliſhed eight Harbingers in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, quarterly Waiters, who wait two every quarter, ſo that whereas there were before but forty, there are now forty eight Harbingers quarterly Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſerving by twelve a quarter, which have every of them, a Salary of 240 <hi>l. 120 l.</hi> gratuity, 450 <hi>l.</hi> extraordinary, and when the Court is on the march, a Crown a day for their Diet, from the day they ſet out; and in the Armies their <hi>rations</hi> of Ammunition-Bread.</p>
                  <p>The places of all theſe are in the Kings Gift, and they are all ſworn by the Great Marſhal, or Knight-Harbinger of the Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of every quarter, the three Marſhals of the Kings Lodgings in Waiting, agree together, to ſeparate the twelve Harbingers for that quarter into three Bands, allotting four to each Band.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One of theſe Harbingers, who is ordinarily the eldeſt or Foreman, makes according to the ſtile of this Court, the Body, or the Groſs, that is to ſay, 'tis he, that in the preſence of the Marſhal of the Lodgings, or chief Harbinger, marks out with Chalk; Firſt, The Kings, or the Kings and Queens joint Apartments. Secondly, The Offices. Thirdly, The eating Halls, or Dining-rooms, and Fourthly,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95022:94"/>
The Apartments of thoſe that are preferred in the Kings Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By the Kings Apartments, are meant, the Kings Bed-Camber, Anti-Chamber, Cloſet, Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, Guard-Chamber, and other neceſſary Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Kings or Queens perſons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By the Offices, are meant the ſeven Offices, as the Goblet, the Kitchin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> afore-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By the Eating-Halls, or Dining-rooms, are meant, the Hall of the new Table of the Great Maſter, otherwiſe called the Hall of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Duke; and that of the Great Chamberlains Table; which two Tables ought to be within the Kings Lodgings, when there is room enough, or elſe, as near as may be: Next the Hall of the Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters old Table, and that of Maſters of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholds, which are ſometimes called the firſt and ſecond Tables of the ſaid Maſters; The <hi>Serdeau's</hi> Hall, or the Kings voiding Hall, the Almoners Hall, the Quarterly Waiters, <hi>Valets de Chambers,</hi> or Bed-Chamber-mens Hall: There was likewiſe the Chief <hi>Valets de Chambres,</hi> or Bed-Chamber-mens Hall, but it was taken away on the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1681.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Under the name of the Preferred in the Kings Lodgings, are comprehended, the Great or High Chamberlain, the Chief-Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, the Great Maſter of the Wardrobe, the Captain of the Guards, and the Maſter of the Wardrobe. In caſe the Lodging be ſo ſcanty, that after the King is Lodged, there remain but one ſingle Apartment, the Captain of the Guards ought to have the preference of it before all others, and if there remain two, then the Chief-Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber is to have the Firſt, and the Captain of the Guards the ſecond; but if there be three, then the Great Chamberlain is to have the preference before the two others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:95022:95"/>
When the Queen marches with the King, the Marſhals, or chief Harbingers of the Kings Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, after they have given Order for marking out Apartments for the Queen, are to cauſe other Apartments to be Chalked out in their Majeſties Lodgings, for her Ladies, in this Order; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, For the Super-intendant, or Stewardeſs of the Queens Houſhold. Secondly, For the Lady of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Thirdly, For the Tire-Woman, or Dreſſing-Lady. Fourthly, For the Ladies of the Palace. Fifthly, For the Chief-Gentlewoman of the Bed-Chamber. And ſixthly, For the other Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Bed-Chamber: And if after the Queen be lodged, there remain but one Apartment more, then the Chief-Gentlewoman of the Bed-Chamber, ought to have it before any of the other Ladies, and Female-Officers.</p>
                  <p>The Harbinger which makes the Body, when there is room enough, marks out to in the ſame Houſe, Apartments for the Chief-Phyſician, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion and Apothecary of the Body.</p>
                  <p>The Harbingers of the Queens Body, or of the Dauphins, or <hi>Monſieurs,</hi> cannot Chalk out any thing that belongs to that they call the ſervice of the Body: But it belongs to the Kings Harbinger that makes or heads the Body to do it, ſo that they cannot mark any places for the ſeven Offices, but thoſe that are appointed them by the Kings Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that makes the Body, that is, as is above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that is, the Eldeſt, or Foreman of the Band, or Company.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Harbinger is to take care to chalk out all the <hi>Ranks,</hi> and Preferred, without the Kings Lodgings: By the Ranks, are meant, Firſt, The Lodgings for the Princes. Secondly, For the Great Officers. Thirdly, For the Dukes and Peers. Fourthly, For the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, Miniſters of State, and other Perſons of Quality: And by the preferred without the Kings
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95022:95"/>
Lodgings, are meant thoſe Lords, or other Great Perſons, who are recommended to be lodged in the Town, by the Kings expreſs order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That the ſame Harbinger that makes the Body, very often marks to the Lodgings, for the Ranks, and aboveſaid preferred perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Harbinger marks out the Ordinary of the Kings Houſhold, that is, Lodgings for the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of it, <hi>viz.</hi> For the firſt or chief Almoner, for the chief Maſter of the Houſhold, for the Maſter of the Houſhold in Ordinary, for the Captain of the Guards of the Gate, for the Lieutenant and Enſigns of the Life-guards, and generally, for all the other Officers of the Kings Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>It often happens, that beſides the Harbinger that marks out the Stables in the Town, there is another that takes up Stables in the Neighbouring Villages, and provides Lodgings for the Equipages.</p>
                  <p>The King generally is prevail'd on, with much facility, to grant to the Marſhals of his Lodgings, and his other Harbingers, Reverſions of their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in favour not only of their Sons, but of their Grand-Sons, Sons-in-Law, Brother, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews.</p>
                  <p>He alſo grants them Briefs, impouring them to retain or ſtop a certain ſumm to be deducted out of the yearly Revenue of their places, and paid by their Succeſſours, for their Wives, if they have no Children, for their Daughters; if they have no Sons, or if they have neither Wives nor Children, for the younger Brethren of their Family.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt Entries made by Kings into any Cities of their Kingdom, the Officers of the Town are to pay a certain ſumm as a Fee, to the Marſhals and Harbingers of the Kings Lodgings, or elſe the one half of the profits of the Triumphal Arches, Porches, Tapiſtries, and all the Decorations, is to fall to the Marſhals, and the other to the Harbingers of the ſaid Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:95022:96"/>
The Marſhals of the Queens Lodgings, and of thoſe of the Dauphineſs, of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> of <hi>Madame,</hi> and the particular Harbingers of the Princes of the Bloud, of the Chancery, and of other Bodies, as alſo the Men or Meſſengers ſent by other Princes, Dukes and Peers, and other great Lords, to take up their Lodgings, receive their Quarters or Lodgings from the Marſhals and Harbingers in Ordinary of the Kings Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>Whenever <hi>Monſieur,</hi> or <hi>Madame,</hi> happen to be travelling in Company with the Queen, or the Dauphineſs, when the King is not there, then the Marſhals or Harbingers of the Queen or Dauphineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Lodgings, are to appoint <hi>Monſieurs,</hi> or <hi>Madams</hi> Harbingers, what Lodgings and Quarters they are to take up.</p>
                  <p>The Marſhals and Harbingers in Ordinary of the Kings Lodgings, are reputed to be of the Body of the Kings <hi>Gend'armes,</hi> or Men at Arms, as having been formerly drawn out of the antient Companies of the ſaid <hi>Gend'armes;</hi> and the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, (who under-ſtood exactly well the original of all the different Offices of his Houſhold) gave the Marſhals of his Lodgings place in, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated them into his Company of <hi>Gend'armes,</hi> at the Head of which, his Majeſty uſually fights on a day of Battel, or on any other occaſion; and made the Harbingers ſerve in his Company of Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, at the Siege of <hi>Corbie,</hi> to which ſervice he ſummoned all his whole Houſhold, that is, the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire-ban</hi> of his Houſhold, which he placed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in his Army.</p>
                  <p>This ſaid number of <hi>Gend'armes</hi> detached out of the antient Companies, was uſually ſent before, to provide Lodging and Quarters for his Majeſty, and the Troops that were with him: And ſtill to this day, the Marſhals of the Kings Lodgings, both in Town and Country, give out the Orders for the quartering of the <hi>French Life-guards,</hi> of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95022:96"/>
                     <hi>Suiſſers</hi> of the <hi>Gend'armes</hi> of the light Horſe, of the Musketeers, of the Regiments of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swiſſe-guards,</hi> when all the ſaid Troops at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the King in his march.</p>
                  <p>And in effect, the Marſhals of the Lodgings in <hi>France,</hi> are what the Quarter-Maſters are in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who riſe to the Higheſt Commands in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>The Marſhals and Harbingers of the Kings Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, were formerly likewiſe Marſhals or Quarter Maſters of the Camps and Armies, and the ſame perſons that provided Lodgings for the Kings Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, always took up Quarters to for the Armies, as have done ſeveral of them that are ſtill living: But ſome of their Body, in the time of the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, got themſelves made Marſhals, peculiarly of the Camps and Armies, and got Patents of it, as of a diſtinct Office; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, the Marſhals and Harbingers of the Lodgings of the Houſhold, ſerve ſtill in the Armies, either in the abſence of the others who have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, as is ſaid, for being Camp-Marſhals, or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Maſters, or when the number of theſe others is not ſufficient for all the Armies the King has on Foot. When the King is in an Army, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals of the Lodgings of his Houſhold, have privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to take at leaſt two thirds of the room, to lodge his Majeſty, and all the Officers of the Royal Houſes; and it was Ordered by the King, that the remaining third ſhould be diſpoſed of by the ſaid Marſhals of the Lodgings, or Quarter-Maſters of the Camps and Armies, for the general Officers and other Officers in the Army, neceſſary to be near his Majeſties Perſon: I ſay, the Marſhals of the Kings Lodgings have power to take up at leaſt two thirds for the King, becauſe, if after they have divided the whole into three equal parts, there ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main two, or but one Lodging over and above; thoſe one or two ſo over and above, or ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95022:97"/>
are to be taken up likewiſe for his Majeſty and his Court, that they may be ſcanted. As for Example, It is true, that where there is but thirty Lodgings, the Marſhals of the Lodgings of the Houſhold are to take but twenty, and the general Officers of the Army are to have the other ten; but of fifty Lodgings, or Lodgments, the Marſhals of the Kings Lodgings will take thirty four, and the general Officers of the Army will have but ſixteen, and of forty Lodgments, the Kings Marſhals will have twenty ſeven, and leave the general Officers but thirteen.</p>
                  <p>By the antient Order, according to the Rules made for that purpoſe, none but the Kings Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers can mark out Lodgings with white Chalk, thoſe of the Princes and others being obliged for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſake to mark out theirs with a yellow <hi>Crayon;</hi> with this further difference, that the Kings mark only is put upon the Street-Doors, and the others only upon the Doors of particular Chambers within ſide the Houſe.</p>

                     <p>In an Army, where the King is Preſent, the firſt Quarter is for him, or where he is not, for the General, and the next belongs to a Marſhal of <hi>France</hi> to chuſe, or if there be two Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> there together, then he that Commands that Day or Week, is to have the Choice, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they agree to Command by turns, one one Day, or one Week, and another another: But if there happen to be more than two together, without having any Command there, then they chuſe their Quarters according to their ſtanding; And next to the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> the Dukes and Peers take place; for in Armies, Dukes and Peers are Lodged always after Marſhals of <hi>France.</hi> But in following the Court, out of an Army, this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95022:97"/>
Order is obſerved; Firſt their Majeſties are Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then other Royal Perſons, then the Princes and Princeſſes, then the Great Officers of the Crown, after them the Dukes and Peers, and laſtly, the Marſhals of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Chancellour</hi> is Lodged next after the Princes, and in marking his Lodging, the word <hi>Pour,</hi> or <hi>for</hi> is uſed, the meaning of which, we have already explained; Beſides all which, which are called the Ranks, there are the Preferred, of which we have ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>The Marſhals and Harbingers of the Kings Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are alſo employed by his Majeſties ſpecial Command, to provide Lodgings for the Aſſemblies of the States General of the Kingdom, when any are called, or for the States of any particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, when the King is to be preſent at them; as likewiſe for the Aſſemblies of the Clergy, which is to be underſtood when they aſſemble in any other place but <hi>Paris,</hi> for there no Lodgings are marked for them.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe when the perſons compoſing any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Courts, or other publick Bodies, are to meet at <hi>St. Denis</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by the Kings Order, and according to Cuſtom, to aſſiſt at the Funeral Pomps or Solemnities made at the Burials, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary Services for Kings, Queens, and Princes, or Princeſſes of the Blood, or others, the Marſhals and Harbingers of the Kings Lodgings go thither ſome dayes before to provide them Lodgings.</p>
                     <p>The King too uſually ſends the ſaid Marſhals and Harbingers of his Lodgings, to meet Foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Princeſſes, that come into, or paſs through his Kingdom, to order and prepare Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for them every where as they paſs.</p>
                     <p>The Title and Quality of Squires has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and confirmed upon the Marſhals and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers in Ordinary of the Kings Lodgings, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Orders of the Council of State.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Judge of the Kings Court and Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, who is the Provoſt of the Houſhold, or Great Provoſt of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Provoſt of the Kings Houſhold, or Great Provoſt of <hi>France,</hi> is the ordinary Judge of the Kings Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>The Title of Great Provoſt implies two things: For firſt, He is Judge of the Kings Houſhold, and Secondly, He is Captain of a Company of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Guards, called the <hi>Guards of the Provoſtſhip,</hi> which is another part of his Office in the Kings Houſe: We ſhall ſpeak of him here only as in the firſt quality, reſerving the latter till we come to the Military Officers of the Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>His Office is one of the ancienteſt of the Kings Houſhold, and one may ſay, that in the Juriſdiction which he retains of adminiſtring Juſtice to all the Kings Officers, and other Perſons that follow the Court, he has ſucceeded the antient Count, or <hi>Mayor</hi> of the Palace, which was an Office that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with the Monarchy it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>He is ſworn by the King himſelf, and is received into the Great Council, where he takes place as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:95022:99"/>
He has the Priviledge to chuſe his Lodging after the Princes, Dukes and Peers, and Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> have choſen theirs; for which reaſon, he is called, the laſt in the Ranks.</p>
                  <p>He has a Salary of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and an annual Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of 8000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the Officers of the Provoſt-ſhip are received by his Majeſty upon the nomination of the Great Provoſt, and afterwards take out Letters from the King, under the Great Seal, directed to the Great Council, where they are admitted upon thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and qualified Judges.</p>
                  <p>The Great Provoſt Judges of all matters, both Civil and Criminal, hapning between the Officers of the Kings Houſhold among themſelves, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and others which are not ſo.</p>
                  <p>The Juriſdiction of the Provoſtſhip of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, is the ordinary Court of Juſtice for the Kings Houſhold, and therefore from the beginning was ordered to be kept in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> that ſo the Kings Officers, and others of his Court and Retinue, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their natural Judge within the Kings Houſe, might not be diverted from the ſervice of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; for ſome years, the place where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſts Court uſed to be kept, being taken up by the Queen-Mother, it was transferred to the <hi>Fort-Eveque,</hi> or <hi>Biſhops-Fort.</hi> At preſent, the Officers of the Provoſtſhip, have their Auditory, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of the Great Council-Chamber; there they have their Hall of Audience, their Council-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, their Civil and Criminal Records, or Regiſters, and there is the Office of the Uſhers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſtſhip.</p>
                  <p>The preſent King, by a Brief bearing date the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1658. declared, that he would ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Seat or Court of the Juriſdiction of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of the Houſhold, re-eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and that he would cauſe a convenient place there to be marked out, and ſet apart for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:95022:100"/>
The ſaid Court is kept there three times a Week, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Tueſday, Thurſday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday-</hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>People plead there by a Proctor, as in other Courts, but in a more ſummary and conciſe way. In civil matters there lies an Appeal from it, to the Great Council, but in matters Criminal, the Great Provoſt Judges without Appeal, as well as the Maſters of Requeſts, and thoſe of the Great Council.</p>
                  <p>The Officers of the Kings Houſhold, and thoſe of his Court and Retinue, may by ſpecial priviledge, bring all their Cauſes into this Court, whether they be Civil or Criminal, ſince the Court was chiefly erected in their favour: There needs no <hi>Committi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> to cite any one that belongs to, or follows the Court, but only an aſſignation, or warning, taken out of the Provoſts Court, by vertue of a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion out of the Regiſtry there. But as the ſaid perſons have the priviledge to bring their actions againſt their Debtors in this Court, or to appeal from their Proſecutors, thither they may do it, if they pleaſe, by vertue of their <hi>Committimus,</hi> and at their choice, bring their Cauſes, either before the Maſters of the Requeſts of the Palace, or of the Requeſts of the Houſhold, or before the Provoſt of the Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>The Great Provoſt only has power to apply Seals, make Inventories, and do all other acts of Juſtice in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and in the Galleries and other places thereunto belonging, and in other Royal Houſes within fourteen Leagues diſtance of <hi>Paris,</hi> as it was determined a Contradictory Sentence of the Council of the 25 of <hi>March</hi> 1650. given in favour of the Officers of the Provoſtſhip of the Houſhold, againſt the Officers of the <hi>Chatelet.</hi> He may alſo take cogniſance of all crimes and particular offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other Cauſes, <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> any way rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the people of the Court, and of the Kings
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95022:100"/>
Retinne, and belonging to the Royal Houſes, and againſt Vagabonds, and of ſeveral other Caſes, with the conſent and advice of the other Provoſts.</p>
                  <p>When he follows the Court any where, he Taxes and ſets a price upon all Proviſions, gives aſſiſtance for taking of Lodgings, if any reſiſtance be made, and doth other things neceſſary for the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there, by his Lieutenants of the Long Robe, or in their abſence, by the Lieutenants and Exempts of the ſhort Robe, who call to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, the Officers or Magiſtrates, and chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the place.</p>
                  <p>When the Court takes a Journey, the Great Provoſt Commands a ſufficient number of Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Handicrafts-men to follow it, to whom he grants Letters of Priviledge, by which they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to furniſh the Court, and its Retinue, with all neceſſaries, who are called the Priviledged Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and by vertue of the ſaid Letters, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to keep open Shop in <hi>Paris,</hi> or elſewhere, and enjoy ſeveral other Exemptions.</p>

                     <head>Of the Officers of Judicature belonging to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſtſhip of the Houſhold.</head>
                     <p>For the better adminiſtration of Juſtice to the Officers of the Kings Houſhold, and to the reſt of his Court and Retinue, the great Provoſt has under him two Lieutenants which are put in by the King, but named by the Great Provoſt, and are admitted as ſuch, in the Great Council, where they are ſworn.</p>
                     <p>There was formerly but one Lieutenant-General, the other being but a particular Lieutenant, but by an Edict of the Month of <hi>September,</hi> regiſtred in the Great Council the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> following, the King made theſe two Offices equal; ſo that at preſent, there are two Lieutenants-General for both Civil and Criminal matters, they have
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95022:101"/>
each of them 400 <hi>l.</hi> Salary, and 600 <hi>l.</hi> gratuity.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe exerciſes his Office the firſt ſix Months of the Year, where the Kings Court is, and the other ſix Months he keeps the Provoſts Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> within the Incloſure of the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Chamber when the King is abroad, and the Great-Council at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other ſerves the latter ſix Months of the Year at the Kings Court, and the firſt ſix Months keeps the Provoſts Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> for the cauſes of thoſe that are Officers of any Royal Houſes within his Precinct, and priviledged perſons and others.</p>
                     <p>So that there is always two Seats or Courts of Juſtice of the Great Provoſt, one at <hi>Paris,</hi> for the better expedition of the Cauſes of the Officers, and priviledged Perſons belonging to the Royal Houſes, and another where the Court is, when his Majeſty is not in <hi>Paris,</hi> as he never is to ſtay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That the two Lieutenants, the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and the Regiſter of the Provoſts Court, are allowed each of them, at the Salt-Granary at <hi>Paris,</hi> two <hi>Minots</hi> of Free-Salt, that is, for paying only ſome ancient Duties.</p>
                     <p>The Kings Proctor there, has a Salary of 400 <hi>l. 75 l.</hi> Augmentation-Money, and a gratuity of 1200 <hi>l.</hi> He ſerves all the year round, and has a Subſtitute.

in their abſence, by the Lieutenants and Exempts of the ſhort one, who only have power to take cogniſance of, and judge criminal Cauſes among the Kings Retainers, and in his Quarter.</p>
                     <p>All the Officers above-mentioned are Commoners or Tablers in the Kings Houſhold, and on the four chief Feſtivals of the year, are allowed Bread, Wine and Meat, Candles on <hi>Candlemas,</hi> and <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> days, and Prayer-Books and Cloth in the Holy Week.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo twelve Proctors called <hi>Poſtulants.</hi> One Chief Uſher, and twelve other Uſhers that wear the Kings Livery, and carry in their hands a blue Wand, with <hi>Flower-deluces</hi> at the end.

                  <p>The Great Maſter, Maſter and Aſſiſtant, or Aid of the Ceremonies, exerciſe their Offices jointly at Royal Solemnities, bearing in their hands, a Staff of Ceremony, covered with black Velvet, with the handle and top tipt with Ivory.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſiſtant of Ceremonies is alſo ſworn by the Great Maſter of the Houſhold.</p>

of the Ceremonies, go to carry any Order or Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to any of the Soveraign Courts, after they have ſaluted them, they take their place among the Counſellours, but with this difference, that if it be the Great Maſter of the Ceremonies himſelf, he takes place above the laſt Counſellour, but if it be the Maſter in Ordinary, or his Aid, he takes his Seat after them all; and then upon a ſign made to him by the chief Preſident, he ſpeaks to them from his Seat, with his Head covered, his Sword by his ſide, and his Staff of Ceremonies in his hand.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt and laſt Audiences of Ambaſſadours, the Great Maſter, the Maſter, or <hi>Aid</hi> of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, marches on the right hand of the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, a little before him, from the bottom of the Stairs, to the Guard-Chamber, where being come, he advances before him to give notice to his Majeſty.</p>

by him his <hi>Arquebuſe,</hi> or Arms-Bearer, that prepares him Arms ready charged. We have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned them among the Officers of the Chamber.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that when the Dogs are to run, the Captains of the Packs then to run, are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Staff or Wand, the mark of their Office, to the Great Hunter, and he, to the King; as alſo, when the Deer, or any other Game is taken, the Pricker cuts off the Foot, which he gives to his Captain, the Captain, to the Great Hunter, and he preſents it to the King.</p>
                     <p>There are beſides the Great Hunter, and thoſe under him, ſeveral other Captains of the Game eſtabliſhed in ſeveral Foreſts and Warrens, of which we have ſpoken in the Chapter of the Royal Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Houſes.</p>
                     <p>There is likewiſe a Lieutenant of the Long-Robe, belonging to the Court of Juſtice of the Captain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Waters and Foreſts.</p>
                     <p>The other Captains of Foreſts are to be ſeen at length, in the <hi>Sieur de Salnove</hi>'s Book of Hunting.</p>
                     <p>By a Declaration of the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1644. the King eſtabliſhed, beſides theſe, three General Keepers of the Game and Pleaſures of his Majeſty, throughout the whole extent of the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>

                        <p>One Maſter Falconer, at 300 <hi>l.</hi> five Prickers, at 250 <hi>l.</hi> and one <hi>Porte-Duc,</hi> or Decoy-Bearer, at 250 <hi>l.</hi>

                        <p>A ſecond Flight for the Kite,</p>
                        <p>With the ſame number of Officers, and like Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries and Appointments.</p>
                        <p>When the Captain of theſe Flights of Hawks, takes a black Kite, in the Kings Preſence, then he is to have the Kings Horſe, his looſe Gown, and his Slippers, for his Fees, which are redeemed of him for 100 Crowns, or about 25 <hi>l.</hi> Engliſh in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                        <p>The Flight at the Kite, is performed with <hi>Ger-Falcons, Tiercelets,</hi> or <hi>Taſſels,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> and there is always a <hi>Decoy</hi> to draw the Kite to a reaſonable height, to give him to the Hawks.</p>
                        <p>When after the Kite is taken, the Hawks, as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually, are to have their Fees given them with all the ſpeed imaginable, a Hen is put into their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and the Kites Legs broken, that he may not hurt them. The Kite is very rare in <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Of the Flight of Hawks for the Heron,</p>
                        <p>There is a Chief, or Captain, at 700 <hi>l.</hi> Salary, who is alſo Captain of the Guards, or Keepers of the Hawks-Neſts in <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Breſſe,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands over all the Flights, for Heron, throughout the Kingdom; a Lieutenant-<hi>Aid,</hi> and two Maſter Falconers. at 300 <hi>l.</hi> each, and eight Prickers, at 250 <hi>l.</hi> which amounts in all, to 3600 <hi>l.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Flight at the Heron, is performed with the ſame kind of Hawks as that at the Kite; it is done two ſeveral wayes;</p>
                        <p>To make the Herons Mount when there found on the ground, two or three Piſtols, or Fowling-Pieces are let off, to force them to riſe, and then a Bird is let fly at him, which is called in <hi>French, Hauſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piéd,</hi> or a <hi>Raiſe-Foot,</hi> and when he is mounted a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95022:109"/>
good height, other Birds are let out, which go and fight with the <hi>Hauſſe-piéd,</hi> and draw the Heron downward; thene are always ſhagged Grey-hounds in readineſs too, bred up to this ſort of Game, to go into the Water, and fetch the Heron to the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner, when it fall there, or to kill him when he falls on dry ground, for fear he ſhould hurt the Hawks; this firſt Heron being thus killed, whilſt the Falconers of the firſt Flight are curing their Hawks, and giving them their uſual Fees, other Falconers, who are to have a ſecond Flight always ready, are to let them fly at the other Herons, which commonly keep hovering over the place where they are curing or feeding their Hawks: the ſecond way is, to flie Hawks at the Heron in her paſſage, as they term it, that is, at a reaſonable height, while ſhe is going to, or coming from Fiſhing, to her young ones. When a Heron is diſcovered upon the ground, or upon the Wing, the uſual cry is, <hi>à la Volte,</hi> that is, to the Vault.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There are two Flights for the Crow, of the firſt of which, there is</p>
                        <p>A Captain, at 700 <hi>l.</hi> a Lieutenant-Aid, and a Maſter Falconer, at 300 <hi>l.</hi> each, twenty Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, at 250 <hi>l.</hi> apiece, which amounts in all to 6300 <hi>l.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of the ſecond Flight, there is likewiſe,</p>
                        <p>A Captain, at 700 <hi>l.</hi> a Lieutenant-Aid, at 300 <hi>l.</hi> ſeven Prickers, at 250 <hi>l.</hi> each, a Decoy-Bearer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting in all, to 3000 <hi>l.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Flight at the Crow is performed with a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, or a <hi>Taſſel</hi> of a <hi>Gerfalcon.</hi> The Crow is inticed and drawn into the Plain with a <hi>Decoy,</hi> and as ſoon as ſhe is got into the Plain, the Falconers cry out, <hi>Corneille en bean,</hi> that is, the Crow flies fair, and then as the Crow turns back on the <hi>Decoy,</hi> they commonly let flie at her, firſt a Taſſel of a <hi>Gerfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> which is the Guide, and then two Falcons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. The Crow being attacked, endeavours to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95022:109"/>
ſave her ſelf, either by ſoaring aloft, or retiring towards her hold; when ſhe ſoars aloft, no luring, or any other term is to be uſed; and when ſhe gets to her hold, if ſhe can be forced out of it, then the cry is, <hi>Hal, Hal, Hal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is one Flight for the Fields, or for the Partridge, to which belong,</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Flight for the Fields, or at the Partridge, is performed with Falcons, Taſſels of Falcons, Sakers, Sakerets, Lanners, Lannerets, Alets, Goſhawks, Taſſels of Goſhawks, Spar-Hawks, Taſſel Sper-Hawks, Merlins, and Malots. There are two ways of flying at the Partridge; firſt, with a ſort of Hawks that turn and maintain the flight along with the Dogs, and that will hold out half a League out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, continually upon the Wing; Secondly, with Hawks called <hi>Blockers,</hi> which are let fly as ſoon as the Partridges riſe, and drive them full ſweep to their hold, where they light upon a Branch, or on the top of a Houſe, and where the Falconer goes and ſerves them with Dogs. Every time the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge riſes, the cry is, <hi>Guereaux.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. A Flight for the River, or at the Duck, to which belong</p>
                        <p>A Captain, or Chief, at 500 <hi>l.</hi> a Lieutenant <hi>Aid,</hi> at 300 <hi>l.</hi> and four Prickers, at 250 <hi>l.</hi> each, which amounts in all, to 1800 <hi>l.</hi>

                        <p>The Birds that are uſed for the Flight at the Duck, are the ſtrong Hawks, and Haggard Hawks, that are let flie into a Moat, or Brook where Ducks are. Firſt, the cunningeſt and moſt ſtaid Bird is let flie to chaſe the Change, and then two others, and when they are well turned, the Ducks are let out which the Hawks knock on the Head, or force into another Moat. Every time the Ducks move away, the cry is, <hi>Ila, Ila, Ila,</hi> or <hi>Stou, Stou, Stou,</hi>
                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:95022:110"/>
like the <hi>Flemings,</hi> and for fear any ſhould go too nigh the Water, they cry, <hi>hors l'eau,</hi> that is, keep off the Water.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. A Flight for the Mag-Pie, to which belong</p>
                        <p>A Captain, or Chief, at 500 <hi>l.</hi> and two Prickers, at 250 <hi>l.</hi> each.</p>
                        <p>The Flight at the Mag-Pie is performed with Taſſels of Gerfalcons. Firſt, the moſt beaten and ſtaid Taſſel is let fly to chaſe likewiſe the change, and then the other Hawks are let out, and the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is ſhown them, that endeavours to ſave her ſelf from Tree to Tree, or from Buſh to Buſh, from which ſhe is forced away, and every time ſhe is forced out, the cry is, <hi>Hoüya, Hoüya.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In ſpeaking of the Flight at the Mag Pie, Pigeon, or Crow, by the term of chacing the change, is meant forcing the ſaid ſeveral Birds out of the Plain.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. A Flight for the Hare, to which belong</p>
                        <p>A Captain, or Chief, at 500 <hi>l.</hi> a Lieutenant-Aid, at 300 <hi>l.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Flight at the Hare is performed with a Ger-falcon, and any ſorry Greyhound to help the Hawk ſometimes.</p>

                        <p>The Merlins are made uſe of to flie at the young Partridge, whilſt the light Hawks are mewing or caſting their Feathers; they are uſed likewiſe for the Quail, the Black-bird, the Sky-Lark, and other ſmall Birds, as likewiſe to fly at the Pigeon Brow-ſtrung.</p>
                        <p>The Flight with the Merlins is particular to the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95022:111"/>
Kings Cabinet, being in no other Royal Falconry but that of the Cabinet. This Flight is performed from the Fiſt, that is, when they are minded to let flie at a young Partridge, they attack her not till the Dogs have raiſed her, and there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the way of flying this little Bird, and the Falcon called a <hi>Blocker,</hi> but only that one may carry a Merlin without Hood-winking, upon the Fiſt, whereas a Falcon muſt be always carried Hood-winked, whether it be let flie one way or the other. In flying at the Black-Bird, and other ſmall Birds, they uſe Poles to beat them out of the Hedges, and Croſs-Bowes to have the pleaſure of killing them, when they cannot be got out of their holds, or ſhelters, where they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked. Of all the ſeveral ſorts of Birds that the Merlins are uſed to fly at, none is more delightful, gives more diverſion, or ſhows more the eagerneſs and courage of the Merlins, than the Sky-Larks; becauſe they commonly endeavour to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſoaring aloft, and ſo draw the Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Merlins up to the very Clouds, from whence they force them to deſcend, and to endeavour to light in ſome Thicket, or ſome other ſhelter, which before they can reach, the Merlins commonly take them. The manner of flying them at the Pigeon Brow-ſtrung, is thus: two ſtrings are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the lower Eylids of the Pigeon, and then tied ſo together above her Head, ſo that her Eylids are drawn up, that ſhe cannot ſee downwards at all, but only upward, and then ſhe is thrown with the hand as high into the Air as a Man can throw her, where ſeeing no way but upward, ſhe is forc'd to ſoar upwards by ſpirts, and when ſhe is mounted reaſonably high, the Falconers ſend the Merlins, who overtake her, and never leave purſuing her, till they have faſtened on her, and brought her down; which ſort of ſcuffle laſts very often a great while, and gives the moſt pleaſure.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Military Officers, and Troops of the Kings Houſhold.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Kings of <hi>France</hi> have always kept ſeveral Guards for their Security, and to preſerve a Life, that is, the Lives of their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>We read in <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> in the eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his ſeventh Book, that <hi>Gontran</hi> King of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> or of the <hi>Burgundian</hi> part of <hi>France,</hi> ſeeing his two Brothers, <hi>Sigebert</hi> King of <hi>Mets,</hi> or <hi>Auſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> being that part of <hi>France</hi> towards <hi>Germany,</hi> including <hi>Lorrain</hi> and the Neighbouring Provinces, and <hi>Chilperic</hi> King of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> had been aſſaſſinated, placed a great Guard about his Perſon, about the year 587. without which, he never went to Church, or to his Recreations.</p>
                  <p>So upon different occaſions, the Guards have been reinforced and augmented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> being in the <hi>Holy Land</hi> in the year 1192. eſtabliſhed Serjeants at Arms, or Mace-Bearers, as may be ſeen in the Great Chronicles, where the Old Hiſtorian, <hi>La Montagne,</hi> ſpeaking of the Aſſaſines, or rather <hi>Arſacides,</hi> a Deſperate ſort of people of <hi>Syria,</hi> whom their Princes uſed to ſend to aſſaſinate the moſt couragious and active Princes among the Chriſtians, uſes theſe words: <hi>When the King</hi> (ſays he) <hi>heard this news, be began to be fearful of himſelf, and by advice of his Council, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have his Perſon well guarded, and choſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants with Macis, well armed and accoutred, who were night and day to attend him, to guard his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> The ſaid King made uſe of the ſaid Serjeants, at the Battel of <hi>Bouvines,</hi> who behaved themſelves
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95022:118"/>
that day ſo valiantly, that <hi>St. Lewis</hi> in the year 1229. founded for them, in memory of that action, the Church of <hi>St. Catharine du Val,</hi> of the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of <hi>Paris,</hi> according to an Inſcription to be ſeen upon two Stones at the entring into the ſaid Church, which contains theſe words: <hi>At the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of the Serjeants at Arms,</hi> Monſieur St. Lewis <hi>founded this Church, and laid the firſt ſtone of it, for Joy of the Victory obtained at the Bridge of</hi> Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, <hi>in the year</hi> 1214. <hi>The Serjeants at Arms, then in being, had the keeping of the ſaid Bridge, and vowed to God, that if he would give them the Victory, they would found a Church, and dedicate it to</hi> St. Catharine, <hi>which was performed accordingly:</hi> Where it is remarkable, that there are four Serjeants at Arms, repreſented upon thoſe two Stones, but in a different manner: There are two upon one of them, holding in their hands their Maces at Arms, and armed Cap-a-pee to repreſent the Serjeants at Arms, as they were in the Army, and upon the other ſtone, there are two more, whereof one is Clothed with a Coat with great Sleeves, cut in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, wearing a Collar hanging down upon his Breaſt, and I ſuppoſe that ſignifies the Uſher at Arms, Waiting at the Door of the Chamber, (for ſtill to this day, the Uſhers of the Chamber bear Maces on Feſtival days) to guard the Kings Perſon in the Day-time; The other is wrapped up in a long Cloak well furred with ſhaggy furr, with a Bonnet on his Head, and his Mace in his hand, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Serjeants at Arms that watched by night.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Du Tillet,</hi> in his Chapter of the <hi>Marſhals, pag.</hi> 282. writes, <hi>that ſome of them were appointed to carry Maces before the King in the day time, and were called <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhers at Arms,</hi> whoſe place is now ſupplyed by the Uſhers of the Kings Chamber, and others to guard his Chamber in the night time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:95022:118"/>
Theſe Guards then took their name from the Arms they uſed, and ſo when they quitted the Mace to take the Bow they were called <hi>Archers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh entertained a Guard of <hi>Scotch</hi> ſelected out of the Auxiliary Forces brought over to him by the Earls of <hi>Bucan, Douglas,</hi> and other Scotch Lords, to drive the Engliſh out of <hi>France, Philip de Comines</hi> calls them the Silver Guards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Coats or Jackets, called <hi>Hoquetons,</hi> were ſet with ſpangles of Silver, and Goldſmiths Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, being at <hi>Puiſeaux,</hi> on the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1474. eſtabliſhed a Company of a hundred <hi>Lanciers</hi> for his Guard, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of one <hi>Hector de Golart,</hi> who were every one of them to have in their Retinue, one Man at Arms, and two Archers: But afterwards he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the <hi>Lanoiers</hi> of their Archers, and took them to himſelf, compoſing of them a little Life-guard of two hundred Archers, making one <hi>Lewis de Graville</hi> their Captain.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1479. when the ſame King began to grow Melancholy, and ſuſpitious, he ſet up another <hi>French</hi> Company of Guards, of which one <hi>Claudius de la Chatre</hi> was Captain.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh too, at the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, retained the <hi>Suiſſers</hi> in his Service, and in the year 1481. being at <hi>Tours,</hi> he made an Alliance with them, and took a Company of that Nation, for the Ordinary Guard of his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the Eight in 1497. ſet up a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>French</hi> Guards, of which, <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> was Captain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt likewiſe in the year 1514. raiſed another Company of ſixty Archers, to which the next year, he added forty five more, under the Command of <hi>Raoul de Vernon.</hi> But at length all theſe Companies were reduced to thoſe now in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95022:119"/>
whoſe Denominations differ as much from the others, as the Arms now in uſe from thoſe then in Mode.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Guards now in being, may be divided into two Bodies, according to their Poſts, <hi>viz.</hi> Into the Guards within the <hi>Louvre,</hi> or Palace, and the Guards without the <hi>Louvre.</hi>

                     <p>The King allows the Guards every day twenty four Quarts of Wine, and twenty four Loaves, which the Clerk of the Watch of every Company cauſes to be brought them, which was formerly diſtributed to them by equal Portions, Morning and Night, <hi>viz.</hi> Twelve Quarts of Wine, and twelve Loaves every Morning, and as much every Night when the King was in Bed, but now it is all dealt out to them in the Morning, which Wine is called the <hi>Watch-Wine.</hi> They have allowed them, beſides this, on the four Great Feaſts of the year, to every Company, two Gallons of Table-Wine, twelve Loaves out of the Kings own Pantry, a Side of Veal, a whole Sheep, and four Fowls; And in the <hi>Holy Week</hi> they have Prayer-Books, and Linnen-Cloth given them; and on <hi>Candle-maſs</hi> and <hi>Corpus-Chriſti</hi> Days, Wax-Gandles; they enjoy the ſame Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

                        <hi>Of the Guards, called the</hi> Guards de la Manche, <hi>or</hi> of the Sleeve.</head>
                     <p>They are twenty five in number, counting the Chief, or firſt Man at Arms of <hi>France,</hi> who has 300 <hi>l.</hi> Salary.

                     <p>When any of theſe Guards <hi>de la Manche,</hi> fail to come and do Duty, the King cauſes their Places to be ſupplied by ſome of the Gentlemen of his Life-Guards.

                     <head>Their particular Functions are as follows.</head>
                     <p>When the King is to go to any Church or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to hear Maſs, Veſpers, Tenebres, or Sermon, or to aſſiſt at any Chriſtning or Marriage, two Guards of the Sleeve, or <hi>Manche,</hi> always goes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, and wait for the King, in their white <hi>Hoquetons,</hi> or Jackets, ſet with Gold and Silver Spangles, with Partiſans, fringed with ſilver in their hands, with Damaskt Blades: When his Majeſty is come, they keep on each ſide of him, always ſtanding, but only juſt at the time of the Elevation, with their Faces towards the King, to have an Eye on all ſides, upon his Sacred Perſon.</p>
                     <p>When the King eats in publick at home, either alone, or with the Queen, or any other Royal Perſon, whether at Dinner or Supper, two Guards
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95022:121"/>
of the Sleeve, Habited and Armed after the ſame manner, keep always on each ſide of him, in the ſame poſture, that is to ſay, ſtanding upright, with their Faces turned towards his Perſon.</p>
                     <p>Every two Nights in three, one of the Guards <hi>de la Manche,</hi> or <hi>of the Sleeve,</hi> goes at Midnight to the Principal Gate of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> or of any other of the Kings Palaees, ſome time before the Watch is called, that is to ſay, the Officers and Guards that are to compoſe the Court of Guard, that are to do Duty that Night at the Gate, where he receives the Keys from the hands of one of the Guards of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company, to whom only the Guards of the Gate deliver the Keys at ſix a Clock every Night: And he is to keep theſe Keys till the Watch be called, and then he is to ſhut all the Doors; and when he is called by the Clerk of the Watch, to anſwer in <hi>Scotch,</hi> I am here, and at the ſame time, to preſent the Keys to the Captain of the Guards then in Waiting, if he be preſent when the Watch is called, or in his abſence, to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Chief. But it often happening, that after the Watch is called, there are ſtill ſeveral perſons to go out of the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Guard <hi>of the Sleeve,</hi> opens it to all that would go out, and ſhuts it again till it be time to ſhut it for good and all; which being come, after the Brigadier, with a Torch in his hand, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the Aid-Major, has viſited all places, and warned every one with a load Voice to go out, the Guard <hi>of the Sleeve</hi> ſhuts all the Doors, and then taking with him the ſaid Brigadeer that carries the Torch, and the Aid-Major. He carries all the Keys to the Captain then in Waiting, or in his abſence, to him that ſupplies his place, and puts them under his Bolſter, in their preſence: I ſay they do this every two Nights in three, becauſe, every third Night 'tis a <hi>Scotch</hi> Brigadeer that does thoſe Duties, and then the Guards <hi>of the Steeve</hi>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:95022:122"/>
begin again, till it come again to the Brigadeer, and ſo all along. It is likewiſe a <hi>Scotch</hi> Brigadeer that goes and takes the Keys again of the Captain or Commander every Morning, at ſix a Clock.</p>
                     <p>The Guards <hi>of the Sleeve</hi> wait Monthly, two every Month.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Maundy-Thurſdays</hi> they wait for the King at the Door of the Hall, where the uſual Ceremony of the Day is performed, keeping always on each ſide of his Majeſty, during the time of the Sermon, and Abſolution, and following him along the Hall, while his Majeſty is waſhing the poor Peoples Feet, and ſerving up their Meat to the Table. When the King aſſiſts at any Proceſſions, as on <hi>Corpus Chriſti Day, Candlemas, Palm-Sunday,</hi> and at the <hi>Aſſumption of our Lady,</hi> and when he touches for the Evil, two Uſhers of the Chamber bearing Maces, march only before his Majeſty, but the Guards <hi>of the Sleeve</hi> march cloſe by his ſides, and when the Sacrament was carried in 1666. to the Queen Mother, <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> theſe Guards Accompanied the King all the way as he went on Foot from the <hi>Louvre</hi> to the Church, and back again.</p>
                     <p>At Extraordinary Ceremonies, as when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is pleaſed to appear in an Extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in Parliament, at the Creation or Inſtalment of Knights, at Coronations and Marriages of Kings, at the Chriſtning of their Children, and at Royal Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</p>
                     <p>When his Majeſty is minded to ſit in Parliament, they go to the Palace, and wait at the Door at the top of the Great Stairs called <hi>the May-Pole Door,</hi> and conduct him as far as the Entry of the Bar in the Great Chamber.</p>
                     <p>And when the King hears Maſs at the Holy Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as he commonly does before he goes to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they wait on him at his ſides in the manner above-deſcribed, and when Maſs is done, conduct him thence to the Great Chamber, where they ſtay

for him at the Entry of the Bar of the ſaid Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whence when he comes out, they reconduct him to the top of the ſaid Great Stairs, or elſe to his Coach: At the Creation or Inſtalment of Knights, ſix of theſe Guards wait for the King three days one after another, at the Door of the Houſe where the Aſſembly of the Knights is held, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the King ſtep by ſtep, from thence, to the Church, and every time he moves from his place, they march always cloſe by his ſides.</p>
                     <p>At the Coronation of any King, ſix Guards <hi>of the Sleeve,</hi> having under their <hi>Hoquetons,</hi> or upper Jackets, ſhort-truſs'd white Satin-Coats, with Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and Silk ſtockings anſwerable, wait without the Door of the Kings Chamber, from eight in the Morning, till his Majeſty comes out to go to Church, whither, and where-ever elſe he goes, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually accompany him.</p>
                     <p>At the Kings Wedding, they have new and very rich <hi>Hoquetons,</hi> or Jackets.</p>
                     <p>At the Kings Funeral, they wear Mourning Suits under their <hi>Hoquetons,</hi> or Jackets, and keep guard night and day about the Body or Effigies of his Majeſty as long as it lies in State: They onely are to put his Body into the Coffin; and when the Body is tranſported to <hi>St. Denis</hi> Church, which as <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Abbey</hi> here is the place of the Sepulchres of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> they go before and wait for it in the Chappel where it is to be depoſited, and keep Guard about it, till it be put into the Vault, down into which, they only are to carry it.</p>
                     <p>In all the Ceremonies and Solemnities above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, they have always their Partiſans in their hands, and their <hi>Hoquetons,</hi> or Jackets on their backs, on which, both before and behind, a <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules's Club</hi> was wrought with theſe words about it, <hi>Erit haec quoque cognita Monſtris; And the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhall alſo know, or feel this;</hi> which was the Motto of <hi>Henry the Great:</hi> But in the year 1671.

                     </p>
                     <p>When the King makes his firſt Entry into any of the Cities in his Dominions, there is due to each of the two Guards <hi>of the Sleeve</hi> then in Waiting, from the Magiſtrates of the City, a Silver-Hilted Sword; The ſame Fees are due to them from any Biſhops or Prelates when they take the Oath of Fidelity to the King.</p>
                     <p>They are allowed the ſame allowance of Bread and Wine every day, as they have that are upon the Watch, and have their Diet at the Kings <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaus,</hi> or Water-Servers Table, with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-Waiters, and a little Chamber to lie in, in the Guard-Chamber, if there be convenience for it.</p>

                     <head>The particular Duties and Prerogatives of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Guards.</head>
                     <p>The Captains of the Guards are ſworn by the King himſelf, and receive the Oath themſelves in the Guard-Chamber, from the Officers and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Companies of Life-Guards under their Command.</p>
                     <p>The Captain of the Guards that is in Waiting, never leaves the King from the times he riſes, or goes forth of his Chamber, until his Majeſty be in Bed, and then he goes out into the Guard-Chamber, to ſee the Watch called, where upon his Arrival, the Clerk of the Watch, with a loud Voice, calls over the Names of the Guards that are to lie that Night in the Guard-Chamber; and then the ſaid Captain having taken notice who are wanting, he goes down to the Gate, and ſets the Watch, and then is Conducted to his own Apartment. The
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95022:123"/>
ſame Clerk of the Watch calls over too the twelve <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> that are to lie at the upper end of the ſaid Guard-Chamber, in preſence of the Officers of the Company of a hundred <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> who after that, is in like manner Conducted to his Lodging.</p>
                     <p>The Captain of the <hi>French-</hi>Guards marches and keeps always immediately next the King, and near his Perſon, where ever he be or goes, whether at Table, on Horſeback, and in a Coach, and any where elſe; without ſuffering any to ſtep between the King and him, that ſo nothing may hinder him from having always his Eye upon His Majeſties Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon. It's true, that in a very narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, the Captain of the Guards lets the <hi>Querry</hi> paſs before him, and nearer the Kings Perſon, becauſe he may have the conveniency to aſſiſt his Majeſty upon any accident requiring his ſervice.</p>
                     <p>The Lieutenant of the Guards marches almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before the King, becauſe the Captain of the hundred <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> to whom-that Place is aſſigned, is moſt commonly not there; but when he is there, then the Lieutenant of the Guards places himſelf on the Kings right hand, and the Enſign on his left; but in the abſence of his Captain, he takes his place, and follows immediately behind his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                     <p>The King honours the Captain of the Guards with a place in one of the Coaches, or Caleches of the Body, and ſometimes in the ſame Coach with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and if his Majeſty rides out on Horſe-back, the Captain of the Guards takes Horſe in the very Court of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and at preſent, both the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Souldiers of the Life-Guards, wait for the King, ready mounted, in the Court of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> for fear whilſt they are waiting for him at one Door, he ſhould go out at another.</p>
                     <p>The Captain of the Guards in the time of his Waiting, always Lodges in the Kings Palace, as

near as may be conveniently to his Majeſties Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and in any of the Kings Palaces has the very firſt Apartment next the Kings, and before all other Officers: At Night he keeps the Keys, as we have ſaid, under his Bolſter.</p>
                     <p>When the King gives Audience to an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, the Captain of the Guards receives him at the Guard-Chamber Door, and conducts him to the Audience-Chamber; during the Audience he ſtands near the Rails, and when it is done, he conducts the Ambaſſadour back again, all along the Guard-Chamber, as far as the Door, the Guards making a Lane for them all the way.</p>
                     <p>The Captain and Lieutenant of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany may always take their place near the King though they be not in Waiting.</p>
                     <p>When the Guards that remain of the four Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Life-Guards, that are not in Waiting, or upon Duty, are drawn up (which is commonly called a <hi>Cornette</hi> of the Guards) whether it be to follow the King, or for any other Service, they are Commanded by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Lieutenant, as was ſeen when the King was going to <hi>Marſal.</hi>

                     <p>The Guards of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company only keep the Keys of the Doors of the Quires of the Churches where his Majeſty is, as alſo thoſe of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> at Night, which when the King is in Bed they carry to their Captain.</p>

                     <p>The Life-Guard men are always to keep Guard immediately before the Kings Anti-Chamber.</p>
                     <p>There is always a Sentinel upon Duty at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Guard-Chamber, to take notice of thoſe that go in. This Sentinel ſtands there with his Carbine, and ſets open both the leaves of the Door when the King, Queen, any Royal Perſon, or Ambaſſadours on Audience Days, are to paſs in or out: Note likewiſe, that when any Great Perſons, as thoſe of the Quality above-named, or the Princes of the Bloud, the Captains of the Life-Guards, or any other Lords of high quality are to paſs in or out, the Guards that are in the Guard-Chamber, as ſoon as the Sentinel has given them notice of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by ſtamping with his Foot on the Boards, betake themſelves preſently to their Arms, and make a Lane towards the Entry, into the ſaid Guard Chamber, to do honour to thoſe Great Perſons as they paſs; and as for their Captains, they Conduct them alſo all along the Guard-Chamber, as far as the Door of the Anti-Chamber.</p>
                     <p>The Sentinel is not to ſuffer any Souldier of the Regiment of Foot-Guards, to come into the Guard Chamber with his Bandoleer, nor any of the Great Provoſts Guards, with their Jackets, or <hi>Hoquetons,</hi> nor any Lackeys, or Livery-men.</p>
                     <p>If a Guard keep a Door through which one has a mind to paſs, one ought not to open it ones ſelf, though the Guard be at a diſtance from it, but to call civilly to the Guard to open it.</p>
                     <p>The Life-Guards go every Morning at ſix a Clock, and take the Keys of the Gates of the principal Court of the Royal Palace where the King lies, which they keep from that time till ſix at Night, when the Guards of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company take it of them, as we have already ſhewed.</p>

                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:95022:125"/>
At ſix a Clock at Night, the Exempt leads up the Company to the Gate, that is, to keep Guard there all night, with a Tierce of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and then all the other Guards retire, as well thoſe of the Gate, as thoſe belonging to the Provoſt of the Houſhold.</p>
                     <p>They lie all in the Court of Guard, and from ſix a Clock at Night, that the Guards of the Gate are relieved, there is but one <hi>Scotch</hi> Sentinel at the Gate, till the King be in Bed, after which, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadeer adds another Sentinel out of a <hi>French</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and this double Sentinel that is to watch all Night, is to be relieved every hour by the Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a Sentinel placed every night at the Door of the Guard-Chamber, which ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved every hour, but commonly by agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, he that is firſt placed there, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving watched half the night, wakes another Guard, who is to do Duty the remaining part of the night, and ſo goes to Bed. Always, both day and night, there are Sentinels drawn out of the Foot-Guards, placed without the outward Gates of the Kings Houſe, as we ſhall ſhow in due place.</p>
                     <p>If in the night time when all the Gates and Doors are ſhut, there happens to come a Courier, or any other perſon charged with buſineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the King, that is not to be delayed, the Guard that ſtands Sentinel, is to tell it the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, who is to go and tell the Captain; and then the Brigadeer, with a Torch in his hand, and the Exempt and the Captain with two other Torches carried before them, go all together to the Kings Lodgings, and calling upon the Chief Gentleman of the Bed Chamber, deſire of him, to know of his Majeſty, whether he be pleaſed to admit the ſaid Courier, or other Perſon, to his Speech and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>When an Exempt goes to relieve the Watch,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95022:125"/>
he is allowed half a Piſtol a day for his Diet.</p>
                     <p>The King ordinarily allows the Queen twelve of his <hi>French</hi> Guards, with an Exempt, and ſix <hi>Suiſſers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral Boys and Servants belonging to the Life-Guards, to make their Beds, go on Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands, and fetch neceſſaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>At Entries made into Cities, the Trumpeters of the Chamber march likewiſe at the head of the Kings Coach-Horſes.</p>
                     <p>The Pages of the Chamber get up behind the Coach, or if it be night, the Pages of the little Stable, ride on Horſeback before the Coach-Horſes, with each of them a Flambo in his hand; becauſe the King commonly marches ſomething faſt, he is pleaſed to permit ſome of his own, and of the Queens Footmen, to get up behind his Coach.</p>
                     <p>When the King makes any ſolemn Cavalcade, and rides in State, as at his Majority, and at his publick Entries into any great Towns or Cities, his Footmen run on each ſide of him, from his Stirrup to his Horſes head, and the Life-Guards march likewiſe on each ſide, from his Stirrup backwards. When the King walks on Foot, through the Courts of his Palace, or in the Streets, he is Accompanied by a good number of his <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Suiſſe Life-Guards,</hi>

and of the Great Provoſts Guards, but when he is going into any of his Gardens to walk there, all the ſaid Guards withdraw and let him go, ſave only ſome few <hi>French</hi> Life-Guards, and ſome Officers that follow him. But when the King goes out in his Coach, or on Horſeback, as he moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly does, the Life-Guards, both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> come out of their Guard-Chambers in the Palace, and make a Lane about the Coach or Horſe, while his Majeſty is getting up, or when he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting at his return. The Great Provoſts Guards place themſelves likewiſe in a rank on one ſide of his Majeſty, with their Officers, and ſometimes the Great Provoſt himſelf at the head of them, holding the Staff of Command in his hand. In Journeys, beſides the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Suiſſe Life-Guards,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aſſiſt at the Kings ſetting out, there are a great number of the Foot <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Suiſſe-Guards,</hi> with their Officers, that place themſelves round about the Coach the King ears in, while he is taking his Repaſt, and that keep off the people, and make Room for the Waiters to ſerve up the meat. When the King goes out to any place, a little diſtance from his Palace, in the Town where he is, as at <hi>Paris,</hi> when he goes from the <hi>Louvre,</hi> to <hi>Noſtre Dame Church,</hi> or to the Palace, or out upon any viſit, or to any <hi>Opera,</hi> or Comedy abroad, the Guards go thither firſt, and the <hi>Suiſſers</hi> wait for him at the great Gate of the place he is to go to, making a Lane on both ſides of it, for his Majeſty to paſs through when he comes.</p>

                     <p>They enjoy the ſame Priviledges as do the <hi>French</hi> the Kings born Subjects: they may purchaſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, and diſpoſe of their Goods or Eſtates, by Sale, Deeds or Gifts while living, or Wills at their Deaths, and their Wives, Children, or next Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, may Inherit what they leave: Both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Widows and Children, are free from all Taxes, Subſidies, and Impoſitions, laid or to be laid on the ſubject, under what name ſoever, and under what pretence ſoever, though the King himſelf ſhould have expreſly order'd them himſelf, his Majeſty being unwilling to make uſe of his Power and Prerogative againſt them, becauſe of their great Services, and ſingular Fidelity: They are alſo free from Watching and Warding, and keeping of Gates, as the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have always been pleaſed to let them be ever ſince their firſt Alliance with them, which have ſtill been confirmed by all ſucceeding Treaties.</p>
                     <p>When any of the Officers of this Company dies, he is buried with the Ceremonies and Solemnities uſed to Military Perſons; his Sword and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Staff are placed ſomething Croſs-wiſe, on the top of the <hi>Biere,</hi> which is carried in the midſt of the Company, who all Accompany the Body, the Drums and Flute making a mournful ſound, as is uſual at Funerals; when any of the common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of them die, they are buried much after the ſame manner, only with proportionably leſs Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, according to their Quality: The Swords of the deceaſed belong to the Harbinger then in Waiting.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the above-mentioned Priviledges en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by this Company, there are two other very particular and remarkable ones; the firſt is the right of being lodged <hi>gratis</hi> all the year at <hi>Paris,</hi>
                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:95022:131"/>
and the ſecond, the priviledge of ſelling Wine.</p>
                     <p>That Part or Quarter of <hi>Paris,</hi> that comprehends the Streets of <hi>Montorgueil,</hi> of <hi>Montmarire,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Neighbouring Streets, is allotted for Lodging this Company, though the King be not at <hi>Paris:</hi> And the Owner, or chief Tenants of the Houſes in thoſe Streets, if their Houſes be ſmall, are bound to find a Chamber ready furniſhed, at moſt but two ſtories high, for a common <hi>Suiſſe,</hi> and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all neceſſary Utenſils, and thoſe who have big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Houſes, are to find an Officer two Chambers ready furniſhed, with a Stable and Coach-Houſe, if need be, and with all neceſſary Utenſils, as Linnen, Diſhes, Pots and Pans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But generally the King having not for a long time reſided at <hi>Paris,</hi> not being like to do, the Owners, or chief Tenants of the ſaid Houſes, agree with the ſaid <hi>Suiſſers</hi> and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, for a certain yearly payment in Money, in conſideration of which, their Houſes are free from this ſubjection, and the <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> upon occaſion, like Lodgings where elſe they pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Kings of <hi>France</hi> have granted to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany thirteen Priviledges, or an Exemption to be enjoyed by thirteen Perſons of their Body, from the Duties uſually paid by Vintners and Wine-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Theſe thirteen Priviledges are enjoyed by twelve <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> among whom, are ſome Officers, and the Clerk of the Watch: They are by vertue of the ſame, exempt from paying the Duty called the Eighth, and generally from all other duties upon Wine, except the duty of the Entry or Importation of thoſe Wines they ſell by retail. The Jurours of the Wine-Sellers, pretend, that the number of Buts, or Pieces of Wine, which theſe Priviledged <hi>Suiſſers</hi> are to ſell, is limited to 150, and they on the other ſide ſay, they are not limited to any definite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is a Controverſy as yet undecided; the King abates 1400 <hi>l.</hi> a year to the <hi>Farmers of the Aids,</hi> for every one of theſe thirteen Priviledges,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95022:132"/>
and yet they let them out but for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, to thoſe that hire them of them.</p>
                     <p>Formerly thoſe of this Company that ſold Wine, paid no more for ſelling Wine with Napkins and Plates, that is, for ſelling Wine and Victuals too, than for ſelling of it only by the Pot, ſo that they paid 27 <hi>d.</hi> on every Piece of Wine leſs than the Vintners; but in the year 1658. the Company ſold this Priviledge, which was called the little Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to the <hi>Farmers of the Aids,</hi> for a certain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity to be paid to their Captain, which is diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among them at the rate of 4 <hi>d.</hi> a day each Man, ſo that ever ſince that time, the hundred <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> that before had but 14 <hi>d.</hi> a day, have now 18 <hi>d.</hi> a day.</p>

                     <p>Fifty Guards of the Gate, that ſerve by Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>viz.</hi> Thirteen of them each of the two firſt Quarters, and but twelve of each of the two laſt Quarters of the year. They enjoy their Places too by Patent, and are ſworn by their Captain.</p>
                     <p>They are reckoned among the firſt and moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Guards of the Houſhold, which is the reaſon that this Company is yet to this day entred upon the Book of the General Eſtabliſhment of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold,

and accordingly receive their pay from the Treaſurers of the Houſhold, and not from peculiar Treaſurers of their own, as do the other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Guards.</p>
                     <p>Every day, at ſix in the Morning, the Guards of the Gate, receive from the hands of the Life-Guard Men, the Keys of the Gates of that Court where the Kings Lodgings or Apartments are, within which, they place Sentinels, and at ſix at Night they return the ſaid Keys again to the Life-Guards; By the Court where the Kings Lodgings are, I mean the principal Court of the Palace where he is, as the Oval Court at <hi>Fountain-bleau.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that ſtands Sentinel at the Gate, holds a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine on his ſhoulder, as do all the reſt of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that are on the Guard, who likewiſe ſtand to their Arms, and place themſelves in Ranks, making a Lane near the Gate, when his Majeſty, any other Royal Perſons, or any Ambaſſadours in going to, or coming from their firſt and laſt Audiences, are to paſs by. They alſo ſtand to their Arms in the ſame manner about the Gate, within the Court of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> or other Royal Palace where the King is exerciſing the Company of Gentlemen Musketeers, during the whole time of the ſaid Exerciſe in that Court.</p>
                     <p>The Guards of the Gate are to let none paſs into the Palace with Arms, but the Life-Guards only; but are to ſtop all that offer to go in with Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes, Firelocks, Pikes, Powder, or any other Arms but Swords.</p>
                     <p>They all wear blue Coats laced with large gold and ſilver Galoon, and trimmed with Buttons of Maſſy Silver. Formerly they uſed to wear Jackets, or <hi>Hoquetons,</hi> like thoſe worn at preſent, by the Great Provoſts Guards, ſave only, that upon the four great Skirts of them, they had two Keys Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered Salter-wiſe, and Swivels, which are both of Buff.</p>

Their Belts, at preſent, are edged about with gold and ſilver Galoon; and in the middle of their Swivels, there is before, and behind, a golden <hi>Flower deluce,</hi> and an <hi>L</hi> of the ſame, for <hi>Lewis,</hi> being the Kings Name, and above them two Keys placed Salteir-wiſe, and tied with a red Ribband, all which is wrought in Embroidery, enterlaced with Palms and Lawrels, and Crowned with a Crown Royal.</p>
                     <p>The Guards of the Gate, in the time of their Waiting, never take off their Swivels wherever he goes, unleſs it be when he goes into the Kings An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chamber, or into the other Chambers, Cloſets, and Apartments of his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>At the end of their Quarters Waiting, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 200 <hi>l.</hi> Wages from the General Treaſurer of the Houſhold, and 40 <hi>l.</hi> Gratuity at the Treaſure Royal.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Eaſter, Whitſontide, All-Saints, Chriſtmas, Martlemas,</hi> and on <hi>Shrove-Tueſday,</hi> they have Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Bread, Wine and Meat, from the King, which gives them the priviledge of Tablers, or Commoners of the Kings Houſhold; they that are in Waiting, at the like times, on the Queen, or the Dauphin, have the ſame allowance from them.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>New-Years Tide,</hi> the King gives them that are in Waiting that quarter, 50 <hi>l. 5 d,</hi> the Queen 32 <hi>l,</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> as much, for which, they give an Acquittance. The other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Courts likewiſe, and the <hi>Guildhall</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> pay them ſome certain ſumms, for they give alſo Acquittances.</p>
                     <p>Upon <hi>St. Lewis</hi>'s Day, which is his Majeſties pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Feſtival, the Kings allow them 40 <hi>l.</hi> out of the Privy-Purſe of the Chamber; Beſides which, they have a Fee of ten Crowns from the Treaſurer of the Offrings every time the King touches for the Evil: But however, on the four great Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95022:133"/>
of the year, they are paid the ſaid allowance on that account, whether the King touches or no.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that are in Waiting, ſhare amongſt them, the Gifts and Liberalities made to them, by the New Dukes, and Peers, and Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> and other Officers of the Crown, at their firſt Entry into the Kings Palace in their Coaches or Sedans, by vertue of their new Dignity.</p>
                     <p>They have likewiſe Wax-Candles at <hi>Candlemas,</hi> Torches on <hi>Corpus Chriſti Day,</hi> and Prayer-Books in the Holy Week, given them.</p>
                     <p>They are Exempt from Taxes, and from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on Salt in thoſe Provinces where it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and from all Subſidies and Billeting of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: They have the Priviledge of <hi>Committimus,</hi> and take out Letters of State when they have need of them.</p>
                     <p>By an Order of the Privy-Council dated the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1668. the King has confirmed the quality of Eſquires to the Guards of the Gate; and by a Declaration of the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1659. and Letters Patents of the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1675. regiſtred in the Great Councel on the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> following.

                     <p>Of the Nobility in General.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN <hi>France,</hi> as in moſt other Countries, not only thoſe which are Princes, Peers, and Great Lords, but all Gentlemen of ancient Deſcent, and that are enobled by the King, are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned into the Body of the Nobility; and there the King often gives Letters of Nobility, as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, whereby he conſtitutes the perſon receiving them Noble, or makes him a Gentleman, without Conferring upon him any particular Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <note place="margin">1</note> contrary to the practice uſed in <hi>England:</hi> It is to be noted too, that there, neither Arts nor Sciences ennoble, neither Lawyers, nor Phyſicians,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:95022:163"/>
nor Divines, being accounted noble, or Gentlemen, unleſs they be otherwiſe ſo, or enjoy ſome Place, or Dignity, that gives them the Title of Lord, which is only temporary and perſonal.</p>
                  <p>The Chief Priviledges of Nobles, or Gentlemen, are to be Exempt from Taxes, and to enjoy ſome other immunities, and be capable of enjoying Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and riſing to Honour. If they take Church Dignities, or addict themſelves to the Law, they derogate not from their Nobility, though they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it not, but if they follow any Trade or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, or marry with any Family, not Noble, they derogate and loſe their quality; and till of late, thoſe that medled with Sea-Affairs, were reckoned to derogate likewiſe, but that being found prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Improvement of the Power of <hi>France</hi> by Sea, It was Order'd by the preſent King, having concerns in publick Companies, ſuch as the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, that ſtudying or practiſing Sea-Experience, ſhould not only not derogate, but be encouraged with Priviledges; and accordingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed publick Schools and Nurſeries in ſeveral Marine Places, with good Endowments, wherein a conſiderable number of the younger Sons of the meaner Nobility, might be inſtructed in Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Maritime Affairs, and trained up to make uſeful Sea-Officers: So that now the younger Sons, or Cadets of the Gentry, are either provided for in the Church, with Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, or raiſe themſelves by Military employs, by Sea or Land, not ſo many as formerly affecting the civil ones, becauſe they are ſuch as are often enjoyed by the Sons of rich Citizens, or Farmers of Taxes, whom they a little diſdain for Companions.</p>
                  <p>The Nobility or Gentry in <hi>France</hi> is the moſt numerous of any Kingdom of the World, they being reckoned above ten thouſand able Bodies, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally well educated in all accompliſhments that may make them ſerviceable to their Country, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:95022:163"/>
in them conſiſts the Kings chief Force; and he is, in ſome reſpects, as abſolute over them, as over the Peaſants: for though they pay no Taxes, and cannot be legally compelled to take Arms, unleſs upon an Invaſion, or imminent danger; yet it is by Cuſtom, thought ſo diſgraceful for any Principals or Heads of greater Families, not to attend the King, and ſpend what they have in his Court, or Service; or for Cadets, or younger Brothers, not provided for in the Church, to follow any thing but the Wars, by which only in a manner all Nobility was ever acquired there, that the King can never want Souldiers among them: It being almoſt impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable for a Gentleman, any thing conſiderable, to live privately, or retired there, unleſs he thruſt himſelf into a Convent.</p>

The Quality of the twelve antient Peers of <hi>France,</hi> is at preſent but a kind of Ceremonial Dignity, by vertue of which, thoſe that poſſeſs it, have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rank or Precedence in <hi>France,</hi> at the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration and Coronation of Kings, have Place in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and in the general Aſſembly of <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and enjoy the Honours of the <hi>Louvre:</hi> Their firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is ſo uncertain, that it is impoſſible to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Hiſtory their true Original, ſome attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting it to <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and ſome to <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> or <hi>Charles</hi> the Great: But the Original of the Name and Functions of the <hi>Peers</hi> of <hi>France</hi> can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be derived from nothing elſe, then from the common uſe and cuſtom of Fieſs and Tenures, which is, that the Vaſſals holding moveable Fiefs fully and directly of the ſame Lord, are called <hi>Pares Curiae aut Domus,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Peers of the Fiefs, or of the Court,</hi> that are to aſſiſt when the Lord takes poſſeſſion of his Land; to be preſent at thoſe days, when cauſes relating to the Fiefs, are pleaded and judged, and have ſeveral other rights which are analogically common to them with our <hi>Peers</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who in like manner aſſiſt at the Conſecration and Coronation of the King, who is the ſupream Lord, are Counſellers in his Court of Parliament, which for this reaſon is called <hi>the Court of Peers;</hi> ſo that in a word, the <hi>Peers</hi> of <hi>France</hi> are but as Tenants that hold of the Monarchy, and depend immediately on the Crown; ſuch as were the ſeven <hi>Peers</hi> in the time of <hi>Lewis the Young,</hi> in the year 1179, or in the time of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> who reunited to the Crown, the <hi>Dutchy</hi> and <hi>Peerage</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> or of <hi>Paris,</hi> which he poſſeſſed before he was King: So that there remained after that, but ſix <hi>ancient Peers,</hi> that were <hi>Seculars,</hi> to which at ſeveral times, by degrees, were afterwards added ſix other <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Peers,</hi> over whom, <hi>Lewis the Young,</hi> gave the Primacy to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Reims,</hi> with the Prerogative of Conſecrating and

Crowning the Kings: Since the time of the ſaid <hi>Lewis</hi> the Young, the number of twelve <hi>Peers,</hi> at thoſe great Ceremonies, has been always continued till the preſent; But the <hi>Secular Peers</hi> are as we have ſaid, only repreſented on that occaſion, there being none now that bear any of thoſe Titles, but only now lately the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Eldeſt Son to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> one of the Kings Natural Legitimated Sons.</p>
                  <p>Their ſeveral Functions at the Kings Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Coronation, are theſe:</p>
                  <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Reims</hi> Conſecrates, or anoints the King with the Oil of the Holy <hi>Ampull,</hi> or Viol, kept in the Cathedral of that Name, from Age to Age, only for that purpoſe: The Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> carries the ſaid Viol; the Biſhop of <hi>Langres</hi> carries the <hi>Scepter;</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> the <hi>Mantle Royal,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Chaalons, the Ring;</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Noyons,</hi> the <hi>Belt:</hi> The Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> carries the <hi>Crown Royal,</hi> and girds on the <hi>Kings Sword;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guyenne</hi> carries the <hi>firſt ſquare Banner,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> the <hi>Second;</hi> the Count of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> the <hi>Spurs;</hi> the Count of <hi>Champain,</hi> the <hi>Banner Royal,</hi> or <hi>Standard of War;</hi> the Count of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the <hi>Kings Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the day of the Conſecration and Coronation, and during the Ceremony, theſe <hi>Peers</hi> wear a Circle of gold in form of a <hi>Crown:</hi> Now becauſe of the ſix <hi>Secular Peerages,</hi> there are now five reunited to the Crown, and that of <hi>Flanders</hi> is likewiſe in part reunited, and in part remains ſtill in foreign hands, therefore there are on ſuch occaſions ſix Princes, or great Lords choſen to repreſent them, and to perform their Functions.</p>
                  <p>The Order obſerved at the Coronation of the preſent King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, now happily Reigning, which was on the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1654. was as follows.</p>

                     <p>Of the Orders of Knighthood, at preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, called, the Kings Orders.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AT preſent there are only two Orders of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſubſiſting, <hi>viz.</hi> of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which are uſually called, <hi>the Kings Orders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Order of St. <hi>Michael</hi> was Inſtituted the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the year 1469. by King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. in honour of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel. He Ordained, that this Order ſhould conſiſt of thirty ſix Knights, which ſhould be obliged in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting it, to quit all other Orders they might have received from Foreign Princes, unleſs they were Emperours, Kings, or other Sovereign Princes, who only were priviledged to wear it together with the other Orders, of which themſelves were Chiefs or Soveraigns; with a Proviſo nevertheleſs, that the Brotherhood, by common conſent, might modifie this regulation, according to their pleaſure: And in like manner, he provided, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be. free to wear the Orders of other Princes with this Order.</p>
                  <p>The Knights of this Order wear a golden Collar, wrought all in the form of double Sea-Shells, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:95022:173"/>
one with another, in true Lovers Knots, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of double points of ſilk tag'd with gold, at the end of which, hangs a Medal, on which, is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven a Rock, upon which is figured St. <hi>Michael</hi> Fighting with the Dragon: But <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged theſe Laces, called <hi>true Lovers Knots,</hi> into Cords of gold of the faſhion of thoſe worn by the <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> Fryers, becauſe he bore the name of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Order.</p>
                  <p>All the Knights of the Holy Ghoſt are obliged by way of preparation, to take this Order the Eve before they are to take that of the Holy Ghoſt; for which reaſon, their Arms are Encompaſſed with the Collars of both the Orders, and they are called Knights of the Kings Orders, in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>Of the whole number of thoſe that had formerly received the Order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> the King ſelected and retained a hundred on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1665. of which a Liſt was Printed, ſince which, his Majeſty has reformed ſeveral of them, as you may ſee in the following Liſt.</p>
                  <p>The Order of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was Inſtituted at <hi>Paris,</hi> on New-Years Day, in the year 1579. by <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> as an Eternal-Mark of! his Piety, and thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment he deſired to render to Almighty God, for the repeated and ſignal Favours he had received from him on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> or of his ſending the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> for that on that day he was Born, was Elected King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and ſucceeded to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> by the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth. He likewiſe ſtinted the number of theſe Knights to thirty ſix; but their number has now been a long time unlimited: the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth in the year 1633. at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> gave the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to fifty of his Lords; and at the laſt Promotion that was made in 1662. there were Inſtalled three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:95022:174"/>
The Knights of this Order wear at preſent a ſilver Croſs ſet on Orange-Coloured Velvet upon the left ſide of their Cloaks and Suits, in the midſt of which, is a Dove Embroidered in ſilver, with rays of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and at the Corners, <hi>Flowerdeluces</hi> alſo of Silver, with another Croſs all of gold hung about their Necks with a Sky-Coloured Ribband, which Croſs is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameld with white on the ſides, having at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>Flowerdeluces,</hi> and in the middle, the Figure of a Dove on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>The Great Collar of this Order is compoſed of <hi>Flowerdeluces</hi> of gold Crowned with golden Flames, Enameld with red, enterlaced with three Cyphers likewiſe of gold, Enamel'd with white: The firſt Cypher is an H and a double A all double, which may be read upward or downward, the H ſtanding for <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the Letter L for <hi>Lewiſe</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> his Wife, and another for ſomething, which is as yet a myſtery. The Croſs of the Order is of Gold, in the midſt of which, there is a Dove Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meld with white on one ſide, and on the other ſide, the Image of St. <hi>Michael.</hi> On the laſt of <hi>June,</hi> in the year 1594. <hi>Henry</hi> the Great took out of the Collar of the Order, the Cyphers of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third his Predeceſſour, and cauſed to be put in their place, Trophies of Arms interlaced together, and intermingled with Crowned H's. Some aſſert, that this Order was firſt Inſtituted by King <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Scicily,</hi> and that <hi>Henry</hi> the Third did but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new it.</p>
                  <p>The Knights upon the day of their reception, or Inſtalment, are clad in Cloth of Silver with Breeches tuckt up, white Silk Stockings, and Pumps of white Velvet, their Bonnets of Black-Velvet, and their Cloaks made with a Cape after the ancient Faſhion, of Black-Velvet uncut, and their Ruffs ſtiff-ſtarched: When they are received, their Capes are taken off, and a long Green-Velvet Cloak is put on their Shoulders, trailing on the ground, wrought all over
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:95022:174"/>
with Trophies of gold for the Knights, and Flames for the Officers, and lined with Orange-Coloured Satin.</p>
                  <p>They kneel down before the King, who taking their joined hands between his own, ſtrikes them gently over the Shoulders with his Sword, and Kiſſes them on the Cheek.</p>
                  <p>When the King Confers this Order in any Church, he goes and ſits down near the Altar, in the middle of the Officers of the Order; then the Great Maſter of the Ceremonies of the Order, Accompanied with the Uſher and the Herald, goes and gives notice to the Lords which are to receive the Order, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently advance towards his Majeſty, one after the other, or elſe by two and two, and kneeling down, take the uſual Oath, holding their two hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Majeſties, in the manner aforeſaid, and touching the Book of the Holy Goſpels, which is held by the Chancellour: After which, the Provoſt and Great Maſter of the Ceremonies, preſent the King with Cloaks and Mantles to Inveſt the Knights, and then his Majeſty taking the Collars of the Order from the hands of the High Treaſurer, puts them about the Knights Necks, ſaying to them theſe words, <hi>Take from our hand the Collar of our Order of the bleſſed Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the number of the Knights of the Kings Order, under the Title of the Order and Militia of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> in the Year, 1678. with other things concerning both this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the Additional Orders of <hi>Nôtre Dame de Mont-Carmel,</hi> and of St. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Knights of the Order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> in the year 1678. were ſeventy four in number.</p>
                  <p>The two eldeſt of theſe, enjoy the Priviledge of <hi>Committimus,</hi> under the Great Seal.</p>
                  <p>The King has named ſince other Knights in the room of thoſe Deceaſed, and to compleat the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a hundred, to which his Majeſty reduced it, by the reformation he made in the year 1665. who will be received in the firſt general Chapter, which ſhall be held by the Kings Order, when they have made proof of their Nobility and good Services.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty has been pleaſed to honour ſome Strangers with the Collar of this Order, and among others, the Count of <hi>Padua, M. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldo Cima d' Ozimo,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the late Dutch Admiral <hi>Ruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> But Strangers are not comprehended in the ſaid number of a hundred.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1666. The King Commiſſionated the late Duke of <hi>Noailles,</hi> Peer of <hi>France,</hi> and Captain of his Life-guards, <hi>M. de Beringhen,</hi> Chief Querry, and Commander of his Orders, and the late Mr. <hi>Colbert</hi> Secretary of State, Comptroller-General of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Finances,</hi> and then Commander, and great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:95022:178"/>
of his Orders, to ſurvey and examine the Proofs and Evidences of the Nobility of the Knights of the Order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> which were put into the hands of Mr. <hi>Cotignon de Chauvry,</hi> Genealogiſt of the Kings Orders.</p>
                  <p>The King commonly Commiſſionates one of the Knights of his Orders to aſſiſt at the general Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and to receive thoſe which are to be received, with the uſual Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, according to the intention of his Majeſty, after they have made due proof of their noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and of their Services: And at the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every General Chapter, the King ſends a new Commiſſion to one of the Knights of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and though his Majeſty be pleaſed to continue ſometimes the ſame Perſon, yet he may change, if he pleaſe, at every new Chapter; for he of the ſaid Knights of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> that is named for that purpoſe, can plead no preſcription from thence, for his being continued perpetual Commiſſioner of this Order of St. <hi>Michael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1608. King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Order, which he named the Order of <hi>Nôtre Dame de Mont-Carmel, i. e.</hi> of our Lady of <hi>Mount-Carmel,</hi> in memory of the ancient Order of the Dukes of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> dedicated to the B. Virgin; and in the Month of <hi>October</hi> the ſame year, he joined thereto, the ancient Order of St. <hi>Lazarus</hi> of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is compoſed all of <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>They wear a Golden-Croſs Cantoned, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with four <hi>Flower-deluces</hi> edged with a white Hem, in the midſt of which, on one ſide, upon a white Enamel, is repreſented the Virgin, and on the other, a St. <hi>Lazarus</hi> upon an Enamel of Green. This Croſs is tyed to a Flame-Coloured Ribband.</p>
                  <p>The Great Priors, and other great Officers of this Order, wear this Croſs tyed to a great large Flame-Coloured Ribband tied Scarf-wiſe, and on the left
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:95022:178"/>
ſide of their Cloaks, or Coats, another Croſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of four Flames, Cantoned with four <hi>Flower-deluces,</hi> and in the middle, the Image of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, Environ'd with Rays of Gold, all in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery.</p>
                  <p>The Preſent King, Confirmed the Rights, Eſtates, Commanderies, Priviledges and Exemptions of this Order, in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1664. and in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> 1672.</p>
                  <p>The King is likewiſe Chief, and Soveraign of this Order.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1668. the Marquiſs of <hi>Nereſtang</hi> took the uſual Oath to the King, for the Office of Great Maſter of the Royal Order of <hi>Nôtre Dame de Mont-Carmel,</hi> and of St. <hi>Lazarus</hi> of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> both on this ſide of, and beyond the Seas: After which, his Majeſty put on upon him the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Croſs, in the Preſence of his principal Lords; and at the ſame time, he took his leave of his Majeſty, to go and Command a Squadron of Ships deſigned for the Guard of the Coaſts of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany:</hi> But he voluntarily reſigned this Office into the Kings hands again in 1673.</p>
                  <p>The Marquiſs of <hi>Louvois</hi> was received Vicar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of this Order the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1673. at the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Convent, called <hi>les Carmes des Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes,</hi> where the Aſſemblies and Ceremonies of the Order are kept and Celebrated.</p>
                  <p>On New-Years Day, in the year 1669. the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> received into the number of his Life-guards twelve Knights of St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which are as 'twere the Cadets, or young Noblemen of his Guards.</p>
                  <p>There are five great Priories, and 140. Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries of this Order, <hi>viz.</hi> 28 Commanderies to each Great Priory, to which his Majeſty commonly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates ſome of his Land, or Sea-Officers, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, which have been wounded, or which have render'd him conſiderable Services.</p>

                     <p>Beſides theſe aboveſaid Orders of Knighthood, there are in <hi>France,</hi> many Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and Great Priors and Commanders of that Order, that poſſeſs there many rich Lordſhips, with great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Immunities, for that they are obliged, by their Order, to expoſe themſelves continually for the common defence of Chriſtendom againſt the Turks and Infidels: But there being Books enough that treat <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> very largely and particularly of them.

                     <p>In old time, before theſe particular Orders of Knighthood were inſtituted, this word <hi>Chevalier,</hi> or Knight, was uſed to ſignifie ſome great precedent merit, from whence it comes to paſs, that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Quality, and of ancient Families, ſtill to this day, aſſume that Quality, and write themſelves <hi>Meſſire, N.</hi> Knight, and Lord of <hi>Meſſire,</hi> being a Title intimating Nobility, and <hi>Chevalier,</hi> or Knight, being reckoned a worthier Title than that of their Mannours, or Seignieuries, of which they are Lords.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the general Dignities of the Kingdom; and firſt, of the High Conſtable.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE High Conſtable was the firſt of all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Crown, and next to the King, was Sovereign Head of the Armies of <hi>France,</hi> and took place immediately next after the Princes of the Blood, chiefly in Parliament. At firſt, he was no more than the Great Maſter of the Horſe is now, as appears by the Etymology of the word, which is, <hi>Comes Stabuli,</hi> i. e. Count of the Stable: On the ſides of his Coat of Arms, he bore as a mark of his Dignity, two naked Swords, with the points upward, held by a right-hand armed, with a Gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let coming out of a Cloud: He was ſworn by the King himſelf.</p>
                  <p>At publick Entries of Kings, the Conſtable marched foremoſt before his Majeſty, on his right hand, holding a naked Sword; And when the King ſate on his Bed of Juſtice, or in the Aſſembly of the general Eſtates, he ſate before him on his right hand.</p>
                  <p>The Power of this Officer was much augmented by the Succeſſours of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> when the Office of Mayor of the Palace was ſuppreſt, and though there were Conſtables before <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> yet they had till then, no power in the Armies: If we may believe M. <hi>du Tillet,</hi> who ſets down the Conſtables, according to their Succeſſion, the firſt to be found
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:95022:180"/>
in Hiſtory, was <hi>Froger</hi> of <hi>Châlons,</hi> under <hi>Lewis</hi> the Groſs, who therefore may well be called the firſt Conſtable, he being the firſt that ever enjoyed that large power the Conſtables enjoyed after that time, to whoſe Command in the Armies, the very Princes of the Blood were ſubjected.</p>
                  <p>He that firſt Exalted the Power of Conſtable to a Soveraign Command over all the men of War, not excepting the Princes of the Blood, was <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the ſecond, Baron of <hi>Montmorency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conſtable had right to take a days pay, as his Fee, of all Military Perſons entred into the Kings pay, at the firſt payment they received, and of the Horſe and Foot that were under the Command of the Maſter or Clerk of the Croſs-Bow-men, and in general, of all thoſe that were paid by the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Wars, except only the Princes of the Blood and their Domeſticks, that ſerved in the War at their own Expences, and the Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at Sea.</p>
                  <p>It was Treaſon to offend the Conſtable, as it was Judged in the Caſe of <hi>Peter de Craôn,</hi> who had attempted upon the Life of <hi>Oliver de Cliſſon,</hi> High Conſtable.</p>
                  <p>The Juriſdiction, or Court held at the Marble Table, is called the <hi>Conſtablerie</hi> and <hi>Marſhalſey,</hi> and though the Office of Conſtable was ſuppreſt by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the laſt King, in 1627. after the Death of the then Duke <hi>de Lesdiguieres,</hi> the laſt Conſtable, yet ſo much of his Juriſdiction and Power, as was exerciſed at the Marble Table, remains ſtill in the hands of the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> that were formerly but his Lieutenants.</p>
                  <p>The number of Conſtables is differently related by the Annaliſts, who as little agree in the Order of their Succeſſion. There is ſtill, always in the Armies, a Provoſt of the Conſtablery, that gives out Paſsports, and has juriſdiction and power to take cogniſance of all Diſorders of Men of War, and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:95022:181"/>
to decide all differences ariſing among them, as likewiſe over all Traytors and Deſerters of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: He alſo ſets the price of Victuals, and enjoys many other Priviledges.</p>
                  <p>By an Order of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1627. and another of the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> in 1643. The late King ſuppreſt the Offices of High Conſtable, and Colonel-General of the Infantry of <hi>France,</hi> with a Proviſion for the future, that they ſhould never be renewed again upon what pretence ſoever: and the ſuppreſſion of that of Colonel-General of the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was again confirmed the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1661.</p>
                  <p>The firſt or eldeſt Marſhal of <hi>France</hi> Officiates the duty of Conſtable, and may as ſuch, bear on one ſide of his Coat of Arms, a naked Sword, and the Commanders Staff on the other, as Marſhal.</p>
                  <p>The other Prerogatives belonging to this Office, may be ſeen in the relation of M. <hi>du Tillet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before we conclude this Chapter, it will not be impertinent the following Article of the Priviledges of this High Office found in the Regiſters of the Chamber of Accounts in a Bag called <hi>Spalia,</hi> and expreſt in old <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> The Conſtable is to have his Chamber at Court, near the King, where-ever his Majeſty be; and in his Chamber, is to have twelve Stools, and twelve Cuſhions, and Billets for his fire; and he is to have a certain allowance of Wine, and two pound of ſmall Candles, and a Torch by Night, to conduct him to his Houſe, or into the Town, which are to be redelivered next Morning to the Fruiterer: And he is to have thirty ſix Loaves, and one Pot of Wine for himſelf placed near the Stand, and two Barrels for his Chamber, one towards the Door, and the other towards the ends, and of every Meſs, cookt or raw, as much as is neceſſary, and a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for four-Horſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> If a Caſtle, or Fortereſs be taken, or do yield, the Horſes, Harneſs, Proviſions, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:95022:181"/>
things found therein, belong to the Conſtable, except the Gold, and the perſons that belong to the King, and the Artillery that belongs to the Maſter of the Croſs-Bow-Men.</p>
                  <p>There has been ſometimes made a Lieutenant-General, repreſenting the Kings Perſon throughout the Kingdom, which is an Authority almoſt equal to the Conſtables, though held only by Commiſſion: There was one of theſe made in 1560. under <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and the late Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the ſame Dignity in the Minority of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King <hi>Lemis</hi> the Great.</p>

                  <p>IT will be no eaſy matter to tell you preciſely, at what time the Office of Marſhal of <hi>France</hi> was firſt Inſtituted, becauſe the Hiſtorians that have made mention of it, are not agreed about that point. <hi>John le Feron,</hi> that writes their Hiſtory, makes them to have begun under <hi>Clovis</hi> the ſecond, Son of <hi>Dagobert,</hi> in the perſon of one <hi>Girard</hi> Count of <hi>Dammartin;</hi> ſome others attribute their firſt Creation to <hi>Hugh Capet:</hi> But I can ſubſcribe to neither of theſe opinions, my firſt reaſon is, becauſe <hi>John de Feron</hi> has not the approbation of all thoſe well skill'd in Hiſtory; my ſecond, that after having peruſed over the moſt part of the French Annaliſts, I can find no mention made of any Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> till the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the Firſt, neither was it by Hiſtory that I found out the name in that Reign, but by reading the Records of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of St. <hi>Martin des Champs,</hi> or of St. <hi>Martins in the Fields,</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> dated in the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:95022:182"/>
year 1067. Signed by his Majeſty and other Lords, and afterwards by <hi>Guy</hi> and <hi>Anſelm,</hi> Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> without the addition of any other Sur-names.</p>
                  <p>This Charter which cannot be charged with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, induces me to believe, that there were always ſome of that name and Dignity, ever ſince their firſt Creation, which agrees with the opinion of M. <hi>Du Tillet;</hi> but becauſe it is more commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that they were always the Lieutenants of the Conſtables, I ſhall not abſolutely contradict it, and becauſe the Office of Conſtable was then but the fourth Dignity in the Kingdom, and that their Command extended but over a part of the Kings Cavalry, I cannot be perſuaded that the Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> have always been Generals of Armies: The Office of Conſtable became the firſt Dignity of <hi>France,</hi> by the Valour of <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who in the time of <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> gained the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Bovines,</hi> againſt the joint Forces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Otho,</hi> and the King of <hi>England,</hi> who were then Armed and Leagued together againſt that Great Prince: And then it was, that the Dignity of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>France</hi> raiſed it ſelf to that Luſtre which it keeps to this day; for whereas they were before but Lieutenants of the Conſtable in the Kings Stables only, they from that time his Lieutenants alſo in the Command of the Armies, and ſince the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Dignity, exerciſe the whole remainder of the Authority annexed to it, which is conferred upon them, by putting a Staff of Command into their hands.</p>
                  <p>The Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> bear, as a mark of their Dignity, two <hi>Azure</hi> Staves, ſet with <hi>Flower-deluces</hi> of gold, paſſed <hi>Salteir-</hi>wiſe, behind their Coats of Arms.</p>
                  <p>Their Offices depend wholly of the Crown, and they are Sworn for them by the King himſelf: They are commonly given as recompences to Eminent
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:95022:182"/>
Commanders, for ſome great Military Exploits, and are not Hereditary: They cannot be deprived of the Title of their Dignities, but with the loſs of their Lives, only they may be ſuſpended from the Exerciſe of their Office. They are not obliged to take any Oath in Parliament no more than was the Conſtable.</p>
                  <p>The Provoſts of the Marſhals, or Provoſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals, are Royal Judges, eſtabliſhed in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince under the Authority and dependance of the Marſhals of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have Juriſdiction over all Vagabonds and people that are no Houſe-Keepers; and in many Caſes, over them that are Houſe-Keepers too, if they commit any Robberies on the High-way, if they be Incendiaries, Coiners of falſe money, or be guilty of wilful Murther, and other Crimes.</p>
                  <p>The Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> were at firſt but two in number, but ſince that, the neceſſity of Affairs has given occaſion ſometimes to the doubling of that number. There were four under <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, who were afterward reduced to the old number: <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, finding himſelf obliged to maintain three or four Armies, to oppoſe the great Enemies, which he had always to deal with, revived again the number of four, and ſoon after added a fifth, who was <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> Son of the Conſtable of that Name, by way of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to his Father, for the Office of Great Maſter of <hi>France,</hi> which he had reſigned by his Orders to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> but with this condition, that this fifth place ſhould be ſuppreſt upon the Death of the Firſt of the five that ſhould die: The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> made three during the time he was head of the League; and <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, when by the acknowledgment of his Subjects he came to be peaceable Poſſeſſour of the Kingdom, Created two of thoſe three Marſhals of <hi>France, viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban de Laval, Sieur de Bois Dauphin,</hi> and <hi>Claudius de la

                     <p>As to the Order obſerved in the Command of the Armies of <hi>France,</hi> they are always Commanded by one General in Chief, who has under him two Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Generals, who Command by turns every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, and under them there are two Camp, or Field-Marſhals, that change in the ſame manner, beginning with the Elder of the two. When the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:95022:189"/>
King Commands his Armies in Perſon, he has always two, or four Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> under him: And when any Prince of the Blood Commands them, he has commonly two Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> under him.</p>
                     <p>Every General has four Adjutants, or <hi>Aids de Camp,</hi> to carry about his Orders, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly young Noblemen, or ſometimes old Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
                     <p>A Lieutenant-General has at leaſt two <hi>Aids de Camp,</hi> and the Marſhals <hi>de Camp,</hi> or Field-Marſhals, have each of them one: Formerly there were Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Marſhals in every Army, but at preſent there are none, only Mr. <hi>de Fougerais</hi> is one, as being ſuch by Title of a ſtanding Office, though without act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſuch: Next are the Brigadeers, who are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from among the Camp-Maſters of oldeſt ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to Command Brigades compoſed of five or ſix Regiments of Horſe, Foot, and Dragoons: Next them are the Camp-Maſters that Command over the ſeveral Regiments of Horſe, and the Colonels in the Foot-Regiments, and then the Lieutenant-Colonels, a Major, and the Aid, or Adjutant-Majors, in the Foot-Regiments, but in the Cavalry, the Major is the ſecond Perſon; Next are the Captains of every Company, and in Companies of Light-Horſe; under every Captain there is a Lieutenant and a Corner, but in Companies of <hi>Genſd'arms,</hi> or of Foot, there are Lieutenants, and after them Enſigns inſtead of Cornets.</p>
                     <p>As for the Quarter-Maſters, or Marſhals of the Lodgings of the Armies; There is one Quarter-Maſter General of the Cavalry, who is <hi>M. de St. Martin,</hi> who enjoys it by Title of a ſtanding Office, who has under him ſeveral Adjutants, and <hi>Fouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> or Under-Quarter-Maſters: In the Body of the Infantry of every Army, there is a Major-General of the Brigades, from whom the Majors of every Brigade receive their Orders; Then there is a Quarter-Maſter for every Regiment, who having
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:95022:190"/>
known from his Superiours the Quarters allotted to his Regiment, divides and ſhares them out among the ſeveral Companies, and Orders the Quarter-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of each Company to lodge the Captains, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Souldiers accordingly.</p>
                     <p>The four Quarter-Maſters General at preſent of the Kings Camps and Armies are, <hi>M. Fougueux, M. de l' Anglée, M. Bolé,</hi> and <hi>M. du Verger:</hi> when they are in the Armies, they have every one two Harbingers, or Quarter-Maſters under them, who are paid by the King.</p>
                     <p>There is likewiſe one ſtanding <hi>Fourier,</hi> or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger of the Kings Camps and Armies, who is the <hi>Sieur de Couty.</hi> Now, becauſe there often have happened differences and conteſts among the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Horſe, and thoſe of Foot concerning place, and precedency of Command. It is ordered, that when they are both Incamped on a Plain, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Horſe ſhall have the Command, but when they are Poſted in any Incloſure, Retrenchment, or Barricado, in any place, then the Foot-Officers ſhall have the chief Command.</p>

                        <hi>Note,</hi> That in former time, when the <hi>French</hi> King went to Fight, they marched under the white Cornet of <hi>France,</hi> Accompanied with ſeveral Lords Voluntiers: But now it is no more in uſe.

                     <p>Of the Great Maſter of the Artillery.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Preſent Great Maſter of the Artillery of <hi>France,</hi> is <hi>Lewis de Crevant de Humieres,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>France,</hi> who is ſtiled, Great Maſter of the Artillery of <hi>France,</hi> and Super-Intendant General of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:95022:190"/>
the Powder and Salt-Peter; he is likewiſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Lieutenant-General of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and of the other Conqueſts made in the Low-Countries ſince the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty; He took the uſual Oath for this Office in <hi>September,</hi> 1685.</p>
                  <p>The Great Maſter of the Artillery, bears for a mark of his Office, under his Coat of Arms, two Canons, or Culverins, mounted on their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
                  <p>Before the Invention of Canon, there was a Great Maſter of the Croſs-bows, and Battery-Men, called <hi>Cranqueneers,</hi> who had the Super-intendance over all the Officers and Machines for Battery: The <hi>Cranquins</hi> were certain Engines then in uſe for Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Walls and Gates of Towns, not unlike thoſe we read of in the ſtories of all Nations of thoſe and elder times. It is the common opinion, that this Office has been ever ſince the time of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and in 1411, under <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth, the <hi>Sieur de Hangeſt</hi> was Great Maſter of the Croſsbow-Men; in lieu of which afterwards was ſubſtituted a Captain-General of the Powder of the Artillery; which Title was uſed till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, who in the year 1610. Erected it into an Office of the Crown, under the Title of Great-Maſter, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Maximilian de Bethune,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suilly,</hi> his Favourite.</p>
                  <p>At preſent in every Army of <hi>France,</hi> there is a Lieutenant of the Artillery, that has Command over all the Equipage of the Artillery, and takes care of its conducting, who depends of the Great Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The Great Maſter has the ſuper-intendance over all the Officers of the Artillery, as Canoneers, Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, Wheel-wrights, Rope-Makers, and other ſmall Officers, of which he keeps a Muſter-Roll in all the Kings Armies, in every one of which, he has his Lieutenants, although in Caſes belonging to their Offices, the Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> have likewiſe a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:95022:191"/>
over the ſaid Officers: It is the Great Maſter of the Artillery that gives Order for making all works in the Armies, as well at Sieges of Towns, and in their Marches, and he has power over all the Arſenals of <hi>France:</hi> He has alſo the charge of moſt of the Tents and Pavilions of the Army, and has the Seat of his Juriſdiction in the Arſenal at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Great Maſter of the Artillery is always Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Kings Fuſileers.</p>
                  <p>All caſt Mettal found in Conquered Towns, or rebellious places, at their taking, belongs to the Great Maſter of the Artillery, as his Fee, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times commands the very Bells to be taken down from the Steeples.</p>
                  <p>There are Lieutenant-Generals of the Artillery in the ſeveral Provinces, and in every Army, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal at preſent, are the Marquiſs <hi>de la Frezeliere, M. de Vigny,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel of the <hi>Fuſileers,</hi> and <hi>Bombardeers,</hi> and <hi>M. de Mets,</hi> Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Artillery of <hi>Flanders.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE preſent Admiral of <hi>France</hi> is the Count of <hi>Toulouze, Lewis-Alexander</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated of <hi>France,</hi> who is ſtiled Admiral, or Great Maſter of the Seas, and chief and ſuper-intendant of the Commerce and Navigation of <hi>France,</hi> being Conſtituted ſo in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> 1683.</p>
                  <p>The Great Admiral bears, for a mark of his Charge, two Anchors paſſed Salteir-Wiſe, behind his Coat of Arms.</p>
                  <p>The Admiral is one of the Officers of the Crown, and Commands in the Wars at Sea with the ſame Authority as did the Conſtable formerly, and at preſent the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> in thoſe by Land; The Power of this Office is very Great, and was much augmented by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Duke <hi>de Joyeuſe,</hi> one of his Favourites, that was then Admiral.</p>
                  <p>The Admiral grants out Commiſſions to Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers to Arm and put out to Sea againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the State, and has Power to make Truce with them upon the Sea, for three Weeks, of his own private Authority; without his leave no Veſſels can enter into any Port; he has the tenths of all the ſpoils taken at Sea: He is Judge in all Maritime Cauſes, and the Appeals from his Sentences are brought to the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> but he has no Place there by vertue of his Office. His Chief Court is kept at the <hi>Marble Table</hi> in the Palace at <hi>Paris,</hi> whither Appeals are brought from the Judges of his inferiour Courts; and he has his Officers, that
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:95022:192"/>
take cogniſance of all Delinquencies and Differences that ariſe, as well about Contracts and Agreements, made either for Warlike Affairs, or for Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, Fiſhing, and all other things whatever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Civil or Criminal, putting in under him what Lieutenant he pleaſes, he gives ſafe Conducts and Paſs-Ports by Sea, and Licenſes for Herring-Fiſhing and other Fiſhing, and cauſes Watch and Ward to be kept on the Sea-Coaſts, when there is occaſion, by thoſe who are ſubject to that Duty; and appoints Men of War to guard the Fiſher-Boats in time of Herring-Fiſhing.</p>
                  <p>The Name of Admiral was borrowed from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who came by Sea, pouring in like an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation, on the Chriſtians in <hi>Europe,</hi> and after having roved over all the Seas of this Quarter of the World, Conquered <hi>Spain,</hi> and from thence made deſcents into <hi>France,</hi> by the Coaſts of <hi>Guienne</hi> and <hi>Poitou;</hi> during the ſpace of ſuch long Wars, the <hi>French</hi> had frequent Communication with them, and he that Commanded in Chief over all the other Commanders of that ſo potent and formidable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Army, being commonly called in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, <hi>Amiral Muſulmin,</hi> that is to ſay, Prince of the <hi>True Believers,</hi> (for ſo thoſe Infidels affect to call themſelves) the <hi>French,</hi> who retained only the firſt Syllables of that Name, took occaſion out of the corruption of it to form the name of <hi>Amiral, i. e.</hi> Admiral, which is the Title they have ever ſince applied to their chief Commanders, or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals at Sea.</p>
                  <p>All Ships of War are to bear their Admirals Colours, and the Admirals own Ship bears a ſquare White Flag, upon her Main-Maſt, and a Lanthorn in his Poop.</p>
                  <p>He has a Sovereign Command over the Seas of <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially over all that part of the Ocean, and of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> near the Coaſts of <hi>France,</hi> and over all the Ships of War, and Naval Forces.</p>

                     <p>THE Chancellour is the Head-Officer of Juſtice, and of the Kings Councels, and into his hands he has wholly depoſited it, that he may diſtribute and diſpence it impartially to all his Subjects, with the ſame Power and Authority as he might do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Perſon: for this reaſon the Seals of <hi>France</hi> are committed to his Cuſtody, which he makes uſe of in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gifts, Graces and Offices, as he thinks moſt reaſonable for the good of the State. He preſides in the Kings Councels. 'Tis he that on all occaſions declares the Kings Pleaſure; and when his Majeſty goes to Parliament, to ſit on his Bed or Throne of Judgment, he ſits before his Majeſty on his left hand. He wears a Robe of red Velvet lined with Scarlet Sattin; and at publick Ceremonies, a Cap faſhioned like a Mortar, covered with gold, and adorned with Pearls and precious Stones: Before him march the Uſhers of the Chancellery, carrying on their Shoulders Maces of guilt Silver, and the reſt of the Uſhers after them.</p>

                     <p>When a Keeper of the Great Seal is made at any time, he has the ſame Authority given him as a Chancellour, only with this difference, that a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour is not depoſable, but by arraigning him at the Bar, and taking away his Life, whereas the Keeper of the Seals is an Officer changeable at the Kings Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The Original of the word Chancellour comes from this: All Letters Patents and Charters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly paſſing through his hands, when they were not well drawn up, or that any thing were found in them not conformable to Law and Cuſtom, he

                     <p>Of the Grand Council.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Grand Council, being at its Original, or firſt Inſtitution, the only Councils of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> the Princes of the Blood, Officers of the Crown, and chief Preſidents of the ſuperiour Courts, uſed to ſtile themſelves Councellours of it. Afterwards the Title of Councellour to the King in his Councils, was taken up inſtead of it, as ſoon as a plurality of Councils was erected. The Grand Council was reduced by <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, to 17 Councellours, and one Proctor-General, and ſince augmented by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, with three Councellours, to make up the number of twenty, and that ſerved by the half year; ſince that, the Advocates-General, and the Preſidents were added thereto, and the number of Councellours augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from time to time, by new Creations, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that at preſent, this Company is compoſed of eight Preſidents, ſerving by turns, four each half year; 54 Councellours, ſerving by turns, 27 each half year, two Advocates-General ſerving half a year apiece; and one Proctor-General who only is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perpetual.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:95022:203"/>
The half-yearly waiting times of the Councellours, begin in <hi>October,</hi> and <hi>April.</hi> Beſides theſe there are fourteen Councellours of Honour, or Titular Councellours in the Grand Council, who are Candidates as it were of it, and ſucceed in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies. There are likewiſe twelve Subſtitutes; or Deputies, one Regiſtrer or Recorder in Chief, five Secretaries, one Chief or firſt Uſher, twenty other Uſhers, and 23 Proctors.</p>
                  <p>The Juriſdiction of the Grand Council extends throughout all the whole Monarchy and Dominions of the King. At its firſt beginning, it had power to judge of Appeals from, and of the Regulations of Judges, and of the nullities and contrarieties of Sentences; of which Regulations of Judges, and contrarieties of Sentences, it ſtill takes Cogniſance; as alſo of the Juriſdiction of Preſidials, and of the Provoſts of the Merchants, and of whatſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends thereon, concerning the Honour, Function, and Regulation of their Offices. It alſo takes Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of all matters concerning Conſiſtorial Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Archbiſhopricks, Biſhopricks, Abbies, and Conventual Priories, and in general, of all other Benefices, that are at the Kings Nomination, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, Collation, or other Diſpoſal whatſoever, as well in reſpect of the Title to them, as of the Penſions charged on their Revenues, excepting the Regal Right, or Due. It alſo takes Cogniſance of the Duties belonging to the King from Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, upon the account of his joyful arrival to the Crown, and of thoſe due from Archbiſhops and Biſhops, when at their Inſtalments and Conſecrations they ſwear Fidelity to the King; of thoſe ariſing from the <hi>Indults,</hi> or Fees ſo called, of Cardinals, and other Prelates of the Kingdom; from the <hi>Indult</hi> of the Officers of the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> From the appellations of the Provoſtſhip of the Houſhold, of the Warren of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and from thoſe of the Chamber of the General Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:95022:203"/>
of the Hoſpitals, and Houſes for the ſick in <hi>France,</hi> from the Commiſſions of the Chief Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, for the Reports of dead Bodies, drowned and wounded, and all Statutes, or Orders of the ſaid Chief Phyſician, concerning Pharmacy; from the Execution of, or offences againſt the Statutes, or Orders of the Kings Chief Barber; and from Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals concerning the Perſons, Eſtates or Priviledges of the Great Orders of the Kingdom, as are thoſe of <hi>Chiny,</hi> the <hi>Ciſtercians,</hi> the premonſtrated Monks, <hi>Grandmont,</hi> the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Fontev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the withdrawing, concealing and imbezel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eccleſiaſtical Goods or Eſtates, and Immunities and Franchiſes, or Liberties of Eccleſiaſtick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and from ſeveral Appeals concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Subſtitutions of the Great Houſes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>The Solemn and Ceremonial Habits uſed in the Grand Council, are Robes of Black-Velvet, for the Preſidents, and Black-Satin Robes, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, Advocates, and Proctor-General, and the Recorder, or Regiſtrer.</p>
                  <p>The Great Council is a Court, that Judges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Appeal, and that follows the King, whenever it pleaſes his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The place where the Grand Council is held, is in the Cloiſter of the Church of St. <hi>Germains l' Auxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> near the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Chancellour is not only the Head and Chief of all the Kings Councils, but alſo the Head of the Chancery, ſince he has the Seals in keeping.</p>
                  <p>Now we have treated of the ſeveral Councils, it will be moſt proper in the next place, to ſpeak of the Officers of the Chancery in their order, and to explain what their Offices are.</p>

                     <head>Remarks concerning the Governours of Provinces.</head>
                     <p>The Governours and Lieutenants for the King in the Provinces, are what the Dukes were formerly, and the Governours of Towns, what the Earls or Counts were. Under every Duke there were twelve Counts, and over all the Dukes, there was one that was ſtiled Duke of the Dukes, or Duke of <hi>France,</hi> who was the Mayor of the Palace: The ſaid Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:95022:230"/>
of Dukes and Counts became Hereditary under <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> who having made himſelf King, every one of the other Great Men would needs make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter and Proprietour of the Government of which he was in Poſſeſſion. <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> to have their good will, winked at this Uſurpation, but yet being not willing on the other ſide, that the Royal Authority ſhould remain always Clouded, he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all theſe Dukes, and made an Agreement with them, by which he left them a lawful Succeſſion to all their reſpective States, but with condition how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that for lack of Heirs Male to ſucceed in a Right Line, or when the Poſſeſſours of them ſhould happen to be Attainted and Convinced of the Crime of Felony, they ſhould return to the Crown.</p>
                     <p>They that are well read in Hiſtory, have, without doubt, remarked the return of all theſe parcels to their principle by the one or the other of theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And becauſe the Quality of Mayor of the Palace, or of Count of <hi>Paris</hi> in which the firſt was Confounded, had ſerved him as it had done to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi> for a ſtep to arrive to the Throne, he ſuppreſt that too at the ſame time, for the better ſecuring of the Crown to his Succeſſours.</p>
                     <p>The Governours and Lieutenants for the King, in the Provinces, have under them the Governours of Towns, as the Dukes had the Counts; but with this difference, that the number of Governours of Towns that are under each Governour of a Province, is not determined, one Province having more Towns, and another fewer. The Power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Lieutenants-General of Provinces, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together like that of the ancient Dukes and Counts; which is, to keep in the Kings Obeyſance the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Places given them in Cuſtody, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in Peace and Tranquility, to have Power or Command over their Arms, to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Enemies, and againſt Seditious attempts, to keep the places well fortified and provided with
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:95022:231"/>
what is needful, and aſſiſt the Execution of Juſtice, every one in his reſpective Government. But at the beginning, when theſe Governours were firſt eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, there were none but only in the Frontier Towns; but becauſe in the time of the Civil Wars, all the Provinces became Frontier, there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of placing Governours, not only in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, but in all the Towns.</p>
                     <p>Their Commiſſions are verified in the Parliaments of their reſpective Provinces, in which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the ſame Provinces have place, ordinarily next after the Chief Preſidents. They are only ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Commiſſions, whoſe Continuation depends only of the Kings ſole Pleaſure, though ſome years paſt, there were crept in ſome abuſes in this affair, and the Governours were become, as it were, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That all the Lieutenants-General of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Lieutenants of particular Towns and Places, are ſtiled Lieutenants for the King, becauſe they are put in by the King, and have no dependance on the Chief Governour, under whoſe Command they are.</p>

                     <p>JUſtice was formerly adminiſtred by the Kings themſelves, who render'd it in Perſon to their People; but Affairs multiplying every day more and more, the Kings were obliged to eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that Burden, reſerving to themſelves only the Cogniſance of Affairs of State. And for the Adminiſtration of Ordinary Juſtice, he eſtabliſhed a certain Council, which they called, a Parliament, which judged and decided all Cauſes and Affairs, both Civil and Criminal, between Man and Man; and that without Appeal, in which, were preſent, all the Peers of <hi>France,</hi> both Eccleſiaſtical and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: This Parliament followed the King in all his Voyages; and conſequently, for that reaſon, was in thoſe times, Ambulatory. It was firſt Inſtituted by <hi>Pepin</hi> in the year 757, and was doubtleſs the ſame thing that the Privy-Council is now. But at length the Kings parted with this Council in favour of their people; And <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair was the firſt that made the Parliament Sedentary, and gave them a part of his Palace at <hi>Paris,</hi> to be the Seat of that Auguſt Senate, which by the Integrity of its Decrees and Sentences, has acquired ſo great a Reputation among all Nations, that Popes, Emperours, Kings, and Foreign Princes, have voluntarily ſubmitted
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:95022:232"/>
their differences to their Judgments; as may be ſeen by ſeveral Examples in Hiſtory, and among others, by that of the Emperour <hi>Frederick,</hi> with Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth, and of the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> with the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>

Formerly, All the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> had ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Place and Voice in Parliament: They ſtill uſe the Title of Councellours to the King in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Abbot of St. <hi>Denis</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> are Counſellers by their Places in this Parliament, where they place in ordinary, and a deliberative Voice. Four of the Maſters of Requeſts have likewiſe the ſame Priviledge, as alſo the Honorary Counſellours of this Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> has this particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence above the reſt, that it alone is called, the Court of the Peers, where the Dukes and Peers of <hi>France</hi> ought to be ſworn, and where they are to be judged too, when they are impeacht of any Crime; And though in the laſt Reign it was ſeen, that <hi>de facto,</hi> the Marſhal <hi>de Marillac</hi> was Judged by Delegated Commiſſaries, and the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> by the Parliament of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> pretends, That theſe two Acts were done againſt their Priviledges.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Counſellers of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> pretend a Priviledge to ſit in all the other Parliaments, without allowing the ſame Priviledge reciprocally to the Counſellers of the other Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> yet it is to be remarked, That the Priviledge of ſitting in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris</hi> was granted to the Counſellers of the Parliament of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> by an Ordinance of <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, in the year 1454. which the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> refuſed to verifie; whereupon, the Parliament of <hi>Toulouze</hi> made a Decree in the year 1466. by which they Ordained, That the Counſellers of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhould have no Admittance into the Parliament of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> till they had obey'd the aboveſaid Ordinance, made in their Favour: Thirdly, The other Parliaments, not having that extent of Juriſdiction as the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> have but one Chamber of Inqueſts, the Parliament of <hi>Toulouze</hi> but two, whereas the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> has ſix.</p>

The Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> opens every year the next day after St. <hi>Martins</hi> Day, in this manner, The whole Body being in their Scarlet Robes, go to a ſolemn Maſs, Celebrated on that occaſion, in the Great Hall of the Palace; after which, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates and Proctors are ſworn in the Grand Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the Biſhop that ſaid Maſs, has that day Place, and a deliberative Voice among them. The Parliament continues ſitting from that time till the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> after which follows the Vacati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: During which Receſs nevertheleſs, there ſits a Chamber called the Chamber of the Vacations, which takes Cogniſance of thoſe Cauſes that require ſpeedy diſpatch, and Criminal Affairs.</p>
                  <p>In the five Chambers of Inqueſts, all Proceſſes, or Suits, are Judged, concluded, and received by Writing, that they may the better diſcern whether the Appeals made to this High Court of Parliament, be made reaſonably or no.</p>
                  <p>The fourteen Preſidents of the Chambers of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and of thoſe of the Requeſts, which are two, are but Counſellers that have accepted that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and when the Parliament is met, and marches in State, they take place among thoſe of the Grand Chamber, according to a Regulation of Parliament of the <hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1677.

                  <p>This Chamber was eſtabliſhed at <hi>Paris,</hi> according to the Regiſter of the <hi>Sieur de Juſt,</hi> under the reign of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſince which, <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair, when he made the Parliament Sedentary at <hi>Paris,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſht that at the ſame time: At its firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, it conſiſted but of two Preſidents, of which the firſt, who was a Clergyman, was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſome Archbiſhop or Biſhop, and the other a Lay-man, or for the moſt part they were both Clergymen, of ſix Maſters of Accounts, <hi>viz.</hi> Three Clergymen, and three Laymen. <hi>Philip</hi> the Long added thereto, another Maſter Clergy-man, that there night be always two in the Chamber to hear the Accounts, and two below, to correct them: and eight Clerks, two of which were to keep the accounts, one to keep the Journal for Regiſtring Affairs, and the five other to look after the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Examination of the Accounts, according to the Ordinance of the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1319. Since that, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fair added another Lay-Maſter, and another Clergy-man Maſter. <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Court of <hi>Aids</hi> is compoſed of ſix Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and of forty Councellours, divided into three Chambers: In the firſt, is the firſt, or Chief Preſident, and the eldeſt of the other Preſidents, with fifteen Councellers of the longeſt ſtanding: In the ſecond Chamber, there are two Preſidents, and thirteen Councellers; and in the third, two Preſidents and twelve Councellers.</p>
                  <p>The Court of Aids was erected ſoon after the Parliament was made Sedentary at <hi>Paris.</hi> And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the Parliaments of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Toulouze,</hi> it precedes in antiquity all the other Parliaments.

<pb n="467" facs="tcp:95022:239"/>
the Royal Houſholds, and of thoſe of the Princes of the Bloud, are Regiſtred in this Court. And all the Officers named upon the Rolls of the ſaid Books, have no other ſupreme Judges to have recourſe to in relation to the Aids, or Taxes, but thoſe of this Court, though their Seats or Dwellings be within the Precincts of the Juriſdiction of the other Courts of Aids.</p>

                     <p>Of the Court of Monies, or Coynage.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>UNder the very firſt Race of our Kings, there were three Generals of the Monies of <hi>France,</hi> who were made Sedentary at <hi>Paris,</hi> at the ſame time as the Parliament. The like Offices were Created in the reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair, and in ſome other Reigns, and annexed to the Chamber of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, from theſe Generals of the Monies or Coins, as they are ſtiled, were ſeparated in the year 1358. They have judged, without Appeal, both in Civil and Criminal matters, within their Juriſdiction, ever ſince the year 1551. under <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, who gave them the Title of the Court of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or Coinage. They take place in all Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, next after the Court of Aids.</p>
                  <p>Their Habits on ſolemn occaſions are theſe; the Preſidents wear Black-Velvet Robes, the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, the Kings Advocates, and Proctor-General, and the Chief Recorder, Black-Satin ones, and the Chief, or firſt Uſher, one of Black Taffaty.</p>
                  <p>This Court gives Audience on <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays,</hi> to the Advocates and Proctors of the Parliament; and ſits in a Room above the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Accounts, from whence the Chief Preſident of it, is reconducted every day, by the Uſhers, as far as the bottom of the great Stairs, before the lower Holy Chappel, as is the Chief Preſident of the Chamber of Accounts. This Court Judges without Appeal, of all Cauſes relating to Monies, Metals, Mines and Weights, and the Officers and Artificers employed therein; as alſo of all things that concern the fabrick, title, currantneſs, value

                  <p>There are two Preſidents, and ſeveral Counſellers, whoſe Offices are fixt, that go every year to viſit the Provinces. In this Court are kept, with great care, the Original Standard weights of <hi>France,</hi> from which are taken thoſe of the ſeveral Towns of the Kingdom. One of the Councellers, who is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>M. Chaſſebras du Breau,</hi> has been deputed and authoriſed ever ſince the year 1668. to look after the keeping a general Uniformity in all the Weights and marks of <hi>France;</hi> and accordingly, cauſes all publick weights, when they are conformable to the Kings Standard, to be markt with the Kings mark, which is a <hi>Flower-deluce;</hi> and that <hi>Gratis,</hi> and without exacting any Fees.</p>
                  <p>The preſent Chief Preſident of this Court, is <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho'as Cotignon de Chauvry,</hi> Lord of <hi>Chawvry,</hi> and of <hi>Breüil,</hi> &amp;c. There are beſides, eight other Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, twenty nine Councellers, two Advocates, and one Proctor-General, one Subſtitute, or Deputy to the Proctor-General, who is likewiſe the Kings Proctor in the general Provoſtſhip of the Monies of <hi>France;</hi> and one other Subſtitute, who is likewiſe an Aſſeſſour in the general Provoſtſhip of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or Mint: One Recorder, or Regiſtrer in Chief, one Chief Uſher, and ſeventeen other Uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; beſides which, there is a Provoſt-General of the Monies or Mint, and Marſhalſy of <hi>France,</hi> who takes place after the laſt Councellour, when he comes thither to bring the Criminal Proceſſes to be judged, that he has drawn up and taken informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of.</p>
                  <p>There are likewiſe ſeveral Lieutenants, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts, one Aſſeſſour, ſome Regiſtrers, and ſixty Archers, or Guards.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Treaſurers General of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is almoſt as ancient as the Monarchy, were Erected into generalities, about the year 1450. which were eſtabliſht in divers parts of the Kingdom, to judge of all matters relating to the Crown Lands, and the Kings Revenues. They are of the Body of the Sovereign Companies, or Courts, and injoy the ſame Priviledges as the Chamber of Accounts, in which they have Place, ſitting, Voice, and opinion deliberative, or freedom of debating, as they have likewiſe in the Court of Aids, when they go thither about any important affairs. They have likewiſe place and ſitting in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Councellours, when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them to go thither for the Kings bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or that of the publick, and are Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries by their Places, of the Sovereign Chambers of the frank, or free Fiefs, or Tenures, of the Crown Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are reckoned among the Kings Domeſtick Officers, that are Commoners in his Houſhold, and enjoy all Priviledges as ſuch. And in that Quality they are ſworn to the King, by the Chancellour, before they are admitted to their Offices. They give out all Orders concerning the Buildings and Reparations of all Royal Houſes, of Palaces where Courts of Juſtice are held of Preſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:95022:241"/>
Bayliwicks, Seneſchalſies, Provoſtſhips, and other Royal Juriſdictions, and of Bridges, Cauſeys, Pavements, and other publick works; but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and ſome other Royal Houſes, were diſmembred from their Office and Care, when the <hi>Sieur de Fourey,</hi> Treaſurer of <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> cauſed the Office of Super-intendant of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be Erected, of which he got himſelf provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Patent, ſelling his former place of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Letters of ennobling, reſtoration of Blood, Naturalization, Legitimation, Aubaine, or Grant of deceaſed Strangers Goods or Eſtates, Diſinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Erections of Lands into Baronies, Marquiſates, Counties and Dutchies; and all Letters of Donation, Impoſt or Toll, Penſions, and other Letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kings Crown-Lands, are to be addreſſed to them to be Regiſtred in their Office.</p>
                  <p>All Levies of Taxes are to be made by vertue of Letters Patents addreſſed to them, after they have given in to the King, and the Lords of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, the Departments made by them of the Taxes upon the Elections, in Execution of the Brief, or Brevets, his Majeſty directs every year to them, for that effect; upon which Letters they make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances to his Majeſty, when need requires, and ſend their annexed Schedules, or Bills, and Commands to the Perſons Elected, to lay Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accordingly on the Pariſhes within their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Elections. That Impoſition is made in the generality of <hi>Paris,</hi> by the Treaſurers of <hi>France,</hi> and other Commiſſaries diſtributed throughout the ſeveral Elections depending of that generality, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go and preſide, in order to make a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſaid Taxes, together with the Officers thereto belonging. They afterwards ſend to the general and particular Receivers, the Accounts, or Calculations, of recovering or collecting the ſaid Taxes, in order to their receiving them.</p>

                     <pb n="472" facs="tcp:95022:242"/>
The ſame method is to be uſed in levying all the other Monies raiſed in the Kingdom, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever they be.</p>
                  <p>There are two Receivers-General of the <hi>Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or Revenues in the generality of <hi>Paris,</hi> and two Comptrollers-General of the Domain, or Crown-Lands, and Treaſure; which were Commiſſionated in 1670.</p>
                  <p>All the Officers of the Elections of the Granaries of Salt, and all the Officers concerned in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the general, or particular receits thereof, or the Commiſſioners for the Receit of the Royal <hi>Deniers,</hi> or Monies, are admitted and ſworn by theſe Treaſurers, and give up their Accounts there truly and exactly before they give them up to the Chamber of Accounts.</p>
                  <p>They are great Seers, or Surveyours, and have the Direction, Oeconomy, and Policy of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys, particularly of that of <hi>Paris,</hi> as well for the High-ways, and for hindring all Enterpriſes that may be made in them, as for the Buildings, and all advances, jettings out, incumbrances, and nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances of High-ways, Views, or Proſpects, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ways and paſſages; And all Letters Patent for the removal, changing, and ſtopping up, or inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of High-ways, and the like matters, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to them, as perſons to whom the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the Cauſe belongs, and the parties therein concerned, are cited, and plead before them, where Juſtice is rendred them without further Appeal.</p>
                  <p>There are twenty three Generalities in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France,</hi> and twenty three Treaſurers of <hi>France</hi> in every Office, the firſt of which, is at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> in the Palace near St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Chappel.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Juriſdiction of the Waters and Foreſts, is very ancient, and of a very great extent. It was eſtabliſht to hinder the Abuſes, Delinquencies, and Miſdemeanours, which might be committed in the Kings Woods, which are the goodlieſt part of his Crown-Lands; it likewiſe takes cogniſance of the ſame abuſes committed in the Woods, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Princes of the Blood, and other Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to Prelats, Gentlemen, and other private Perſons, as alſo to Communities, or Corporations. It alſo takes cogniſance, both primarily, and by way of Appeal, of all Enterpriſes, or attempts made in Woods, Warrens, Rivers, Iſles, Iſlets, Mills, Fiſhings, Chaces, and of all Proceſſes, or Suits, both Civil and Criminal, ariſing upon thoſe Accounts, between any Perſons, of what Quality ſoever, nay, and of thoſe too that concern the very Fund, or propriety it ſelf in any of them, and all Regulations of Cuſtoms, thirds and tenths of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Woods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

This Chamber is held in the Great Hall of the Palace, near the <hi>Parquet,</hi> or Bar, of the Kings Advocates, and Proctor-General in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Its Juriſdiction extends farther than that of the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> for beſides the Appeals of Maſterſhips of the Game, and of the particular Courts of Juſtice of private Lords, in relation to the Waters and Foreſts, that are within the limits of the Juriſdiction of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> It receives likewiſe thoſe of the other Parliaments, where there is not as yet any Marble Table; as of thoſe of <hi>Grenoble, Bourdeaux, Dijon, Aix, Pau,</hi> and <hi>Mets.</hi> And it has likewiſe an over-ruling Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Waters and Foreſts of other Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The principal Officers of the Maſterſhips and Captainſhips of the Game, and of the <hi>Louvetry,</hi> or Wolf-Hunting, are admitted in this Chamber, or Court.</p>
                  <p>Dukes and Peers proceed in all Caſes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in this Court rather than in any other Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for the Waters and Foreſts under other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, although the things conteſted about, be ſcituate within the extent of the Juriſdiction of thoſe other Parliaments. They have there too, the like priviledge as in the Grand Chamber, in which they can have no remedy for theſe kinds of affairs, as they may have in all other Caſes; becauſe the Ordinances made for this purpoſe attribute to this Court the full and plenary cogniſance of all Cauſes belonging to it, privatively and excluſively to all other Judges, notwithſtanding any <hi>Committimus,</hi> or any other priviledge whatſoever. It is divided into two ſorts of Juriſdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> Ordinary and Extraordinary. From the Ordinary Juriſdiction, Appeals may be made to the Parliament; but in the Extraordinary Juriſdiction, all Proceſſes, or Suits concerning Reformations, Miſdemeanours, Delinquencies and Degradations, relating to Woods,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:95022:244"/>

                  <p>When the Grand Maſters of the Waters and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts are pleaſed to come to this Court, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly preſide there, and the Judgments paſſed there are intitled by their names in this manner.</p>

                  <p>AS ſoon as the ſumm his Majeſty is pleaſed to impoſe on his people, is reſolved on in his Royal-Council, Commiſſions are ſent to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers-General of <hi>France,</hi> eſtabliſht in the Offices of the ſeveral Generalities: Which Commiſſions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the ſaid Treaſurers General, to divide the ſumm which they are Commanded to levy upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, within the extent of their reſpective Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, into as juſt and equal proportions as they poſſibly can; which done, they ſend them to the Elects, who are the Judges of the Elections, (which we have already deſcribed in ſpeaking of the Election of <hi>Paris)</hi> with an Order an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed thereunto, by which they are Commanded to levy juſt ſuch a ſumm, neither more nor leſs, within the extent of their Elections. The Elects
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:95022:253"/>
thereupon, aſſemble, and draw up Tax-Rolls, by which they aſſeſs the Cities, Boroughs, and Villages, within their ſeveral Elections, and afterwards ſend thoſe Rolls to every Pariſh, who chuſe Collectors of the ſaid Taxes out of the Inhabitants of the ſame Pariſhes. Which Collectors are obliged again to make particular Rolls for their Pariſhes, and to aſſeſs every one of the Inhabitants of the ſame, in ſuch juſt proportions, according to their reſpective abilities and capacities, as will make up the ſumm charged on their Pariſhes, and then to levy the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſo aſſeſſed, and carry it to the Receivers of the Taxes for every Election, and they again are to return it to the General Receivers of their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who tranſmit it to the Treaſure Royal.</p>
                  <p>The Taxes are paid only by thoſe of the third Eſtate of the Kingdom, that is to ſay, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants called <hi>Roturiers,</hi> who are no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, dwelling in Town not Free, and in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs and Villages, according to the proportion of Goods they have that are Taxable, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever they be, and in what place ſoever ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate, except in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where only Lands and immovable Goods are taxable, ſo that the <hi>Roturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> or Peaſants, pay nothing for the noble Fiefs, or Lands they hold there in Knights Fee, but on the contrary, the Gentlemen pay for the Lands they hold in Villenage there, becauſe the Taxes there are real, and not perſonal.</p>
                  <p>Churchmen, Gentlemen, and Perſons ennobled by Patent, are exempt from Taxes, as likewiſe are the Officers of the Sovereign Courts of Judicature, the Kings Secretaries, the Officers that are Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Kings Houſhold, that ſerve there actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, either by the quarter, or the half year, and which receive at leaſt 60 Livers yearly Salary, and whoſe names are in the Rolls, or Books of Accounts, Regiſtred in the Court of Aids; and the <hi>Veterans,</hi> or ſuperannuated Perſons and Widows of the above-ſpecified
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:95022:253"/>
Officers, during their Widow-hood, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided nevertheleſs, they make no Traffick of any thing but what is of the growth of their own Lands, which they may ſell freely, but they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar'd from Farming any Lands of other Perſons, without paying.</p>
                  <p>The Officers of the preſidial Courts, Bayliwicks, Seneſchalſies, Provoſtſhips, Vigueries, Waters and Foreſts, Cuſtoms of things Exported. Elections, Salt Granaries, and of all other Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Juriſdictions in the Kingdom, are exempt from Taxes, and from Watching and Warding, as is amply expreſſed in his preſent Majeſties Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Month of <hi>February,</hi> 1674.</p>
                  <p>The Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of other free or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged Towns, are likewiſe exempt from Taxes. The Impoſition called the <hi>Taillon,</hi> or little Tax, was eſtabliſht by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond in the year 1549. to augment the pay of the Souldiers: This Duty is paid by the ſame perſons that pay the Taxes, and with the ſame compulſion, and amounts to about a third part of the Income of the Taxes.</p>
                  <p>Subſiſtance Money is another Duty, which has been begun to be levied but of late years. It is ſo called, becauſe it is raiſed for the ſubſiſtance of the Souldiers in their Winter-Quarters; upon payment of which, people were for a while exempted from lodging Souldiers, in Winter time. This Duty is paid too in the ſame manner as the two former. Theſe Duties are called Real, in reſpect of Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Goods, perſonal in reſpect of ones place of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and mixt, in reſpect of the proportion of peoples ability, or ſufficiency; to diſtinguiſh them from the Aids, which are only Impoſitions real, as we ſhall afterward further explain.</p>

                  <p>THE Duties the King takes upon Salt, are called <hi>the Gabels.</hi> It is hard to find the original of them, ſo ancient are they; only we find, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Long, about the year 1318. took a <note n="*" place="margin">The ſixth part of a Penny.</note> double upon every pound of Salt; and that under <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth; this Duty was already united to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, or Revenue of the Crown-Lands, contrary to the opinion of thoſe that attribute the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, to <hi>Philip de Valois.</hi> In the Ordinance of King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, made in the year 1542. It is ſaid, that a <note n="†" place="margin">A Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure being ſomething above half a Buſhel.</note> Muid of Salt ſhall be ſold for 20 Livers. The <hi>Gabels,</hi> or Duties on Salt were ſold by <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, to the Inhabitants of the Countries of <hi>Poitou, Xaintonge, Aunis, Angoulême,</hi> Higher and Lower <hi>Limoſin,</hi> and the Higher and Lower <hi>March</hi> of <hi>Perigord,</hi> in the year 1553. and
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:95022:254"/>
thoſe Provinces, for that reaſon are called the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of free Salt: The Town of <hi>Callice,</hi> and the Reconquer'd Countries, when they came from under the Dominion of the Engliſh, to return to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchs, demanded like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſame priviledge of having their Salt free.</p>
                  <p>There are three Parties, or Diviſions for the <hi>Gabels, viz.</hi> 1. That of the Country of <hi>Lyons,</hi> or <hi>Languedoc.</hi> 2. That of the Dauphinate, and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence.</hi> And 3. That of the reſt of <hi>France,</hi> which is called the Grand Party. The Farmers of the <hi>Gabels</hi> are obliged to buy all the Salt at the Salt-Pits, at a certain price, to pay there the Kings Duties, and to convey it at their own Charges, Perils, and Fortunes, to the Granaries eſtabliſhed by the King, where they are to deliver out the Salt to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by a Commiſſioner for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>There are certain Officers eſtabliſhed over the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Granaries, which are, One Preſident, two Granateers, or Granary-Keepers, three Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and one Advocate, and one Proctor for the King, who iſſue Proceſs out againſt ſuch as make bad Salt, and judge of the goodneſs of the Salt, and of the quantity requiſite for the extent-of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, look after the Weights and Meaſures, and take care it be not ſold above the Kings ſet price. The Salt is diſtributed two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> By way of Impoſition, or voluntarily, according to the diſcretion and will of the Buyers. They that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit within the extent of the Granaries of Impoſt, which are fixed in the Frontier Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or that live near the Countries, that have the priviledge of free Salt, from whence Salt may be eaſily brought to them, are obliged to take every year, a certain quantity of Salt, proportionable to their Family, but at the voluntary Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, every one takes but what he pleaſes; And ſo you ſee, that the <hi>Gabel</hi> is perſonal at the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Treaſure-Royal, or Exchequer, formerly called <hi>L' Epargne,</hi> or Spare-Treaſury, is in <hi>France</hi> what the <hi>Aerarium Populi</hi> was at <hi>Rome.</hi> It is as 'twere a Sea, into which all the Receiving Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well general as particular, of the Taxes, Taillons, Subfiſtance-Money, and in fine, of the Kings whole Revenue, like ſo many Rivulets and Rivers, diſcharge themſelves; and in which, all the Treaſurers eſtabliſht for the payment and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Kings Money, come and take the ſumms needful for the Adminiſtration of their ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as for the expences of the Royal Houſholds, for the payment of the Souldiery, who have their Treaſurers, both Ordinary and Extraordinary, which are the Treaſurers for the Ordinary, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers for the Extraordinary Expences of the Wars; The Treaſurers of the Navy, who have charge of the payment of the Naval Army, and of all the Ships the King puts to Sea; The Treaſurers of
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:95022:256"/>
the Fortifications; The Pay-Maſters of the Rents of the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> or Town-Houſe of <hi>Paris;</hi> and the Pay-Maſters of the Officers of the Sovereign Courts, with many others.</p>
                  <p>The Treaſurer of the <hi>Epargne,</hi> or Spare-Treaſure, was put in the place of the Ancient Receiver-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, by <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond made that Office Alternative, ſo that in his time, there were two; The Late King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth made it Triennial, as he did all the other Offices that were accountable, or handled Money, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Kings Minority, they were about to make it Quadriennial, or to be executed by four, every one in his year, as likewiſe all the other accountable Offices. The King uſed to ſtile them the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and Treaſurers of his <hi>Epargne,</hi> or Spare-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>They that poſſeſſed theſe Offices, had 12000 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Salary, and three <note n="*" place="margin">A Denier is the twelfth part of a Penny.</note> Deniers out of every Liver they handled, and every time they handled it, whether in receiving, or paying it, and ſo took the ſaid Deniers every time any Money was brought to, or carried out of the ſaid Treaſury, which amounted to a very great ſumm. At preſent this Office is alternatively executed by <hi>M. Steven Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannot de Bartillat,</hi> and <hi>M. Gedeon de Mets,</hi> under the Title of Keepers of the Treaſury-Royal.</p>
                  <p>The Keepers of the Treaſury-Royal uſually pays every year, all the Gifts and Gratuities given by the King, or otherwiſe they give in lieu of them, aſſignations or Bills, acquitting the Parties of ſo much as the King has been pleaſed to grant them.</p>
                  <p>There are three Offices of Treaſurer of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Caſual, or Caſual Revenue, <hi>viz.</hi> The ancient one, the Alternative one, and a Quadriennial one, was going to be eſtabliſhed, but that the three firſt bought off this fourth Office. Formerly, there was but one at the time of the eſtabliſhment of the
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:95022:256"/>
venality of accountable Offices, by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth. Their Office is to receive all the Money ariſing from the Sale of Offices; but ſince the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, ſeveral Offices are become He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, upon condition of paying every year a certain Duty or Fee, which is therefore called the annual Duty, or the <hi>Paulette.</hi> But if it happen, that any Officer, having not paid the aforeſaid Duty, die before he reſign his Office, or ſurvives not forty days after his Reſignation of it, then the Treaſurer of the Parties Caſual, has power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Office for the Kings profit.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Of the Faculty of Arts, of the Rector, and of the four Nations.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Faculty of Arts is the Mother of all the Reſt, and for which Schools were firſt Founded.</p>
                  <p>The Head of the whole Univerſity, who is called the Rector, is always choſen out of this Body, and never out of the other Faculties: This Rector has ſo great a power over the other Faculties, that he can make them ceaſe all publick Acts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; and on the days he makes his ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, which is four times a year, he forbids the Preachers to go up into the Pulpit. For theſe ſolemn Proceſſions, all the Faculties aſſemble in the <hi>Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi> Convent, in the <hi>Rue St. Jaques,</hi> and from thence march in order, to the Church appointed by the Rector, who is accompanied thither by the Doctors of the three ſuperiour Faculties, by the Maſters of Arts, and a great number of Religious Men. He being the Head of that Univerſity, which
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:95022:259"/>
the Kings of <hi>France</hi> treat as their Eldeſt Daughter, as it is reported, takes place of all ſorts of Perſons, excepting the Princes of the Blood, and ought at publick Acts in his Univerſity, take place of the Popes Nuntio, of Ambaſſadours, Cardinals, and the Dukes and Peers of <hi>France.</hi> At the Funeral Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of Kings, he marches ſide by ſide in an equal Rank with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt he injoys this Dignity, he wears a Violet-Coloured Girdle, the trimming of his Gloves is alſo of Violet-Colour. His ſolemn Habit is a Violet-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Gown, with a ſilk Girdle of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with golden Taſſels, at the end of which hangs a Purſe of Violet-Coloured Velvet, called an <hi>Eſcarcelle,</hi> trimmed with gold Buttons and Galoon. He wears over his Gown a little Mantle of white Ermine, which reaches down, round about, half way his Arms.</p>
                  <p>This Dignity is Elective, and laſts but three Months, unleſs it be thought convenient (as ſometimes it happens) to continue it to one Perſon, two or three times together.</p>
                  <p>The Faculty of Arts is divided into four Nations, which are, 1. The Nation of <hi>France.</hi> 2. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Picardie.</hi> 3. The Nation of <hi>Normandy.</hi> And 4. The Nation of <hi>Germany.</hi> The Titles, or Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes, aſſumed by theſe ſeveral Nations, when their Proctor ſpeaks for them in publick Aſſemblies, are, 1. <hi>Honoranda Gallorum Natio,</hi> the Honourable Nation of the <hi>French. 2. Fideliſſima Picardorum Natio,</hi> the moſt Loyal, or Faithful Nation of the <hi>Picards. 3. Veneranda Normannorum Natio,</hi> the Venerable Nation of the <hi>Normans.</hi> And 4. <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſima Germanorum Natio,</hi> the moſt conſtant Nation of the <hi>Germans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The three ſuperiour Faculties likewiſe, when they ſpeak, have their peculiar Titles; for the Faculty of Divinity ſtiles it ſelf, <hi>Sacra Theologiae Facultas,</hi> the Sacred Faculty of Divinity; the Faculty of Law,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:95022:259"/>
                     <hi>Conſultiſſima Decretorum Facultas,</hi> the moſt wiſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Decrees; and the Faculty of Phyſick, <hi>Saluberrima Medicorum Facultas,</hi> the moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Faculty of the Phyſicians.</p>
                  <p>There are in this Univerſity, many Colledges, in which are maintain'd ſeveral Regents, and Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Profeſſours, that teach the Humanities, or Learning of the leſſer Schools, which they do by Claſſes, and the Sciences, Tongues, and Philoſophy. So that in this Univerſity, is taught all in one Houſe, whatever is taught, both in the inferiour Schools, and Univerſities of <hi>England.</hi> So that there is no need of fitting youth before-hand, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Schools, for Univerſities in <hi>France,</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> they running through the whole Circle of Learning in one Colledge; where for better help to youth, there is a different Regent in every Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, which are all in diſtinct Rooms; and they have Preceptors, or Tutors beſides to help them in their Exerciſes. There are maintain'd in theſe Colledges too ſome few Foundation Scholars called <hi>Bourſiers,</hi> or Burſers, but the Colledges ſubſiſt moſt by Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, or Borders; and it is free for any of what Nation ſoever to lie any where in the Town, and yet go and learn in the Claſſes, and hear Lectures, upon doing which, they have as much priviledge to take their Degrees, as thoſe that reſide in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ſo that the number of Students lying in the Town, doſt vaſtly exceed that of thoſe that reſide in Colledges; And the number of them is indeed prodigiouſly great; the Youth not only of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>France,</hi> but of all other <hi>Europaean</hi> Nations, flocking hither to ſtudy. Beſides what is performed in the Colledges, that depend of the Univerſity. There are likewiſe Lecturers and Profeſſors of Royal Foundation, for teaching of the Oriental Tongues, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Greek, Hebrew, Arabian, Syriack, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean, Samaritan,</hi> and other Tongues; as alſo the Mathematicks, and Phyſick, as alſo Philoſophy, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:95022:260"/>
and the Latin Tongue, all which, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Royal Colledge, by Profeſſors paid by the King.</p>
                  <p>Philoſophy is alſo taught there in <hi>French</hi> by ſome Perſons, as of late by the deceaſed <hi>M. de L' Eclache,</hi> with ſucceſs enough. There are alſo Academies for Natural Philoſophy: Some parts of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are alſo taught there by private Men, as Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy by Mr. <hi>Sanſon,</hi> and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are alſo many Maſters of the Modern and living Tongues.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo worth our remark, that at certain times in the year, there are ſeveral particular and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Exerciſes performed in <hi>Paris;</hi> As in the Nave of the Church of St. <hi>Germains</hi> Abby, there is every <hi>Sunday,</hi> a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Sermon Preached at half an hour paſt two in the Afternoon; a <hi>Latin</hi> Sermon at the Great <hi>Cordeliers</hi> Church, on St. <hi>Bonaventures</hi> Day, as likewiſe at the <hi>Auguſtins, Bernardins,</hi> and <hi>Jacobins,</hi> on the Days of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and St. <hi>Dominick;</hi> and on the Day of <hi>Quaſimodo,</hi> there is a High Maſs ſung in <hi>Greek,</hi> in the <hi>Cordeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Church, for the Confraternity of the Pilgrims of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and of the Holy Sepulcher, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of which, there is a <hi>Greek</hi> Sermon.
