            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe answer lately published to my discourse concerning the Abatement of usury was so farre from surprising mee, that, indeed, it was no other then I long expected and much desired; Not from any overweening of my own cause, (which yet perhaps would justifie some degree of confidence,) But from a reall wish, that important truths may be cleared, which they can hardly be, till they have been roundly contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and severely scanned: And therefore I am in the first place to thank my plain dealing Adversary for this Opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming the Argument, That by due enquiry, either Convincing my Errour, or Confirming my judgement, the impartial Reader may be however satisfied.</p>
            <p>When first I saw it, and observed its bulke, I looked at least for some Arguments which had never been offered before, and prepared my self with much curiosity to read it; But finding my Expectation herein disappointed, I could not but take it for a happy Omen, that since the reasons urged for the present fall are either parallel, or certainly more pregnant than those in former times, and the objections against it, little or nothing Varied, the like suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse would probably attend it.</p>
            <p>It was then with equal tumult and acrimony suggested, that no wisdom could foresee the tragical consequences; That half our cash would be buried under ground, and the rest exported to better profit; That no young beginner could ever hope to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row five pounds; That wee should be beggered meerly by the with-drawing of forraign Loanes; That eight per cent, was not worth whistling after, nor scarce telling; That Brokage and securities would be intolerable, that lawes were but cobwebs to necessity, that Improvement was a brainsick Project; That Orphanes and Widowes would crie for vengeance; That the Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Riot and sloath were falsely charged upon usury; And
<pb facs="tcp:29705:3"/>
that it was frivolous herein to quote the wise, frugal and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious <hi>Hollander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sutable to the Arguments, the Adversaries were then the same, For it was principally opposed by the Dons and Ruffes, the eminent Traders and other sages of that time, who either being (some of them,) at least parcel-usurers, or foreseing that it would raise that land which they were yet to purchase, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse that Benefit of trade which they desired still to monopolize, or disdaining to learn ought from their inferiours, brow-beat it as the Project of Bankrouts, derided it as the Frenzy of Novices and State-Empyricks, and thought it sufficiently baffled by their dis-owining it: Herein seconded by the usurer with his numerous Gang, deeply concerned that so goodly a shrine should be prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched, and shrewdly misliking the Precedent: Abetted by many faint-hearted Borrowers, who, mistrusting the event of a good cause, maintain'd, (as they thought) by Dwarfes, but assai'ld by Gyants, Either cried quarter<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and layd down their Armes, or ran over to the enemy, to the great encrease of his forces, and hazard of the enterprise.</p>
            <p>The same Crisis had it in point of time, being moved three years before it took effect; For in the year 1620, my Father wrote his treatise, as appeares by the Date of its first edition, and in the year 1623. I take it, the Act passed; Now this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval was spent in eager disputes, and the daily gaining of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes; (wherin, by the way, it is observable, that, for ought appeares, that age was not yet brave enough to assert even the height of publick usury in Print,) For being first propounded by a few Country Gentlemen and Merchants, (for the smalnesse of their party and boldnesse of their assertions then censured as Fanaticks in trade,) in that space of time, it won in effect all true lovers of their Country, and convinced farr the major part of unbrassed Auditours: These Circumstances I hold it pertinent enough for me to relate, as I received them by conversation with my deceased Father, or collected them from his Treatises,
<pb facs="tcp:29705:3"/>
partly to shew how difficult it is to dislodge a potent Oppressour, partly to satisfie the present Assertours of this Argument, that they ought not to despayre, though they meet with greater hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships then have yet encountred them, but rather assuredly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise themselves, That cause must and will at length prevayle, which hath not hitherto been opposed but by flouts and frowns.</p>
            <p>In the Reading of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Manlies</hi> answer, I find exception taken both at my frequent mention of the term usurer, and at divers blunt expressions upon that subject; But I hope it may easily be salved with this candid distinction of a ranke or common usurer, and a Lender upon usury; It is the trade which I abhorre, not the bare practise; Common usurers I defie, as the scandals of the Church, and Cankers of the State; Lenders upon usury I partly excuse, knowing many of them to be persons truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious, and such, as were they convinced of the oppression, would not only desist but restore: yet even these I cannot but admonish seriously to consider, whether such practise have any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ground to support it, then general Custome, and seeming Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, Countenanced by the Pulpits silence, and whether in the purpose of humane lawes, impunity come not farre short of right: To such as yet further expostulate my meaning, I answer with a late e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent States-man in the like case, whosoever feels himself concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, him I mean; or with a friend of mine, who being asked where the usurer dwelt, protested he knew not, and hoped there was no such man.</p>
            <p>Two capital errours in my former Treatise I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but withal excuse; The first, that I did not previously clear this great probleme, that the abatement of usury hath a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Mathematical Energy to rayse Land, and augment Trade; For that being granted, all the advantages propounded had been sufficiently proved by but naming them; Whereas, for want of this ground-work the foundation seemed too sleight for the building, and my ensuing assertions to unprepared Readers appear'd no better then bold presumptions, like the imposing of Authority without first proving it authentick: The second, that
<pb facs="tcp:29705:4"/>
charged our present sufferings wholy, (or at least principally,) upon the rate of usury, and not as well upon our long unequal burthens, which perhaps have had a greater share in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing of land then even usury it self, and without which usury would now much lesse have needed reducing: To the first, I answer, That in truth I could not foresee the denial of that maxime, which so immediately referres to the infallible rule of three in Arithmetick, hath been ever granted, and never till now questioned by the usurer himself, And is, by way of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, solemnely declared, not only by that notable statute 21. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> but even by an Act of this present Parliament: To the second, That I rather chose frequently to glance, as it were, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those unequal pressures, than lay the main stresse upon them, if I could avoyd it, Partly from my reverence to the Authority imposing them, Partly from my foresight of an answer, which obliging me, in my own defence, to produce them as manifest causes of the fall of Land and Rents, will, I hope, absolve me for it.</p>
            <p>For brevities sake, I have chosen to reply by way of Dialogue, having ever observed that in such familiar discourses, doubtful matters are best explained; Glosses and sophismes prevented, and taedious circum-locutions avoyded, which at best signifie somewhat to style and forme, but nothing to sense: Only for an Antidote to my former omission, I shall first ground my future Arguments concerning Land, upon the impartial narrative of our publick burthens, for forty years past, here ensuing.</p>

            <head>A summary Account of our Publick Taxes and Burthens, and how they have been born for forty years past.</head>
            <p>TO clear my Antithesis of Land and Usury, I shall distinguish the time into three Stages or Periods, 1. Before the War, 2. During the War, 3. After the War.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Before the War, It hath ever been the known grievance of this Kingdom, that all the hardships of the Common wealth were born by Land: Our Land-lords only exposed to be Lords and Deputy Lieutenants, Sheriffes, Commanders in the Militia, Justices of the Peace, Jury-men, with divers other chargeable employments general and Parochial; Our Tenants to be Constables, Bosholders, Surveyours, Collectours, &amp;c. Prest to the War, and charged even in Peace; Both of them, in their degrees, obliged to Residence and Hospitality, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to payment of Tithes, maintenance of the Poor, employment of Labourers at certain cost, but uncertain profit, Repayring of Churches, Mills, Bridges, High-wayes, Sewers, &amp;c. Rarely pretending to matters of much advantage: Neither is it a new Complaint, That usury hath always sculked and shifted like the running Gout, and like a Faery or Goblin, which tortures and scares without ever appearing; That it was to the Commonwealth, at best, like a lame legge, uselesse, deceitful, and troublesome; Profitable only to it self; Craftily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding all charges and Duties, how just and Equall soever, but watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Advantages of wealth and leisure for gainfull Offices and penny worths: Tithe he never payd, I will not swear he never received it, since the first fall of Interest, in doubtful times he is presently upon the Wing, And if you do but talke reason to him, threatens to lurch or leave you; For the world is his Country, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and perhaps in six moneths time, he can be as good <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> as ever he was <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> being now, at the best, but a Denizen: With great reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my father, in his second Treatise, even then inferred, that since the usurer payd little to subsidies, nothing to fifteens, little to the poor mans boxe, repayred nor built no Churches, set no Labourers a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> worke for the good of the Commonwealth, employed none but Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veners and Brokers, and those at the charge of the Borrower, no man needed doubt, but there would be enough of the Occupation, though mony were brought to five, (he might now have sayd to three,) in the hundred.</p>
            <p n="2">2. During the War, most remarkable it is, how generally and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29705:5"/>
the Land was engaged, most of it actively in raysing of Troopes and Regiments, for the assistance and support of the parties contending, towards which the Land-lords, as their perswasions led them, not only staked and pawned their own Estates, but procured their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and tenants to embarke with them; all of it passively, by Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Freequarter, Contribution, and other exactions so insupportable, that an indifferent summe was then worth a fair Lordship, Taxes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly in surplussage to Rents, and stock on all sides looked upon as lawful prise, so as Land-lords were ruined by hundreds, and Tenants by thousands; Not to mention the irreparable wasts commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by fire and other warlike violences. The usurer, in the mean time, felt none of these Earth quakes, but (like a devout Hermite in his Cell,) retired to his Beads, little concerned in secular or sublunary affaires, unlesse it were in the special case of an Assumpsit or single band: Wee heard little of his Chivalry, and lesse of his Martyrdom: some have been reported by the black art to be stick-free, and others shot-free; The usurer, in the late times, was both.</p>
            <p n="3">3. After the War, it is but too fresh in our memories, what grievous Pressures have ever since lain upon the Land; For the clear discovery whereof, I shall consider it under the fourefold Capacity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder, Owner, Farmer, and Borrower: The Compounder, (of which quality were perhaps our most and greatest Land-lords,) upon payment of two years compleat revenue for a Fine, the lowest rate I have heard of, (debts being rarely considered,) was graciously restored to his house empty and half ruined, to his Land stripped of Wood and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ill tenanted and unfenced, his Meadows perhaps broken up, his Plantations, Hop-grounds, Nurseries, &amp;c. at best neglected; Nor was hee thus dismissed, but exposed to the repayring of all pretended tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes by him unavoydably committed in the War; Still molested, and forced, (as the least of evils in appearance, though in consequence perhaps the greatest,) by residing in <hi>London,</hi> to shelter himself from some ill neighbourhood. The owner, besides many other ruinous losses, hath for above twenty years past, <hi>commumbus annis,</hi> in Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxes, Military charges, and the encrease of Parochial duties, pay'd at least one fourth part of his yearly income strictly valued. without the least consideration of fall or losse of Rents, Repayrs and divers other incident defalcations. The Farmer having been impoverished by free quarter, and owing, (at least in part,) for his stock, hath been, and still is, by the like sufferings, together with his growing debts, kept so low, that it is great pity to see how painfully and innocently he

cheats himself by holding on the Farme, being neither able pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably to stock, nor afford it ordinary and necessary amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor keep his grayn for tolerable Market: The Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, if compounder, and in debt before the War, (as divers were,) must needs be desperate; It could then be no otherwise with him then thus, take all, and pay the Baker; For what estate almost could buoy up against such a Fine, with many years losse of income, and growth of Interest at eight per Cent? But though neither compounder, nor formerly in debt, can he well be imagined a clear man, having lived so long in effect upon the main? And then let us take a survey of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Borrow he could not then, without excessive Brokage, for the Glut of Compounders had strangely improved Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, besides the Circumstantial mischiefs and traps of charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able attendance, conveyance, suretyships, counter-securities, and trusts, which have furnished us with sutes and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances scarce to be cleared in an Age, and which, without fall of Interest, may amount to a reasonable Land-taxe, twenty, (perhaps forty) years hence; sell he could not in due time, but to the losse of almost half his Inheritance, so much was Land embased by the Miseries of the War, multitude of sellers, and Land-taxes: subsist without selling long he could not, how ever ought not, for Taxes and Interest mony, (like heavy bruises meeting with foul humours,) would soon gangreen: All this while, the monyed man eat the fat of the Land, being a kind of Lord-Dane in every houshold; The common rate of Interest, with Choice of security real or Personal, (for borrowers were forced to helpe one another with joynt and mutual surety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,) came clear to him, for the Acceptance whereof he was even treated as a Benefactour; But the common Usurer, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally his own Broker, like Bawd and Curtesan,) was double greased; He swaggered like the Lord of a great Mannour, the Demeans whereof are holden by Villenage, having the very Carkasses of his Betters, as it were, in his clutches: His harvest lasted many years, betwixt pernicious Loanes and Seisures, Dog-cheap penny-worths of goods, and half-purchases of Lands both private and publick: For like a Raven, he feasts upon Carrion, and thrives by the calamities of his Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:29705:6"/>I have claimed the Losers Priviledge in the blunt Narrative of these plain truths, (irksome indeed to the memory, but in use medecinal) partly to silence their un reasonable clamour, who most absurdly impute our present damp of Land, to the reducing of Interest, chiefly to lay open, even to vulgar Capacities, the Original and Ground-work of our present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, so industriously palliated by most of those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, so unhappily mistaken or sleighted by many that feel it, whom I dayly hear lamenting the hardship of the times, but withal imputing it to causes, either scandalous to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or in themselves so frivolous, as one would blush to mention, as if they should tell me, we are sick for want of health, idle for want of businesse, and insolvent for want of mony: These I would willingly acquaint, what evil Spirits haunt them, and what familiar spels may drive them away; For to mee it seems most evident, That the disproportion of Usury to trade, but principally to Rents, not timely observed and Redressed, together with the advantage constantly taken by Usurers to decline all Publick Burthens, (especially in civil Broyles, after them,) hath and, since our current practise of Usury, made greater havock of noble Families, hopefull Traders, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Farmers, then all other Oppressions and Casualties, within that time, summed up together.</p>
            <p>For the better applying of this History to my present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, give mee leave to propound these following Quaeries.</p>
            <p>Doth not publick welfare mainly depend on the avoyding of oppression by equality of Taxes?</p>
            <p>Ought not every one that hath a certain Revenue to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his share to the common Burthens of his Country, is it not a condition reasonably annexed to Property?</p>
            <p>Supposing Interest of money to be lawful Rent, (as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,) and admitting it the speediest, clearest, and securest income, (as doubtlesse it is,) ought it not, even in that respect, to be most strictly charged?</p>
            <p>Are not summes of money at Usury, goods, chattels, indeed the principal ones, were they not then comprehended in all our late lawes for Taxes, even those of the late Usurpers?</p>
            <p>Were they not, in some of our latest Acts, since his Majesties return, particularly charged by name?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29705:6"/>Admitting it assault to steal Customes and Excise, is it not at least equivalent in the lender upon Usury to decline Taxes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by one and the same Authority?</p>
            <p>Is not the Prejudice to King and Kingdom finally as great, but the immediate wrong to neighbours palpably greater?</p>
            <p>Hath not the encrease of our Poor, Military Burthens, and Farmers Taxes, for twenty years past, embased Farmes at least ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> in Value?</p>
            <p>Have not the like pressures more immediately cost the Land-lord at least fifteen <hi>per Cent.</hi> of his yearly income, and what hath the Usurer contributed to any of them?</p>
            <p>Hath not every Purchaser of late years, by reason of their long Prescription, purchased with allowance for them, in the nature of Quit-rents clogging inheritance?</p>
            <p>Hath not then every necessitous Seller clearly sacrificed the fourth part of his Estate to his exigence, and have not Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers thriven to the same proportion by their neighbours Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and so made double Benefit of their own wrong?</p>
            <p>Have not the hopes of Land-lords and doubts of Tenants concerning the end or ease of Taxes justly hindred the letting of good leases, and multiplied Tenancies at will, to the manifest ruine of Farmes, and Publick detriment, but advantage of lurching Purchasers?</p>
            <p>Have not the like hopes suspended many sellers upon Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to their greater Ruine, and the contrary doubts so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mused fair Purchasers, that they knew not what justly to offer?</p>
            <p>Have not borrowing Land-lords pay'd all this while six <hi>per Cent.</hi> indeed to the Usurer, but otherwise, (considering the Clog of their inheritances,) much more then double that rate; and have not Lenders, in effect, received neer two <hi>per Cent.</hi> overplus, which, in all equity, they should have payd to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick?</p>
            <p>Will not the Usurer, without due caution always, serve us with the same sawce in all future Broyles, or extraordinary Levies?</p>
            <p>May not this Kingdom be presumed still to feel the effects of the late civil War, As men do sometimes old Bruises or the sinnes of their youth very long after?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29705:7"/>Admitting Land-taxes should cease, may not the continuance (perhaps encrease,) of other Burthens, especially the Poor, without effectual redresse, be sufficient to perpetuate the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement of our Farmes, now so impoverished?</p>
            <p>Will any man now marvel at the Deadnesse, and not rather at the quicknesse of our Lands and Markets?</p>
            <p>Must we not impute this suspension of our utter ruine to our intermediate growth of trade by our last fall of Usury, and its exemption from new Clogs?</p>
            <p>May not an Indifferent Charity suppose, that the Land-lord may be now incumbred, and Tenant impoverished, without rank Prodigality?</p>
            <p>Doth not even six <hi>per Cent.</hi> grievously bite the Land, it being now Notorious, That (all things computed) Rents in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try do not generally answer three?</p>
            <p>Can the Borrower ever hope, without abatement of Usury, to clear himself, but to half Ruine in sale, or extreme mischief by delay, may not the Usurer, at his pleasure, relieve himself, perhaps with advantage, by purchasing in time?</p>
            <p>Can the Retrenching of Usury, which by visible experience hath always proved successeful, be ever so just and necessary, as to Farmers generally drooping, and a Gentry incumbred by Loyal sufferings?</p>
            <p>Is not the improvement of Land, and support of Gentry farre more considerable to his Majesties service, then any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Usurers can be?</p>
            <p>If our Taxes and Burthens had been equally born, must not the due Rate of Land have been maintained, to at least 24. years Purchase?</p>
            <p>If land could have escaped all these Burthens, and money born them, without consideration of desperate and uncertain debts, (as surely little we have had of incumbrances or fayler of Rents.) What would probably have been the Purchase of Land?</p>
            <p>If all our Payments had been charged upon Customes and forrain Imposts (money and Land being both exempted,) what would have been our Account of Trade?</p>
            <p>May it not yet be seasonable, (because profitable, and most just,) to expose money at Interest to publick Taxes and Duties?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:29705:7"/>
               <hi>If Creditours at Interest be Obliged, at their Peril, to Taxe themselves, so as by their declining it, they be construed to disown their Principal, and forfeit it, either wholy to the Borrower, or half to the King, may not this probably be effected, without either the temptation of Perjury, or prejudice of Informing? Where were the Inconvenience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were not this, Concurrent with the fall of Usury, a likely way speedily to raise the value of Land, for want of which only the Country now droopes?</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed in my Reply to <hi>Mr. Manly</hi> by Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Propositions naturally arising from his own words, or sense, for brevities sake, collected with the same fidelity; which I would desire him, or any other, hereafter to use towards me.</p>

                  <hi>IS not the hiring of mony, (seeing it cannot be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for Gods sake,) as necessary for the well-being of mankind, as hiring of Land or houses?</hi>

               <p>Divines will first tell you, your very Hypothesis is stark naught, <hi>De jure,</hi> I mean, though <hi>de facto</hi> it be too true; and then withal they will direct you to wholsomer expedients for traffick, on all sides, than hiring of mony, <hi>viz.</hi> Trading with our own stocks, honest Partnership, and discreet Factorage: besides, as to the difference of Land and money, they will, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things) inform you, That your Letting of mony at the same price to all <hi>Borrowers,</hi> looks somewhat like the expecting an equal Rent for all Lands by the Acre, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining their Quality, scituation, &amp;c.

               <p>My meaning was the same with yours, (though not asserted with the like confidence and Authority,) <hi>viz.</hi> That his Majestie gave excessive Rates, now this, say I, happened through his not commanding mony, as the States did, the reason whereof I clearely referre to the plenty and security attending low Interest.</p>

               <p>Five or six, I doubt, is generally fair for them, ours, I suppose, may thank you for it; They would fain perswade the Usurer either to trie himself, or be their Ensurer; But, it seems, he desires none of their Egges for his mony, for he lovingly thanks them, and had rather they should be his.</p>

                  <hi>I desire the Reader to take notice, That all</hi> Europe <hi>exceeds us in the Rates of Vsury, the</hi> States of Holland, <hi>and some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29705:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of</hi> Italy <hi>only excepted? And some or all of these are unrestrained by their lawes, and at liberty to take as much for Interest as they can get.</hi>

               <speaker>T. C.</speaker>
               <p>We differ partly in fact, but more in the Issue by you put; For lawes may not only be proper but necessary in a Kingdom grievously incumbred by civil War, and that hath so much good Land for its fund; When, in Commonwealths of unequal and slender territory, free from exigents, possessed of trade, and chiefly founded in it; current Security, with good Policies, may both supply the want of them, and perhaps better effect their design: As for Rates, I think it were happy, if ours were the lowest.</p>

                  <hi>I say, (speaking as a man,) 'tis no wrong to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, If men of Estates drink, drab, live profusely, and die Beggars, so long as every penny comes to the Natives,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I say (speaking as an <hi>Englishman,) Interest Reipublicae, nequis male utatur suis</hi>: This is indeed, a rare doctrine for Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but baneful to the Commonwealth; such a vermine, as you describe, it no more wants, then it doth the Usurer himself, or than the Farmer, in a cheap time, doth Rats and mice, or lazy and disorderly hinds to devour his fruits; For so necessity, (the mother of Incumbrance, and Gran-dame of Extortion<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Me thinks, Sir, we are already half agreed; The Kings debts, I presume, you would have payd, and his real occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons supplied, Land-taxes, it seems, you abborre as much as I, and I trust, you wish so well to trade, as you would not have that bear all our Burthens; What then remains, but that our future levies be upon mony at Interest? If you please then, and publick occasions require it, (as 'tis like they may) mony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxes let them be: Let two or three <hi>per Cent.</hi> be charged upon all Interest mony for seven years, and let Usurers always after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29705:9"/>
be double Taxed like Aliens, as, in effect, they are, and say you are gently dealt with: But four <hi>per Cent.</hi> with an effectual provision for the future taxing of mony its due share, seems to be the cleanlier way.</p>

               <p>I could answer you perhaps without just exception, it was the Rebel and the Usurer betwixt them; But, pray Sir, is not this as good a plea for the highest extortions as for common Interest? My surly host, when I question his Reckoning, may as well reply, who sent for you? The Prostitute, having picked her lovers purse, may as well aske him, who sollicited you? I durst likewise swear, (but that I doubt a <hi>Borrowers</hi> Oath may not be taken without a voucher, since his Band I find will not passe without two or three sureties,) The Usurer would never lend for pure good nature or Importunity, or if he thought he could otherwise deale to better effects; And therefore I have a little curiosity to know, what that something else was, For, if it were a purchase, (though a Lurching one,) beshrew those, say I, whoever they were, that diverted him.</p>

               <p>I say so indeed, and I doubt not but most of those Gentleman will believe me, for the thing is manifest both as to the Purchase and Rents of Land; For Purchase, the Resemblance of Land and mony to two Buckets was never questioned till now; And Rents must needs be governed by the very same Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes with the Land it self and Trade, the farmer being no other then a Country Marchant, and, with your Patience, I shall offer you divers familiar instances to prove, the Tenant hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual benefit in the fall of Usury with his Land-lord, his stock

will be so much cheaper to him, his ordinary yet necessary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments, Fences, Repairs, &amp;c. will be cheaper, he may the better afford to sell at common and low markets, or wait for higher, and, upon the Encouragement of a long and good lease, he (but much more the owner) will be enabled to venture on Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements chargeable and expectant, the profit whereof will vastly accrue not to himself only, but the Commonwealth, <hi>viz.</hi> Building, Planting, Enclosing, Drayning, Flouding, Marling, &amp;c. These are so obvious, as I cannot but admire the vulgar capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of some, who in discourse on this subject are apt to say, Alas! What is it to me, that neither lend nor borrow? But say I, do you neither hire nor let? Neither sell nor buy? Neither build nor repayre? Neither plant nor enclose? Neither wear nor cloath Neither travel nor sojourn? Neither entertain nor eat? Which way soever you turn, six <hi>per Cent.</hi> stares in your face; You meet him on the Road and sup with him at your Inne; His intruding you cannot avoyd, yet shun, if you can, his acquaintance; And in case you design to build a Church or Chappel, or found an Hospital, or plant a Colony, or enlarge a Navigation, or bravely serve your Prince, or worthily oblige your friend, or seasonably assist your neighbour, or encourage Manufacture, or advance learning, or maintain hospitality, or uphold your degree, or improve your Estate, or adorn your mansion, or enclose your Park, or compleat your library, or liberally breed your Son, or well match your Daughter, or any way exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie your Christian Profession, publick Spirit, or private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, to the Purchasing of Brass or Marble, nay to the bare rescuing your name even from present oblivion, consult him not, for you will find him sacrilegious, selfish, difficult and costly; But let me freely recommend to your four <hi>per Cent.</hi> for besides his fidelity and dispatch, he may chance in the upshot, (all things computed,) save you more then half in half.</p>

My Father told him, he hoped for some abatement of Interest, and forbearance of the principal, in regard of the fine he was then to pay; His answer was, Sir, take your own time for payment, as for Interest, God forbid, I should require any when you had no Rents, nor could my father prevail with him to take any part of it: A rare pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for Conscientious lenders, and a lively decision of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent argument: Now by the happy conduct of these weighty Land-lords, I understand their dextrous shifting of publick Duties, and otherwise making hay while the Sun shined; If they can, at length, be (in some small measure) fairely met with, let King <hi>Adonibezek</hi> acquaint them with the Justice of it.</p>

                  <hi>I humbly conceive, it were much better to keep up Vsury, and find out a way like that of a Register, (so long and Passionately desired,) which at once might enable the solvent Gentleman to borrow easily, (which now he cannot do,) on all occasions reasonably secure the mony lent, affright men from running greatly into debt, least their nakednesse appear, prevent ten thousand frauds, and as many law sutes, defer none but insolvent and ill-minded men, and direct the State, upon all emergencies to lay impositions on it equal to Land-taxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I humbly perceive, Usury is your <hi>noli me tangere</hi>; Well, however, I am glad to find you grant equall taxing just, it savours of some ingenuity still, though, I doubt, you may think it will not be in your time, and that you are safe enough at your close guard: As for a Register, it hath indeed been long desired, and long, I fear, yet may be, at least, ere it operate, considering the difficulties of agreeing, settling, and purging it: This six <hi>per Cent.</hi> well knows, and therefore, as his last stake, drives the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to that issue, just in the <hi>Welshmans</hi> Rhetorick, <hi>Let her but alone, till that daycomes</hi>; We, on the other side, desire a Register, (as surely it is chiefly our Interest,) farre more sincerely then he, and wish no time were lost, that at least the next age may reap the fruit of it; But we hope our Redresse needs no such long Prorogation, for he that must dine late, wants a good breakfast, and we suppose some fall of Usury, in our involved condition, to be the necessary Harbinger or Pioneer to an effectual Register, judging it more likely and proper to begin with the Egge, then the Hen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By</hi> the way, I cannot but with trouble reflect, that Land and Trade should so conspire to play the Usurers game against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as by their discord all along they have done; The trader crying, taxe Land, in Gods name, for that will bear it, trade cannot; And the Land-lord of late, spare Land, for Gods sake, it hath already been taxed to death; Taxe now our superfluous trade, and therein our luxury; Giving, it seems, the Usurer over to his Reprobate sense, and therefore freely permitting him to thrive in this World; But little, in the mean time, considering, that tillage and trastick lay in one belly the Earth, sayle in one bottom upon the Sea, and fear one Pyrate or vermine, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29705:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like a slie make-bate circumventing, and secretly no doubt deriding them, withal applauding his own happy conduct, (as my Authour hath it:) For as when theeves disagree, true men recover their goods, so whilst honest men quarrel, Pockets are the more securely picked.</p>

               <p>I have heard of divers great Politicians, and some, in my dealings, I have met with, who being a little thick of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, kept notwithstanding one ear constantly open to good tyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and another shut to bad: Near of kinne to these is our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer; No man so nimble in apprehending, so subtle in calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profit as he; But if any thing be offered crosse to his Purpose, he counterfeits himself a changeling; Poor man! I dare say, he cannot tell ten: At this close lock we have him all along: If he find purchasing commonly gainful, in three moneths time he is our Land-lord, however, if he meet with a lurching Penny worth, he snaps it; He then lookes bigge and is a man of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he would have you know; But if times be doubtful, taxes high, and Rents falling, he is then a poore Orphane, a silly Cock-nay, not versed in Country affaires; If trade be in a thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way, and yield above his rate of Usury, (which he Critically observes and understands as well as most that drive it, for there is not a better Weathercock, to tell us where the wind sits,) being naturally shrewd, and pensive: a rare Accomptant, and by conversation, at least, no stranger to those affaires, he plies the Exchange, examines the Rates of Impost, soon acquaints him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with Prices and Markets, and is as brisk as the best: But finding little to be got, but hazard, and that, all things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he may repose himself more profitably upon his Downbed of Interest, he is then wholy defective in business of that kind, his Friends undid him by not giving him more learning, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him early out to Prentice; Or he is a crazy old man, weary of the World, glad to retire, and beginning to doat: Were it not for this imposture of affected impotency, how could men the acurest and exactest judges of advantage in their generation, at this time of the day, so peremptorily deny the raysing of Land
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29705:12"/>
by the fall of Usury; a Problem full of self Conviction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling assent to the very mention of it, and which themselves, I dare say, have formerly granted a hundred times over: But truly here is the Intrigue, before the Usurer had dived into the bottome of the Argument, and spied the vast invincible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, not only in the Various improvements of Land, but in their immediate affinity to those of trade, (and one would marvel so sharp a nostril should not sooner smell so strong a scent,) his common Reflexions, were these, yes indeed, this is good for you in the Country, but it will undo us Citizens; You Gentlemen care not what becomes of trade, so your Lands rise; Now you would fain be raysing your Rents again, and racking your Tenants to maintain your Prodigality: These and divers other unwary Confessions have I my self, and I dare say most that read this Page heard from some even of those who now sing another note; For finding themselves, by their own admission, utterly gravelled, and unable to gainsay the necessary great and good effects of raysing Land, they soon swallowed their own spittle, and now the Crie is, 'tis absurd thus to argue against Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; We utterly deny it, prove it if you can; Well then, I am ready to prove it, (which yet I supposed I should never have been driven to,) and not only prove, but in good measure demonstrate it, if at least Arguments of this nature be capable of such evidence.</p>
               <p>Purchasing is the Exchanging of mony for Land to a supposed equal Value, the proper measure whereof is Yearly income or Revenue; He then that purchases according to Rule, compares the income of his mony which he quits, with the Revenue of his Land which he acquires, and thereby Examines his gain or loss: Now, in regard of the dignity and stability of Land, it hath alwayes had, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> some preheminence allowed it in the <hi>Ballance,</hi> to a fourth or third part, perhaps more in very clear times, so as six Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> good Rents were counted of equal intrinsecal value to eight or nine Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> Interest; He then that would lay out a hundred Pounds upon a Purchase, (mony being at six <hi>per Cent.</hi>) expected Land to the Yearly value of four Pound, or at most four Pounds and ten shillings, which is about four and twenty years Purchase,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29705:13"/>
whereas, (mony being at four <hi>per Cent.</hi>) less then three Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> becomes his Due, which is about six and thirty years Purchase: This estimate, I dare maintain, must generally hold, if there be certainty in the rules of proportion; And that it doth so, appears even in our present case, which I take for a Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and marvellous instance, considering the number and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of sellers; For supposing Land now to carry eighteen years purchase, (as good Rents have all along done,) and abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fourth part for the Rent charges of publick Duties, by Purchasers cruelly defalked; the present purchase is just recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to my presumed Rate: As for Rents, I must again mind you, of five years actual War, five years Anarchie, ten years Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and above twenty years unequal burthens, sufficient, one would think, much more to have impoverished our Farmers, and embased our Farms.</p>
               <p>But as for the Feats and projects which you so deride, I again affirm, they are not Monstrous, but most natural, even so familiar? That every Country, almost every year presents us with notable Patterns of them; Your self have instanced in some which may only serve for a Relish of many incomparably more important: Do but cast your eye upon our Lands now adjacent to good Towns, and observe what the industrie of man, meanly and but accidentally encouraged hath there effected; And then, (if you can) deny, that a perfect Enablement, and withal pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent compulsion of the same Industrie, doubled and redoubled, would, through the necessary progresse of improvement, make indeed a strange and happy Metamorphosis; Even by planting Cities, in time, where are now scarce hamlets, and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Towns almost to the number of our Parishes; Since God, who sends meat for our mouths doth likewise ever send mouths for our meat, and that not by Miracle in our vulgar Account, but the ordinary successe of just laws, and prudent Endeavours; For sure there is nothing that so fatally and universally wasts and depopulates as Usury, if once it grow rank and rampant; No not War or Pestilence it self, which have always had their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, intermissions and Exemptions; Whereas this, like a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and perpetual contagion and secret canker, supplants the present Age, and undermines Posterity; For who, that hath
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29705:13"/>
common sense, observes not, that dark and drooping times, (the fruitful harvest of our silversmiths,) drive out natives, and keep out strangers, cut off the thred of life untimely with want, care, anguish, and disorder, oblige even the richer sort, (as it were in their own defence,) to decline or deferre marriage, and compel the poorer, at best to neglect, but shrewdly tempt them even to expose their Children? And who may not easily thence conclude, that the flourishing of trade and tillage, (which to our worms and weeds is a most nipping frost,) endeares any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to its people, allures forreiners, prolongs lives, and makes posterity even the Tenants welcomest stock, but the Land-lords only treasure and Jewels?</p>

               <p>It is now almost seventy years, since Usury in <hi>France</hi> was abated from eight to six Pounds and five shillings <hi>per Cent.</hi> by that wise King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, as a prime expedient to repayr the breaches, and desolations of thirty years cruell War, Judging, no other Medicine adaequate to the disease, for so it appeares by his solemne and Excellent edict in the <hi>French</hi> Story thus noted and related: <hi>The King, by these Edicts, had nothing relieved the necessities of the Nobility, if he had not provided for Vsuries, which have ruined many good and antient Houses, filled Towns with unprofitable servants, and the Countrys with Miseries and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29705:15"/>
inhumanities: He found the Rents constituted after ten or eight in the hundred did ruine many good Families, hindred the traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick and Commerce of Merchandise, and made tillage and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts to be neglected; Many desiring, through the easiness of a deceitful gain, to live idely in good Towns of their Rents,</hi> (mark this, for it is now become just our own ease, mony having so long escaped all our heavy Burthens,) <hi>then to give themselves, with any paines to liberal arts, or to till or Husband their inheritances; For this reason, (meaning to invite his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to enrich themselves with more just gaine,) to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with more moderate profit, and to give the nobility means to pay their debts, he did forbid all Vsury or Constitution of Rents, at a higher Rate, then six Pounds five shillings for the hundred: The Edict was verified in the Court of Parliament, which considered, that it was always prejudicial to common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal to give mony to Vsury, for it is a Serpent, whose biting is not apparent, and yet it is so sensible, that it pierceth the very heart of the best Families.</hi> It was yet early-day, I take it, when this law was made in <hi>France,</hi> Anno 1601. at least twenty years before Usury had its first reducement from ten to eight <hi>per Cent.</hi> in this Kingdom, a thing, in it self, very observable; For had it not been for the miserable <hi>servitude</hi> of that people, and their other insupportable taxes, (the very twins of Usury,) it is scarce by any mans wit imaginable what effects so great and early a foundation of wealth and trade, (as perhaps the then lowest rate of Interest,) might before this time have produced in that ample and fruitful Territory, or what influence it might have had upon all its neighbours: Truly I never heard, it was since raysed, and will hold you great oddes it was not; And I durst likewise hold you an even wager, (having it from very good hands,) that the <hi>French</hi> King hath newly reduced Interest to five <hi>per Cent. Sweden,</hi> our Licensed Gazette acquainted us in a solemne narrative, the last year, brought it from ten to six at one large stride; Little, it should seem, regarding your profound objection of forcing nature by a law, even in a remote Northern tract, or rather De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart, desperate, (one would think,) as to much improvement or trade: If yet you ask mee, to what neighbours Standard I would have Usury adjusted, I answer, certainly to the lowest

in Christendom, if it might be, for that is evidently best, though somewhat more may for the present serve turn, the rather, because we hope, that with this seasonable lift at the brow of the Hill, it may tumble downward of it self, which, without it, it will never do, but rather rise in Extortion; <hi>For as to high and low Interest, it is equally natural for the one to soar with its own Wings, and the other to sink with its proper Weight.</hi>

Surely, the only inconvenience as to our wages consists in the present disproportion betwixt Trade and Land; For our manifest Growth in the Bulk of our trade since the last fall of Usury having deserved, advanced wages in all our Maritine and Trading Towns, hath necessarily imposed the same upon the Countries adjacent, which, under their unequal pressures and impoverishment they cannot bear, so fruitful of mischief is errour, this is at present a reall and accumulative grievance, particularly to us in <hi>Kent,</hi> by reason of the special influence we receive both from the City and Navy; But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it otherwise, then by easing Land for the future in the Rate of Taxes and Usury were indeed a work worthy of your Art.</p>

draw his bow: Yet let him examine whether the hazards he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be not of his own creating by uncharitable contracts, and whether a due abatement of his profit would not mend his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; For two <hi>per Cent.</hi> we offer him competent ensurance.</p>

               <p>Because your present objection seems to be grounded upon our pretended general want of ingenuity and industrie, I shall endeavour previously to remove this vulgar Prejudice; And first for ingenuity, I say, it appeares reasonable to suppose, that People, at least, of the same or neer the same Climate and Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian are born with the same or neer the same Principles of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity: that which afterwards makes the difference, is law, example, Education, Custome, and other forraigne accidents of life, either ennobling or depraving our natures: Thus the examples of Princes and Generals active and always present in Battles and Campes, together with Military rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments maks Nations and Armies valiant: Pure doctrine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened by diligent Preachers, adorned by holy patternes, and advanced by wholsome Constitutions Civil and Ecclesiastical, makes people Orthodoxe and devout; Hope of successe in their affaires, with a nimble spurre to endeavour, and prudent curbe of sloath, makes men inquisitive and ingenious: I say then we are now, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> as ingenious as any people living, for every one, by a kind of civil instinct, understands and closly pursues his best interest, and what would you have more? To begin with the Usurer, (for with him indeed we must begin) he, I am sure, of all men is in the right; for you, in your first Page, have resolved and secured him in point of conscience, by positively affirming, that hiring of mony is as necessary for the well being of Mankind as hiring of Land or Houses; and those, we know, were never questioned by any Casuist: Then you lay him down a second doctrine every whit as wholsome; that his profit should reward his hazard, which sometimes, you say, is excessive; Be<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wixt these two, what should hinder him from concluding, that what we now call extortion, may be, in many cases, every whit as just as common interest; The latter having
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29705:18"/>
no more reall stamp of Authority, then the former: Thus I have heard that Highway-men fancy they acquit themselves and come off with honour, by pleading, that they see no difference betwixt their courses, and some worshipful trades, but the danger, which, they suppose, much improves their title, and so, by your rule, evidently it doth. Being thus inwardly fortified, his next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is profit, and surely that affords no dispute: I have heard, that an eminent person, to prove that beasts have Logick, would introduce a hound or Beagle thus discoursing; The hare went not that way, for there I smell nothing; nor that way, for there I smell nothing neither; but this way, for here, indeed, I have a seent of her. To the Usurers choyce three wayes are propounded for the employment of his stock; Land, Trade, and Usury; And thus I presume him to argue: Land I like not, for there I smell Taxes, Duties, and losse of Rents; Trade I like not, for there I smell <hi>Pyrates,</hi> shipwrack, trusts, Customes, and <hi>Flemings</hi>; But for Usury, surely there went the hare, for there is the sweet savour of mortgages and vayles with Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Ease and Dominion. Of the borrower I have little to say, for I looke upon him all along not as a free but necessary Agent or rather patient: What would you expect from the Labourer? He workes not if he can chuse, and in effect tell us, if you find working so good, work your selves; Is not this a witty answer from a Labourer? Hath he not, thinke you conferred notes with six <hi>per Cent</hi>: To thrive by pain-taking he sees little hope; live from hand to mouth, it seems he can, tying one hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. If then he work in dear years, take his ease in cheap, and cast himself upon the Parish in age or sickness, doth he not very discreetly? Even those Gangs of <hi>Gypsies</hi> you mention, I doubt not but the Usurers, wholesome Principles, applied to their condition, may likewise bear then out in conscience and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; the Usurer himself being (<hi>qua Vsurer,</hi>) to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth but a bigger and graver sort of <hi>Gypsie</hi> Now for our In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dustry, it appeares by the premisses, that is meerly frustrate by our ingenuity from one end of the board to the other; For if U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury and sloath be more pleasant, profitable, and secure, Industrie becomes folly, and that so it is, who can doubt seeing it by so intelligent Persons so dearly preferred: It must then be lawes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29705:18"/>
grounded upon Equity and Vertue, which must clear this end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Laborynth, and Correct this vicious habit, and that of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing Usury must march in the van. And for infallible high-water markes to know the tide or season, take this; When rich and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Citizens leave off Trading, and betaks themselves to Interest; When monied men in the Country generally decline Purchasing, but enquire for security and hug good mortgages; When honest men make it the business of their lives to sell at any tolerable rate, and pay their debts, but cannot; When the mortgage, being at first but half, is become full or neer equal in Account to the Land; When <hi>Statutes,</hi> judgements, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognisances grow as familiar as Bonds, and new shaped securities are dayly minted; When the ruine of all Borrowers and most Farmers is bespoken; When it is weightily objected, that there are many Borrowers for one lender, (though surely as much lent as borrowed;) When Professions are overcharged, but the Land understocked; When, by reason of the Farmers indigence, Markets run low with mean crops; <hi>When, according to the</hi> French <hi>Kings Edict, many good and antient Houses are ruined, Towns fined with unprofitable servants, and the Countries with Miseries and inhumanities, Traffick and Commerce of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise hindred, tillage and handicrafts neglected,</hi> &amp;c. When Usurers would passe for Orphanes, and in their own defence, turn Preachers and Patriots; When Parish duties encrease, yet Vagabonds swarm; Then, then, I say, the fruit is ripe, Gather it, or expect abundance of windfals; Yet even then, I doubt not, but abatement of Usury, and equal Taxing, will with Gods Blessing, and some allowance of time, (for betwixt Ebbing and Flowing is always still water,) retrive our after-game, revive Farmers, excite improvements, and largely answer all the Benefits specified in my former treatise.</p>

                  <hi>Were our poor industrious and frugal, and wages rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, (which I fear will never be, till the abused (rutch of State-maintenance be rescinded, or better regulated,) they could not want employment, though Vsury were at eight</hi> per Cent.</p>

               <p>I agree with you in the rescinding of State-maintenance, as a provision only proper for the times it was made in, when Monasteries were newly dissolved, and Trade in its infancy;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29705:19"/>
But if you will take from the poor this Crutch, you must withal cure their Lameness, and set them upright upon their own legs, lest they lye too heavy at your doors: This, I affirm, neither eight nor six <hi>per Cent.</hi> will do, nor any thing but the turning of our main stocks out of the muddy Chamel of Usury into the pure streams of Husbandry and Traffick, by a round abatement and equal Taxing of Interest-mony; For did you not marke, how eight <hi>per Cent.</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> even seventy years since, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that rate was lesse in proportion then five is now, filled Towns with unprofitable servants, spoyld Traffick, tillage, and handicrafts?</p>

still observe certain peculiar rules of their own; the chief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are, that they dread borrowing, Cherish Industrie, hate oppression and discord, provide liberally for their reall poor, and preferre honest labour and trade before Usury, though more easy, and perhaps more profitable; which Gods blessing will always attend.</p>

               <p>I could alledge another manner of reason, then you dream of for the standing of Timber to full growth in our Fathers time, <hi>viz.</hi> their general abhorrence of multiplying mony by mony, now so current and Orthodox; witness the Statute 13. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> which in its Preamble recites, that all Usury, being against the law of God is sinful and detestable, thereby convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us of the sense of that Age; As also the Act 21. <hi>Iacobi,</hi> which foreseeing, what perverse use might be, made of their Limitation, by construing it to an allowance of Usury, notably provides against the mistake; But I will admit, the inconsiderable Value of their Timber, at least in places remote from Market, must needs have been a second motive, (proper for such as then owed or wanted mony) to let it stand: Otherwise, if our Fathers could have had tolerable prizes for their Timber, and yet would either pay ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> or decline the receiving it with a safe conscience, I durst, without Irreverence to them, pronounce, that they could not count one, two and three.</p>

               <p>Methinks, Sir, I cannot better resemble most of your Arguments upon this subject, then to the Sentence of a Country Doctour, who, in a visit to his Patient, dying of the stone, gravely pronounced, that if he could pisse freely, he might doe well, or to the right witty prevention of Vomiting at Sea by holding a large Peble in the mouth: For, when we demand a Remedy to our present Incumbrance and embasement of Land and Rents, you bid us look better to the decay of our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, and exporting our coyne: you recommend to us the Reforming our Luxury and avoyding Idleness, you tell the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he must get and keep out of debt, reside in the Country, plant groves and orchards, and read <hi>Seneca</hi>; The Labourer you direct to be always at work, and accept such wages, as his Master may afford to give; The Vagabond you admonish to keep at his home, or, if he have none, to get one, to mend his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and be a better Commonwealthsman, then he hath hitherto been; Why do you not likewise chide the Farmer; because, in truth, his farme is understocked, ill fenced, and out of heart? Seriously, your discourse is very charming, the beasts and Trees, one would think, should again dance to such a pipe: Now, for the party here accused, <hi>viz.</hi> the Gentleman, you advise him to sell timely, he entreats you to purchase fairely, for unlesse you will buy, he cannot sell; He protests, he offers you almost half under value, and makes it his chief business in this World to sollicite you; But you sleightingly tell him, Land
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29705:20"/>
stinks of taxes nothing, is sweet but mony; Thus you wish him to keep close at home, but will you suffer him there to stay? Live he should within compasse, it must be a very narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, if it be your Reversion, you will teach him to play the Epicure, you will reform him with a witness, before you leave him; By all means, he must plant, but is it not that you may Gather? Surely, Sir, you speak all this while Ironically, for when you list to be a little more serious, you have other language within call, you can tell us, Page 2. of borrowing to keep out of Prison; Of 1500. <hi>per Annum</hi> brought to a trifle without ill husbandry, Page 10.

You can, I presume, pronounce of a person greatly incumbred, as of one that hath plague-tokens; Nay you can foresee ruine upon its march in a great Estate, (once dipped as you terme it,) at ten, perhaps twenty years distance without present sale, be the owner never so provident; You require vast mortgages, and other dayly new invented securities, to borrowers as paenal as Usury it self: The fact therefore, I am sure, you too well know, give me leave to acquaint you with the cause (since those you offer are but accidents;) A poor man that had a very sore Leg, shewd' it the Chirurgeon, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully asked him, if it must not be cut off, to which he pleasantly replied, that trouble, perhaps, might be saved, let it alone for a while longer, and lay but <hi>Diaculum</hi> to it, it will soon enough rot off without more adoe: such Surgery, me-thinks, is the best you can here afford, <hi>viz.</hi> trivial cheap, but therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to us, who, I take it, want effectual means; For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance is to the Commonwealth an Ulcer, deeply rooted in a viciated habit, fed by a Rebellious humour, <hi>viz.</hi> Usury, with its Accomplices, unequal Burthens; Conquer or tame this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the Ulcer heals; But Plasters shall never Mitigate, diet shall never alone correct it; Having once got this head, it is too proud and stubborn for any thing but Cauteries, and Radical courses; Else it will need no other inflammation then its own to fester and spread.</p>

Neither will I barely thank you for so strongly and pertinently
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29705:22"/>
urging my arguments for me, but will likewise, in requital, set you on your way, which it seems, you have lost by a Fog: You alledge, that there are many borrowers and few lenders, but is there not, say I, as much lent as borrowed? Is there a Borrower without a lender? And might not our lenders, (who, it appeares, are great ones, being few to many Borrowers,) soon become Purchasers, if, (as the phrase is,) they were free? And is not the pinching of Usury in rate and taxes the readiest way to make them free, that is forward to purchase? And may not such forwardnesse of theirs make borrowers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise free, that is, able to sell at tollerable prices, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their debts, which now, it is certain, they cannot? And may not such sales and payments soon clear and contract the number of debts and debtours? And will not such clearing of debts in time make few exigents? And will not few exigents make sellers thin? And will not the thinnesse of sellers, even by your own confession marvellously rayse Land? You reproach us with the present fall of Land in purchase, but doth not your tenant paying you 75 pound in mony, and 25 pound in lawful Bills, reckon that he pays you 100 pound <hi>per Annum?</hi> And do you not believe his account? And have not most Usurers treated and purchased accordingly? And doth not this, by your own allowance come pretty neer my account? And is it not much, that it should still do so, considering the extremities of some, and moderation of others? You object the expence of forraine commodities above our own exportation, but have not Land-taxes: (the Usurers darling, however you now exclaim against them, for old friends may sometimes wrangle, and shake hands again,) dispatched many of our Freeholders and Farmouts half undone by the War? And hath not their ruine made much of our Land lie waste, and more be ill husbanded? And must not such waste miserably impair and decay our Growth? And must not such decay starve our exportation? And may not trade so founded easily exceed in its importation? Shew me, if you can, the weaknesse of these chaines.</p>

               <p>You are still for Pedlers and Higlers, the Usurers Cattle, whom he milkes almost dayly, and at last must eat them lean, (for fat they can never be,) I am for the Worshipfull Trader, even the Usurer himself, that hath stock to cope with a <hi>Fleming viz.</hi> those prodigious Summes at command or Interest, (so I take your meaning) which, methinks, I had rather see generously employ'd in forraign Conquests, then, like intestine warre, eating our own bowells, and praying on our vitals: As for the engrossing of Trade, that is, indeed, your wisest Argument, for have you not noted all along, how Trade was dispersed by high Interest, but, engrossed by lower? And may not I observe, how the Builders tongues are confounded? Nine in ten of your brethren, at least, your sages objecting, (directly in your teeth) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable growth of a mechanick Trade, (as they call it) meaning thereby, I suppose, a Trade, not so profitable, as some of them now possesse, nor so easy, Lordly, and secure, as the present Rate of U

               <p>Having hitherto shewn, how little your generall invectives against our Luxury, and other reigning vices signifie to your Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I shall now, (with lesse noyse, but I hope more evidence) turn your own weapons against you, by proving, that Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Usury is, in its own nature, the greatest sumptuary Law, perhaps the only effectuall one, that Policy, with Justice can contrive; Therefore, no doubt, recommended by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his own People; Therefore, by the wisest of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, both antient and modern, layd as the very Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of their Fabrick; Therefore, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth

of <hi>France,</hi> a Prince of vast experience, after the desolations of Civil Warre, aptly chosen, both for a restorative of past, and antidote against future Distempers; Therefore, by that Politick Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> approved, who, though he justly sleighted the Pedantick Notion of reforming popular excesse by coercive Lawes, (as appeares by his notable speech to the Senate upon that subject) yet, as a main provision for publick security and good order, from his own treasury, erected a Bank for noble <hi>Romans,</hi> of declining fortune, (though of the <hi>Patrician</hi> faction) to borrow for divers years without paying Interest; By that single Act, redeeming in great measure the scandals of his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; Finally therefore, by most familiar proofes, asserted; For who sees not that the excesses of this, and indeed every State, are fed by three plentifull and indulgent Nurses, <hi>viz.</hi> drooping debtours, easy gainers, and impotent Vagrants? The first of these, (like those that project to live but from hand to mouth) loathing to day, and fearing to morrow, resign themselves to dissolute habits, that so they may forget those miseries which they cannot prevent, and be in part revenged on disaster by sleighting it, perhaps they judge it nor altogether unreasonable for them to partake with an oppressour in their own spoyls, as persons unhappily matched, sometimes think it just to share with their licentious mates: The second, (wallowing in their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, through an unweildy stock managed to certain profit with little burthen or trouble, whilst their betters carke and droop) neigh and praunce, like high-fed horses, and by the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>Light come, light go,</hi> care not what they squander, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at Dice, because their very sheepes tayles, they think will pay the reckoning, be it what it will; And though this character may not fit the Usurer himself (who seldom revels but wisely, and at the borrowers charge) yet his Executor, possessing an Estate, with a curse appendant, without proportion to his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and breeding, oft-times consumes it as dissolutely as his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestour shrewdly got it: The third and most general, finding vertuous courses servile and unprofitable, and nothing sweet but summes usuniously improved, which they want, and see not how to compasse, first turne tayle to industry, and then meeting with common frailty in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>High Interest, I take it, is a terme of scandalous sound, equivalent to that of excessive or biting Usury, which no man that owned conscience had ever yet the face of brasse to defend: Even for common and general Rates, give me leave again to tell you, you still abound in your wilfull mistake of Limitation for Toleration; since no Assembly of Christians, that deserved the name, or had the face of a Church, (no not heretical) ever gave Usury the least approbation, other then their silence, finding, perhaps, the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> too hard for them; No Christian Authority that I have heard of, Popular, or Despotick, ever allowed it a current stamp: <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself hath prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited it.</p>

               <p>Were Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> now living, I verily believe, he would grant three or four <hi>per Cent.</hi> to be no incompetent reward for Loans in general: 'Tis true, in respect of ten, the rate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was acquainted, it seems a trifle; But nothing upon earth is great or small, save in comparison, as the Dogge is a dwarfe to an Oxe, but to the Mouse a Monster: In <hi>Pagan</hi> Kingdomes, where weekly or monthly encrease is usually exacted, any thing <hi>per Cent.</hi> would perhaps be counted moderate; In Colonies and new Plantations, where neither the situation and Commerce of the Place, nor quality of the Inhabitants affords security or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, fifteen, nay twenty and thirty <hi>per Cent.</hi> hath been current; And he that so trusted, was reputed charitable, (as Charity there went) though it beggered them all: In Tributary Provinces, and mis-governed Countries, or remote from Traffick or Sun-shine, exigence it self almost commands high Rates; Neither, indeed is it much material in some of them, what the Rates be, where nature scarce admits of any improvement, or employment, but for mean stocks: In <hi>England,</hi> about sixty or eighty yeares since, Trade was in its early non-age, Traders were few, Builders, Planters, and Improvers thinne, and small competition we had with our neighbours, whereby the Returns of stock must needs be generally large, even liberally to reward any tolerable Interest; But now to argue upon that principle, were a paradoxe, like that of maintaining the antient Rates of Purveyance, Statute, (or as my Author judiciously propounds) stinted wages; For, I take it, the reason of varying them from time to time, is the same through out, with this single, yet notable diversity, that as all other things advance, Usury must abate; Upon which account, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily hope, or rather doubt not, but that (with Gods blessing) the next generation may judge even four <hi>per Cent.</hi> an extravagant rate for money.</p>

               <p>See my mistake! I took the Usurer for an Orphane, an

impotent person, at least a very harmlesse fellow, till you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed him, at need, an errand Lurcher. Well! It seems, he is a good man, and a fair Gamester, that he should not all this while, so much as think of his tricks, till he was put to his trumpes: But let him take his course, your own Author, Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> acquaints us, that bigge words and menaces are the constant marks of imbecillity, and we all know the great Usurer too wise to play much, or commonly, at that game, for fear of mischief; Yet to do him perfect Right beyond any future cavill or exception, I shall fairly examine, upon what ground of reason and justice he sleights the benefit of four <hi>per Cent</hi>: The Usurer, you say, thinks that profit too small, but is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his eye too bigge? I affirm, it is still great, perhaps exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and offer to prove it by all the measures of square and honest gain, whither you will consider his title, his stock, his pains, his skill, or compare him with others; His title is meerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage taken of his Brothers exigence; His stock, (sever it from his Farm) scarce equals a Barbers, or indeed a Rat-catchers, his Agents and servants being all maintain'd by others; His skill comes short of a Fidlers or Juglers, Minors and Ideots being free of the company; His pains doe not much exceed the Vagabonds or Gypsies he so upbraids: Now to compare him with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who, one would think might somewhat better mer from their Country; His Neighbours, I suppose, are Freehc<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Farmers, and Traders; For Freeholders you tell us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in every page, what their profit is, for you wonder they are so mad to borrow, you advise them at their peril to sell upon any terms, and you deride their imaginary improvements: Of Farmers, I think I need not offer a syllable, <hi>Res ipsa loquitur</hi>; We are then reduced to Traders, who are of two sorts, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and Domestick; The Domestick, being Shopkeepers and Artificers, depending on the Casualty of Vent or Custom, have a Benefit so contingent, as no Rule concerning them can well be framed, nor other observation made, then this in generall, that some indeed thrive, and many fayl, even of those that set up with their own stocks, but still were Borrowers: Forraign Traders are either in those few trades, which we naturally or politically engrosse, or those many, wherein we intercommon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29705:25"/>
with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and others; The former indeed, I suppose, may oft-times yeild good returns to the Merchant; But neither is their foundation very large, nor, perhaps altogether so found as to build our fortune, on them: In the latter, being of more vast and solid advantage and behoof, the present rate of Interest must of necessity, as to many of them, wholy exclude, in all, so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and curbe us, that we cannot expect any cheerfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, or otherwise than to truckle under the <hi>Hollander,</hi> a trade, whose benefit is not, (one would think) very hard to calculate: Whence then is our Usurers lofty pretence, or but colourable claim even to four <hi>per Cent.</hi>

               <speaker>T. C.</speaker>
               <p>Really, I much marvel you should think so; For first I tell them of other Widows and Orphanes mainly concerned in Land, who, by the uneasie Rates of Interest and taxes now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive prejudice, at least equal to the Benefit of these; Secondly I mention a numerous train of unhappy but honest borrowers, perhaps no lesse worthy of support then themselves, who, by the same pressures have been, and are dayly almost ruined; These, being evidently relievable by restraint of Usury, I desire may likewise be considered, and put into the Counterscale: Thirdly, I conjure them to deal as they would be dealt with, (a hard les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I know, for any oppressour to learn,) in not exacting from their borrowers, that which I calmly say they cannot afford, or which my Authour himself, in other language, (perhaps, more effectual and peremptory,) often affirms, must ruine at least all our borrowing Land-lords to give.</p>
               <p>But wholy to silence the Rage of these masked Usurers, who exclaim as if Christianity were expiring, when Usury only is reducing, I shall distinguish the Plaintiffs into two Ranks, <hi>viz.</hi> truly <hi>impotent</hi> and <hi>intelligent</hi>; For the truly <hi>impotent,</hi> or infants and Orphanes properly so called, I offer these considerations. 1. That they are certainly beholden to the several falls of Interest for their present ample provision, which is much better even at four <hi>per Cent.</hi> (all things computed,) then those of their Rank, generally, enjoyed at ten. 2. The Orphanes of <hi>London,</hi> (who, by reason of their assurance, fare, I suppose the best of any,) complain not much of that rate. 3. Abatement of their profit will certainly facilitate and improve security for other Orphanes, and may so turn to better account. 4. By raysing the Value of Land, their fellow Orphanes, the children of Loyal and worthy Parents, (for number and quality, perhaps more considerable,)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29705:26"/>
may be likewise provided for, who otherwise can never look for portions, at least, to their degrees: The <hi>intelligent</hi> I fairly admonish, to save their stakes by purchasing betimes, which, in Mortgages, where the title hath been scanned, were, methinks, an easie exchange: This, I hope, is no such cruel hardship, or dangerous Doctrine; for though some Doctours hold Usury to be consistent with good conscience, yet few, that I have heard of, maintain it necessary to good life: And further to prove it most reasonable, thus I argue; Either the Rents of Land do now competently Ballance the Interest of mony, or they do not; If not, where is their Justice? If they do, where is their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice? Besides, I am directed by an honest Gentleman and their special Advocate, one Mr. <hi>Manly,</hi> to acquaint them, <hi>That five Pounds five shillings a year in Land once surely settled, whereby they shall only venture their Rent, which is commonly secured by stock upon the ground, is better then a hundred Pounds in mony at six</hi> per Cent. <hi>sometimes tumbled and tossed at Usury like a ship in a tempest, and utterly lost, and sometimes remayning uselesse by them, like a vessel becalmed</hi>: If now they will not be ruled by their best friends, what hope is there say I of persons so refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and self conceited? In case their genius be not for Land, let them trie the Seas in forraign trade; If they can be brought neither to fancy the Land, nor trust the Sea, let them build granaries, to deal for grain and other commodities in cheap times, and keep them for better Markets, and with as much ease, as a Usurers heart would wish, sometimes double their stock, so employ'd; or let them advance our national Manufactures with clean hands, and no doubt with competent gain: If nothing but Usury will content them, tell them from me, I smell an evil savour, and that it were great pity, but they were pinched in their superfluous, and (to the Commonwealth) every way pernicious Revenue.</p>

               <p>Are not Usurers ever the first to reproach Gentlemen at least with folly, for not sinking their Rents, if they but seem too dear for the Land? Are not all Land-lords even now upon Abatement, and glad at any rates to get tenants, though surely not so sufficient as yours? Do they not freely discount for taxes and extraordinary burthens? And do not all good Land lords allow for bad times, nay even for very bad years? I tell you, Sir, I ever did, shall, nay, at my Peril, must sink my Rent, if the tenant produce but the tithe of those reasons, which most borrowers now may: For though I shall never admit, that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Land is Usury, yet will I not deny, that racking of Rents, and taking extreme advantage of strict Covenants is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion: And yet by the way, I must note, that the worst of Land-lords will find it a harder matter thus to extort, then the best of Usurers doth, the trade of letting Land not being driven in the Dark; And there being, I take it, no procurement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, double mort-gages, or treble Bands-men in his case to be got; Nor other probable security, then barely the penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, but the markets of Land being free and open, and the Values, to a trifle, publickly known and allowed.</p>

               <p>When you produce me any one Text of Scripture, Church-canon, or Christian Sect, that deserves a civil name, disallowing the Rents of Land, or any one temporal law restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, your bold assertion shall be considered: I, on the other side, offer to prove, that the laws of this and many Countries, (how tender soever they were of Propriety and Freehold, as indeed it concerned them to be,) have, as they saw Occasion, from time to time, retrenched Usury without scruple, or saying so much as, by your leave, Mr. Usurer; Which, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing your Categorical thesis,) shrewdly argues, that the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and title of them hath not been reputed altogether the same; Nor doth the Usurer himself, I suppose, pretend to be our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Land-lord, for then he would be readier to keep hospitality, serve upon Enquests, find Armes, repayre Churches, and pay Taxes, then of late, methinks, he hath been.</p>

               <p>You will prove anon, that borrowers have more brains, then lenders, though formerly you told them, in effect, that if they had any brains at all, they would not be borrowers: Truly 'tis a comfort still, thus to be cajoul'd into our ruine; and that though we find our selves the poor, yet an Oracle, it seems, hath pronounced us the wiser: Sure, <hi>Apollo</hi> was of another mind, when he made my Alderman his Laureat; Nor doth six <hi>per Cent.</hi> I take it, much glory in the improvement of his Sons knowledge and experience, when he runs out, and borrowes; Nor would any sneaking Usurer, I suppose, like to be taken at his word, and have a Guardian by the King assigned him, which methinks, were a charitable work, he having so slender a capacity with so fair an Estate; in which case, Land-lords are of course, provided for; But, alas, too sure it is, that when a Usurer is made, there is commonly as good a Merchant marred, as most that walk the Exchange.</p>

            <p>The Justice of it is, methinks, so apparent, that I durst al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most referre it to the Usurers own conscience, (and it had need be a very plain matter, (saith our late reverend Bishop <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>) that one would referre to the conscience of an Usurer,) for the question, modestly put, is, I take it, barely this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be reasonable, that one part of the Kingdom should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly bear the Burthens of the whole; To which the ready answer seems to be, that it is, (in Mr. <hi>Manlies</hi> phrase,) mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous unequal; Even to such degree, that I might well say, no wonder if it hath not thriven: Neither, having been proposed to divers Champions of Usury, (to give them their due,) hath any of them hitherto offered ought against it: Only they have gravely demurred; and therefore I look that time and thought may produce somewhat to disprove, discountenance, or, at least, divert it: For we live in an acute age, which hath much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Oratours Maxime, <hi>oportet posse contraria persuadere,</hi> by adding, <hi>etiam velle</hi>: To excite vertue or explode Vice is now but a School-boyes theme; He is, indeed a wit, that argues packing the Cards more honourable (because more ingenious,) then square play; can maintain Felony better then others can do Property, prove the true man robbed the thiefe, and say more, perhaps, for keeping a Brothel-house, then I can do for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Almes-house; Thus, since the publishing of my Reply, our Saviours questioning the sloathful servant, for not putting his Talent to the Bankers, was mainly urged to convince me of the lawfulnesse and expedience of Usury, leaving me to inferre, (for follow it needs must,) that Usury is necessary to salvation, the party there, (if you take the literal sense,) being evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for not being an Usurer; A clear case, one would think,

and past controule: And I expect some or other should shortly start this Doctrine, that it is the special duty or priviledge of Christians to practise Usury, since <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath forbidden it: Thus my learned adversary hath in his Preface asserted, that an Unthrift, Drunkard, or Whore-master, (and consequently, no doubt, an Oppressour, Highway-man, or Curpurse,) may passe for a tolerable Commonwealths-man, (if an <hi>Englishman</hi> born,) because every penny comes to the Natives; Thus he hath convinced us Page 2. That there cannot well be a more sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Almes-deed then an Usurious loan; Thus, in the same Page, he acquaints us, how the restraint of Usury is the defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of honest Creditours; that the State, (at least for shame of the World,) may not still persist in picking pockets, (and that with a vengeance,) as twice, it seems, already they have done; Thus he confidently assures us, Page 3. the lender got his mony by great industrie, and thereupon surmises that he lends it to a Trader, who certainly gains fifteen <hi>per Cent.</hi> whereas we thought, he had gotten part of it by happy conduct, and lent most of it to a Gentleman or Farmer, who never makes three, and who, by his own admission, must be thereby undone: Thus he possesses us, Sect 2. That Improvement is, in effect, ridiculous, implying, that it may shortly become a kind of Project in the Farmer, to dung or fence his Farme, because, it seems, the wisest and worthiest improvement is that of Interest mony, whereas I took that of Land to be the more natural and commendable of the two: Thus he blesses himself at raysing the Purchase of Land by fall of Interest, a question, which, I presumed, might soon be determined, (as to the Value of leases,) by comparing some of our yearly Almanacks, made, when mony was at eight <hi>per Cent.</hi> with others, since it came to six: Thus he intimates, Sect 3. That the stinting of wages would instantly cure us, but the subduing of Usury never, whereas I simply imagined, that in the reducing of mony, wages, (being mony,) were best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, <hi>viz.</hi> insensibly, without exception or prejudice, nay to vast and universal benefit: Thus he admitts, Page 18. That wages about <hi>London</hi> are raysed by meer confederacy, which makes me wonder, the <hi>Welch,</hi> and Northern men should not joyn with them, conclude, that, most callings being combined in the same
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29705:31"/>
league, <hi>Catilines</hi> conspiracy was not to be mentioned in respect of this, and only comfort my self, that Land-lords in the Country, for ought I hear, continue loyal, and are not of the Plot: Thus he makes it appear, Page 33. that we want wherewithal to purchase, whereas a classical Authour, Page 35. makes it likewise appear, that there are prodigious summes at command: And lastly, (for there is no end of his witty Paradoxes,) thus, with a delicate flourish, Page 17. he demonstrates, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting of one third from Usury, and adding it to industrie, (which I took to be greatly important in all undertakings and affairs,) signifies no more to trade, then the wrens pissing in the Ocean. Now since all these Fundamentals are so cleared and reconciled, who would despaire, that the same, or some other genius of the like sagacity may not henceforth infallibly teach us, that the redresse of our hardships will no more import to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Land, then, belike, the rate of Interest doth in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, nay further inform us, that honesty is destructive of Commonweal, and equal taxing monstrous unequal?</p>
            <p>For the importance, and indeed necessity, of this Proposal, hear the late excellent Prelate, before cited, in his Sermon on the nature of callings, where, having directed three main en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, 1. whether the thing be simply and in it self lawful, 2. whether it be lawful so as to be made a calling, 3. whether it will be profitable or rather hurtful to the Commonwealth, and shrewdly mated the Usurer in the first two, he thus proceeds as to the third Article; <hi>But say yet our Usurer should escape, at least in the judgment of his own hardened conscience, from both these rules, as from the Sword of</hi> Jehu <hi>and</hi> Hazael, <hi>there is yet a third rule, like the Sword of</hi> Elisha <hi>to strike him Stone dead, and he shall never be able to escape that; Let him shew, wherein his calling is profitable to humane society; He keeps no hospitality, If he have but a barr'd chest and a strong lock, to keep his God and his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (his</hi> Mammon <hi>and his parchments in,) he hath House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room enough; He fleeceth many, but cloatheth none; He biteth and devoureth, but eat<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th all his morsels alone; He giveth not so much as a Crumme, no not to his dearest Broker or Scrivener, only where he biteth, he alloweth them to scratch what they can for themselves: The King, the Church, the Poor are all wronged by
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29705:31"/>
him, and so are all that live near him; In every common charge, he slippeth the Collar, and leaveth the burthen upon those that are lesse able: It were not possible, Vsurers should be so bitterly inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against by sober Heathen writers, so severely censured by civil and Canon laws so uniformely condemned by godly Fathers and Councells, so universally hated by all men of all sorts, and in all ages and Countries, as Histories and Experience manifest they have been and are, if their practise and calling had been any way profitable, and not indeed every way hurtful and incommodious both to private men, and publick societies: If any thing can make a calling unlawful, certainly the Vsurers calling cannot be lawful.</hi> Thus preached that accurate Casuist neer fifty years since, when Land-taxes, properly so called, were not in being, when the Militia was rather an Exercise and Holyday sport then a burthen, and when our Parochial duties were not, I dare say, generally the fourth part in bulk to what they now are; For my Authour himself tell us, Page 25. that in his own Parish within these five and thirty years, the maintenance of the poor is swelled from six or seven Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to above an hundred, which is at least sixteen for one, even neer a great road, adjoyning to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> and in the very mouth of trade: And in most places of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed cloathing, it is too well known, the rates for the poor run from three to five shillings in the Pound, (and still, like a creeping soar, they spread,) wherewith the Land is frequently charged, though un-tenanted and un-stocked; However, if such Farms be eased, (as surely 'tis but reason they should,) still the neighbours are the more oppressed, and so must needs gallop into the same ruine: As for the variety of other rates and duties, the reckoning hath therein been likewise so inflamed, that, by a modest estimate, I cannot judge Interest of mony to be fairly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to Land, upon the Balance of our publick burthens, so little as twenty Millions principal, since the year 1641. It is therefore high time, at length, to make some hue and cry after that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table goodfellow, which hath so oft, so largely, nay gallantly robbed us; And if we cannot get him to refund, yet at least to look better to the bottom of the bagge, where his fingers are, methinks, as busie as ever.</p>
            <p>That it is practicable without inconvenience, to me appeares
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29705:32"/>
by this certain measure, that it having been already propounded to many intelligent persons of different byasse, all of which found themselves concern'd, there was never yet any thing moved, which received not its present answer; Neither indeed do I see, what can be colourably objected: For what, I pray, is lesse dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, then that Mortgages being local and fixed, their taxes and duties should attend the Estate, and be of course defalked by the debtour, (to his great ease,) as well as now by the Tenant? And that the rates of other summes and debts should always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the person and present habitation of the Creditour, even as now, in some small measure, they doe? If any pretend, it is hard for the Creditour to be so paenally compelled to taxe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; I answer, what remedy? Since his debtour dares not, for fear of trouble, his neighbours cannot for want of evidence, and himself will not for love of gain; For should he not, in good conscience, all along have done it without compulsion, at least not have avoyded it by shifts, Covenants and threats? If they plead, mens ability or weakenesse will be thereby discovered, is it not fit, say I, it should? Doth not my Adversary himself press for such discovery, Page 5? But what can this discover? Surely not very many personal debts, and for Mortgages, either they are now known, or it is pity they are not: If they alledge, that it is too shrewd for Creditours to taxe certainly for uncertain debts, I ask, whether there be almost any Gentleman of Estate in <hi>England,</hi> who hath not taxed for Land, when either by want of Tenants, losse of Rents, or divers other charges incident to Estates, it hath yielded him little or nothing, and whether all this while the lender have not thought it very just and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the half-ruined borrower, (even in such extreme cases,) to pay likewise his Taxes, as my Authour himself frankly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, Page 36. But some will yet, perhaps, further object, that there the Annual income only is ventured, here the Capital: My Reply then is, that debts upon personal security are either clearly secured, desperate, or doubtful: Of the clear, (which must needs include all considerable summes, the Creditour in great loanes having always divers strings to his bow,) there can be no question made, those being equivalent to mortgages, and of double value, in point of steady receipt, to the generality of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29705:32"/>
our Rents: Debts really desperate should, methinks, without more adoe, be quitted, the continuance of their claim serving only to wound charity, molest the insolvent, hurt and disturb the Commonwealth by rendring many of its members uselesse, male-content and fit only for mischief; As for doubtful, (and therefore hopeful,) debts, whereof farre the greater number, by reason of suretyships, are finally ensured with a witnesse, do not they who now sue for them effectually, venture a large Taxe to Atturnies, Lawyers, Officers and Sheriffes? And why should they grudge the Commonwealth its due to preserve their own? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides they have always, at the worst, their ready amends in their own hand; For may they not honestly purchase and turn their biting Usury into a healing Rent, to the just relief of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, benefit of their Country, and quiet of their conscience? It being now our greatest and most general complaint, that there is so much Land upon sale, and so few chapmen, seconded by my Authour himself, Page 33. Which way soever I look, the objections are either frivolous or inconsiderable to our grievance and prospect; For I dare maintain, that a taxe of three shillings in the Pound, indifferently charged, will not now so bite the Land by embasing its fund, and consequently cannot finally so much prejudice the State, as a taxe of twelve pence in the Pound, partially imposed, must inevitably doe: From whence I inferre, that (comparing our present condition and rates with the great likelyhood of their future growth, by reason of the dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of our neighbours in shipping,) whosoever argues, that Interest of mony should not, or cannot be taxed, in effect, rings his Countrys passing-bel; For it is notorious, that no good Plant ever did or can thrive together in the same soyle with Usury; Which, (being thus exempted and cherished,) infects our Land much worse then the sowing it with mustardseed. Wherefore, as a fair adieu to the Usurer, I shall now take my leave of him with this hearty and Christian admonition, that he first pluck the beam, (of avarice and sordid partiality,) out of his own eye, and then, perhaps, he may see clearer (then as yet, methinks, he doth) to take the more (of excesse or sloath,) out of his Brothers eye.</p>
