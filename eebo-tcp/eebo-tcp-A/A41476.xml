            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Day being appointed by his
Majeſty for a ſolemn Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to Almighty God, for
deliverance from inteſtine Wars
and an unnatural Rebellion; I ſhall not
bend my Diſcourſe to a bitter Invective, or
Satyrical Harangue, either againſt the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
of the Perſons, that were diſturbers
of our Peace; or awaken your Fears, by
ſetting forth the Miſeries and woful Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of a Civil War. The effects of one
above forty years ſince are ſtill felt among
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94149:4"/>
us, conſiſting in the contempt of God, and
Religion; in the practice of the higheſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities,
Injuſtice, and Debauchery; and
in a great, if not a total diſregard of our
Superiours and Governours, whether Civil
or Eccleſiaſtical. And when we know that
theſe are the neceſſary conſequences of Pride
and Ambition, of Rebellion and inteſtine
Wars; methinks, no Man endued with
Reaſon, enobled by Blood, courted by
Greatneſs, lov'd by many, and envied by
few, ſhould be ſo fond of that black Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
as not only to bear a principal part
in it himſelf, but alſo to aſſign others what
ſhare they ſhould have in it, to the ſcandal
of Religion, the ſhedding of innocent Blood,
and to the utter undoing of themſelves.</p>
            <p>This Subject I ſhall leave to others, whoſe
keener Wits, aſſiſted by ſome neceſſary
Qualifications, are more able to decipher
this ſo abhorr'd a Villany.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94149:4"/>
            <p>That which I ſhall do at this preſent
time, ſhall be to improve this Bleſſing of
Reſtored-Peace, into expreſſions of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to the Divine Goodneſs for this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance;
and to ſhew what is our Duty
conſequent upon it. That whoever may
be the Inſtruments, yet it is God's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
to make Peace and War. For, <hi>he
maketh Wars to ceaſe unto the end of the
Earth; he breaketh the Bow, and cutteth the
Spear in ſunder, he burneth the Chariot in the
fire.</hi> ver. 9. of this <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Wherefore it is
our Duty, not to repine and murmur with
God's dealings with Men in this caſe, but
to lay our hands upon our mouths, to be
ſtill and quiet under his Diſpenſations. To
truſt and depend upon him, for he is God:
And notwithſtanding the Imperious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
of Men, He will be exalted in the
Earth. And this is the comfort of all
good Men, that the Lord of Hoſts is their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94149:5"/>
God, and Refuge; ſo the Pſalmiſt in the
words I have now read. <hi>Be ſtill, and know
that I am God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Pſalm, whether of <hi>David,</hi> or ſome
other perſon, is a large profeſſion of truſt in,
and dependance upon God, in all times and
conditions of Life: <hi>God is our refuge and
ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble,</hi> v. 1.
And it ſeems to be compoſed in the time of
that profound Peace and Tranquillity, which
<hi>David</hi> enjoyed when he had wholly vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and ſubdued all Inteſtine Broils and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Enemies. And altho ſome Jewiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
would make it to be occaſioned by that
Deliverance of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the Aſſyrians
by the Angel in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time, recorded
in 2 <hi>King.</hi> ch. 19. yet ſeeing nothing of this
is mentioned either in the title of the Pſalm,
or in the ſubject matter of it, I rather think
it to refer (as I before hinted) to that Peace,
which <hi>David</hi> had when he was fully ſetled
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94149:5"/>
in his Kingdom. As you may read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.
13, 14, 15. <hi>And David gat him a Name, when
he returned from ſmiting of the Syrians in the
Valley of Salt. And he put Gariſons in</hi> Edom;
<hi>and God proſpered</hi> David <hi>whitherſoever he
went. And</hi> David <hi>reigned over all</hi> Iſrael:
<hi>And</hi> David <hi>executed Judgment and Juſtice
unto all his People.</hi> And further, it appears
from the contexture of the Pſalm, that there
was a ſtrong Conſpiracy againſt him, many
potent and moſt cruel Enemies, reſolvedly
bent for his deſtruction: (For he compares
their Tumults and Combinations to Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and the raging of the Sea; intimating
their ſtrength and malice, v. 3, 6.) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this, he placing his truſt and
confidence in God, was not at all terrified
or diſheartned: being well aſſured that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the performance of his duty, by daily
and conſtant Prayer, he ſhould meet with
that ſucceſs, which he could well hope for,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94149:6"/>
or deſire. Wherefore he ſummons all good
Men, duly to weigh and conſider of the
Goodneſs, Power, and Providence of God
in theſe matters: Of his Juſtice to all wicked
and rebellious Sinners: of his Power in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
of the World, and diſpoſing of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
according to his Pleaſure: and, laſtly,
his Mercy and Goodneſs to all good Men,
that have a full truſt and affiance in him,
from ver. 8. to the end: <hi>Come, behold the
Works of the Lord, what deſolations he hath
made in the Earth; he maketh Wars to ceaſe
unto the end of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be ſtill then,
and know that I am God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to which words, I ſhall do
theſe five things:</p>
            <p>1. Conſider the Power and Providence
of God, in ordering the Events of War and
Peace.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſequence of acquieſcing in theſe his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94149:6"/>
dealings without murmuring or repining;
<hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. What reaſon we have to truſt God
in the ordering theſe Events.</p>
            <p>4. The comfort &amp; encouragement good
Men have to depend upon God at all times,
he is with them, and is their refuge.</p>
            <p>5. Draw ſome Inferences from the whole
pertinent to this ſolemn Occaſion.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Power and Providence of God, in
ordering the Events of War and Peace.
For the Pſalmiſt here ſpeaks of his Enemies
combined together with rage and malice for
his deſtruction; and alſo of his deliverance
from their deſigned Miſchief. Wherefore
upon this experience of God's Power and
Goodneſs, he in a ſolemn manner ſummons
all good Men to come and behold, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
to conſider God's Providence in
theſe matters; ſometimes cauſing Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94149:7"/>
and at other times making Peace and
Tranquillity in the Earth. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
true both from the Perſon, the Author
of theſe Events, and the nature of the thing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, from the Author of theſe Events:
<hi>Know that I am God.</hi> As he is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
ſo he is the Governour of the World;
and nothing happens in the courſe of things,
but what is ordered by his over-ruling Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
The moſt minute things here below
are directed by his alwiſe Providence: how
much more the great and weightier Affairs
of Kingdoms and Nations? His Power is
viſibly ſeen in the Mutations and Changes
in inanimate Beings and ſublunary Bodies:
and the whole courſe of Heaven and Earth
are manag'd by his Governance: But more
eſpecially this is apparent in the riſe and fall
of Kingdoms and Nations. For he pulleth
down one, and ſetteth up another: He
ſcattereth the People that delight in War:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94149:7"/>
And when he ſpeaketh Peace, who can give
Trouble? I will not ſpend time to cite
Inſtances of this nature, recorded at large
by the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Hiſtorians, The
many Alterations in the Jewiſh State, their
Succeſs and Victory, their Decay and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
are remarkable proofs of the point
in hand. Whilſt they were obedient to the
Law and Commands of God, who was
their Supream Governour, with what few
Numbers, and almoſt incredible Succeſs did
they overturn and conquer mighty Nations
and People, ſtrong as the <hi>Anakims:</hi> and all
this, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, not by their might
and ſtrength, but by the Power of God:
But when they fell back from his Service,
they were oppreſſed by their Neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
carried captive into ſtrange Countries,
their Land made miſerably deſolate by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi>
God's Scourge; And in tract
of time abandoned to all the Infelicities that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94149:8"/>
Omnipotent Power was pleaſed to threaten
and inflict upon them. So true is that which
is ſpoken by <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning the ſame
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in this very caſe, God doth
according to his Will in the Army of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and among the Inhabitants of the Earth:
and none can ſtay his Hand, or ſay unto
him, What doſt thou? <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 35. But
we have a remarkable Inſtance of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact nearer home; For we cannot but
remember the beſt of Kings, once the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his People, the delight of their eyes,
and the breath of their noſtrils; ſupported
by his own Power, poſſeſs'd of the whole
Strength of the Nation, and wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
either of Goodneſs or Grandeur to
make him beloved at home, and feared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
yet after all this, by the malice of
wicked and turbulent Men, given to change,
by popular Pretences, by ſly and falſe Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations,
made the Enemy of his Country,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94149:8"/>
the Mark to be ſhot at, the Betrayer of his
Peoples Liberties, the Patron of Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the Subverter of Religion: By
which he was hunted (like <hi>David)</hi> as a
Partridg on the Mountains; by Rebellious
Arms deveſted of his <hi>Power,</hi> ſeiz'd, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned;
under the formality of Juſtice, illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tried for thoſe very crimes, which they
themſelves were guilty of; and at laſt fell
a Sacrifice to that accurſed Faction, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fouleſt ſtain upon our moſt Holy
Religion, the Honour of the Engliſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the higheſt Guilt and Deſolation,
that can be mentioned in any Story. On
the other hand; when God had permitted
theſe ſons of Belial to tire and weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with their Iniquities, He by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Providence turn'd all into a <hi>profound
Peace;</hi> and without Bloodſhed, reſtored our
late dread Sovereign, and this our now gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
King, to their Rights, together with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94149:9"/>
our Religion and Liberties. <hi>En! Digitus
Dei.</hi> This is none other but God's doing,
and it is marvellous in our eyes; As the
<hi>Pſalmist</hi> expreſſes it in the like caſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi>
118. 23.</p>
            <p>2. The nature of the thing requires that
God ſhould order theſe Events. For, being
infinitely wiſe, he knows how to direct all
Affairs and Actions to their beſt and nobleſt
ends; what is moſt for his Glory, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and Welfare of Mankind; <hi>When the
Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the
Strong: When time and chance happen to all
men, i. e.</hi> that Events are contrary to their
Cauſes, and theſe ſublunary things ſeem to
be left to their own governance, as it ſhall
happen: Then if Men will ſit down and
conſider, their own Reaſon will tell them,
that there is a Superintendant Power that
manages ſecond Cauſes, elſe theſe would not
fail of their proper Effects. For let Men
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94149:9"/>
talk never ſo <hi>Captiouſly,</hi> or Atheiſtically ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it will appear an avowed Truth, That
were it not for the interpoſition of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, Force and Power would
always prevail, and neceſſary Cauſes would
produce the deſigned Fruits. For if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
What ſhould hinder? They muſt
aſſign, that the Reaſon of it is either from
themſelves, or from ſome other more potent
Being. If the firſt, then they are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Cauſes, and it is to no purpoſe to
ſpeak of their force and energy, when they
are not able to effect that which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Reaſon of their being ſuch. And if it be
from without, that they do not attain their
end; let thoſe Scepticks (if they can) aſſign
any other Being whatſoever, beſides Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, which can over-rule Events
contrary to their Cauſes. The truth is,
ſome Men, becauſe of their vicious lives
and practices, are juſtly afraid of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94149:10"/>
Dread Majeſty of Heaven; and therefore
endeavour to diſpute God out of the world:
rather taking up with the fantaſtical Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis
of <hi>Epicurus</hi> (whoſe Contrivance is as
ſilly as it is blaſphemous); or with the grave
Notions of an impoſing <hi>Leviathan,</hi> (who
hath ſubjected the Supream Deity, and his
Attributes, Vice and Vertue, to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
Power of the Magiſtrate, and theſe
ſublunary things to a fatal neceſſity) Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I ſay, beguiling themſelves with theſe
trifles, than owning a Providence to govern
them, or a God to judg them. But would
Men impartially conſult their own Reaſon,
that would tell them, without the help of
Revelation, That it is abſolutely neceſſary,
in order to the ſolving the Doubts that do
and will ariſe, to grant the Being of a God,
and his Providence, and that he does direct
the iſſues and events of things: For, as the
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, Pſal. 58. <hi>ult.—ſo that a Man
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94149:10"/>
ſhall ſay, Verily there is a reward for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
verily he is a God that judgeth in the
Earth.</hi> And thus I have done with the
firſt Obſervation from the words. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the ſecond,</p>
            <p>2. To ſhew the neceſſary conſequence of
acquieſcing in theſe his dealings without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
or repining; <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I
am God.</hi> And this by a plain connexion
follows from the former Poſition: For if
God's Power and Providence order all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
of War and Peace; then to acquieſce
in theſe dealings is highly reaſonable: for,
notwithſtanding our petulency, we cannot
alter the nature and iſſue of things, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſpoſed by an Almighty Power, which
none can reſiſt. <hi>Where the Word of a King is,
there is Power, and who can ſay to him, What
doſt thou?</hi> And if this be true in reſpect of
temporal Princes, it is much more ſo with
regard to God, <hi>by whom Kings reign, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94149:11"/>
Princes decree Juſtice.</hi> For on the one
hand, let Force and Counſel, Strength and
Policy, a good Cauſe, and a wiſe-formed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution;
let Numbers, and the Sinews of
War be all united together to effect the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
Purpoſe: yet all theſe ſhall be too
little, and ſtand in no ſtead, when God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to overthrow the Enterprize. Nay,
ſuppoſe further, that the ſubject-matter of
the Undertaking be juſt and good; and (to
ſpeak without a cant) that it be really the
Cauſe of God, the defence of Religion, and
Liberty of the Subject, (as was truly the
caſe of the bleſſed Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> I.)
in that Civil-War and Rebellion, and of
this late <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> notwithſtanding their falſe
Shews and Pretences to the contrary) I ſay,
ſuppoſing all this, yet it is God alone that
can give Victory and Succeſs, and to make
the Iſſue and Event proſperous. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
when wicked <hi>Achitophels,</hi> and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94149:11"/>
               <hi>Abſoloms</hi> combine together in Treaſon
and Rebellion; when their Strength is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and their Force formidable: when their
Plots are laid as low as Hell, and their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out as terrible as that of a mighty Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
Tis God alone that can fruſtrate theſe
Deſigns: His Counſel ſhall ſtand, maugre
all their Imaginations. <hi>He bringeth to nought
the Counſels of the Wicked, and maketh their
Devices of none effect. In the ſame Net which
they hid, is their foot taken. The Snare is
broken, and</hi> (bleſſed be God) that we ſee this
Day to give Thanks that <hi>we are delivered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the reſult of our reaſoning in theſe
matters comes to this, That ſeeing the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Providence of God, orders all the
Events of Peace and War, vve ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
(be the iſſue what it will:) As to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all things to him, ſo to reſt ſatisfied with
what is done; vvell knowing that he in his
Wiſdom beſt underſtands what is fitteſt and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94149:12"/>
moſt conduſive to our Good and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And would we patiently ſubmit to
God's Will in all concerns of life; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in ſuch extraordinary caſes, as Tumults
and Inſurrections, Commotions and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions;
it would more contribute to the quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of thoſe, and effecting our Peace, than
any other courſe whatſoever we could take.
Let us conſider that God governs the world,
and that vvhatſoever is done in the Earth,
he doth it himſelf; That his Will ſhall take
place, be our Contrivances and Devices
what they <hi>will:</hi> And then theſe Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cannot chuſe but baniſh all our Fears of
the worſer part, raiſe our Hopes, fortify our
Truſt, and mightily encourage our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings:
or at leaſt, let the extreameſt and
ſoreſt happen, it will cauſe us with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and patience to acquieſce in God's
Diſpenſations, and to ſay, <hi>Not my will, but
thy Will he done:</hi> Or to expoſtulate vvith
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94149:12"/>
our ſelves in the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Why
art thou cast down, O my Soul, and why art
thou diſquieted within me? Hope in God, for
I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my
Countenance, and my God.</hi> Which brings me
to the third Obſervation from the words,
vvhat reaſon we have to truſt God in the
ordering theſe Events.</p>
            <p>Now tho I have in a great meaſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
my ſelf, by vvhat I have already
ſpoken upon the former Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> from
the Power and Providence of God in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
all Events, not to murmur and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
vvhen the iſſue of things have gone
contrary to their cauſes: yet becauſe good
and holy Men have made this the matter of
their complaint, and has proved the ground
of great trouble and diſquiet to them, (as I
could inſtance in <hi>Job, David,</hi> and <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah;</hi>)
I ſhall therefore conſider this <hi>Caſe</hi> a
little further, and ſhew vvhat reaſon vve
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94149:13"/>
have to truſt God in theſe Events, and to
reſt aſſured that he vvill be favourable and
propitious to us.</p>
            <p>I deny not but that vvicked Men have
grown great and proſperous in the World,
have by their Cunning and Force prevailed
to the Overthrow of Righteous Kings and
Nations: yet it muſt be acknowledged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
that this is a rare Caſe, and ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens:
And vvhen it does, beſides the ſecret
Reaſons which Almighty God reſerves in
his own Counſel, not too narrowly to be
pried into by us, becauſe not revealed, this
I may poſitively affirm, that Sin is the moving
Cauſe of ſuch Evils; according to that of the
Prophet, <hi>For the Iniquities thereof, the Land
ſhall mourn.</hi> Vertue and Vice, Sin &amp; Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are the ſtanding Reaſons of Proſperity
and Affliction. So the Prophet tell us, <hi>Jer.</hi>
18. 7, 8, 9. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94149:13"/>
to pluck up, pull down, and to deſtroy; if that
Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn
from their evil, then I will repent of the evil
that I thought to do unto them. And at what
inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and
a Kingdom, to build and to plant it; if it do
evil in my ſight, that it obey not my Voice, then
I will repent of the good, wherewith I ſaid I
would benefit them.</hi> So that this is one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why we ſhould truſt God with theſe
Events, becauſe he has promiſed that he will
deliver us out of Calamities. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
are not to be taken too ſtrictly, as if it
were never otherwiſe, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> For
the moſt part it will hold true, that God
will protect and defend ſuch as do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and depend upon him. We have the
higheſt Reaſon imaginable to truſt God with
all our Concerns; becauſe if we do ſo, that
God who is Truth it ſelf, and cannot lye,
has promiſed Protection and Deliverance.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94149:14"/>
Thus <hi>David</hi> in that Thankſgiving-Pſalm,
after his Deliverance from <hi>Saul,</hi> and all his
Enemies, tells us, 2 <hi>Sam. 22. The Lord is a
Buckler to all them that put their truſt in him;
God is my Strength and Power; He teacheth
my Hands to war, ſo that a Bow of Steel is
broken by mine Arms.</hi> And <hi>Pſ. 37. 39, 40. The
Salvation of the Righteous is of the Lord, he is
their Strength in the time of trouble. The Lord
ſhall help them and deliver them: he ſhall deliver
them from the Wicked, and ſave them, becauſe
they put their truſt in him.</hi> And hence it is that
<hi>David</hi> upon all occaſions ſpeaks confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of his Salvation from all his Enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of God's Promiſes; <hi>The Lord is my
Light and Salvation; whom ſhall I fear? the
Lord is the Strength of my Life, of whom ſhall
I be afraid? Though an Host ſhould encamp
againſt me, mine heart ſhall not fear: though
War ſhould riſe against me, in this will I be
confident.</hi> Pſal. 27. 1, 3. So that it is very
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94149:14"/>
reaſonable to truſt God in theſe caſes, becauſe
he has promiſed to ſave thoſe that do place
their confidence in him. <hi>It is better to truſt
in the Lord, than to put confidence in Man:</hi>
for <hi>the Lord is my Strength and Song, and is
become my Salvation.</hi> So the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
118. 8, 14.</p>
            <p>But this will more fully appear, if we
conſider, 2dly, the matter of fact, that God
hath in an extraordinary manner ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for the deliverance of ſuch as have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon him for Salvation. There are
many Examples to be brought in proof of
this matter: But I ſhall confine my ſelf to
two eſpecially, recorded in Sacred Writ:
The firſt is that of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> mentioned in the
tenth Chapter of that Book; where five
Kings combine together againſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Their Strength great, their
Numbers far exceeding thoſe of <hi>Joſhua;</hi>
their Intereſt ſuch, as could not but animate
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94149:15"/>
and provoke to a bold and obſtinate reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
Yet for all this, <hi>Joſhua</hi> encouraged by
God (ver. 8.) ſaying, <hi>Fear them not, for I
have delivered them into thine hand, there
ſhall not a Man of them ſtand before thee.</hi>
This mighty Army was ſoon diſcomfited,
their Force broken, and a total Overthrow
given to the whole Army: God himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
ſignally in their defence by Miracles
and Signs from Heaven. For, as the Text
tells us, <hi>The Lord caſt down great Stones from
Heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
they were more which died with Hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,
than they whom the Children of Iſrael
ſlew with the Sword.</hi> v. 11. And further,
that it might appear that God fought for
them, (contrary to the courſe of thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
Beings) <hi>the Sun and Moon ſtood ſtill,
until the People had avenged themſelves upon
their Enemies,</hi> v. 13. So true is that of the
Prophet, ſpoken of the temporal deliverance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94149:15"/>
of <hi>Judah,</hi> Iſa. 54. 17. <hi>No Weapon that is
formed againſt thee ſhall proſper. This is the
Heritage of the Servants of the Lord.</hi> The
other Inſtance is that of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> againſt
whom <hi>Senacherib</hi> unjuſtly wageth War, and
ſends <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> with a mighty Army againſt
<hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> The King being in a great Strait,
applies himſelf to God by the Prophet <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah;</hi>
and by earneſt Prayer obtains Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Victory over that mighty Hoſt:
for <hi>in one night the Angel of the Lord went
out and ſmote in the Camp of the Aſſyrians an
hundred fourſcore and five thouſand: and when
they aroſe in the morning, behold, they were all
dead Corpſes.</hi> 2 King. 19. 35. This may be
ſufficient to prove the point in hand, that it
is highly reaſonable to depend upon God as
to the event of theſe things, becauſe he hath
promiſed he will deliver thoſe that truſt in
him; and in fact has delivered his People
ſignally out of the hands of their Enemies.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94149:16"/>
            <p>From whence likewiſe doth ariſe, in the
fourth place, great Comfort and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Good Men, always to truſt God
in all conditions. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is with
us, the God of Jacob is our Refuge.</hi> If we
conſider Man ſingle by himſelf, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with others, ſuch is the condition of
humane Nature, that without the interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Providence of God, it were better for
him not be at all, than to be ſo miſerable
as the frailties of corrupt Nature would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him to. For in ſuch a ſtate Men would
be Wolves and Tygers to one another, and
inſtead of being fellow-creatures, (made for
mutual help and ſociety) they would ſoon
devour each other, and the weak become a
prey to the ſtronger party. Inſomuch as
<hi>Hobbs</hi> his <hi>Status Naturae,</hi> would juſtify all
Wars, Rebellions, and unjuſt Invaſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rights of others. But for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
theſe are only the wild Fancies of one
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94149:16"/>
that would ſerve a turn, and was timely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
to ſupport an<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s <hi>Leviathan,</hi> p. 8. where he tells my Lord, that the reaſon of his writing that Book was (to expreſs it in his own words) <hi>the truth is, I have a mind to return into</hi> England.</note> 
               <hi>Olivarian</hi> Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>The Lord of Hoſts is our Refuge;</hi> and
happy it is for us that we are under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
&amp; guidance of his all-wiſe Providence.
For if he be on our ſide, it matters not who
is againſt us. It is He that gives Peace, who
then can trouble us? <hi>The Lord is on my
ſide, I will not fear what Man can do unto
me.</hi> Tho the Winds blow, the Sea rages,
and all the Earth be moved with the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
thereof; yet if we depend and truſt in
God, we may reſt aſſured, and comfort our
ſelves in this, that none of theſe evils ſhall
ever take hold of us, that nothing ſhall harm
us if we be followers of that which is good.
All which adminiſters great Comfort under
all Preſſures and perſonal Afflictions, under
all Straits, Commotions, and Diſtractions;
when enraged Faction, and rebellious Fury
threaten all with Ruine and Deſolation to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94149:17"/>
devour, This (I ſay) is our Comfort,
that God is on our ſide, and has promiſed
to deliver thoſe, who with a full Affiance
truſt in him: That it ſhall be well with
thoſe that fear him; and that all things ſhall
work together for good to ſuch as love him.
<hi>The Lord will be a Refuge for the Oppreſſed,
a Refuge in times of Trouble. And they that
know his Name, will put their trust in him:
for thou, Lord, haſt not forſaken them that ſeek
thee. And not only a covering from the Storm,
but a Shield and Defender from the face of the
Enemy. O Iſrael, truſt in the Lord, he is their
Help, and their Shield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have done with what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ſpeak to from theſe words; I ſhall
only in the 5th and laſt place, draw an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
or two pertinent to the Occaſion,
and conclude.</p>
            <p>1. Seeing the Power and Providence of
God orders all Events of Peace and War,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94149:17"/>
Let us acknowledg in all our Deliverances
this as the Supream Cauſe of our Safety.
For whatever are the Inſtruments, 'tis God
alone that gives the Succeſs and Victory.
<hi>He is the Lord of Hoſts, this is his Name,</hi>
(as he tells his People <hi>Iſrael</hi>) becauſe he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
preſides over the Armies of the
Earth, and orders the Events thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this, and all other Deliverances, let
us own him as the Author; and aſcribe the
Honour to his Power. <hi>There is no King</hi>
(ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>can be ſaved by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of an Host, neither is any mighty Man
delivered by much Strength.</hi> This was too
ſadly experienced in the firſt Rebellion;
where that good King and Martyr, King
<hi>Charles the first,</hi> outweighed the Numbers,
Power, and the then ſtated Policy of the
head-ſtrong Faction: And on the other hand,
in this late accurſed Deſign, (according to
the beſt information from Prints) neither
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94149:18"/>
their Numbers, nor their Confederacy, nor
their Cunning, nor their Courage (enflamed
by an Enthuſiaſtick Zeal) were ſo far to be
deſpiſed, as to think that we were able in a
moment to blaſt and overthrow them: for
the Caſe in appearance was quite otherwiſe;
and to God only muſt we aſcribe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Day, and give him the juſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of it. <hi>If the Lord himſelf had not been
on our ſide, may Iſrael now ſay; if the Lord
himſelf had not been on our ſide, when Men
roſe up againſt us, they had ſwallowed us up
quick, when they were ſo wrathfully diſpleaſed
at us. But Salvation belongeth unto thee, O
Lord; the Help that is done upon Earth, he
doth it himſelf. God hath ſhewed us his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
plenteouſly, God hath let usſee our deſire
upon our Enemies. Not unto us, O Lord, not
unto us, but unto thy Name be the Praiſe, for
thy Mercy, and for thy Truth's ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Which is the ſecond Inference, and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94149:18"/>
Duty peculiar to the Day; Let us return
our juſt tribute of Praiſe and Thankſgiving
to our great Sovereign the King of Heaven
and Earth for this ſo <hi>ſignal</hi> a Mercy; well
knowing, that ſuch publick Bleſſings (as his
Majeſty moſt devoutly words it in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation)
are Invitations from Heaven to
us to render chearful Expreſſions of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to the Divine Goodneſs. It hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God in his Mercy, and Juſtice too, to uſe
various Methods to ſave us from our Sins,
and the hands of our Enemies. He hath tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us by a ſeries of Mercies, and a train of
Judgments, and this on purpoſe to make
us ſuch a People, as he may delight in us to
do us good; and to ſave us even againſt our
wills and obſtinacy. But this laſt Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is of ſuch a nature, as could we ſee to
the bottom of this Rebellious Deſign, (as I
doubt not but thoſe who ſit at the Helm,
are ſufficiently acquainted with it) it would
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94149:19"/>
at one and the ſame time ſtrike us with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and amazement for the danger we were
in; and fill our hearts and mouths with joy
and gladneſs for the ſtrangeneſs of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.
The truth is, God hath wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
appeared in the Preſervation of this
King and Nation. He hath delivered Him
out of ſix Troubles, and out of ſeven: So
that thoſe words of the Apoſtle in his own
caſe, may (without a tort) be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
applied unto Him; That tho he was
in Perils of Waters, in Perils by his own
Countrymen, in Perils in the Sea, and in
Perils by falſe Brethren; yet the Almighty
God ſtill was his God and Refuge: And
notwithſtanding the Counſels of ſome to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar
him of his Right, (the Conſequence of

(with which I will conclude</hi>) The Lord
liveth, and bleſſed be my Rock; and let the
God of my Salvation be exalted. It is God
that avengeth me, and ſubdueth the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

yea, thou liftest me up above thoſe that

Thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,

great Deliverance giveth He unto his King,
