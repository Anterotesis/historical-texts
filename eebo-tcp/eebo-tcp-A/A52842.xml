         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat ever may have induced your Majeſty to
write us the Letter, which the Trumpetter we
had ſent you hath delivered us from your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
dated the 7/17 Novemb., we do think ourſelves
bound to return you our thanks, for the honour
you have been pleaſed to do us; But we cann't
but let you know, at the ſame time, how much we are troubled to
ſee your Majeſty ſo prepoſſeſs'd againſt us, and that thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
whom you moſt truſt, have hitherto had the skill to
influence your Majeſty ſo far as we ſee they have done, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading
you to aver ſo many things, which they ſuppoſ'd were
out of your Majeſty's memory, and which they know in their
own conſciences to be contrary to all truth.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, SIR, we do not think fitt to give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
anſwer to all the heads of the Letter, your Majeſty hath
written to us, that we may not give a new occaſion to thoſe
that have ſo poſſeſs'd your Majeſty, to exaſperate you further:
But referring ourſelves to the Deduction, which we are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to ſet forth in anſwer to the <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> which was publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in your Majeſty's Name, we shall ſatisfy ourſelves with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
here unto your Majeſty, that as we have alledg'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Letter we had written to your Majeſty, whereof
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33542:3"/>
we have not in our hands authentick and undenyable proofs,
ſo we shall be ready at all times to produce them before your
Majeſty, whenſoever you will be pleaſed to give us a fitter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for it. And withall ſince your Majeſty (ſuppoſing
that what information you had received from your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
was more faithfull,) hath complained to your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our obſtinate averſeneſſe to Peace, and that the <hi>Houſe
of Commons</hi> according to their wonted prudence, have
been pleaſed to ſuſpend their judgement therein, and to
give us thereby an occaſion to lay our innocence more open,
and to give more publique and convincing proofs of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of our intentions; We have thought it neceſſary to add,
that to let your Majeſty, and all your Kingdom ſee, that we
do not affect to ſpeak of Peace (as is layd to our charge) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
really deſiring the ſame, and that we are farr from entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ourſelves within generall words, without coming to any
particular overtures, We are ready to renew with your Majeſty
the Treaty which you concluded with us at <hi>Breda</hi> in the year
1667, and to explain the 19. Article concerning the Flagg, in
ſuch a manner as may prevent any further diſpute for the future,
and that may regulate and ſettle the practice thereof without any
ambiguity. And being your Majeſty judged the ſaid Treaty ſo
juſt and ſo equitable, that for ſome years after we received more
proofs of your Majeſty's friendship, and you entered with us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſtricter Alliances than ever, we do propoſe the ſame as the
moſt ſolid foundation of a firme and durable Peace, and we
hope your Majeſty will not refuſe to return to your former amity
with us, upon the ſame termes which you have heretofore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of; the rather becauſe the intereſt of the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and many other reſpects relating to the good of both
Nations, ought to be a ſtrong argument on both ſides to unite
us again the ſooner. Moreover becauſe ſome have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33542:3"/>
to perſuade your Majeſty that we have violated our Treatyes,
and committed ſeverall injuſtices for which ſatisfaction is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
we are alſo ready to ſend forthwith our Embaſſadors
to your Majeſty, to give you a more faithfull account of the
truth than you have received from our Ennemies, &amp; to examine
in your preſence all the infractions that are layd to our charge,
with a ſolemn promiſe to repair and give ſatisfaction, for all the
wrongs or injuries, which either your Majeſty or your Subjects,
may have received from us or from our Officers, ſince the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Treaty of <hi>Breda</hi> till the beginning of this War.</p>
            <p>And to the end that this inquiry may not retard the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of a Peace which we ſo earneſtly deſire, and which is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the good of all Chriſtendom; We do offer to your
Majeſty, for a greater ſecurity, the <hi>Guarantie</hi> of our Allyes for
the exact and punctuall performance of the promiſe we make
here, and which we are willing to have inſerted in the Treaty,
which shall be concluded, to make the ſame ſo much the more
authentick.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to demonſtrate to your Majeſty how farr we value
your friendship; We do profer you likewiſe, to reſtore the <hi>New
Netherlands,</hi> with any other Place or Colony, our armes may
have conquered during this Warr; not doubting but that your
Majeſty will not refuſe reciprocally to engage, to reſtore to us
what Territoryes or Forts your Majeſty may have conquerred.</p>
            <p>But becauſe your Majeſty ſeemeth above all to complain, that
we do highly offend you, by propoſing to your Majeſty to
leave your Allyes, to whom you have promiſed not to treat ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
whileſt we do eſtablish it for a fundamental point, that we
cann't break the word we have given ours, without wronging our
honour, as if your Majeſty was to value yours leſs; We beſeech
your Majeſty to conſider, there is a vaſt difference between your
engagements &amp; ours, as well as in the carriage of thoſe we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33542:4"/>
allyed with: And your Majeſty may with as much Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
as glory quench a fire, which hath already ſpred it ſelf much
further than you did think at firſt; whereas we could not forſake
our Allyes, without being guilty of the greateſt ingratitude, and
without deſtroying Europe by deſtroying ourſelves. When your
Majeſty did at firſt joyn with our Ennemies, you did ſeem to int<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end
only to bring our Commonwealth low; But now the War
is grown a generall one; and the <hi>Spanish Netherlands</hi> for
the preſervation of which your Majeſty hath alwayes appeared
ſo zealous, are no leſs concerned in it than our ſelves, as well as
the greateſt part of the Empire.</p>
            <p>Beſides, your Majeſty hath ſo much the leſs reaſon to continue
in your former Alliance, ſince your Allyes themſelves have altered
the nature of this War, and have forced our friends to declare
ſo much the ſooner in our behalf, whileſt neither his Imperiall
Majeſty nor the moſt Serene King of Spain, could bear no longer
with the hoſtilityes the French committed every day in all the
Low Countrys, and in ſeverall Provinces of the Empire, where
they had already maſtered an Electorall Town. But not to enter
into theſe particulars, and laying aſide ſeverall other arguments
of the ſame kind, your Majeſty, SIR, hath but to much cauſe
to forſake an Allye that hath ſought nothing in this Warr but his
own private advantage, and who in the moſt important occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
hath taken care of nothing leſs than of your Majeſtys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
not to ſay worſe: And if your Majeſty do ſtill doubt the
truth of it, let not your Majeſty relye upon what thoſe that are
Friends to France do tell you; But be pleaſed duely to examine
what paſs'd at Utrecht the laſt year between the French Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and our Deputys, and you'l ſee plainly how upright the
carriage of your Allyes hath been. To be convinced of it, it is
even ſufficient to read the Propoſalls which France made then
to us, wherein there is not the leaſt word relating to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33542:4"/>
and whileſt our other Deputys were kept at Hampton-court
without granting them any Audience, we were preſs'd
hard at Utrecht to agree upon, and conclude a Treaty without
your Majeſty's participation: And to quicken us the more, we
were told that unleſs we granted within five dayes what was then
demanded of us, they would afterwards raiſe their demands
higher. We might add to this ſeverall other overtures which
have ſince been made to us, wherein as little care was taken of
your Majeſty: But by reaſon theſe have been leſs publique how
reall ſoever they were, we shall not inſiſt upon them, and will
only for a finall proof of the obligations your Allyes have laid
upon your Majeſty, put you in mind of what hath paſs'd in the
Sea-fights; whereof we'l have no other witneſſes, and appeal to
no other Judges, but thoſe that have had the command of your
Majeſty's Fleets, with the reſt of the Officers and Seamen.
But as for us, ſeeing our Allyes have carryed themſelves in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſo different; that they have laid upon us ſuch Obligations as
we cannot ſufficiently expreſſe; that withall we are entered with
them into this Alliance out of an unavoidable neceſſity, &amp; for the
good of all Europe; And laſtly (as we have ſaid it before) that
we cannot leave them without undoing ourſelves, and expoſing
to an eminent danger the ſafety of Chriſtendom; Your Majeſty
ought not to wonder if we cannot conſent to break our word to
them, nor take it ill, if we endeavour to perſuade your Majeſty
to follow your true intereſt, and to take a reſolution which
would be as generous and as juſt, as it would prove beneficiall
to your Kingdoms, and to your Majeſty's Neighbours.</p>
            <p>To which we may add, that a ſeparate Treaty is ſo much
the more neceſſary and warrantable, by reaſon of the abſolute
ſtop which is put to the Conferences at Collen, by the obſtinate
denyal the French have made, ſome months ſince, to grant the
neceſſary Paſſes to the Miniſters of the Duke of Lorraine (one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33542:5"/>
of our Allyes) and to admit him a Principall in <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Negotiation
of Peace.</p>
            <p>This, SIR, is what we have thought fit both to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and to offer unto your Majeſty, in anſwer to what was
moſt eſſentiall in your Letter. And we conceive hopes that if
your Majeſty will never ſo little reflect upon the ſame, you
will own, that nothing more can in juſtice be demanded
of us; Neither can we perſuade ourſelves that your Majeſty
will without need, as well as without advantage, countenance
any longer the armes of the French not only againſt us,
but alſo againſt ſome other of your ancienteſt Allyes, who are
engaged to run the ſame fortune with us; And to endanger
ſtill both all Europe and the Proteſtant Religion. We'l ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
with great impatience your Majeſty's reſolution, upon
which the reſt and the proſperity of ſo many Nations doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
In the mean time we pray God,</p>
