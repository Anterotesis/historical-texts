            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Which words with other the like in the Scripture, have emboldned me to bring that my small tallent to the banke, beseeching the Almighty to make it proffitable to his glory, and

            <lg>
               <l>AS Isaack typt the Prince of peace,</l>
               <l>He had great trouble in his life,</l>
               <l>Though God him blest, gave him increase,</l>
               <l>Yet hee had almost lost his wife,</l>
               <l>Rabeckas bewty stirred strife,</l>
               <l>Those people thought she was a mayd;</l>
               <l>And Isaacks words they were so rise,</l>
               <l>Which to this King so much had sayd,</l>
               <l>Because be dwelt by them in feare,</l>
               <l>Told him that shee his sister were.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But at the last truth came to light,</l>
               <l>As hee out of his window lay,</l>
               <l>Had these two persons in his sight,</l>
               <l>And did behold their sport and play.</l>
               <l>Then hee to Isaack thus did say,</l>
               <l>Why toldest thou me such a thing,</l>
               <l>One of my folke had almost lay</l>
               <l>With this thy wife. And then this King</l>
               <l>Told his men, it would cost his life</l>
               <l>That touched Isaack or his wife.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then Isaack he did sow his land,</l>
               <l>Found hundredfold increase that yeare,</l>
               <l>God blest all things hee tooke in hand</l>
               <l>Whereat this people angry were,</l>
               <l>And King Abimeleck did feare,</l>
               <l>Sayd, thou art mightier then wee.</l>
               <l>So Isaack went to Gerar there</l>
               <l>At his returning back did see</l>
               <l>The wells full earth his father made,</l>
               <l>Which is the Romish heardmens trade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Those heardmen gave them other names</l>
               <l>Then Abraham had given before,</l>
               <l>Which after turned to their shames.</l>
               <l>These wells brought Isaack trouble more</l>
               <l>Then all his wealth, though hee had store</l>
               <l>For water hee could hardly want,</l>
               <l>His cattell would be quickly poore,</l>
               <l>For water in that land was scant,</l>
               <l>He gott these wells, againe was glad,</l>
               <l>Gave them the names before they had.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then Isaacks servants dig'd a new,</l>
               <l>And found a living water spring,</l>
               <l>Which troubled that cursed crew,</l>
               <l>Great strife arose about this thing,</l>
               <l>The men of Gerar there stryving,</l>
               <l>Told Isaacks men this was their owne,</l>
               <l>But seeing they no proofe could bring</l>
               <l>By name of strife this well was knowne,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10801:5"/>Yet after this digged another,</l>
               <l>Strived for it as for the other.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So Isaack did remove from thence</l>
               <l>Digg'd one for which they strived not,</l>
               <l>He saw Gods helping hand from whence</l>
               <l>He larged was, and roome had got,</l>
               <l>A fruitfull place fell to his lot,</l>
               <l>Who sayd that now he should increase,</l>
               <l>Thereof he wanted not a jot,</l>
               <l>For afterward he liv'd in peace</l>
               <l>From thence went to Bersheba right,</l>
               <l>And God appear'd to him that night.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And thus the Lord to Isaack sayd,</l>
               <l>I am thy Fathers God sayd hee,</l>
               <l>And therefore be thou not afrayd,</l>
               <l>For I will blesse and byde by thee,</l>
               <l>Increase thy seed this shalt thou see,</l>
               <l>Who did which him a Covenant make,</l>
               <l>With many words that did agree,</l>
               <l>That this was all for Abrahams sake.</l>
               <l>Then Isaack did these things record,</l>
               <l>An Altar built call'd on the Lord.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Abimeleck then to Isaack went,</l>
               <l>Which Captaine Phicall call'd by name,</l>
               <l>And Isaack asked his intent,</l>
               <l>Because for strife from them he came;</l>
               <l>These words might make him blush for shame.</l>
               <l>He saw the Lord with Isaack was,</l>
               <l>He came for peace, and sought the same,</l>
               <l>Isaack agreed, it came to pas,</l>
               <l>In feast they ech to other swore,</l>
               <l>And after fell at strife no more.</l>
