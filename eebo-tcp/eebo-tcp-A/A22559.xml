            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of which Å¿ubiect and argument, if we will beleeue the large and lamentable diÅ¿courÅ¿es of fondrie credible authors, we Å¿hal fynde the accompt made, that all the diÅ¿aÅ¿ters, miÅ¿eries, and calamities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ewing to man from all other creatures of the world, either in heauen, earth, Å¿ea, or ayer, or from the foure elementes together with their diÅ¿temperatures or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, doth not equal the number of hurtes receyued by man from man. Wherunto we if lay on the other Å¿yde, the oppoÅ¿ite rule of ChriÅ¿tian religion, founded vpon loue of one man towardes an other, and bynding each one to do as he would be donn vnto: we Å¿hal eaÅ¿ely

diÅ¿couer the roote and reaÅ¿on, why Å¿o many do periÅ¿h, and Å¿o few are Å¿aued, of thoÅ¿e that profeÅ¿Å¿e the ChriÅ¿tian name, for that Å¿o few do perform the obligation to that name annexed. For if hell were raked, and all faultes rared, for which the inhabitantes of that miÅ¿erable dongeon are damned to thoÅ¿e eternall tormentes, I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubt, but that of thowÅ¿andes or millions, Å¿carÅ¿e few would be found. at leaÅ¿t-wiÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿tians, that receyued not their woful Å¿entence, for Å¿ome abuÅ¿e or wickednes practiÅ¿ed towardes their euen brethren and neighbours.</p>
            <p>And this may be preface Å¿ufficient for the breef diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie and reproofe that here I am to make, of a no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious iniquitie, practiÅ¿ed of late in our countrie, (where now we are wolues eating one an other by malice of hereÅ¿ie, though England haue no wolues by nature of Å¿oyle) againÅ¿t certain innocent and eminent men in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique profeÅ¿Å¿ion, named IeÅ¿uites, to whoÅ¿e impugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and general aÅ¿Å¿ault by all kynde of meanes, and by all Å¿ortes of euil affected people, is Å¿eemeth that the diuel and his angels, and all his inÅ¿truments at once, haue made a compact to conÅ¿pire together, by drawing all that is odious in the world vpon them: but eÅ¿pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the practiÅ¿es of princes deathes and murders, wherof in my conÅ¿cience and knowlege (that haue knowen them, and dealt alÅ¿o with them very intrinÅ¿ecally for a good part of theÅ¿e thirtie yeares, and haue noted their deÅ¿ignementes, actions, and deÅ¿yres not vndiligently) no one Å¿ort of people liuing are more free and further of from Å¿uch cogitations then they, who deteÅ¿t Å¿uch bloody meanes in all their Å¿peeches, doctryne, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinges, leauing them to the aduerÅ¿ary Å¿pirit of ProteÅ¿tantes, Puritanes, and Å¿uch other lyke teachers, who both preach, and practiÅ¿e Å¿uch attempes, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the actes and monumentes of Luther in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Zuinglius in Swizer-land, Beza in France,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14799:3"/>
Knokes in Scotland, and others els where, who haue rayÅ¿ed the turmoiles and tragedies that all men know, and haue brought many a iuÅ¿t and peaceable prince to deÅ¿truction, deÅ¿olation, and affliction; which no man can truely auouch of the IeÅ¿uites, notwithÅ¿tanding their zeale and feruour in Godes cauÅ¿e be not vnknowen, which is the fountayne of all this hatred, complaynt, &amp; conÅ¿piracie againÅ¿t them.</p>
            <p>Cicero Å¿ayd in his Å¿econd Philippica againÅ¿t Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that by his particular deÅ¿teny it came to paÅ¿Å¿e, that no man for many yeares had becomen an enemie to the Roman comonwealth, but that preÅ¿ently he had byd warre to him alÅ¿o, as a cheef defendour therof. But this may be much more truely Å¿ayd of the IeÅ¿uites, in reÅ¿pect of ChriÅ¿tes comonwealth in our dayes, againÅ¿t whoÅ¿e churche &amp; kingdome there is none lightly that ryÅ¿eth or Å¿tirreth, ether by hereÅ¿ie, atheiÅ¿me, wicked lyfe, or factious humours, but that ioyntly he beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth an enemy to IeÅ¿uites, and it is a comon note, and their crowne, and Godes Å¿pecial prouidence towardes them for their good.</p>
            <p>But let vs Å¿ee in the particular point of killing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what deÅ¿yre there is of bringing them in queÅ¿tion, aboue other men. There was a king of France not many yeares gone, moÅ¿t Å¿trangely Å¿layne by a religious man, but no IeÅ¿uit. Was his order infamed, perÅ¿ecuted, or afflicted for the Å¿ame? no, nor ought it to be, he being but a particular man, whoÅ¿e fault in no right could be layde vpon a multitude. Some yeares after, the king that now is, was aÅ¿Å¿aulted by a yong man, that had Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in the IeÅ¿uites Å¿chooles only, but now did not, nor was he euer of them, nor appertayned any way to them; yet were all IeÅ¿uites driuen out of France, and purÅ¿ued for this fact as murderers of princes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding by publique Å¿ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of the PariÅ¿ian magiÅ¿trate, they were cleered of all participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, councel, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
<pb facs="tcp:14799:4"/>
of the yong mans fault. What is the cauÅ¿e of this difference? that which Cicero before mentioned, his zeale and fidelitie to his common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Of late there were publiÅ¿hed diuers pamphletes, of an intent that one Peter Panne a flemiÅ¿h cooper Å¿hould haue, to kill the Counte MoriÅ¿Å¿e, gouernour of thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled Å¿tates of Holland and Zeland for which alÅ¿o the Å¿ayd Peter Panne was beheaded; and to the end there Å¿hould not want the ordinary Å¿olemnitie of hauing a IeÅ¿uit in one end of the tale, it was faygned and Å¿et downe in print, how that one father Oliuerius Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus prouincial of the IeÅ¿uites in flanders (a very graue old man) with the prefect of the Å¿tudies, and Rector of Doway, Å¿hould be the deuiÅ¿ers and Å¿ticklers in this acte at Doway, vpon Å¿uch a day and tyme, with Å¿uch &amp; Å¿uch circumÅ¿tances, which might make the matter probable to Å¿imple people, that cannot imagin the malice of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques. All which circumÅ¿tances, with the principal Å¿ubiect it Å¿elf, were proued afterwardes to be moÅ¿t falÅ¿e, by publique examination, and teÅ¿timonies of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿trates, in diuers citties of flanders. And among other poyntes it was proued, that the forefayd father Oliuerius, was more then 60. or 70. myles of from Doway (to wit at BruÅ¿Å¿els) at the very tyme that he was Å¿ayd to deale with Peter Panne in Doway) &amp; that Peter Panne had neuer to deale with him in his lyfe, nor had any doing with the IeÅ¿uites, and that he was an heretiqoe, and had neuer receyued penny of money of IeÅ¿uites, nor by their meanes, as was forged in his pretended confeÅ¿Å¿ions. And many other moÅ¿t euident falÅ¿hoodes are declared in diuers bookes written about this matter, and approued by the aÅ¿Å¿euerations of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique magiÅ¿trates, in diuers townes and prouinces, Å¿ince that tyme. So as the impudence of this heretical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiÅ¿e is made notorious to all the world.</p>
            <p>And yet now leaÅ¿t England Å¿hould be behinde France

and Holland, and other places, in deuyÅ¿ing Å¿ome nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practiÅ¿e of IeÅ¿uites, wherby not only to auert me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nes hartes from them, but euen to rayÅ¿e the hayre of mens heades againÅ¿t them; there hath byn brought in of late the tragical comedie of one Edward Squyer Å¿oldiar, Å¿ent from Spayne (as is pretended) by one William Walpole a IeÅ¿uit, to poyÅ¿on the Queen and Earle of EÅ¿Å¿ex, with poyÅ¿on in a dooble blader, deliuered him by the Å¿ayd William, and diuers imbraÅ¿inges at his departure, as alÅ¿o Å¿ondry exhortations Å¿ayd to be made out of holy Å¿criptures to the Å¿ayd poyÅ¿oner by William Walpole, for proÅ¿ecuting of his purpoÅ¿e. All which circumÅ¿tances we Å¿hall examin afterwardes, to diÅ¿couer therby the faÅ¿hood of this fiction. For albeit I meane not in this place to take vpon me to auerre, that all the whole narration touching Squyer is faygned, or that Squyer was innocent in all poyntes that he was accuÅ¿ed of, or hanged for (notwithÅ¿tanding his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyals at his death) yet dout I not, but to Å¿hew moÅ¿t euidently, that all and euery thing that concerneth the IeÅ¿uites, and William Walpole by name, condemned in this action, by a wrong name (for his true name is Richard) is a meer fable &amp; malitious deuiÅ¿e of Squyer, or thoÅ¿e that Å¿et him a worke, to make Spayne odious, and to Å¿lander the IeÅ¿uites.</p>
            <p>Well it may be that Squyer, after his returne from Spayne (whence he eÅ¿caped by flight and not by miÅ¿Å¿ion as Å¿halbe proued) hauing gone abrode with my L. of EÅ¿Å¿ex to Å¿ea, and that in his owne Å¿hippe, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to diÅ¿couer great matters of Spayne, not fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Å¿uch comeditie or preferment afterwardes as he looked for; might begin to caÅ¿t out Å¿ome wordes of diÅ¿contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, and Å¿ay for his better credit (not fore Å¿eeing the danger that might inÅ¿ew therof) that in Spayne he might haue byn imployed by principal men, in great matters; and in this Å¿peech it may be alÅ¿o, that

father Walpole being a IeÅ¿uit, and the man that was beÅ¿t knowen vnto him, and had done moÅ¿t for him; for relief of his miÅ¿eries, after father PerÅ¿ons departure from Seuil; he might I Å¿ay, perhaps make mention of his name though he knew it not aright, as hath byn Å¿ayd: and that therin being taken at the aduantage, and preÅ¿Å¿ed to go forward partly by fayre promiÅ¿Å¿es, &amp; partly by torture (as at the barre he affirmed that he had byn fyue houres vpon the torture) he might happen Å¿tanding thus between feares of condemnation if he drew back, and hopes of pardon if he accuÅ¿ed others, to begin to frame the tale that in his confeÅ¿Å¿ion is Å¿et downe. And when he would haue denyed it agayne (as he did at his arraynment) it would not be taken or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. It may be alÅ¿o that Munday, and Stanley, or other Å¿ome Å¿uch compaignions (for I know or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them not) coming after him out of Spayne into England, and deÅ¿irous to get creditt, might (as the faÅ¿hion of Å¿uch folke is) being poore and beggarly, begin vpon emulation to appeach, and call Squyer in queÅ¿tion, as was obiected in the arraynement that they did, and as it fell out diuers yeares paÅ¿t, between Doctor Parry and MayÅ¿ter Neuil, that called himÅ¿elf Lord Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The Å¿torie of which two frendes and compaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for that it Å¿eemeth not much vnlyke to this, both in the matter it Å¿elf, and in Å¿ome particular circumÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I Å¿hall heare repeate with great breuitie.</p>
            <p>William Parry, after he had Å¿erued the Å¿tate of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Å¿ome Å¿ix or Å¿eauen yeares by Å¿pierie in Italie, and other places (as himÅ¿elf confeÅ¿Å¿ed) he waxed weary, and to repayre his credit againe on the catholique Å¿yde, he went to confeÅ¿Å¿ion in Lions to a ScottiÅ¿h IeÅ¿uit, named father Critton; and then hearing that the Lord Paget was comen out of England to Paris for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, and that Doctor Allen (afterward Cardinal) and father PerÅ¿ons were come alÅ¿o to Paris to Å¿ee him, he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14799:5"/>
came thither in the yeare 84. and vÅ¿ed all meanes poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible, both by himÅ¿elf and his frendes in that place, to enter into credit with the Å¿ayd Doctor and father; and when he Å¿aw that in no caÅ¿e they would deale with him in matter of Å¿ecreÅ¿ie or moment (though otherwiÅ¿e they vÅ¿ed hun courteouÅ¿ly, and were glad of his conuerÅ¿ion to be a catholique) he was greatly offended therat, and one euening being led by a certayne frend and countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his, to the biÅ¿hop of Rimini, Nuntius at that tyme for Pope Gregorie the thirteenth in France, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him a letter written by himÅ¿elf in Italian to the Pope; wherin he Å¿hewed firÅ¿t and confeÅ¿Å¿ed, that he had done great hurtes to the catholique cauÅ¿e and churche, by his former Å¿eruices of the Å¿tate of England, and that now he was to go thither to make recompence for the Å¿ame, and to do great Å¿eruices in fauour of the Å¿ea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tolique, deÅ¿iring his Holines approbation and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, without Å¿pecifying any particularitie what he meant to do, as by the Å¿aid letter of his, yet heer in Rome to be Å¿een, is manifeÅ¿t. And to this letter did Cardinal Como anÅ¿were, and his anÅ¿were was deliuered by Parry himÅ¿elf to the Queen, and the Å¿ame produced againÅ¿t him afterward at his araygnment: but to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The Doctor hauing donn this act with the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, he got himÅ¿elf away Å¿ecretly from Paris towards England without taking his leaue, either of Doctor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, or father PerÅ¿ons, and paÅ¿Å¿ing by Roan towards Diep in Normandy, he tolde on maiÅ¿ter Wattes a PrieÅ¿t there, that his diÅ¿Å¿ignement was in England, to raiÅ¿e a faction againÅ¿t the IeÅ¿uites, from which maiÅ¿ter Wattes diÅ¿Å¿uaded him, but he paÅ¿Å¿ed on, and as Å¿oon as he came to Diep, before he would imbarque, he wrote a letter to the Lord Burleigh for a paÅ¿Å¿eporte and order, to Å¿peak with the Queen at his firÅ¿t ariual in England, for that he had great matters to vtter: and Å¿o the order came, and he by Å¿ecret wayes was brought to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tie,
<pb facs="tcp:14799:6"/>
and had long talke with her, and told her among other pointes, that he was Å¿ent by IeÅ¿uites and their frendes to kil her. And to confirme this the more, he Å¿hewed her alÅ¿o the anÅ¿were of Cardinal Como when it came, as I haue Å¿ayd: and well knowing that it was no treaÅ¿on when himÅ¿elf vttered the Å¿ame, he inlarged himÅ¿elf in many particulers, about the manner and order how it Å¿hould be donne, as her maieÅ¿tie can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, hoping therby to get great credit, which yet afterward turned to his deÅ¿truction.</p>
            <p>There was Å¿ent ouer vnto Roan at the Å¿ame time, or very Å¿oon after, the forÅ¿ayd maiÅ¿ter Neuil to exerciÅ¿e the Å¿ame office of Å¿piarie, which maiÅ¿ter Parry had donne before in Italy, and waxing alÅ¿o wearie of his occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that rewardes came out of England but Å¿lowly, he made great meanes in like manner to Å¿peak with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther PerÅ¿ons, who by chaunce lay for a time in that towne, but Å¿ecretly, and in the end obteining the Å¿ame, and propoÅ¿ing his miÅ¿erie and affliction of minde, he receiued the Å¿ame anÅ¿were and counÅ¿el that Doctor Parry had donn before: to wit, that the beÅ¿t way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, was to leaue that trade of life, &amp; to returne to a vertuous &amp; peaceable Catholique courÅ¿e, &amp; to haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience if for a time he were not truÅ¿ted by Catholiques, being knowen to haue bin imployd againÅ¿t them, and that as his credit had bin crazed by woorkes, Å¿o muÅ¿t his reputation be reÅ¿tored by deeds alÅ¿o, and by time. Wherto maiÅ¿ter Neuil anÅ¿wered, that he could not liue without credit, and rather then he would liue Å¿o: or Å¿ee men crow ouer him, he would aduenture far, and Å¿o they parted: and maiÅ¿ter Neuil returned into England, and there meeting with Doctor Parry, who was now growen diÅ¿contented again for miÅ¿Å¿ing of diuers Å¿uites (but eÅ¿pecially the hedÅ¿hip of Saint Catherins, which he pretended as I haue bin informed) they two fel into new diÅ¿courÅ¿es about that, which in my opinion neither
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14799:6"/>
of them euer ment indeed, I meane the murdering of her MaieÅ¿tie, but the one preuenting the other in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation, it was the Doctors euil luck to be hanged, who yet tooke himÅ¿elf for the more conning man. And the lyke hath happened to this our Squyer, that Å¿tood not a litle vpon his owne wit in Spayne, and hoped perhaps to inioy the labours therof in England; but dealing doubly, and diÅ¿Å¿embling with God and man (as Parry did) was taken as it Å¿eemeth in the Å¿ame net of his owne deuyÅ¿es, as by the Å¿equel of this narration Å¿hal more appeare.</p>
            <p>And I haue taken vpon me the rather to wryte this breef diÅ¿couerie of his falÅ¿e and treacherous dealing againÅ¿t IeÅ¿uites, for that I knew him, and conuerÅ¿ed with him in Spayne, and with his fellow maiÅ¿ter Rolles alÅ¿o, both before and after their apprehenÅ¿ion by the InquiÅ¿ition, and knew the Å¿petial obligation they had to theÅ¿e kynde of men, whome Squyer now hath Å¿lande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Å¿o lewdly, as many others do, that receyue help &amp; benefytes by them. And I haue heard afterward being in Rome, by Å¿undry letters from Spayne, of the manner of their departure from thence by Å¿tealth, which was Å¿uch, as doth euidently ouerthrow all this whole fiction of poyÅ¿on geuen by father Walpole. And albeit I dout not, but that when the Å¿torie of this tragical fable Å¿hal come to Seuil, they will Å¿end many authentical proofes from thence, of the malitious falÅ¿hood of Å¿o fond an inuention, yet could I not omit in this meane whyle to preuent their further diligence, with Å¿o much as I my Å¿elf knew, and am able to Å¿ay therof, as alÅ¿o two other reuerend preeÅ¿tes beÅ¿ydes that came with me to Rome from Spayne, and knew both the Å¿ayd men and matter, to wit, father William Med. and father Iohn Wor. who were with me in Seuil and haue dealt with the parties. We all three together can and do teÅ¿tifie and proteÅ¿t vpon our conÅ¿ciences, that in our iudgementes it is a
<pb facs="tcp:14799:7"/>
meer fiction, for Å¿o much as concerneth F. Walpole, and his Å¿etting Squyer a worke, to kill the Queen &amp; Earle of EÅ¿Å¿ex, or geuing him poyÅ¿on for that end, and other lyke pointes mentioned in Squyers moÅ¿t ridiculous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raynement. And this teÅ¿tification of ours, wilbe Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (I doubt not) to Å¿atisfie the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tes of all Å¿ober catholique men, as we beÅ¿eech them that it may; and as for others alÅ¿o, if they be vnpaÅ¿Å¿ionate, and will admit reaÅ¿on or truthe for their Å¿atisfaction, I referre them to the argumentes and demonÅ¿trations Å¿ett downe in this diÅ¿couerie. Wherin firÅ¿t of all I will lay forth the true hiÅ¿torie of Squyer and Rolles his compaignion, their being in Spayne, and then of their departure or flight from thence, and laÅ¿tly by the Å¿ame declare moÅ¿t euidently, the Å¿ottiÅ¿h forgerie of this faygned calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 96. when Sir Francis Drake and Sir Iohn Hawkins made their vnfortunate voyage to the weÅ¿t Indies, there was Å¿ent from Seuil a noble yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, named Don Petro Tellio (that had byn priÅ¿oner before with our Lord Admiral of England, &amp; Å¿peaketh great good of him euerie where, for his honorable treatie) and he was Å¿ent with Å¿ix or Å¿eauen light litle gallions (called Sabras in Å¿paniÅ¿h) to wafte home cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne millions of gold, that were remayning in Porto ricco, in the great gallion of Don SanÃ§ho Pardo, retyred thither vpon tempeÅ¿t out of the Indian fleet, a litle before.</p>
            <p>This Don Petro drawing neer to Porto-ricco fell vpon a litle Å¿hippe or pinnace of Sir Francis company, wherin among others were taken the foreÅ¿ayd two EngliÅ¿h men, M. Rolles gentleman (as he Å¿ayd) and Edward Squyer a Å¿oldiar, who being brought priÅ¿oners to Seuil, found there by their good happe F. PerÅ¿ons, who preÅ¿ently (according to his cuÅ¿tome for all EngliÅ¿h in that caÅ¿e) began to deale with Don Petro for their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14799:7"/>
libertie, and obtayned the Å¿ame, after Å¿ome dayes without ranÅ¿ome, or any other lett or moleÅ¿tation in the world. And hauing done this, he procured alÅ¿o Å¿ome temporal helpe for them, and for their apparay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to returne home into England, and this he did, though he knew them to be ProteÅ¿tantes in religion, vpon diuers conferences had with them, both before and after their deliuerie by don Petro. In one of which conferences, I do well remember, and cannot forget, how Squyer was Å¿o hote and earneÅ¿t in defending of his religion, within the EngliÅ¿h College of Seuil, and that in the hearing of diuers EngliÅ¿h Å¿chollers, as he Å¿ayd and Å¿tood to it, that he knew for certayne, that he had the holie ghoÅ¿t within him, for the true vnderÅ¿tanding of Å¿criptures, wherat the Å¿ayd Å¿chollers laughed hartely, and Å¿o did F. PerÅ¿ons alÅ¿o.</p>
            <p>Wherefore both Rolles and he being redy now for their departure towardes England, they tooke their iourney together downe by water to the porte of Å¿aint Lucars (Å¿ome fourtie myles from Seuil) in the company of one Captayne North. And Å¿taying there Å¿ome dayes, whether it were by indiÅ¿creet behaueour of their owne, or that Å¿ome of their company accuÅ¿ed them (as they Å¿uÅ¿pected) they were taken in that place by the inquiÅ¿ition, and brought back priÅ¿oners to Seuil, where F. PerÅ¿ons yet remayning, he procured for them all kynde of curteous dealing at the InquiÅ¿itors ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>des, and at his departure from thence (which was in May after) he left the matter much recommended to the foreÅ¿ayd F. Richard Walpole IeÅ¿uit, and prefect of the Å¿tudies in the EngliÅ¿h College, as alÅ¿o vnto me, and others of our nation there remayning, that we Å¿hould help and fauour what poÅ¿Å¿ibly we could theÅ¿e two poore men, for that all their compaignions or the moÅ¿t were now gone, being let Å¿lippe away by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Å¿ayd father. And Å¿o about AuguÅ¿t or
<pb facs="tcp:14799:8"/>
September next inÅ¿ewing, M. Rolles was firÅ¿t let out of the priÅ¿on of InquiÅ¿ition, and placed in the IeÅ¿uites col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege named of S. Herminigildo, prince in olde tyme and Martyr of Spayne, and there he was moÅ¿t courteouÅ¿ly vÅ¿ed by the Å¿ayd fathers, and I and others viÅ¿ited him there, and made a common purÅ¿e to helpe to appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayle him, and at my departure towardes Rome (which was in October after) I do well remember in particular, and he cannot forget, that of my Å¿male abilitie I lefte him Å¿ome fyue and twentie Å¿hillinges to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ities, and others did perhaps more, as they were able. And of this he being at this preÅ¿ent in England may be examined, and I doubt not but he will tell the truth, and whether any euil word or meaning, was euer vttered vnto him by any there againÅ¿t her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieÅ¿tie.</p>
            <p>As for Squyer, though he were detayned in the InquiÅ¿ition Å¿ome moneth after Rolles was let forth, (for that he was taken to be more obÅ¿tinate in his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors) yet at length he was let forth alÅ¿o, and placed for his further inÅ¿truction in Catholique fayth as priÅ¿oner Å¿till, in a certayne monaÅ¿terie neer to the EngliÅ¿h col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ege, which I take to be of the Carmelites, if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well, vnto which place as alÅ¿o to Rolles, the foreÅ¿ayd F. Walpole was permitted to haue acceÅ¿Å¿e, both for their inÅ¿truction, and further help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and Å¿o he did. And this indured vntill the moneth of May next inÅ¿ewing, in the yeare 97. at what tyme they both conÅ¿piring together fled away, and left both F. Walpole, and other EngliÅ¿h that had geuen their wordes for them in the bryars. Wherof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues being aÅ¿hamed, and hauing Å¿ome Å¿cruple when they were in Å¿aftie, they excuÅ¿ed themÅ¿elues by a como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> letter written with Squyers hand, but Å¿ubÅ¿crybed by them both, and Å¿ent to Seuil, wherin, they aÅ¿ked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don very effectually of the Å¿ayd father, and of all their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14799:8"/>
countrimen, for their flight, and for the hurt or diÅ¿cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit which therby might happen to their Å¿ayd frendes in Seuil, proteÅ¿ting that it was only for the loue they did beare to their wyues and children, and the deÅ¿yre they had to Å¿ee and Å¿uccour them in England, and not falÅ¿hood or ingratitude, or other diÅ¿honeÅ¿t meaning.</p>
            <p>This letter F. Walpole Å¿hewed firÅ¿t in Seuil for his better excuÅ¿e, and then Å¿ent the Å¿ame to F. PerÅ¿ons in Rome, where it was read one day in publique recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the college, among Å¿ome fourtie or fiftie EngliÅ¿h together, who all iudged it a trayterous pranke, but yet had compaÅ¿Å¿ion of them, and laughed at certayne phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of Squyers Puritanical vayne in Wryting, among which, was this: that they luÅ¿ted not after their wyues in the fleÅ¿h, but rather thirÅ¿ted after them in the Lord. And of theÅ¿e fourtie or fiftie EngliÅ¿h, that then were preÅ¿ent at the reading of this letter; Å¿ome nyne perhaps or ten are now in England. By all which, Catholique men may be certified of the truth, and ProteÅ¿tantes alÅ¿o, both by Rolles himÅ¿elf that is priÅ¿oner, as alÅ¿o by Å¿ome of the other that be in lyke manner vnder their cuÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. So as of this poynt of theÅ¿e mennes running away from Seuil, without F. Walpole his knowlege or conÅ¿ent, and without Å¿eeing him at their departure, there can no dout be made at all; for that it may and wilbe proued by euident demonÅ¿trations, and irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable witneÅ¿Å¿es, both from Spayne, Hence, and in England.</p>
            <p>Which being Å¿o, let euery man conÅ¿ider the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious falÅ¿hood of this tragical forgerie. For if Edward Squyer ranne away from Seuil out of the monaÅ¿terie where he was priÅ¿oner, &amp; that he departed in company of Rolles his fellow, who hauing more libertie, then the other, is thought to haue plotted and procured principally that flight; and if they Å¿aw not F. Walpole, nor Å¿poke with him at their departure, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
<pb facs="tcp:14799:9"/>
him, and put him in diÅ¿grace by this their run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, as much as lay in them, and that they haue confeÅ¿Å¿ed and teÅ¿tified the Å¿ame, and aÅ¿ked him pardon for it vnder their owne handes, how then can it be true, that F. Walpole preached vnto Squyer at his departure, exhorting him to this fact of poyÅ¿oning the Queen and the Earle of EÅ¿Å¿ex, as was auowed at his arraygnement? How did he lay his lefte hand vpon his Å¿houlder, Å¿aying <hi>Dominus</hi> only, and then making the Å¿igne of the croÅ¿Å¿e vpon his for head with his right hand, Å¿ayd: God bleÅ¿Å¿e the my Å¿onne, and geue the courage and Å¿trength, and I Å¿hal pray for thee both alyue and dead, and other lyke wordes, and circumÅ¿tances, publiÅ¿hed in Squyers forged and forced confeÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, how can it Å¿tand with any probabilitie, that Squyer Å¿hould vow to F. Walpole to do this act of poyÅ¿oning, and receyue the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿acrament there vpon? How did he receyue the poyÅ¿on redy made and mingled by F. Walpole in a dooble bladder (as the tale is told) and make experience therof vpon a dogge, that died preÅ¿ently? and finally how dyd he carie it with him Å¿o long a iourney, and yet his compagnion Rolles to Å¿ee nor know nothing therof, as he did not, nor is it Å¿o much as feigned or obiected in the indight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>Certayne crymes and accuÅ¿ations there be Å¿ayth Cicero, that are Å¿o improbable of themÅ¿elues, and Å¿o euil fitting to the perÅ¿ons vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> whome they are feigned, that albeit no man Å¿hould refute them, yet do they fall of their owne nature, and neceÅ¿Å¿arie circumÅ¿tances therunto incident. As for example, if a man Å¿hould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿e M. Toplife the halter-maiÅ¿ter of England, and boweller of Catholique PreeÅ¿tes in our dayes, of to much Å¿crupuloÅ¿itie in matters of conÅ¿cience, which might Å¿mel of papiÅ¿trie. Or els our new maried EngliÅ¿h MiniÅ¿ters, of to much faÅ¿ting, wearing hayreclothes,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14799:9"/>
or ouer much puniÅ¿hing their bodies, that are offences tending to the Å¿ame error, no man I Å¿uppoÅ¿e would eaÅ¿elie beleeue them, though they Å¿hould neuer Å¿o Å¿toutly or cuningly be auerred, knowing the perÅ¿ons well, and how far their diÅ¿poÅ¿ition and whole courÅ¿e of lyfe is, from Å¿uch exceÅ¿Å¿es in that kynde. And euen Å¿o, he that knoweth F. Richard Walpole as I do; and firÅ¿t how learned a man he is, being Prefect of the Å¿tudies in the EngliÅ¿h Seuilian college, and then how Å¿piritual and myld a religious man, both by nature and condition, &amp; how far of from all wordlie practiÅ¿es and politique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyÅ¿es as theÅ¿e are, he will clearlie perceyue at the firÅ¿t Å¿ight, the abÅ¿urdities of theÅ¿e imputations layd againÅ¿t him; to wit, that either he Å¿hould be Å¿o fond, as to vÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Å¿criptures to Squyer for killing the Queen &amp; the Earle of EÅ¿Å¿ex, which were alleaged at Squyers arraygn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or Å¿o baÅ¿e, as to go and buy or mingle poyÅ¿on for Å¿uch an effect, and to bring it to him in a dooble blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, call a dogge and make the proofe, with other lyke fooliÅ¿h, incredible, and abÅ¿urd circumÅ¿tances. But aboue all other, that F. Walpole Å¿hould imploy diuers men at once about this foule acte, and lyke a right Macheuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian or impious atheiÅ¿t, Å¿end in Stanley and Munday after Squyer, to diÅ¿couer him to the Councel, for that himÅ¿elf had perÅ¿waded him to this attempt, which were Å¿carÅ¿e credible to Å¿ome, of Toplife himÅ¿elf, or any other as bloody and conÅ¿cienceles as he, and if Stanley and Munday were of Squyer and Rolles their firÅ¿t company, taken with them by Å¿ea, they neuer Å¿poke then with F. Walpole, but were gone from Seuil before Squyer &amp; Rolles came in trouble, or knew alÅ¿o the Å¿ayd father.</p>
            <p>But for the Å¿criptures mentioned, <hi>vnum eÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arium,</hi> one thing is neceÅ¿Å¿arie; and, <hi>quid prodeÅ¿t homini, Å¿i vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿um mundum lucretur, animae verÃ² Å¿uae detrimentum patiatur?</hi> What profiteth it a man if he gayne the whole world, and leeÅ¿e his owne Å¿oule? It is very lykly that F. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole
<pb facs="tcp:14799:10"/>
vÅ¿ed Å¿ometymes thoÅ¿e woordes of ChriÅ¿t, among others, to Squyer. For I well remember that they were often in his mouth to Å¿uch as Squyer was, of our nation, who dealing about matters of religion, concerning his Å¿oule and eternal Å¿aluation, would often alleage humane and worldly reÅ¿pectes for impedimentes, as his wyfe and children in England, how he Å¿hould lyue if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a catholique, that all his frendes at home would forÅ¿ake him, that he durÅ¿t not Å¿hew his face any more among them, that his enemies would laugh at him, triumph ouer him, lay him in priÅ¿on, and the lyke: for moderating of which wordly reÅ¿pects, in Å¿o great a cauÅ¿e as is religion, it is probable, that F. Walpole vÅ¿ed diuers tymes the former Å¿peeches of Å¿cripture to him. Which Squyer remembring in England, when he was to make his tale, applyed them as Å¿poken to the other effect of poyÅ¿oning, wherwith as euery man Å¿eeth, they haue no coherence at all.</p>
            <p>If F. Walpole had byn diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to haue treated vpon any Å¿uch theme, he was not Å¿o Å¿imple or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, but that he could haue alleaged other places and examples of Å¿cripture, far more fit and effectual to Å¿uch a purpoÅ¿e, Å¿eing that the queÅ¿tion in general is handled largely, by many learned men, to and fro, how it may be lawfull or vnlawful in certayne caÅ¿es, for particular men to offer violence to princes by priuate authoritie. Where yet no man maketh it either Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿arie to Å¿aluation, or Å¿o Å¿afe or meritorious, as Squyers fiction conteyneth. And if vpon thoÅ¿e groundes, or other, F. Walpole would haue byn Å¿o idle or euil diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, as to enter into the cogitation or treatie of any Å¿uch enterpryÅ¿e (from which in my conÅ¿cience I hold him moÅ¿t free) yet would he neuer haue made choiÅ¿e of Squyer, whome he thought Å¿till inwardly to be a ProteÅ¿tant (and Å¿o he dyed) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding Å¿ome tymes he would make Å¿hew in Spayne
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14799:10"/>
of his conuerÅ¿ion. F. Walpole knew him alÅ¿o to be a poor hungrie Å¿oldiar, deÅ¿irous to liue, and to get Å¿omething in the world, which was far from him that Å¿hould enterpryÅ¿e Å¿uch a matter, who muÅ¿t be content to aduenture both lyfe &amp; all that therof dependeth, which no man will do, but either of pure zeale in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or of hope of gayne and preferment. As for zeale, it is knowne Squyer had none to the catholique religion, as hath byn noted, but rather the contrarie. And as for gayne and preferment, F. Walpole had none to geue him: nor did Squyer Å¿ay that he was promiÅ¿Å¿ed any, from any other partie. What then Å¿hould moue him to take Å¿o dangerous and difficult an enterpryÅ¿e vpon him, or the other to truÅ¿t him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Of lyke improbabilitie is it, or rather much more, that the Å¿ame father Å¿hould remit Squyer for his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in theÅ¿e affayres, to Doctor BagÅ¿haw, priÅ¿oner in WiÅ¿bich caÅ¿tle, and to no more, as was read out of Squyers confeÅ¿sion at his arraygnment, which euery man that knoweth the perÅ¿ons, will Å¿ee euidently to be moÅ¿t abÅ¿urdly faigned, for that F. Walpole neuer had any frendÅ¿hip, familiaritie, or acquayntance with Doctor BagÅ¿haw, the Doctor hauing lefte the Roman College before the other came to Å¿tudie there, nor euer had they letter or meÅ¿Å¿age between them in their lyues: nor had the direction of Doctor BagÅ¿haw, that was priÅ¿oner Å¿o far of from London (where this attempt was to be made) byn any way fit for this effect, Å¿eing it was not a matter to be treated by letters, and Å¿ome other cauÅ¿es alÅ¿o are well knowen to diuers men, why the Å¿ayd Doctors concurrence in matters of Å¿uch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with F. Walpole, can no wayes be thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Wherefore this fiction hath no Å¿hew or Å¿hadow of probabilitie at all.</p>
            <p>And truly it Å¿eemeth to wyÅ¿e men in theÅ¿e partes here, that if it had byn thought expedient for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent
<pb facs="tcp:14799:11"/>
tyme in England, that Å¿ome Å¿uch tragedie as this Å¿hould be moued about killing her MaieÅ¿tie, for hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding catholiques in hatred and Å¿uÅ¿pition, and for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter continuing of our breache with Spayne (for it is obÅ¿erued, that Å¿till within certayne diÅ¿tances of tyme, this affayre of killing the Queen hath byn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and more men executed or called in queÅ¿tion therabout, then for all other Princes in ChriÅ¿tendome beÅ¿ydes) and if for the Å¿ame, or other lyke conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, it were iudged alÅ¿o expedient, that Å¿ome Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uite muÅ¿t enter in lyke manner into Å¿ome part of the pageant (for that lightly none goeth without them in theÅ¿e dayes) yet might the matter more fitly haue byn layed vpon Å¿ome other of that order, as F. CreÅ¿wel F. Holt, or F. PerÅ¿ons, who for their yeares and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience Å¿hould haue had more authoritie to perÅ¿wade Å¿uch an action, then vpon F. Walpole, who being their punee, and attending only to matters of Å¿tudy, is very vnprobably brought into this treatie. But as for F. PerÅ¿ons, it is well knowen, that he hath had many occaÅ¿ions to imploy much more fitter and reÅ¿olute men in Å¿uch affaires then Squyer, if he had lyÅ¿ted, or byn of that iudgement or humor. For he hath cauÅ¿ed many EngliÅ¿h to be deliuered out of diuers portes and priÅ¿ons in Spayne, and to returne home free. And at one tyme almoÅ¿t a hundreth, out of the porte and gallies of S. Marie in Andaluzia, and this laÅ¿t yeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue thirtie out of the porte and gallies of Naples, which were taken in the Å¿hip of Paulo Gundelo the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guÅ¿ean, and I Å¿aw them my Å¿elf in chaynes at the oare, and were only deliuered by the earneÅ¿t Å¿ute and credit of the Å¿ayd father. And all theÅ¿e being obliged to him, both by the benefyt of their libertie, and the loue of religion (for that all or many are commonly wont to returne well affected to the catholique fayth, by that they haue Å¿een and heard in forayne nations, and in Å¿o
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14799:11"/>
good a Å¿choole as tribulation is wont to be) of theÅ¿e men I Å¿ay, he might haue made choiÅ¿e of far fitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments then Edward Squyer, in Å¿o many yeares, to haue effectuated Å¿uch an enterpryÅ¿e, if he had lyked therof, which yet hitherto hath neuer byn found. And perhaps no perÅ¿ons Å¿o fit as preeÅ¿tes themÅ¿elues, who go directlie into England to dy, if they were Å¿o perÅ¿ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the matter as Squyers tale doth preÅ¿uppoÅ¿e: to wit, that it is a worke of Å¿o high perfection, merit, and godlineÅ¿Å¿e, yea of neceÅ¿sitie to their Å¿aluation, as in his arraygnement is Å¿et downe.</p>
            <p>Other meanes alÅ¿o more effectuall would haue byn thought vpon, for the accompliÅ¿hing of the work, if euer any Å¿uch had byn intended, then is the poyÅ¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Queens Å¿adle pomel, or the chayre of my Lord of EÅ¿Å¿ex, wherin it Å¿eemeth that both his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip hath Å¿itten, and her MaieÅ¿tie ridden, Å¿ince that tyme, and yet neither of them, God be thanked, hath miÅ¿caried. And truly, hauing conferred with the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedeÅ¿t phiÅ¿itions and SimpliciÅ¿tes of this cittie, about the probabilitie of this poyÅ¿on, they do all laugh at the deuyÅ¿e, and Å¿ay that it is a meer fiction, that any Å¿uch poyÅ¿on can be found in this world, or made by art; that being layd in Å¿uch places &amp; in Å¿uch ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ner as this is deÅ¿crybed, can hurt the Å¿itter or ryder, in the Å¿uppoÅ¿ed chaire or Å¿adle. which they proue by theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons that do enÅ¿ew, of their arte. FirÅ¿t, for that all poyÅ¿on muÅ¿t needes worke his effect by one of theÅ¿e foure meanes and wayes, to wit, by being receyued into our bodies, or by one of the Å¿enÅ¿es of Å¿eeing, Å¿melling, or touching.</p>
            <p>As for the firÅ¿t meane (which is the principal and moÅ¿t ordinary) it is here excluded in our caÅ¿e, for that this poyÅ¿on was not ment to be receaued within the body of her MaieÅ¿tie or of the Earle.</p>
            <p>As for the Å¿econd, all phiÅ¿itians do agree, that no poyÅ¿on hath euer byn recorded to hurt by Å¿ight, but
<pb facs="tcp:14799:12"/>
only that of the baÅ¿iliÅ¿ke according to the opinion of Å¿ome olde wryters, wherof yet it is doubted by later authors, whether that infection came by the Å¿ight or no, but all do agree (howÅ¿oeuer this was) that no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane art can reach to imitate this Å¿ecret of nature. And thoÅ¿e that handle of this matter, as Cardan in his Å¿ubtilities, Matheolus vpon DioÅ¿corides, and Å¿ome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do adde diuers conditions, and neceÅ¿Å¿arie cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances beÅ¿ydes the poyÅ¿on it Å¿elf, to worke this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by Å¿ight, as for example, the Å¿pirit and heate of the lyue Å¿erpent, the feare of the partie that be holdeth her, and other lyke, and that no dead or cold poyÅ¿on made by any art can infect this way, all do agree. As neither by the Å¿enÅ¿e of Å¿melling except it Å¿hould be very Å¿trong and much vÅ¿ed, Å¿o as it might infect the very ayer that entereth into vs, and then Å¿ay they, would it be diÅ¿couered alÅ¿o, by the vngratefulnes of the very Å¿ent it Å¿elf.</p>
            <p>There remayneth then the fourth way only, which is by touching, wherin the moÅ¿t learned alÅ¿o do agree, that they haue only the Å¿aying of Gallen, who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the Å¿pitle of a mad dogge, being touched, entereth of it Å¿elf into the fleÅ¿h and infecteth, yet is there no certayne experience either of this, or of any other poyÅ¿on, that killeth in Å¿uch Å¿ort, by only tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but if it be true, yet confeÅ¿Å¿e they all, that this touching muÅ¿t be vpon the bare fleÅ¿h, and that with tyme, and continuance, and calefaction it muÅ¿t enter, and not otherwiÅ¿e, but if there be any thing interiected between the poyÅ¿on and the fleÅ¿h it Å¿elf (as it is probable in our caÅ¿e, where her MaieÅ¿ties gloue or Å¿leeue vpon the pomel of her Å¿adle, and my Lord of EÅ¿Å¿ex his apparayle vpon his chayre, muÅ¿t needes haue place) then do all agree, that by al probabilitie, it could do no hurt at all, though poyÅ¿on had byn put there. For Å¿ay theÅ¿e men, if by poyÅ¿oning only Å¿tooles,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14799:12"/>
chayres, Å¿adles, or apparayle, that toucheth not the fleÅ¿h, or by Å¿ight only, princes may be poyÅ¿oned, who Å¿hould be Å¿afe? And why would men aduenture to attempt any other wayes, that are more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the attempter? yet do they Å¿till except the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the plague, which may be imparted by a cloth or veÅ¿tment infected, which phiÅ¿itians hold to be a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret only of nature, not imitable by any arte of man, as is not alÅ¿o the wonderful Å¿ecret force of the fiÅ¿h named Torpedo in latin, for that being in the fiÅ¿hers nette, before they touch him they feel torporem, to wit, a numnes in their handes, by his being there, which effect no arte poÅ¿sible can euer arryue to worke or imitate.</p>
            <p>Agayne they Å¿ay, that if any Å¿uch poyÅ¿on could be made to worke Å¿uch Å¿trange effectes, Å¿o far of as here is faigned, it had bin impoÅ¿sible for Squyer himÅ¿elf to haue caried it Å¿o many myles, and to haue put it forth from his dooble bladder, into his red botle Å¿topped with corke (as he Å¿ayd he did, when he went to Å¿ea with my lord of EÅ¿Å¿ex) without poyÅ¿oning him Å¿elf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o, and the lyke difficultie would haue byn for him that made and Å¿old the poyÅ¿on. Wherefore theÅ¿e learned men Å¿ay, that all this, of the effect of this poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, vpon the pomel of her MaieÅ¿ties Å¿adle, and the Earles chaire, is a very ridiculous thing. And greatly did they laugh when they heard tell, how the Queens Atturney with weeping teares did congratulate her MaieÅ¿ties Å¿o dangerous eÅ¿cape, applying thoÅ¿e wordes of the pÅ¿alme to her MaieÅ¿tie, that were of ChriÅ¿t and his power: <hi>Super aÅ¿pidem &amp; BaÅ¿iliÅ¿cum ambulabis,</hi> Thou Å¿halt walk vpon the Å¿nake and baÅ¿iliÅ¿k without hurt. And M. Soliciter and others geuing vnto her MaieÅ¿tie the priuilege of Saynt Paule, that Å¿hooke of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vyper from his hand without danger, and that <hi>this vvas a miracle if euer their vvere a miracle.</hi> All
<pb facs="tcp:14799:13"/>
which was attributed here, either to groÅ¿Å¿e ignorance, or deep flatterie, in theÅ¿e orators, Å¿eing that no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all was neer vnto her MaieÅ¿tie in any reaÅ¿on, though any Å¿uch touching of the Å¿adle pomel with Squyers bladder, had bin true. And they do think, that the inchantment which he vÅ¿ed in crying: God Å¿aue the Queen, when he touched the pomel with the Å¿ayd bladder, was a Å¿ufficient preÅ¿eruatiue agaynÅ¿t the force of this kinde of poyÅ¿on: eÅ¿pecially conÅ¿idering the great probabilitie, that this act alÅ¿o of his touching the Å¿adle pomel with his bladders and lethers, was fained in like manner. For Å¿o it Å¿eemeth, that the poore caitife began to make his tale with this at the beginning, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the reaÅ¿ons before put downe, thinking that either it would not haue bin Å¿o daungerous vnto him, but that either he might haue gon back again whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he would, or at leaÅ¿twiÅ¿e haue diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed the matter, confeÅ¿Å¿ing onely Å¿o much agaynÅ¿t Spayn and IeÅ¿uites, as might Å¿erue for the tyme and preÅ¿ent turne, and deny the reÅ¿t, that touched himÅ¿elf, and Å¿o we Å¿ee he did, when he came to his arraygnement, pleading not guiltie, with many Å¿olemne othes and proteÅ¿tations, argumentes, and reaÅ¿ons, to Å¿hew that he attempted nothing after his coming into England, though he were content to let the reÅ¿t Å¿tand, which he had Å¿ayd of F. Walpole and of Spayne. And in this he Å¿tood Å¿tifly all the tyme of his arraygneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, vntill he vnderÅ¿tood firÅ¿t by the cheef Iudge, that he laboured in vayne, for that the very conceyling of the matter treated in Spayne, for Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny monethes, was treaÅ¿on of itÅ¿elf, though it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer byn attempted to be put in execution within En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. And Å¿econdly that he perceyued by diuers Å¿peeches and large diÅ¿courÅ¿es made vnto him by Å¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie CounÅ¿elours, but eÅ¿pecially by Secretarie Cecil, exhorting him to confeÅ¿Å¿e the whole, that except he yealded to all, as it lay in his firÅ¿t tale, there was no hope
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14799:13"/>
of fauour and mercy. And then he falling downe vpon his knees, confeÅ¿Å¿ed all agayne. But yet afterward, when he found alÅ¿o by experience, that this would not Å¿aue his lyfe, nor keep him from execution (wherof it is lykely that he had hope, if not ful promeÅ¿Å¿e) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the matter agayne at his death, as they can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e that were preÅ¿ent at the Å¿ame and heard him, whereof Å¿ome alÅ¿o haue written the Å¿ame hither.</p>
            <p>Wherfore to end this narration, the miÅ¿erable fellow is now hanged, &amp; whether his corporal or ghoÅ¿tly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ery were greater, God knoweth, the men that did moÅ¿t for him, to the releef of the one &amp; the other in Spayne, are moÅ¿t wronged by him. The fictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of his treatie with F.

Whether after his comming in to England, &amp; diÅ¿contentment, he might enter into any malignitie of cogitations, wordes, or factes to this effect, as Doctor Pary was Å¿ayd to do that toucheth not me now to diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿e. The tragical Å¿eÅ¿sion of Å¿o many noble men, Councelours, &amp; Iudges together, made vpon his feigned confeÅ¿sion, their ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, congratulations, admirations, exclamations their bitter inuectiues agaynÅ¿t leÅ¿uites, &amp; the king of Spayne, vpon Å¿o Å¿male and weak groundes, &amp; eÅ¿pecially the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition therof agayne at Paules croÅ¿Å¿e the next Å¿onday after, is ridiculous, &amp; maketh men ween abrode, that eares and lippes are more Å¿ought for, then iudgements, and populer outcries, before Å¿age inquyrie of the truth, and that whyle theÅ¿e matters are in talking to fill mennes heades, Å¿ome other plottes are in delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, tending to other deÅ¿ignementes.

            <head>AN ADDITION, TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>MEANE whyle the precedent confutation was on the printers preÅ¿Å¿e, there came out of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d a printed pamphlet of <hi>Squyres</hi> forged conÅ¿piracie, as a letter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreÅ¿Å¿ed vnto a gentleman at <hi>Padua.</hi> And albeit MaiÅ¿ter M. A. in this his confutation hath well and Å¿ufficiently confuted that fiction, yet is it not vnneceÅ¿Å¿ary to ad a few lynes in conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this pamphlet.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t it is therefore conÅ¿iderable, that whereas this fiction of Squyers, beeing with Å¿uch aÅ¿Å¿eueration plotted &amp; purÅ¿ued, &amp; himÅ¿elf condemned and executed: and the odiouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of the pretended cryme Å¿o much Å¿ounded out, both from the <hi>Bench,</hi> and the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> why yet after all this there Å¿hould need any pamphlet, to giue new credit to the matter? Hereof the reaÅ¿on forÅ¿ooth is no other, but that the forgers in this mint were afrayd leaÅ¿t els their coyne would be the more Å¿uÅ¿pected to be counterfait and Å¿o the leÅ¿Å¿e go for good payment.</p>
            <p>And the rather for that Squyre himÅ¿elf when he came to the concluÅ¿ion of the matter, to wit, when he was to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, did there die a true proteÅ¿tant, &amp; vtterly denied the acting of any Å¿uch thing, and Å¿uch proteÅ¿tations, and at Å¿uch tymes, do comonly make Å¿trong impreÅ¿Å¿ions in the myndes of the people, who generally are giuen to belieue, that at the very laÅ¿t inÅ¿tant of lyf, men are lykelyeÅ¿t to declare the truth of their cauÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>And more-ouer Å¿eeing many of the wyÅ¿er Å¿orte beeing enured to the noting of Å¿uch packings (as this might eaÅ¿ely Å¿eeme vnto them to bee) do vÅ¿e narrowly to watch &amp; obÅ¿erue, how thinges paÅ¿Å¿e at arraignements, and might well Å¿ee that the courÅ¿e &amp; manner of this Å¿eemed rather Å¿ome Å¿uch matche as <hi>Kemp</hi> and his compagnions do handle on the Å¿tage, then the lyuely managing of a matter of truth in deede, which neuer would haue needed Å¿uch a playerlyke coreÅ¿pondence in the actors, for euen as <hi>Kemp</hi> and his fellowes hauing before-hand Å¿tudied to con their partes by roate, and each knowes to keepe his cu, and to frame his Å¿peech and manners according to his fayned function, euen Å¿o was this fore-Å¿tudied tragedy

acted in WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter hall. Where firÅ¿t one playd the prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and told a long and lamentable tale of the horribleneÅ¿Å¿e of the fayned fact. Another burÅ¿t out in teares, and very pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wept at it. An other fell in to admiration of the greatnes of the miracle, making it in effect, as very a miracle, as euer <hi>ChriÅ¿te</hi> wrought any: and <hi>Squyer</hi> himÅ¿elf that was to make good earneÅ¿t of all the ieÅ¿t, was held in a tale whyle Å¿ome good parte of his indightment was red, to the end he Å¿hould heede it the leÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿o the leÅ¿Å¿e reply againÅ¿t it. This then beeing eaÅ¿ely to bee noted, and that Squyer in the end prooued the foole that mard the play, by denying the acte at his death (as aforeÅ¿aid) and Å¿o conÅ¿equently the great miracle <hi>yf euer there vvene a miracle.</hi> No maruel then is it that a Å¿mooth penned pamphlet is now come abrode, to reuyue the decaying credit of this late-made-matter, rather then that it Å¿hould be holpen vp, by the rymings of Å¿ome od pot-poet or idle balletmaker.</p>
            <p>The wryter whereof (yf it bee <hi>M. Smokey-Å¿vvynes. fleÅ¿h,</hi> at the inÅ¿tance of Sir R. C.) preÅ¿umes Å¿o much vpon the faith of the reader, who he hopeth will beleeue him, that he telleth him Å¿o direct and redy a tale, as though himÅ¿elf had bene in euery place, at euery tyme; when, and where, the matter was delt in, or Å¿poken of: or els that he hath had his intelligence by eÅ¿petiall reuelation, for that he Å¿eemes to knowe all, Å¿o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ely, and Å¿o perfectly, yea he knowes now to call the IeÅ¿uyte in Spaine, Richard Walpole, that Å¿o often in the indightment was William Walpole. And moreouer he knowes that the Å¿aid <hi>Richard Walpole is a man of principall credit in Spaine, and as Vicar generall to PerÅ¿ons in his abÅ¿ence,</hi> which is a point in deede that muÅ¿t argue the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nes knowledge to be Å¿upernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, becauÅ¿e he knowes that, that no man els knowes: but yet to knowe it better (as alÅ¿o Å¿ome pointes and circumÅ¿tances in relating actes of Catholique religion) he were better to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Å¿ome one Å¿pie more Å¿ufficient then it Å¿eemes he hath any: <hi>Vnum eÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arium,</hi> by which Å¿entence (by himÅ¿elf repeated) he may correct his ignorances and Å¿o make his pamphlets hereafter to be the leÅ¿Å¿e laughted at, If withall he leaue out Å¿uch bald notes, as that <hi>Squyer</hi> Å¿queezed out the poyÅ¿on out of his dooble bladder in the Å¿ight and preÅ¿ence of diuers, and
<pb facs="tcp:14799:15"/>
therewithal did Å¿ay God Å¿aue the Queene, for this alÅ¿o makes the matter Å¿mell further of then the poiÅ¿on could infect.</p>
            <p>Further it is to be noted (as the indyghtement, &amp; this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter both teÅ¿tifie) the poiÅ¿on was deliuered vnto Squyer in a dooble bladder, that is, in one bladder within another, and this he pricked with holes, and Å¿queezed on the pomel of the Queenes Å¿adle, and the Å¿adle as the pamphleter Å¿ayth, being on the back of the horÅ¿e, and the horÅ¿e Å¿tanding in the Å¿table yard (for that the Queen was redy to ride abroad) it would be knowen how <hi>Squyer</hi> did, to auoyd his owne harme by the poiÅ¿on, that now by the Å¿queezing of the bladder, and Å¿training it through, muÅ¿t needs be left Å¿ticking on the outÅ¿ide: and this marueil is the greater, for that Squyer muÅ¿t of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity, haue donne it with a tryce, and therfore could haue no leaÅ¿ure (for fear of being noted by the lookers on) to put it into a new bladder or veÅ¿Å¿ell (for that he was to reÅ¿erue the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this poyÅ¿on for the Earle of EÅ¿Å¿ex chaire) and therefore thruÅ¿ting the bladder all wet on the outÅ¿ide into his pocket on the Å¿udden, and yet to get no parte of the poyÅ¿on, vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf or his clothes, is a great merueil, and to get parte vpon him and to haue no harme, may be deemed a miracle, but to auoyd this queÅ¿tion, if the pamphleter had remembred Å¿o much, he Å¿hould either haue Å¿ayd that Squyer had had Å¿kill in iugling, and could deceaue their Å¿ightes that looked on, or els that the Å¿adle was in a corner in the Å¿table where he was alone by him Å¿elf, and not on the horÅ¿es back in the open yeard, and the Å¿ight of many, for now a miracle may bee preÅ¿uppoÅ¿ed to be wrought vpon the horÅ¿e alÅ¿o, yf any of the poyÅ¿on Å¿queezed out on the Å¿adle pomell did light vpon him, as very lykely it muÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e the pomell is round and Å¿uch a Å¿ubÅ¿tance as may be Å¿trayned through holes pricked with a pin in a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will eaÅ¿ely run downe a Å¿adle pomell. And by this reaÅ¿on muÅ¿t enÅ¿ew, miracle vpon miracle (fowre at the leaÅ¿t) yf all be well remembred. And it is alÅ¿o a maruell (though no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle) that neither the Queenes Å¿adle, nor the Earles chaire, were preÅ¿ented at the bar, becauÅ¿e in all lykelyhood the Å¿tayn or Å¿igne of Å¿o forcible a poiÅ¿on Å¿hould be found to remaine vpon the one or the other, at leaÅ¿t to grace the matter Å¿ome <hi>aqua fortis</hi> or <hi>alcumiÅ¿ticall diÅ¿tillation</hi> might haue bene wyped

on both, or one, in Å¿teede of a pretended poiÅ¿on, and Å¿o might the Å¿adle and chaire haue bene reÅ¿erued for remembrance of Å¿o many great miracles, and well woorthy: yf this had bene remembred, as in good earneÅ¿t it would haue bene, yf it had bene a true donne thing in deede, or that the proÅ¿ecuters of this matter had belieued it themÅ¿elues, or had better fayned, to haue belieued it.</p>
            <p>But to leaue theÅ¿e ouerÅ¿ightes to Å¿uch as muÅ¿t take better heede to them heerafter, I will heer draw to an end, and tell the pamphleter, that he doth Å¿erue his Paduan frend but by peecemeal: for Å¿eeming to go roundly to woork with him, &amp; to tel him a full tale without Å¿top, and yet to leaue out the later and chief parte of all, which was played by the principall actor Squyer himÅ¿elf, to wit, in not telling how he ended the matter at Tiburne, and how he there made two denials, the one of Catholique religion, declaring himÅ¿elf a perfect prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant, and the other of his practiÅ¿ment of poyÅ¿on, all which I Å¿ay to be left behinde Å¿ticking in his pen, muÅ¿t needes be but a Å¿ly trik of his, and howÅ¿oeuer his frend do accept ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or of his excuÅ¿e therof, likely it is that he wil be Å¿o wiÅ¿e, as not once to tel-the contentes of his Å¿aid letter Å¿o any of the Italians, leaÅ¿t he be well laughed at for his labour, for they are to wiÅ¿e for him to delude with flimflammes, and to wel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ridiculous rumors of EngliÅ¿h Queen-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges. Some poore fooles in England that know nothing, may do them the pleaÅ¿ure to beleeue it for them.</p>
            <p>They can tel him, and tel him truly, of the cruel and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tomarie killing that is vÅ¿ed in England, which now a dayes (for the bloodineÅ¿Å¿e thereof) is become the moÅ¿t Å¿ad Å¿pectacle of the vniverÅ¿al world.</p>
            <p>They can tel him, how when by the open force of malyce they liÅ¿t not to take away mennes liues, that then they can do it by Å¿leight, deceit, and cooÅ¿inage, and yet Å¿til with exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior face and Å¿hew of IuÅ¿tice, and for proof of this, we need not Å¿eek ouer our hiÅ¿tories of former ages.</p>
            <p>They can tell of the great numbers of innocent prieÅ¿tes, and Catholique men, that for old faith and religion, vnder pretence of new treaÅ¿on, are made Å¿ubiect to Å¿o many and Å¿o great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and laÅ¿tly to moÅ¿t cruell death: and this both by Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians

            <p>And who knoweth not, and Å¿eeth not, that it is a comon cuÅ¿tome, before any new Å¿torme is raiÅ¿ed vp of perÅ¿ecuting Catholiques, more violently then ordinary, that then Å¿ome pretence is made of the diÅ¿couery of Å¿ome great treaÅ¿on, againÅ¿t the Queenes perÅ¿on.</p>
            <p>Valentyn TomÅ¿on his matter of Queene-killing had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented Squyres, yf he had come aÅ¿well from Spaine as he did from Scotland, and that he could haue Å¿aid that he had Å¿eene and Å¿poken with a IeÅ¿uite, though he knewe him not Å¿o familiarly, as to know his name.</p>
            <p>This world is now growne ouer well acquainted with theÅ¿e tales of Queen-killings, as alÅ¿o that thoÅ¿e brutes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions to the killing of Å¿uch innocent Å¿eruants of God as lighte into the hands and power of the blood-thirÅ¿ty and are by them alloted to the Å¿laughter, whoÅ¿e glorie both in heauen and earth wilbe the greater, in that their paynes are inflicted with dooble wrong.
