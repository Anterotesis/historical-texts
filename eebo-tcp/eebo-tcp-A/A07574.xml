            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Such magnitudes, sayth Apollonius, are the shadowes vpon the ground, which ouerspread the fields farre and wide, but do not enter into, or pierce the earth: Neither haue they any thicknes at all. The Greek woord <hi>Epiphania,</hi> is here more significant. For this worde intimateth no more but, The outward appearance of any thing. For of a magnitude nothing is to be seene but the surface. Such are bourds esteemed to be by the Carpentars: Wainscotte, by the Ioyners: Glasse, by the Glasiers: Cloth, both linnen &amp; Woollen, by the Drapers: Land, Medowe, &amp; Wood, by the Surueighers: For in the measuring of these, there is only Breadth &amp; Length considered, with out any respect at all had to the Thicknesse. Therfore</p>
               <p>2 Here the measure is a Surface. Surfaces, according to their diuerse natures, are measured with diuerse and sundry kindes of measures: Wood, Land, &amp; Medowe, are measured by the Rod or Perch: Cloth, Painting, Pauing, &amp; Wainscotte, by the Yard: Bourd and Stone, by the Foote.

For if a rightline applyed to a surface euery way, do touch it in all places, it is Eu'n: Otherwise, it is vneu'n.</p>

               <p>Land, Meddow, or Wood, is to bee measured by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, in all respects, as Board or Glasse was measured. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two things are here first to be knowne: The first is, That as there the beuelling line of 12, was alwayes giuen for the breadth, as appropriate to that kinde of measure: So here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, peculiar to this manner of measure, is in like sort to bee drawne ouerth wart the parallell lines from 6 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of an inch from the fore-end of the Rular, in the parallell 24, vnto 13 and ⅓ in the parallell 12. The second is, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> there lines and spaces did answer, and were denominated of inches and parts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; so here the same lines and spaces must bee supposed to signifie Rods and Perches, and parts of the same. An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or two will make all plaine and manifest.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Suppose a right angled square field of 16 Pole broad, and 30 in length were to be measured: Here I finde 16, to meet with the line of Land measure at 10 inches from the fore end of the Rular: Therefore I say, that euery 10 rod in length, of the breadth of 16 rods shall make an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Land. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, because the said 10 is found in 30 the length giuen 3 times. Therefore I say, the field assigned doth conteine 3 A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
               <p n="2">2 A square Meddow right-angled of 40 Poses in breadth, and 60 in length, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be measured. Here 40, the lesser num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the two giuen, is greater then any vpon the Rular: Theresore I take 20, the halfe of 40: And I finde 20 to meet with the line of land measure, at 8 inches from the said fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of the Rular. Therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I say. That euery 7 Pole in length of the breadth of 40 Pole, shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 2 Akers of
<pb facs="tcp:1550:16"/>
Meddow. Againe because 8 is conteined in 60 seuen times and ½: therefore I auerre, that the Meddow assigned to bee measured, doth conteine 15 akers.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Admit that a Wood to bee measured were 160 rods square: that is, that euery side of the same were 160 Poles in length. Here 160 is farre greater then any number vpon the Rular: Therefore I take 16, the tenth part of 160: which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to crosse the line of land measure at 10 inches from the fore end of the Rular: wherefore first I affirme, that euery 10 pole of the breadth of 160 pole, shall conteine 10 Akers of Wood: Againe, because 160 doth 10 sixteene times, I say, that the Wood doth conteine 160 Akers. Or, which is all one, that euery Pole in breadth of that length, doth conteine an Aker.</p>
               <p>But some man may obiect and say, this is not a matter worth the learning, or of so many words, seeing that it is well knowne, that there are many men wholly vnlearned, yea, and some of no extraordinary parts of capacity or vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which can measure Land, Meddow, or Woods, so that they be square, or of any ordinary forme. I confesse I haue knowne diuers such. And yet is not this our labour in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> or altogether vnprofitable: For first, what they doe with much study or contention of minde, and are long in doing of it, we teach to doe with great facility and speed. For they, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the field be a rightangled parallelogramme, must first measure at the least two sides comprehending one or other of the rightangles. And then multiply these two sides the one by the other: And lastly, the product found, they must diuide by 160: And so by the quotient now found, answer the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion propounded. We saue a great deale of this labour. For we only measure the breadth of the field; then wee seeke vpon the Rular, how much in length of this breadth doth make an Aker. Lastly, we apply this last number found vnto the whole length, and so witho ut either multiplication or diuision, doe speedily answere the demand.</p>

               <p>Another thing there is wherein this inuention doth goe farre beyond the reach of the vnlearned, which is thus. These <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> one, two, or three Akers of the same. Here it is all one to giue the content of the whole, or any part, or parts of the same. And that which to those is most hard, here to vs is most easie: I meane to set out any one or more Akers of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
