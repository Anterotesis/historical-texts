            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Am abundantly ſatisfied that the ſtrenuous attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt
the Religion of <hi>Romane Catholicks,</hi> made by
the zealous Aſsertors of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe, do amount to
but little more than an Endeavour to fortify theſe two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it is, in not a few inſtances, manifeſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from, and repugnant to the Doctrine of our <hi>Saviour</hi>
and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> delivered in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that it is highly prejudicial to the <hi>Secular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi>
violates the due <hi>Liberty,</hi> and infringes the rights of
Princes and their Subjects.</p>
            <p>Now, how well they have quitted themſelves as to the
<hi>former</hi> of theſe Charges, I leave thoſe to determine, who
with an unbiaſſed and impartial mind, have oonverſt with
their Writings: but as to the <hi>latter,</hi> thou wilt be ſufficiently
enabled to paſs a true judgment concerning it, by putting thy
ſelf to the ſmall pains of peruſing this ſhort <hi>Narrative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>hence</hi> thou wilt as throughly underſtand what obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
lieth upon <hi>this</hi> Kingdom eſpecially, from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

Thou wilt clearly perceive by theſe few leaves, how much
<hi>Princes</hi> conſult the ſecurity of their Government, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement

the truth of the following <hi>Narrative,</hi> I aſſure
thee, I have moſt faithfully taken it from Father <hi>Paul,</hi>
a perſon of unqueſtion'd integrity, and that lived and
died in the Communion of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church: As thou
mayſt be ſatisfied by comparing it with his relation of the
Government of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, in his exact <hi>Hiſtory
of the Council of Trent.</hi> For which, as the Chriſtian
Church is highly obliged to him upon many <hi>other</hi> accounts,
ſo particularly for the <hi>Life</hi> of this Zealous <hi>Pope,</hi> in which
his extraordinary kindneſs for two things is more eſpecially
remarkable, becauſe they ſeem to ſtand in no ſmall need of
ſo Great an Authority to recommend them, viz. <hi>Perjury</hi>
and an <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> Beſides that, we may learn from this
<hi>Pope,</hi> how exceedingly convenient <hi>Infallibility</hi> is for the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Church; when we ſee that it may ſometimes
fall out, that a <hi>Pope</hi> may be but little better than a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Year of our Lord One
thouſand five hundred fifty and
five <hi>Marcellus Cervinus</hi> was
Created Pope, and retained
his Name; but, having ſate
no more than twenty two daies,
died: The Cardinals being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
again in the <hi>Conclave,</hi>
he of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> aſſiſted by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi>
made great inſtance, that among the Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the Cardinals were to ſwear to, one ſhould
be, that the future Pope ſhould, by Counſel of the
Colledg, call another Synod within two years, to finiſh
the Reformation begun, to determine the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of Religion that remained, and to find a means to
cauſe the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> to be received in <hi>Germany.</hi>
And the Colledg of the Cardinals being full, it was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62897:6"/>
that the Pope ſhould not Create more than
four within two years. The three and twentieth day
of the next moneth. <hi>John Peter Caraffa,</hi> who called
himſelf <hi>Paulus Quartus,</hi> was Created.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He took it for a great glory, that the three Engliſh
Ambaſſadors, diſpatched in the time of</hi> Julius, <hi>entred</hi>
Rome <hi>the firſt day of his Papacy: and the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory
after the Coronation was publick.</hi> The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
were brought into it, who, proſtrating themſelves at
the Popes feet, did in the name of the Kingdom, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the faults committed; relating them all in particular,
(for ſo the Pope would have it) confeſsing they had been
ungrateful for ſo many benefits received from the Church,
and humbly craving pardon for it. The Pope did pardon
them, took them up from the ground, and embraced them:
and, to honour their Majeſties who ſent them, gave the title
of a Kingdom to <hi>Ireland,</hi> granting them this Dignity by the
Authority which the Pope hath from God, being placed over
☜ all Kingdoms, to ſupplant thoſe that are Contumacious,
and to build new. <hi>But it did not then ſeem a fit time to
ſay; he had power from God to build up, and overthrow
Kingdoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Henry <hi>the Eighth, after his ſeparation from the Pope,
made</hi> Ireland <hi>a Kingdom, and called himſelf King of</hi>
England, France <hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>which Title continued
by</hi> Edward, <hi>was aſſumed by</hi> Mary <hi>and her Husband.</hi>
The Pope ſo ſoon as he was Created, entred into a reſolution,
that the Title of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould not be uſed by thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
affirming conſtantly that it belonged only to him, to give
☜ the name of a King. But it ſeemed hard to induce <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to quit that which two Kings had uſed, and the Queen,
not thinking much of it, had continued. Therefore he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62897:6"/>
found a temper; that is, to diſsemble the knowledg of what
<hi>Henry</hi> had done, and himſelf to erect the Iſland into a
Kingdom, that ſo the World might believe that the Queen
had uſed the Titles as given by the <hi>Pope,</hi> not as decreed
by her Father. <hi>And the Popes have often given that
which they could not take from the Poſſeſſors; and, to
avoid contentions, ſome have received their</hi> own <hi>goods
as</hi> gifts, <hi>and ſome have diſſembled the knowledg of the
gift, or of the pretence of the giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the private diſcourſes between the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,</hi>
he found fault that the Church was not wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
☜ ſaying, that by no means it was to be tolerated,
and that it was neceſſary to render all, even to a farthing;
becauſe the things that belong to God can never be applied to
humane uſes, and he that with-holdeth the leaſt part of them
☜ is in continual ſtate of damnation. That if he had
power to grant them, he would do it moſt readily, for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
affection that he beareth to them, and for the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he had of their filial Obedience, but his authority was
not ſo large, as that he might prophane the things dedicated
to God, and let <hi>England</hi> be aſsured that this would be an
<hi>Anathema,</hi> and a Contagion, which, by the juſt revenge of
God, would hold the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity.

and was not content to ſpeak of it once, but repeated
it as often as there was occaſion. He ſaid alſo plainly, that
☜ the <hi>Peter Pence</hi> ought to be paid, as ſoon as might be,
&amp; that, according to the cuſtom, he would ſend a <hi>Collector</hi> for
that purpoſe; that himſelf had exerciſed that Charge three
years, having been ſent into <hi>England</hi> for that end, wherein
he was much edified, by ſeeing the forwardneſs of the people to

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62897:7"/>
often that they could not hope that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would open
Heaven unto them, ſo long as they uſurped his goods upon
Earth. This relation made unto the Queen, with many
other Treaties continued ſucceſsively from <hi>Rome,</hi> cauſed
her to employ all her Spirits herein; but nothing could be
done, becauſe many of the Nobility, and of the <hi>Grandies</hi>
had incorporated many of theſe revenues into their houſes.
For <hi>her ſelf</hi> ſhe reſtored the <hi>tenths,</hi> and all other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
goods annexed to the Crown by her <hi>Brother</hi> and her
<hi>Father.</hi> The Ambaſſadors parted from <hi>Rome,</hi> with much
praiſe and favour from the Pope, for their ſubmiſsion; a
means by which his good will is eaſily gained.</p>
            <p>In the mean ſpace the Diet of <hi>Germany</hi> was proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
not without contentions; which would have
been greater, if Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> had remained there,
as well for the negotiations he would have made, as for
the ſuſpitions conceived by the Proteſtants, that he was
ſent only to oppoſe their Commodities. And it was
already publiſhed every where that <hi>Rome</hi> was full of
hope, that <hi>Germany</hi> would quickly come under the
Yoke, as <hi>England</hi> had done. After the Cardinals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
the firſt difficulty was; whether the points of
Religion ſhould be diſcuſſed firſt of all; which, though
the Eccleſiaſticks did contradict in the beginning, yet
it was finally reſolved by common conſent to begin
there. Wherein there were two contrary Propoſitions;
one to treat of the means to reform it, the other to
leave every one to his liberty: about which Point
there was very great Controverſy. But in the end all
inclined to the ſecond Propoſition, not knowing how to
root out the evil which did ſtill move, only hoping that
when the humours were quiet, and the differences and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62897:7"/>
ſuſpitions removed, many eaſy and commodious waies
might be found out. For this, it was neceſſary to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
a Peace, that for cauſe of Religion there might be
no more War, and that it might be lawful for all the
Princes and States of the Empire to follow and cauſe
to be obſerved in their Dominions what Religion plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them beſt. And the five and twentieth day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
the <hi>Receſs</hi> was made, that a General or Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Council (neither of which could be aſſembled in
regard of many difficulties) being neceſſary to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
lawfully the Cauſes of Religion, until a way
might be opened to a friendly agreement throughout
all <hi>Germany,</hi> the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Catholick
Princes and States ſhould not force the Princes, Orders
and States of the <hi>Augustan Confeſsion</hi> to forſake their
Religion and Ceremonies already inſtituted, or to be
inſtituted in their Dominions, not ſhould do any thing
in contempt thereof, nor hinder them in the free uſe of

the old Religion as well Eccleſiaſtical as Secular, every
one having power to eſtabliſh in his own State what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
he will, and to forbid the other. And if any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick
ſhall abandon the old Religion, it ſhall be no
infamy unto him, but the ſhall preſently loſe his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
which ſhall be conferred upon others by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron;
and the Benefices, which the Proteſtants have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

Pope, <hi>Paul,</hi> underſtanding of this <hi>Receſs</hi> of <hi>Ausburg,</hi>

reprehending <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for ſuffering a Treaty in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, without the knowledg of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
☜ See, <hi>and threatning that in due time he would make
the Emperor and that King know, to their grief, how they
have offended him:</hi> he exhorted them to prevent it, by
revoking and diſallowing the things granted, that he
might have no occaſion to proceed, as he meant to do,
not only againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but even againſt <hi>them</hi>
alſo as Abettors: offering to aſſiſt them, in caſe they
ſhould do it by authority and arms; and to command
all Chriſtian Princes, upon pains and cenſures, to aid
them with all their Forces. He was not ſatisfied with
the Ambaſſadors anſwer, who alledged the ſtrength of
the Proteſtants, the War againſt <hi>Ceſar,</hi> in which he was

them, yea, commanded not to obſerve them.</hi> To the reſt
he ſaid, that in God's Cauſe one muſt not proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to humane reſpects. That the Emperor was
in danger, by God's permiſſion, becauſe he did not what
he could and ought to do, to reduce <hi>Germany</hi> to the
obedience of the Apoſtolick See: that this is but a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of God's anger, and that he muſt expect greater
puniſhment, if he take not warning by it: but carrying
himſelf as a Souldier of Chriſt undauntedly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
worldly reſpects, he ſhall obtain all manner of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
as the examples of the times paſt do demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul,</hi> being of an high ſpirit, and vaſt thoughts, did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62897:8"/>
aſſure himſelf that he could redreſs all the diſorders,
by his <hi>Papal</hi> Authority only, nor had need of any Prince
herein. Therefore he never ſpake with Ambaſſadors,
but he thundred in their ears, <hi>that he was above all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that he would not that any of them ſhould be, too domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
☜ <hi>with him, that he could change Kingdoms, that he
was Succeſſor of him who hath depoſed Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi>
and did often repeat, for a beginning of authority
exerciſed by him, <hi>that he had made</hi> Ireland <hi>a Kingdom,</hi>
and went on ſo far, that in Conſiſtory, and at his Table
publickly, in the preſence of many, he ſaid <hi>he would not</hi>

under his foot,</hi> (ſo he ſaid, ſtriking it againſt the ground)
<hi>as it is fit, and as it is his will who hath built the Church, and
hath placed them in this degree.</hi> And ſometimes he would
ſay, <hi>that rather than he would do any thing baſely, he would
die, overthrow all, and ſet the whole World on fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth was naturally of a lofty mind and
courage, and truſted much in his knowledg and good
fortune, which did accompany him in all his actions:
whereunto the power and fortune of the <hi>Papacy</hi> being
added, he thought every thing was eaſy. But two hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
did flote in him by turns; one, which by cuſtom
to make uſe of Religion in all his attempts, did induce
him to employ his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Authority. The other was
put into him by <hi>Charles Caraffa</hi> his Nephew, who, being
valiant, and exerciſed in War, made Cardinal of a
Souldier, did retain his martial Spirits, and perſwaded
him to uſe his <hi>temporal</hi> power, ſaying, that the one
without the other is deſpiſed, but being joyned, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of great matters. The circumſpect old man
knew well that the <hi>Spiritual</hi> is made weaker, when it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62897:9"/>
is manifeſted that there is need of the <hi>Temporal.</hi> But
being ever intent to make his name great, ſometimes
he gave ear to his <hi>Nephew,</hi> and ſometimes he believed
<hi>himſelf</hi> more. In the end he concluded to uſe the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>
ſecretly, and the <hi>Spiritual</hi> openly, that, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>this,</hi> he might add or omit the <hi>other,</hi> as he ſhould
be adviſed by events. Therefore he treated moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
by his Nephew, with the Cardinal of <hi>Loraine,</hi> a
League with the <hi>French</hi> King, which being almoſt
made, <hi>Loraine</hi> parted from <hi>Rome</hi> to take away ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Cardinal <hi>Torrnon</hi> went thither, with whom
it was concluded with the ſame ſecrecy. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Capitulation whereof was, the gaining of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Naples</hi> for a younger Son of the King, with
great enlargement of the bounds of the Eccleſiaſtical
ſtate.</p>
            <p>The Pope alſo, that he might have a prop to lean on
in both courſes, thought it neceſſary to make a promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> dependents on himſelf, men of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
who would not be afraid to proſecute his deſigns,
and employ themſelves in any hard enterpriſe. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſpeak of this promotion but a few daies before
he made it; which grieved the Cardinals, <hi>for that he
would contradict the Capitulation which he had ſworn.</hi> The
twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> the Pope, being entred into
the Conſiſtory, ſaid, ſo ſoon as he ſate down, that he
would not give audience to any that day, becauſe he
had greater matters to propoſe. Every one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
by this, that his meaning was to create new
Cardinals, the Cardinal of St. <hi>James</hi> went to his Seat
to ſpeak with him; and the Pope refuſing, and the
Cardinal not deſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting, he ſet his hand on his breaſt, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62897:9"/>
thruſt him from him. All being ſate, the Pope began
to complain of thoſe who reported he could make but
four Cardinals, in regard of that which he had ſworn
in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>that this was to bind the Popes
authority, which is abſolute; that it is an Article of Faith</hi>
☜ <hi>that the Pope cannot be bound, and much leſs can bind
himſelf; that to ſay otherwiſe was manifeſt hereſie; from
the guilt whereof he did abſolve thoſe that were faulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he thought they did not ſpeak obſtinately: but hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
if any ſhall ſay the ſame, or the like, againſt the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
given him by God, he will give order that the</hi> Inquiſition
<hi>ſhall proceed.</hi> He added that he would make Cardinals,
and would not have any contradiction, becauſe he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
perſons for employment, which he could not put
upon them, becauſe every one had his proper faction:
that it was fit to promote men of Learning, and of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
life, to employ them for reformation of the
Church, eſpecially in the Council, whereof it was high
time to treat ſeriouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he would propoſe with
the firſt occaſion. But now he would name unto them
the perſons to be promoted to the Cardinality, that
they, having a <hi>conſultive</hi> voice, might put to his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
what was for the good of the Church, wherein
they ſhould be heard, and that they ſhould not believe
they had a <hi>deciſive</hi> voice, becauſe that belonged only to
him. He propoſed ſeven perſons, in which number
only one was his Kinſman, and another of the <hi>Theatine
Congregation:</hi> the others were men of much fame either
for Learning, or for the negotiations of the Court. The
Cardinals were created the next Sunday before the
League was concluded with <hi>France,</hi> which was the
<hi>15th.</hi> of that moneth.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62897:10"/>
At this time Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> (who, for many reſpects
of ſucceſſion, and to ſhew he was not ſo obliged to the
Papacy, would not receive Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Orders;</hi> theſe
cauſes being ceaſed) went out of the number of the
Deacon Cardinals, and was ordained Prieſt: and four
moneths after, the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being
burnt, having been firſt degraded with many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
he was put into his place.</p>
            <p>The people of <hi>Au<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in the Diet, and of <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s declaration, entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hope that themſelves alſo might retain liberty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Therefore he having called a Diet of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to have a contribution againſt the Turks, who made
War againſt him, they demanded permiſſion to live in
purity of Religion, and to enjoy the benefit which was
granted to the <hi>Confeſsioniſts,</hi> and that they might not be
in verſe eſtate than other Germans, and that Miniſters
of the Church might teach and diſtribute the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
according to the Evangelical and Apoſtolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> anſwered, that he could not grant their
demand, not for want of will to gratifie them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was bound to obey the Church, but to yield
to their deſires as much as he could, he was content to
ſuſp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd that part of the Edict which concerneth the
Communion of the Cup, yet with condition that they
ſhould change nothing in the Rites and Ceremonies of
the Church, until the Decree of the future Diet. And
they, deſiring nothing elſe, were content to contribute
readily againſt the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bavarians</hi> alſo deſired of their Duke liberty of
Religion, demanding a <hi>free preaching of the Goſpel, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62897:10"/>
of Prieſts, the Communion in both kinds,</hi> and <hi>to eat
fleſh every day,</hi> proteſting that otherwiſe they would not
pay the heavy Subſidies and Contributions againſt the
Turks. The Duke ſeeing that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had granted
his people the Communion of the <hi>Cup,</hi> did likwiſe
grant them that Communion, and leave to eat fleſh, if
there were neceſſity, on Faſting daies, until the cauſes
of Religion were compoſed by Publick Authority.</p>
            <p>But the Pope having laid the foundations before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed,
applying himſelf to Spiritual matters, thought
it neceſſary to gain Credit with the World; which
could not be done, if it did not appear by deeds, not
by words only, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was reformed.
Therefore, being wholly bent to this, in the end of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
1556. he erected a Congregation, to which he
committed the diſcuſſion of all the doubts in matter of
Simony; which he Printed, and ſent Copies of them
to all Princes, and ſaid, he had publiſhed them, that
they might come to the knowledg of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi>
of general <hi>Studies,</hi> and of every Learned man, that all
might have occaſion to make known their opinions,
which he would not openly deſire, becauſe it was not
honourable for that See, which is Miſtreſs of all, to go
about and beg them. He ſaid, <hi>that for himſelf he had
no need of the inſtruction of any, becauſe he knew what Chriſt
did command, but that he had erected the Congregation that,
in a matter wherein all are intereſted, it might not be ſaid
that he had proceeded of his own head.</hi> He added, that
having purged himſelf and his Court, it could not be
ſaid to him, <hi>Phyſitian cure thy ſelf: And that he would
make Princes know, that there is greater Simony in their
Courts, which he would take away, being Superior to Princes
as well as Prelates.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62897:11"/>
Some told him that it was neceſſary to handle ſuch a
thing in a General Council, which he heard with great
indignation, and ſaid, <hi>he had no need of a Council, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
being above all.</hi> And Cardinal <hi>Bellai</hi> ſaying that
a Council was neceſſary, not to add authority to the
Pope, but to find a means for Execution, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be uniform in all places; he concluded, that if a
Council were neceſſa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, it ſhould be held in <hi>Rome,</hi> and
that it was not needful to go elſe-where; and that he

T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe it was in the midd'ſt of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
that the Council is to conſiſt of <hi>Biſhops</hi> only; <hi>that other
perſons might be admitted for Counſel, yet only Catholicks,</hi>
☜ <hi>otherwiſe the Turks alſo ought to be admitted:</hi> That it
was a great vanity to ſend into the Mountains ſixty
Biſhops of the leaſt able, and fourty Doctors of the
moſt inſufficient, as was twice done already; and to
believe, that by thoſe the World could be better regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
than by the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with the Colledg of
all the Cardinals, who are the Pillars of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Elected for the moſt Excellent of all Chriſtian
Nations, and by the Counſel of the Prelates and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
which are in <hi>Rome,</hi> who are the moſt Learned
perſons in the World, and more in number than, by any
diligence, can be brought to <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when news came to <hi>Rome</hi> of the grant of the
<hi>Cup,</hi> made by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to his Subjects, he
entred into a great rage againſt him: and he put this
among other things, for which he deſigned to make
proviſion at once, being full of hope that every thing
would be eaſy unto him, if the Court were reformed,
and was not troubled, though he ſaw the number of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62897:11"/>
abuſes to encreaſe. For a few daies after the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
of <hi>Polonia,</hi> coming expreſly to congratulate his
Holineſs for his aſſumption to the Popedom, made five
demands in the name of the King and Kingdom, <hi>viz.
To Celebrate the Maſs in the Polonian Tongue. To uſe the
Communion in both kinds. The Marriage of Prieſts.</hi> That
<hi>the payment of</hi> Annates <hi>might be taken away.</hi> And that
<hi>they might call a National Council</hi> to reform the proper
abuſes of the Kingdom, and to reconcile the variety of
opinions. He heard theſe demands with unſpeakable
impatience, and ſet himſelf to deteſt them moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,
ſpeaking againſt them one after another, with infinite
vehemence. And for concluſion he ſaid, that a
General Council in <hi>Rome</hi> would cauſe the hereſies and
bad opinions of many to be known, alluding to what
was done in <hi>Germany, Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for theſe reaſons almoſt reſolute in himſelf, (or at
leaſt willing to ſeem ſo) that it was neceſſary to call a
Council, he told all the Ambaſſadors, that they ſhould
ſignifie to their Princes his purpoſe to make a <hi>Lateran</hi>
Council, like unto that which is ſo famous. And he
ſent <hi>Nuncii</hi> to the Emperor and the French King, to
exhort them to Peace, though in <hi>France</hi> he had a more
ſecret negotiation. He gave commiſſion alſo to treat
with them of the Council, and ſaid in the Conſiſtory,
that it was neceſſary to Celebrate it quickly, ſeeing that
beſides <hi>Bohemia, Pruſsia</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> which were
much infected; <hi>Polonia</hi> alſo was in danger. That in
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> they were well affected in Religion,
but the Clergy were badly uſed. That which he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
reprehended in <hi>France,</hi> was the exaction of the
Tenths, which the King made the Clergy ordinarily
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62897:12"/>
pay. But he was more incited againſt <hi>Spain.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi>
the Third, and <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lius,</hi> having granted the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> the halt and quarter Fruits, for a Subſidy of the
War of <hi>Germany,</hi> and he having revoked the grant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was not ſatisfied with the <hi>Receſs</hi> of <hi>Ausburg,</hi>
yet they perſevered in <hi>Spain,</hi> and forced the Clergy to
pay by Sequeſtrations and impriſonments.</p>
            <p>He did not forbear to ſay that the Emperor was an
<hi>Heretick;</hi> that in the beginning he favoured the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators
of <hi>Germain,</hi> to depreſs that holy See, and to
make himſelf Lord of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all <hi>Italy;</hi> that he
held <hi>Paul</hi> the Third in perpetual trouble, and that he
ſhould not do the like to him. He added, that although
he might remedy all theſe inconveniences by his <hi>own</hi>
Authority, yet, not to lay ſo great a burden upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
alone, he would not do it without a Council; that
he had called it in <hi>Rome,</hi> and named it the <hi>Lateran;
that he had given commiſſion to ſignifie it to the Emperor
and French King in courteſie, but not to have their conſent
or Counſel, becauſe his will was they ſhould obey:</hi> That he
was aſſured it would pleaſe neither of them, becauſe it
is not for their purpoſe, living as they do, and that they
will ſay many things againſt it, to diſturb it. <hi>But he
will call it whether they will or no, and make known what
that See can do, when it hath a Pope of Courage.</hi> The <hi>26th</hi>
of <hi>May,</hi> the Anniverſary of his Coronation, all the
Cardinals and Ambaſſadors dining with him, according
to cuſtom, he began after dinner to diſcourſe of the
Council, and that his reſolution was to celebrate it by
all means in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that, in Courteſie, he gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
thereof to the Princes, and that the high-waies
may be made ſecure for the Prelates. But if no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62897:12"/>
would come thither, yet he would hold it with
thoſe only who are in Court, becauſe he well knew what
Authority he had.</p>
            <p>While the Pope was buſy about the Reformation,
news came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that a Truce was concluded the
<hi>5th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> between the Emperor and French
King, by the mediation of Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> who did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
in the name of the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> which
made the Pope amazed, and Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> much
more, it having been treated and concluded without
them. The Pope was diſpleaſed principally for the
loſs of reputation, and for the danger which it brought,
if thoſe two Princes were joyned, at whoſe diſcretion
he muſt needs ſtand. Yet the Pope, not loſing courage,
made ſhew of joy for the Truce, but ſaid he was not
fully ſatisfied with it, becauſe a <hi>Peace</hi> was neceſſary in
regard of the Council, which he purpoſed to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate,
which he was reſolved to treat; and, for that
end, to ſend Legates to thoſe Princes, being aſſured to
conclude it, becauſe he would employ his Authority:
for he would not be hindred in the government of the
Church, committed to him by Chriſt. To the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
he ſent <hi>Scipio Rebiba</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and to the
French King, Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> his Nephew. <hi>This</hi> went
with all ſpeed, and to the <hi>other,</hi> order was given to go
ſlowly. <hi>Rebiba</hi> had inſtruction to exhort the Emperor
to amend <hi>Germany,</hi> which was not done till then, becauſe
none had proceeded aright in that enterpriſe. He knew
the defects of his Predeceſſors, who, to ſtop the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Court, did hinder the good progreſs of
the Council. But contrarily he was reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Reformation, and to celebrate a Council
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62897:13"/>
in his own preſence, and to begin with this point; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
himſelf, that when they ſhould ſee the abuſes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, for which they ſeparated themſelves from
the Church, and remain contumacious ſtill, they will
deſire, and run to receive the Decrees and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the Council will make; where ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
not <hi>verbally,</hi> but <hi>really,</hi> the <hi>Head, Members,
Clergie, Laity, Princes,</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> To do ſo good a
work, a truce of five years is not ſufficient, becauſe
there are no leſs ſuſpitions in Truces than in War; and
one muſt be ever providing againſt the time when they
end. That a perpetual Peace is neceſſary to remove
all malice and ſuſpitions, that all may bend themſelves
joyntly, without worldly reſpects, to that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
the union, and reformation of the Church. He
gave the like inſtructions to <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and was content it
ſhould be publiſhed by giving out ſome Copies of
it.</p>
            <p>He gave his Nephew a large inſtruction to try the
Kings mind, and, if he ſaw him reſolute to obſerve
the Truce, to thunder into his ears the ſame leſſon of
the Council: and to <hi>Rebiba</hi> he gave order to govern
himſelf as he he ſhould receive advice from his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew.
<hi>Caraffa</hi> carried to the King the Sword and Hat
which the Pope had bleſſed on Chriſtmaſs-day at night,
according to the cuſtom. Of the <hi>Peace</hi> he made no
mention, but repreſented to the King, that howſoever
the League was not violated by the Truce of five years,
yet it was made of no force, to the great danger of his
Unckle, and of his Family, and that they had already

terms, Religion and the Papacy, to which his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
gave ſingular protection, and the Pope himſelf
and his Family, much devoted to his Majeſty. The
King was not averſe, but remained doubtful, conſidering
the Pope's age, who might die when he ſhould have
moſt need of him. <hi>Caraffa</hi> perceived this, and found
a remedy, promiſing that the Pope ſhould create ſo
many Cardinals partial for <hi>France,</hi> and Enemies to
<hi>Spain,</hi> that he ſhould ever have a Pope on his ſide. The

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62897:14"/>
retiring into the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> was received,
and ſometimes made excurſions upon his own lands,
which much provoked the Pope; who thinking his
<hi>nods</hi> were <hi>commandments</hi> unto all, able to terrifie every
one, he could not endure to be ſo little eſteemed at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
his Country, where he would have been thought to
be Omnipotent. He thought in the beginning, by talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laviſhly of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and of the King, to make
them deſiſt from favouring the <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> and therefore
ſpake very often diſgracefully of them, in the preſence
of all ſorts of perſons, but moſt willingly when any
Spaniſh Cardinal was preſent, and, at laſt, commanded
it ſhould be written unto them.</p>
            <p>None of theſe proofs taking effect, he proceeded
farther, and the three and twentieth of <hi>July</hi> made the
<hi>Fiſcal,</hi> and <hi>Silveſter Aldobrandinus,</hi> the Conſiſtorial Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
appear in the Conſiſtory, who declared, that his
Holineſs having excommunicated and deprived <hi>Marcus
Antonius Colonna,</hi> and prohibited, under the ſame cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
all ſorts of perſons to aſſiſt or favour him, and it
being notorious that the Emperor, and King <hi>Philip</hi> his
<hi>Son,</hi> had furniſhed him with horſe, foot, and money,
<hi>they were fallen into the puniſhments of the ſame ſentence,</hi>
☜ <hi>and had loſt their Territories, which they held in Fee.</hi>
Therefore they deſired that his Holineſs would proceed
to a declaratory Sentence, and give order for Execution.
The Pope anſwered, that he would adviſe upon it by the
counſel of the Cardinals, and propoſed in Conſiſtory
what was fit to be done in a caſe of ſo great importance.
But the Conſiſtory being diſmiſſed without a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Pope knew that either he muſt yield, or come
to a War, from which being not averſe, advice came
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62897:14"/>
fitly to him from his Nephew, of what was concluded
in <hi>France.</hi> So that the diſcourſes of <hi>Reformation</hi> and
<hi>Councils</hi> were turned into parlies of <hi>Money, Souldiers,</hi>
and <hi>Intelligences.</hi> The Pope armed the Citizens and
Inhabitants of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the number of 5000. cauſed
many of his Cities to be fortified, and put garriſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; and the French King ſent him, at his inſtance,
3000 Gaſcons by Sea, that he might ſubſiſt while the
Royal Army was prepared.</p>
            <p>In theſe negotiations the Pope impriſoned many Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
Barons, and others, upon ſuſpition; as alſo the
Ambaſſadors of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
Poſt-maſter. And to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> (who
ſent to proteſt againſt him, for maintaining in <hi>Rome</hi> the
fugitives of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> for laying hands
on, and keeping in Priſon publick perſons without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and for having opened the Kings Letters,) he ſent
back this anſwer: <hi>That he was a free Prince, and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to all others, not bound to give any account, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it of any wha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſoever; that he might entertain any
perſons, and open any letters which he thought to be written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Church: that if</hi> Carallaſſo (Philip's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor)
<hi>had done the office of an</hi> Ambaſſador, <hi>nothing ſhould
have been done againſt him; but having made Treaties,
moved Seditions, plotted againſt the Prince to whom he
was ſent, he had offended as a private man, and as ſuch he
ſhould be puniſhed; that no danger ſhould make him be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Dignity of the Church, and defence of that See,
referring all to God, by whom he was made Shepherd of the
Flock of Chriſt.</hi> And the Pope ſtill continuing to make
proviſion; the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> ſent another proteſtation
againſt him, that the King having endured ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62897:15"/>
knowing that the intention of his Holineſs was
to diſpoſſeſs him of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> and being
aſſured that to this end he had made a League with his
enemies; therefore, in regard his Holineſs did deſire
War, he did denounce it againſt him, proteſting that
the Calamities thereof could not be imputed to him,
and laying the blame upon the Pope. The Pope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng
ſhew to deſire Peace, but anſwering only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
terms, to gain time, the Duke began to make War
the fourth of <hi>September,</hi> and in the year, 1556 poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelf of all <hi>Campania,</hi> holding it in the name of
the next Pope, and came ſo near to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he put
City in fear, and made them ſtrengthen and fortifie it.
But the greatneſs of the City, and other reſpects and
dangers, counſelled him, not aſſailing <hi>Rome,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
ſmaller enterpriſes.</p>
            <p>It gave much matter of diſcourſe, that, this year
<hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor parted from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and paſſed
into <hi>Spain,</hi> to betake himſelf to a private life in a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
place, ſo that they made a compariſon between a
Prince trained up from his infancy in the negotiations
and affairs of the World, who at the age of little more
than fifty years, reſolved to quit the World, and only
to ſerve God, changed from a mighty Prince, to a mean
religious perſon; and one, who had formerly abandoned
the Epiſcopal Charge, to retire into a Monaſtery, and
now, being at the age of eighty years, and made Pope,
did wholly addict himſelf to Pomp and Pride, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to ſet all <hi>Europe</hi> on fire with War.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the year, 1557. the Duke of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> paſſed into <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Pope, who, to obſerve the promiſe of his Nephew
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62897:15"/>
made to the French King, made a promotion of ten
Cardinals; which not being according to the <hi>meaning</hi>
and the <hi>end</hi> agreed on, neither for the <hi>number,</hi> nor <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of the perſons, his excuſe was, that he was ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conjoyned with his Majeſty, that his dependents
would be as ſerviceable to the King as the <hi>French</hi>-men
themſelves: and that he could not then make a
greater promotion, ſeeing the number already arrived
to 70. which would quickly be diminiſhed by removing
ſome Rebels, which he meant of thoſe that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in the Caſtle, and others againſt whom he had a
deſign, as well for matter of <hi>State,</hi> as of <hi>Religion:</hi> for
he was not ſo intent on the War, as to abandon the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which he ſaid was <hi>the principal
Secret and Myſtery of the Papacy.</hi> He had information
againſt Cardinal <hi>Morone,</hi> that he held intelligence in
<hi>Germany,</hi> and impriſoned him in the Caſtle, and the
Biſhop of <hi>Modena</hi> as confederate with him.</p>
            <p>He deprived alſo Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> of his Legation of
<hi>England,</hi> and cited him to appear in the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and created Cardinal <hi>William Peto</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> and made him Legate in <hi>Pool</hi>'s place. And
although the King and Queen, teſtifying what ſervice he
had done to the Catholick Faith, made earneſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
for him, yet the Pope would never remit one
jot of his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igour. Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> obe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the adminiſtration and ornaments of a Legate, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not out of <hi>England,</hi> alledging the Queens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
that he ſhould not go. In <hi>England</hi> many
were ſcandalized at it, and allienated from the Pope,
and many in <hi>Rome</hi> thought it a calumny, invented to
revenge himſelf for the Truce between the two
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62897:16"/>
Kings, treated by him without imparting it to
him.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being come into <hi>Italy,</hi> made
VVar in <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mont,</hi> with purpoſe to continue it in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi>
and ſo to divert the Arms taken up againſt the
Pope: but the Pope's ardent deſire to aſſail the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Naples</hi> did not permit him. The French-men
knew the difficulties, and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with four
principal Commanders, went to <hi>Rome</hi> by Poſt, to make
the Pope underſtand what the reaſons of War did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade.
In whoſe preſence all being conſulted on, and
the Pope's reſolution not giving place to any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
it was neceſſary to yield unto him. Yet they
did nothing but aſſault <hi>Civitella,</hi> a place ſituated at the
entry into the Provinces of <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> where the Army
had a repulſe. In ſumm, the Pope's Arms, as well
his <hi>own</hi> as <hi>Auxiliary,</hi> were not much favoured by God:
But in the midſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Army of the Duke of
<hi>Alva</hi> approaching <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope underſtanding
the ſurprize and ſack of <hi>Signea,</hi> the ſlaughter of many,
and the danger in which <hi>Pagliano</hi> was, he related all in
<hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> with many tears; adding, that he did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly
expect Martyrdom; the Cardinals marvelling
that he ſhould paint out the Cauſe to them, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the truth, as if it had been of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it was profane, and proceeded from ambition, and
that he ſhould ſay it was the principal Sinew, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Papacy.</p>
            <p>VVhen the Pope's affairs were in greateſt ſtraits, the
French King's Army had ſuch a great overthrow near
S. <hi>Quintin,</hi> that he was forced to recall the Duke of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> and his Forces, letting the Pope know his inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62897:16"/>
neceſſity; the Pope refuſed to let <hi>Guiſe</hi> return,
whereupon there being a great conteſt between them,
the Pope not able to keep him, bad him go, ſeeing he
had done little Service to the King, leſs to the Church,
and none at all to his <hi>own</hi> honour. In the end of the
moneth, the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> approached <hi>Rome,</hi> which
he had taken but for want of courage. Finally, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
was made the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> between <hi>Alva</hi>
and the <hi>Caraffi,</hi> the VVar being continued a whole year.</p>
            <p>In the Capitulation the Pope would not have <hi>Colonna,</hi>
nor any of his Subjects comprehended, nor any word
inſerted to ſhew that he had offended in impriſoning
the Emperors Miniſters, but maintained moſt conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that <hi>Alva</hi> ought to come to <hi>Rome</hi> to ask pardon,
and receive Abſolution, ſaying plainly, that <hi>before he
would loſe one jot of his due, he would ſee the whole World
ruined: that the queſtion was not of his</hi> own, <hi>but of</hi> Chriſt's
<hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVith this condition, and the reſtitution of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
taken, the Controverſy was ended.</p>
            <p>It was eſteemed a Prodigy, that the very day that the
Peace was concluded, there was ſuch a great inundation
of the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> that all the plain of <hi>Rome</hi> was
drowned, and a great part of the fortifications of the
Caſtle S. <hi>Angelo</hi> was overthrown.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> went perſonally to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſubmit
himſelf to the Pope, and receive Abſolution in the <hi>Kings</hi>
name and his <hi>own.</hi> So it happened that the <hi>Conqueror</hi>
bare the indignity, and he that was overcome, triumphed
more than if he had been victorious. And it was no ſmall
favour that the Pope received him with humanity, though he
forbare not his uſual haughty ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62897:17"/>
The VVar was no ſooner ended, but new troubles
came upon the Pope. For advice was ſent out of
<hi>France,</hi> that the fifth of <hi>September</hi> at night, in <hi>Paris,</hi>
about two hundred perſons were aſſembled in an houſe
to celebrate the Communion; which being diſcovered
by the common people, the houſe was aſſaulted, and
ſome fled, but the women and weaker ſort were taken,
of whom ſeven were burned, and the greater part of
the others reſerved for the ſame puniſhment, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

for the Cuſtody of the City, and of <hi>his</hi> perſon, and that
he had a ſtrong hope that God would convert them.
So men judge diverſly of their own intereſts, and of the
facts of others. The Pope took occaſion hence to call
to mind two Conſtitutions which the King had made the
ſame year, which, he ſaid, were againſt the liberty of
the Clergy, and therefore was reſolved they ſhould be
abrogated. The one was publiſhed the firſt of <hi>March,</hi>
that Marriages made by Sons before the age of thirty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62897:17"/>
years complete, and of Daughters before twenty five,
without conſent of the Father, or of him in whoſe
power they are, ſhould be void. The other, the firſt of
<hi>May,</hi> That all Biſhops and Curates ſhould reſide, upon
pain of loſs of the Revenues, with an impoſition of an
extraordinary Subſidy, beſides the ordinary Tenths,
to pay five thouſand foot Souldiers. The Pope thought
not of theſe things when the news came, becauſe he
was then in War, and had need of the King: but this
reaſon ceaſing, he complained that the King had medled
even with the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and unſupportably burdened
the Clergy: He ſaid it was neceſſary to provide againſt
theſe diſorders by a Council, which were greater than
could be objected againſt the Clergy, that it was fit to
begin the Reformation from hence: that the French
Prelates durſt not ſpeak ſo long as they were in <hi>France,</hi>
but being in a Council in <hi>Italy,</hi> free from fear of the
King, their complaints would ſoon be heard.</p>
            <p>Among theſe diſtaſtes the Pope received ſome joy,
that the Colloquie begun in <hi>Germany,</hi> to compoſe the
differences in Religion, (which troubled his Holineſs
and the Court, as all Colloquies had done) was reſolved
into nothing.</p>
            <p>The Pope perceiving that, by the War paſt, he was
deprived of the credit with which he thought to daunt
the whole World, thought to regain it by an heroical
action, and did the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> in Conſiſtory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> of the Legation of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and
of all government, and confined him to <hi>Civita Lavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and took from <hi>John Caraffa,</hi> the Cardinal's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the command of the Army, exiling him to <hi>Galeſſi.</hi>
He deprived the other Nephew of the government of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62897:18"/>
               <hi>Borgo,</hi> and baniſhed him to <hi>Monte-Bello,</hi> commanding
that their <hi>Wives, Families</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> ſhould depart
from <hi>Rome.</hi> He deprived alſo all <hi>thoſe</hi> of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to whom he had given them in contemplation of
theſe. He inſtituted a new government in <hi>Rome,</hi> and
in the State of the Church, giving the Charge of all
buſineſſes to <hi>Camillus Orſinus,</hi> unto whom he joyned
the Cardinals of <hi>Trani</hi> and <hi>Spoleto,</hi> affecting a fame of
juſtice in theſe actions, and laying the blame of all the
grievances which the people ſuffered upon the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews.
Being thus disburdened of the Government,
he applied himſelf wholly to the office of the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi>
ſaying, <hi>it was the true</hi> Ram <hi>to beat down hereſie, and
defend the Apoſtolick See.</hi> And, not regarding what did
befit the time, he publiſhed a new Conſtitution, dated
the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> which he made all the Cardinals
ſubſcribe. In this he renewed every cenſure and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
pronounced by his Predeceſſors, and every
Statute of Canons, Councils and Fathers, in what time
ſoever, publiſhed againſt Hereticks; ordaining, that
thoſe that were diſuſed, ſhould be brought in uſe again.
He declared, that <hi>all Prelates and Princes, even</hi> Kings
and Emperors, <hi>fallen into hereſie, ſhould be, and ſhould be</hi>
☜ <hi>underſtood to be deprived of all their Benefices, States,
Kingdoms, and Empires, without farther declaration, and
uncapable to be reſtored to them, even by the Apoſtolick See:
the their</hi> Good, States, Kingdoms, and Empire, <hi>ſhall be
underſtood to be common, and to belong to thoſe Catholicks
that can get them.</hi> This did miniſter much talk, and if
it had not been preſently diſeſteemed by the World,
it would have kindled a fire in all Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>Another accident made the World know that he had
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62897:18"/>
not moderated the haughtineſs of his mind. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Charles,</hi> in the year, 1556. by his Letters written
to the Electors and Princes, did abſolutely give to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
all the adminiſtration of the Empire, without
reſerving any thing to himſelf, commanding that he
ſhould be obeyed by all. Afterwards he ſent <hi>William</hi>
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with two Colleagues, to the Diet in
<hi>Germany,</hi> to transfer the <hi>Name, Title, Crown</hi> and <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
upon <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as if himſelf had been dead; which
not ſeeming fit to the Electors, was deferred until the
year, 1558. in which, the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> the day of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
Coronation,</hi> and other <hi>felicities</hi> of <hi>Charles,</hi> the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the reſignation being made by his Ambaſadors,
in preſence of the Electors, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was inſtalled with
the uſual rites. <hi>The Pope hearing this, fell into an exceſſive
rage. He pretended, that as the Pope's Confirmation doth
make the Emperor, ſo the reſignation cannot be put into the
hands of any but himſelf; in which caſe it belonged to him
to make what Emperor he pleaſed; alledging, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
have power granted them by the Popes's favour, to
Elect the Emperour in place of him that is dead, but not in
caſe of reſignation, in which it remaineth ſtill in the power of
the Apoſtolick See; as alſo to the diſpoſition thereof, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
all dignities reſigned unto it. Therefore the reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of</hi> Charles <hi>is void, and the whole authority to chuſe an
Emperour, is devolved to him, and was reſolved not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
the King of the</hi> Romans <hi>for Emperor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſent <hi>Martin Guſman</hi> his Ambaſſador to the
Pope, to give him an account of his Brothers reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and his own aſſumption, to teſtifie unto him the
reverence he bare him, to promiſe him obedience, and
to ſignifie to him that he would ſend a ſolemn Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62897:19"/>
to treat of his Coronation. The Pope refuſed to
hear him, and referred the diſcuſſion of the matter to
the Cardinals: who related (for the Pope's will was
they ſhould do ſo) that the Ambaſſador could not be
admitted, before it did appear whether the reſignation
of <hi>Charles</hi> were lawful, and the ſucceſſion of <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
juſt. For he being Elected King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
the Election confirmed by <hi>Clement,</hi> to ſucceed after the
death of the Emperor, it was neceſſary the Empire
☜ ſhould be void by death. <hi>Beſides, there was a nullity
in all the Acts of</hi> Francfort, <hi>as made by Heretick, who have
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> authority and power. Wherefore it was neceſſary that</hi>
Ferdinand <hi>ſhould ſend a Proctor, and renounce whatſoever
was done in that Diet, and beſeech the Pope, that he would
graciouſly be pleaſed to make good the reſignation of</hi> Charles,
<hi>and his Aſſumption to the Empire, by virtue of his plenary
power, from whom he might expect all Paternal grace and
favour.</hi> The Pope reſolved according to this counſel,
and ſo declared himſelf to <hi>Guſman,</hi> giving him three
moneths to put it in execution, beyond which time he
would hear no more ſpeech of it, but <hi>himſelf would create
a new Emperour.</hi> Neither was it poſſible to remove
him, though King <hi>Philip,</hi> to favour his Unckle, ſent
<hi>Francis Vargas</hi> expreſly, and after him <hi>John Figaroa,</hi> to
entreat him. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> underſtanding this, gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to <hi>Guſman,</hi> that, if within three daies after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
thereof he were not admitted by the Pope, he
ſhould depart, and proteſt unto him, that <hi>Ferdinand,</hi>
together with the Electors, would reſolve of that which
ſhould be for the honour of the Empire. <hi>Guſman</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
audience again, which the Pope granted in private,
not as to an Ambaſſador of the Emperor; and hearing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62897:19"/>
him what he had in his inſtructions, and that which was
wrote unto him from the Emperor, he anſwered, that
the things conſidered by the Cardinals, were very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,
and that he could not reſolve on them ſo ſoon;
that he would ſend a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the Imperial Majeſty of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and, in the mean while, if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from his Maſter to depart, he might do it, and
proteſt what he thought fit. Therefore the <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
having made his proteſtation, departed. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Charles</hi> died the ſame year the <hi>21th</hi> of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
yet it was impoſſible to remove the Pope from this
reſolution.</p>
            <p>The Religion of <hi>England</hi> was much changed this
year. The Queen died the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and
Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> the ſame day; which ſtirred up many
who were not ſatisfied with the former Government, to
reſtore the Reformation of <hi>Edward,</hi> and to ſeparate
themſelves wholly from the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> which they did
the rather, becauſe King <hi>Philip,</hi> to hold a foot in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
had treated to marry <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Siſter and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
of <hi>Mary,</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> his Son: and when there
was little hope of the life of <hi>Mary,</hi> had alſo caſt forth
divers words, that he would take her for his <hi>own</hi> wife.
But the new Queen being wiſe, (as ſhe ſhewed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be in all her Government) did firſt ſecure the
Kingdom by Oath, that ſhe would not marry a ſtranger,
and was Crowned by the Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not making any open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
what Doctrine ſhe would follow, deſigning,
ſo ſoon as ſhe was ſetled in her Government, to eſtabliſh
it by the Counſel of Parliament, and of Learned and
Godly men, and to make a conſtant reformation of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62897:20"/>
State of Religion. Therefore ſhe exhorted the chief
of the Nobility, who deſired a change, to proceed
without tumult, aſſuring them that ſhe would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
any. She cauſed preſently an account to be
given to the Pope of her Aſſumption, with Letters of
Credence written to <hi>Edward Cerne,</hi> who was Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
to her Siſter, and was not departed from
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☜ <hi>But the Pope proceeding according to his uſual
rigour, anſwered,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> was held in Fee of the
Apoſtolick See; that ſhe could not ſucceed, being illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;
that he could not contradict the declarations of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
the Seventh, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, that it was a great
boldneſs to aſſume the Name and Government without
him; that, for this, ſhe deſerved not to be heard in any
thing; yet, being deſirous to ſhew a Fatherly affection, if
ſhe would renounce her pretenſions, and refer her ſelf wholly
to his free diſpoſition, he will do whatſoever may be done with
the honour of the Apoſtolick See.</p>
            <p>But the new Queen underſtanding the Pope's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and wondering at the mans haſty diſpoſition,
thought it not profitable, either for her, or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to treat any more with him. So that, the cauſe
ceaſing, ſhe gave the Nobility leave to conſult what
was fit to be done for the ſervice of God, and quiet of
the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>A Diſputation was held in <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> in preſence
of all the States, between Learned men, choſen on
both ſides, which began the laſt of <hi>March,</hi> and laſted
until the thirtieth of <hi>April:</hi> and, a Parliament being
aſſembled to this end, all the Edicts of Religion made
by <hi>Mary</hi> were aboliſhed, thoſe of her Brother <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62897:20"/>
reſtored, obedience taken away from the Pope,
the title of the Head of the Church of <hi>England</hi> given
to the Queen, the revenues of the Monaſteries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fifcated,
and aſſigned ſome to the Nobility, and
ſome to the Crown, the images taken out of the
Churches by the people, and the Roman Religion
baniſhed.</p>
            <p>Another accident happened alſo: For in the Diet
of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> it appearing by the Acts of the Colloquie,
the year before diſſolved without fruit, that there
was no hope to do any good by that means, <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
told them he would procure the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to be reſtored, exhorting all to ſubmit themſelves
to the Decrees thereof, as being the way to remove
differences. The Proteſtants anſwered, that they
would conſent to a Council, called, not by the Pope,
but by the Emperor, to be held in <hi>Germany,</hi> in which
the Pope ſhould not preſide, but ſhould ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the judgment thereof, and releaſe the Biſhops
and Divines of their Oath; in which alſo the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
ſhould have a deciding voice, and all ſhould be
determined according to the holy Scriptures, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
was concluded in <hi>Trent,</hi> ſhould be re-examined:
which, if it cannot be obtained of the Pope, yet the
Peace of Religion ſhould be confirmed, according to
the agreement of <hi>Paſſau,</hi> having known by too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
experience, that no good can be drawn from any
Popiſh Council. The Emperor knowing the difficulty
to obtain of the Pope a grant of the things propoſed,
and that now he had no means to negotiate with him,
in regard of the Controverſy about the Reſignation of
<hi>Charles,</hi> and his Succeſſion, he confirmed the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62897:21"/>
of <hi>Paſſau,</hi> and the <hi>Receſſes</hi> of the Diets follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The Pope having cut off all means to treat with
the Emperor and <hi>Germany,</hi> knew not what to ſay to
this. Yet he was more diſpleaſed with their diſcourſe
concerning the Council, than with the liberty granted
by the <hi>Receſs,</hi> being reſolute not to call any Council
but in <hi>Rome,</hi> whatſoever ſhould happen.</p>
            <p>In this reſpect another accident was as grievous as
the former, that is, the Peace made at <hi>Cambray</hi> the
third of <hi>April,</hi> between the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spain,</hi> which was well confirmed by the Marriages of
the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
of his Siſter to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> In which Peace,
among other Capitulations, it was agreed, that both
the Kings ſhould make a faithful promiſe to labour
joyntly that the Council ſhould be Celebrated, the
Church Reformed, and the differences of Religion
Compoſed.</p>
            <p>The Pope conſidered how goodly a ſhew the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Reformation, and the name of a Council did
make; that <hi>England</hi> was loſt, and all <hi>Germany</hi> alſo,
partly by the Proteſtants, and partly by his differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> that theſe two united Kings
were much offended by him, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by deeds
and words, the <hi>French</hi> by words at the leaſt, and
there remained none to whom he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.
Theſe cogitations did ſo afflict the Old Pope,
that he was unfit to rule. He could not hold the
Conſiſtories ſo often as he was wont, and when he
did hold them, he ſpent the moſt part of the time
in ſpeaking of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and exhorting the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62897:21"/>
to favour it, as being the only way to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
Hereſies.</p>
            <p>But the two Kings did not agree to procure the
Council for any ill will or intereſts, which either
of them had againſt the Pope or Papacy, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
againſt the new Doctrines which did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
encreaſe, being willingly heard, and received
by all men of Conſcience: and, which was of more
importance, the male-contented put themſelves on
that ſide, and did daily, under pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
make ſome Enterpriſes, as well in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi>
as in <hi>France,</hi> in regard thoſe people did
love their liberty, and had commerce with <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
as bordering upon it. In the beginning of
the troubles ſome ſeeds were ſown, which that
they might not take root, the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth, in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and the French
King in his Kingdom, made many Edicts, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
divers Executions. But after that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Proteſtants did encreaſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the
Evangelicks did multiply among the <hi>Suiſses,</hi> and
the ſeparation was made in <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of
the often Wars between the Emperour and French
King, either Party was forced to call in Auxiliaries
out of theſe three Nations, who publickly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and preaching the Reformed Religion in their
quarters, by their example, and by other means,
divers of the people became of their Religion.
And although in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> from the firſt
Edict of <hi>Charles,</hi> until this time of the Peace, there
were hanged, beheaded, buried alive, and burned
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62897:22"/>
to the number of fifty thouſand, and very many put
to death in <hi>France,</hi> yet both places were then in
worſe caſe than ever. This made the Kings to
think joyntly of finding a remedy.</p>
            <p>The Pope, as he was much diſcontented with the
Progreſs of the new Doctrine in the States of both the
Kings, ſo he was pleaſed that thoſe Princes did think
of it; and moved them by his <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ii</hi> to do ſo
ſtill. But he would not have any other means than
that of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which he thought the only
remedy, as he ſaid upon all occaſions, judging that
the Council would do as formerly it had done, that
is, reduce all into a worſe ſtate.</p>
            <p>While he was poſſeſſed with theſe cogitations,
and weak of body, the King of <hi>France</hi> died the
ſecond of <hi>July,</hi> by a wound in the eye, running at
<hi>Tilt;</hi> for which he ſeemed very ſorrowful, and was
ſo indeed. For although he ſuſpected, and with
reaſon, the intelligence between the two Kings, yet
he had ſtill hopes to ſeparate them. But the one
being dead, he ſaw he was at the diſcretion of the
other alone, whom he more feared, becauſe he was
more offended by him, and was of a more cloſe
nature, hard to be ſounded. He feared alſo, that
in <hi>France</hi> a gate would be ſet wide open to let in
Sects, which might be confirmed before the new
King could get ſo much wiſdom and reputation, as
was neceſſary to oppoſe ſo great difficulties. He
lived ſome few daies, afflicted with theſe cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but now laying aſide all hopes, which had
until then kept him alive, he died the eighteenth of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62897:22"/>
               <hi>Auguſt,</hi> recommending to the Cardinals nothing but
the Offic<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> the only means, as he
