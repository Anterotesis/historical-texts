            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have fully conſidered what you have been pleaſed to offer to me in yours concerning the Convocation now met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Alterations intended to be made therein in the preſent Offices, Rites and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Church, and all what you ſay I apprehend to be reducible to theſe three heads: 1. <hi>That no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought at all to be made in things pertaining to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but when there is a very great neceſſity for it.</hi> 2. <hi>That at preſent there is no ſuch neceſſity for the alterations inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And,</hi> 3. <hi>That, if there were, this is no time for it, when ſo many of the Fathers of our Church, and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons of the Clergy do now by their ſuſpenſion ſtand incapacitated to act with us in this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt, I readily grant what you ſay, That nothing is more dangerous to Religion, than frequently to make alterations in the things pertaining thereto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an unſteadineſs as to theſe, although in outward circumſtantials onely, which are always alterable, may to many become an argument againſt the whole. For there being multitudes among us who are not able to diſtinguiſh between what is circumſtantial and what is eſſential in our Worſhip, what is in the power of the Church to alter, and what is not, and are apt to call every alteration though in things merely indifferent,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93455:3"/>
and which the variation of times have made totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant to the firſt end of their eſtabliſhment, to be a change of the Religion it ſelf; and therefore concluding that we have no firm bottom at all for that which they ſee us ſo often vary from, may from hence be induced to caſt off all regard both for our Church and the Worſhip of God eſtabliſhed therein, and become Apoſtates from us either to Popery or Atheiſm all their life after. For the prevention whereof I readily grant what you ſay, That ſuch alterations ought not to be attempted but when there is an abſolute neceſſity for them. And therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be juſtifyed in her Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings hitherto, that ſhe hath not been forward on every demand of the Diſſenters to unhinge thoſe of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from her long received eſtabliſhments, but hath to the utmoſt reſiſted all alterations from them, hoping by other leſs dangerous methods to cure the diſtractions and heal the diviſions that are among us. But when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her utmoſt tryal of all other ways they have all proved ineffectual to attain the end propoſed, and the Church hath ſtill grown weaker and weaker, and thoſe that diſſent from it ſtill ſtronger and ſtronger under all thoſe attempts which have been made uſe of for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting them to us, ſo that now we are brought to that paſs, that without coming to a temper with them, and abating ſomething on our ſide for the ſake of peace and union with them, we cannot have that proſpect as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly of ſupporting the Church of God and maintaining the Honour of his Worſhip with ſucceſs among us. I think now to make ſuch alterations as are propoſed a thing ſo abſolutely neceſſary as ought not any longer to be deferr'd. And this I hope I ſhall be able clearly to convince you of in anſwer to your ſecond head of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, from theſe following reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93455:3"/>For, firſt, There lyes an indiſpenſable obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to doe the utmoſt we are able to remove this miſchievous Schiſm, from among us, which hath ſo long diſturb'd the Church of Chriſt in this Land. How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial this hath been to the Honour of God and the Salvation of Men, and how advantageous to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Popery and Atheiſm, and the propagating alſo of all manner of iniquity among us, is that which by wofull experience is too well known unto you to need a deſcription: And all this evil moſt certainly muſt lye at our doors as far as we doe not the utmoſt that in us lyeth to remove it, and what other way is there now left of attempting it but by coming to ſome terms of moderation and temper with thoſe that diſſent from us. We have already tryed all methods of perſuaſion to mollifie them, all force of argumentation to convince them; we have tryed alſo Church Cenſures and Penal Laws, and inflicted them too with a ſeverity perchance beyond what we can juſtifie; and what have we avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our ſelves of all this, but onely to heighten the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and increaſe the miſchief which we endeavoured to remove; and therefore what other remedy is now left us, what other means for us to have recourſe to for the curing of this prevailing evil among us, but that, as far as we are able we abate of that which hath given the whole origin thereto; thoſe excepted paſſages in our Liturgy, and thoſe ceremonies in our Worſhip which our diſſenting Brethren cannot conform with us in. And for this the late Act of Toleration hath added a very preſſing neceſſity. For when our diviſions ran ſo high, and our animoſities againſt each other ſo far increaſed as that Diſſenters were driven by them to take ſhelter from us in the Camp of our common Enemy, and join with the Papiſts againſt us to the endangering both of Church and State to utter ruin. The Parliament then thought
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93455:4"/>
it time to provide for the publick Safety by reconciling thoſe men thereto by an Act of Toleration and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, whereby they being now put upon as good a bottom of legal right and protection as we our ſelves, there is no other way left us of coming to a union with them but by following the ſame ſteps which the State hath gone in before us, and by condeſcenſion and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to reconcile thoſe men unto us: For they are now no more in our power to force them to a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with us than we are in theirs, and therefore they being on equal terms with us of right and protection from the Government under which we live, treaty and mutual abatement is the onely method now whereby we can be brought to a union with each other; and why we ſhould not abate for the ſake of this which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with it a promiſe of ſo great good and benefit to the Church of Chriſt among us, I would deſire a reaſon from him that is able to give it. For what are thoſe things which we differ about, that we muſt for ever ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to them the peace both of Church and State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abating the leaſt tittle for ſo great a good as that of the common union of Chriſtians among us? are a few excepted paſſages in our Liturgy, and two or three cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in our Worſhip things of ſo great value that we muſt for the ſake of them ſtill maintain thoſe diſcords and diviſions both in Church and State which have ſo long haraſſed both almoſt to utter ruine? Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that we have had already a twenty years War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them? and, is it not enough, that ever ſince our deliverance from that, for the ſake of thoſe trifles, we have for theſe thirty years laſt paſt driven up our diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and animoſities againſt each other to that height as that we had almoſt totally given up our Church to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and our Government to Tyranny thereby? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, after all this, it's time to ſit down and conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93455:4"/>
thoſe things are of ſuch great value for the ſake of which we bring ſo much miſchief to this poor diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Church and Nation, that nothing muſt be abated of that unreaſonable rigor whereby we have hitherto main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them. And if the conſideration of things paſt cannot move us, I beſeech you, conſider a little the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſture of our affairs; we have a formidable Enemy in our neighbourhood now engaged in War againſt us, who thinks of nothing leſs than ſubjugating theſe three Kingdoms to his abſolute Tyranny, and impoſing Popiſh Idolatry and Superſtition upon all the Inhabitants of them; and that which gives him the greateſt advantage againſt us, and the greateſt hopes for our deſtruction is, our diviſions among our ſelves at home which enfeeble both our hearts and hands for the battel, and make us unable to reſiſt him with that ſucceſs which formerly uſed to attend moſt of our other expeditions againſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies altogether as potent; and what remedy have we left to prevent this terrible ruin that now ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly threatens us, but to come to as firm a union among our ſelves as we are able? and could but this be once happily effected, we need not fear all the power of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> in the firmeſt union againſt us; but ſhould be ſtrong enough to reſiſt all their efforts for our ruin; and, by the bleſſing of God, ſtill continue in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in ſpight of all the endeavours of both to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And ſince it hath pleaſed God to move the King to call us together in Convocation in this conjuncture, I hope we ſhall not let ſlip this opportunity of doing the utmoſt we are able to unite the Nation now our affairs do ſo much require it for the publick ſafety thereof. For the expectations of all men are now upon us for this purpoſe, and the hopes of preſerving Church and State in the great dangers under which they are now both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd, do in a great meaſure depend upon what we ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93455:5"/>
doe for our common Peace now met together and put in a way to remove thoſe obſtacles which have ſo long diſturbed it. Have we not already loſt our reputation with the people of the Land by inſiſting too rigorouſly on thoſe things? And now we have in a great meaſure again retriev'd it by our firm and ſucceſsfull engagement againſt the Popiſh cauſe, ſhall we be ſo far infatuated as again to run the ſame risk? will we but now come to that temper and moderation in our eſtabliſhments as may remove that bone of contention which hath ſo long diſturbed us, and think of ſuch abatements as may tend to the ſetling of Peace and Union among us, the mouths of all this people ſhall bleſs us, and we ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thereby that veneration and regard among them that they ſhall all look on us as the onely faithfull Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds whoſe voice they are to hear, and we thereby be enabled to diſcharge the duties of our Miniſtry among them with that comfort to our ſelves and benefit to them as ſhall ſoon fix our Church upon a foundation never more to be ſhaken by any of its Enemies. But if on the contrary we ſtill perſiſt in our old rigor, and abate no expreſſion in our Liturgy, nor ceremony in our Worſhip, for the ſake of ſo great a good; for my part, I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing leſs than that we become abhorr'd of the whole Nation, as the common Enemies of its peace, and be treated accordingly in every Pariſh where we live among them. Were thoſe matters in which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements are deſired of us by our diſſenting Brethren things of that moment that they either carried with them the force of a divine Inſtitution, or were of their own nature ſo neceſſary to our Worſhip that either the Honour of God or the Intereſt of man's Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould ſuffer the leaſt prejudice by their omiſſion, it would become us then, whatever the Conſequences ſhould be, to ſtick to them to the utmoſt, and with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93455:5"/>
the ſame conſtancy as formerly the ancient Chriſtians did againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> not yield a letter to them to end the whole controverſie between us. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what our learned Prolocutor hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his Latin Speech to the Convocation to ſuggeſt, this is by no means our preſent caſe. For what Article of Faith, what neceſſary requiſite of our Worſhip is it in which any alterations are at all intended to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this preſent Convocation? if he knows of any ſuch, he would doe well to diſcover them, and when they come to be offered, oppoſe them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſh But, alas, the alterations intended, how great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions ſoever they may meet with, are ſo far from touching upon any thing of this nature, that I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, and he himſelf well knows it, as being one of the Commiſſion, where they are prepared, that they are onely in thoſe indifferent things, which have through all ages of the Church from the beginning been ever allowed to be alterable, whenſoever the good of the Church ſhould require it. And therefore ſince at preſent (as I have ſhown) not onely the good of the Church in order to the eſtabliſhment of its peace among us, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the publick intereſt of the State too in order to its preſervation in its preſent exigencies do ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that thoſe alterations ſhould be made, why do we ſo obſtinately ſtick at thoſe matters, whereby not onely the cauſe of God in the welfare of his Church, but our own alſo in the publick intereſt of the Nation, is ſo greatly prejudiced by us? As it is a great errour in ſome of our diſſenting Brethren to allow nothing law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be made uſe of in our publick Worſhip but what they find particular warrant for in Scripture, ſo is it no leſs a miſtake in us to hold any thing of this nature not preſcribed there to be unalterable. For our Saviour having given us his divine Law, and therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93455:6"/>
other Precepts, commanded in the Worſhip of God, the Celebration of his Sacraments, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church for the better influencing of every member of it to all the duties enjoined, for this very reaſon deſcended not to preſcribe the particular manner, rites and conſtitutions which his Church after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made uſe of in the performance of all this, becauſe it was impoſſible that any unalterable rule could at all be given of thoſe matters. For the reaſon of theſe being only decency and order in the Church of God, and to be as helps therein the better to influence the minds of men to the performance of the Divine Commands muſt neceſſarily be of their own nature variable, according as to the different variations of times, circumſtances and the cuſtoms of men they more or leſs become capable of anſwering the end deſign'd, and therefore have ever been in the power of the Church to conſtitute, alter and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them according as the honour of God, the good of his Church and the intereſt of Religion might be beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted thereby. As long therefore as theſe Forms of Prayer which are uſed in our Church, and thoſe Rites and Conſtitutions which are received therein do anſwer the end of their firſt eſtabliſhment in being uſefull to the promoting the honour of God and the edification of his people, ſo long they ought with conſtancy always to be retained; but when either the infirmity or the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, or any other cauſe hath made that alteration in the Times, and in the humours and cuſtoms of thoſe that live in them, that theſe things inſtead of conducing any longer to that good end propoſed, do on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry adminiſter only to Schiſm and Diviſion in the Church, and to diſtraction and diſcord in the State, whereby the peace of both is miſerably diſturb'd, as is too manifeſtly our caſe; from hence there ariſeth a reaſon altogether as ſtrong for their alteration, as ever there was at firſt for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93455:6"/>
their inſtitution. Were they become only uſeleſs and no longer anſwered their end, this would be a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alone for an alteration in them, but when over and above they become miſchievous too in the evils that they bring both upon Church and State this adds an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, which cannot I think without guilt be reſiſted, of coming to a change in theſe matters.</p>
            <p>And to come to the particular things controverted between us, I readily aſſent that the Croſs in Baptiſm had a very good reaſon for its firſt inſtitution: For when in the primitive times the Heathens made it a matter of conſtant reproach to the Chriſtians, that they worſhipped a crucified God, they for this reaſon appointed the Croſs after Baptiſm to be thenceforth put as a Badge upon all whom they received into the Church, to let them know, that they ought not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed hereof. And I doubt not but that it was of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe in thoſe times to fortifie the minds of Chriſtians with that conſtancy and reſolution as was requiſite to bear them up againſt the ſcoffs and reproaches of their Heathen Adverſaries amongſt whom they lived. But now Heatheniſm hath ſo many Ages ſince been totally extinguiſhed in thoſe parts of the World, and we live in a State which is totally Chriſtian, ſo that the Croſs of Chriſt is no longer liable of being objected to us as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by any, it cannot be denied but that this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony hath now totally loſt its uſe, and although it might innocently enough be ſtill retain'd, yet may it with as much innocency alſo be totally laid aſide now the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of times have made it wholly uſeleſs to the end for which it was firſt deſigned. But in our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when it is become not only uſeleſs but alſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to the cauſe of Chriſt by reaſon of the Diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Schiſms which it occaſions in his Church, and is thereby inſtead of a badge of Union and Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93455:7"/>
under the banner of the Captain of our Salvation, as was firſt intended, become an Enſign of war to make us fight againſt each other, and a Croſs of torment thereon again to crucifie the Lord of life in his body the Church, and rent its bowels aſunder by thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable diviſions which it cauſeth among us; in this caſe I think we have an obligation upon us not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from the abſolute neceſſity of the thing, either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to lay this Ceremony aſide, or elſe make ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements concerning its uſe, as may allay all theſe heats of contention and miſchiefs of ſeparation which have been cauſed in the Church of Chriſt thereby. And I here plainly aver that the Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot be guiltleſs in this matter, if ſhe doth not on this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, now put into her hands by this preſent mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Convocation, doe ſomething herein, and that eſpecially ſince by an unwary expreſſion in her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, wherein ſhe hath explained this Ceremony to be that whereby the perſon baptized is dedicated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe hath wrongfully attributed thereto the ſacramental effect which belongs to Baptiſm onely, and thereby adminiſtred a great part of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to all the diviſions which have been riſen about it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Surplice I am ſufficiently ſatisfied that nothing is more unreaſonable than thoſe Cavils which are riſen againſt it. For it is onely an habit of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Miniſter for the ſake of order and decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy makes uſe of in the execution of his Function in the ſame manner as is practiſed in all other Offices and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of men, and thoſe that except againſt it may as well except againſt the Robes of a Judge on the Bench, or the Gown of a Mayor when he preſides in his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, it being altogether as reaſonable that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould be diſtinguiſhed by a proper habit in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Office, as they in theirs. But when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93455:7"/>
through the malice of ſome in working ſtrange objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it into the minds of men, and the weakneſs of others in receiving and believing them, it is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo great a ſtumbling-block of offence as to drive multitudes to forſake our Churches, and be diſaffected to the Worſhip of God which is performed in them; whatſoever was the reaſon of its firſt appointment, ſure I am that from hence there is a much greater totally to lay it aſide, and appoint another that may be leſs offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in its ſtead. The Union of the Church and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which the Souls of men may receive thereby being certainly things of far greater moment than to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to ſo trivial a matter as that of a Garment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Kneeling at the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is a poſture ſo proper to that Holy Ordinance, that of all the Conſtitutions of our Church, this is the laſt I ſhould be willing to part with; becauſe I think the higheſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Devotion is that which is always moſt natural for us to be in when we are receiving from Chriſt ſo great and ineſtimable Benefits as thoſe which are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out unto us in that Holy Myſtery. But ſince the weakneſs of many who are good and well meaning men have been ſo far impoſed on by ſeveral fallacious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they have not skill enough to ſee through, as to think it ſinfull to receive in this poſture, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Table of the Lord becomes deſerted, and the Souls of many deprived of the benefit of that Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Food which is adminiſtred thereon, contrary to the intention of our Saviour, who hath by no means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred us on any ſuch account as this to debar men from Communion, and deprive them thereby of thoſe Benefits of Salvation which we are ſent to adminiſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, it is time for us now to abate of our rigor in this matter; and when we are not able to bring men up by reaſon of their weakneſs to the Conſtitutions of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93455:8"/>
the Church, be ſo far indulgent as to deſcend to them, and give them the Sacrament in their own way, rather than for the ſake of a poſture onely debar them of the Benefits which their Souls may receive thereby; and to doe otherwiſe I doubt will not onely be a Sin againſt Chriſtian Charity, in prejudicing the Salvation of many, but alſo be an abuſe of the Commiſſion intruſted with us. For I can by no means be perſuaded that Chriſt hath given us the power of the Keys to ſhut out thoſe from the Benefits of this Sacrament who in all other reſpects being good and righteous men, have onely this weakneſs, that they cannot comply with us in receiving thereof in that poſture which the Church preſcribes, and for which it hath no other warrant but its own Conſtitutions. For how fitting a poſture ſoever Kneeling may be for the receiving of this Sacrament, this muſt undeniably be allowed, that neither Scripture directs it, nor Antiquity ever uſed it; it having been for ſeveral ages after Chriſt the conſtant practice of all the Churches in the World to communicate Standing, and why this may not again by a particular diſpenſation from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtabliſhment be allowed to weak and ſcrupulous perſons for the ſake of peace and union with them, I can ſee no reaſon that ſavours either of a Chriſtian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Chriſtian Charity that can be ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the Liturgy of our Church I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and I think no man can contradict me herein, that it i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the beſt which was ever yet uſed in any Chriſtian Church, but that it ſhould therefore be ſo perfect as not to be capable of amendments or alterations for the better doth by no means follow. For nothing of humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure can be ſuch, eſpecially in a thing of this nature, where proceſs of time and alteration of circumſtances frequently produce a neceſſity for correction, as moſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93455:8"/>
certainly in our Liturgy they very often doe. For the language in which it is wrote being conſtantly <hi>in fluxu,</hi> as all other living languages are, in every age ſome words that were in uſe in the former grow obſolete, and ſome phraſes and expreſſions formerly in grace and faſhion through difuſe become uncouth and ridiculous, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to continue theſe in our Liturgy without correction would be to bring a diſparagement upon the whole, and expoſe to contempt the worſhip of God among us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there are ſeveral things which in one age may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to devotion, which through variation of times and circumſtances may not be born in another; ſeveral things which may be the proper matter of Prayer at one time which may not be ſo in another, and all thoſe things call for alterations and amendments whenever they happen. And therefore I am ſo far from aſſenting with ſome of our Brethren in this particular, that our Liturgy ought not to be altered, that I think it abſolutely neceſſary from the abovementioned particulars that it be always at leaſt once in 30 years brought to a review for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And I am ſure this hath been the judgment of the whole Chriſtian Church from the beginning till this time. The Greek Church hath ſo often altered as to this, and made ſo many different forms of their Liturgies, that a Collection of them in a late Auction amounted to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Volumes; and the Latin Church who brag moſt of their conſtancy in theſe matters have rather exceeded than come behind them herein, as in the old Manuſcripts of their Liturgies will ſufficiently appear to any that will take the pains to look into them. Nay they were ſo far from continuing one age in conformity with another herein, that they obſerved none at all in this matter, but almoſt every Province had its different Liturgy, and it's well known that there were five different forms of them in this Kingdom till the Reformation, and the like was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93455:9"/>
alſo practiſed in other parts of the Latin or Romiſh Church, and a general Agreement as to this was then ſo far from being thought neceſſary, That the Act of King <hi>Edward</hi> the VIth was the firſt Law for a uniform Liturgy in any Church that was ever enacted from the beginning of Chriſtianity to that time. But neither did that exclude all varying from it in after times. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy that was firſt eſtabliſhed in that King's reign, within a very little while after underwent a review, which produced very conſiderable alterations in it. And when Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> came to the Crown many others were made therein. And thoſe who compute the late altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions decreed in the Convocation of 1662. tell us they amount to the number of 400. And why we onely of this preſent time ſhould be debarred the privilege of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering our ſelves in this matter, which all other times of the Church before us have enjoyed, I would fain know a reaſon. Thus far ſure I am that no time had ever more need to make uſe of it for the publick good than this in which we now live. For the Exigences of the State call loudly upon us to doe that herein which may tend to its ſafety, and the peace of the Church and the intereſt of Religion plead as hard on the other hand to the ſame purpoſe, for the removing of animoſities and diviſions, and the reſtoring of Union and Charity among us. And what can we ſay for our ſelves if we continue deaf as to all this? But to come to the Liturgy it ſelf; are there not many things in it which with ſome ſhew of reaſon our diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren except againſt? and are there not many more which we our ſelves heartily wiſh might be amended and improved? certainly, were there no other reaſon to induce us to comply with our Brethren that diſſent from us, in making ſuch alterations as would ſatisfie them, I ſhould think this a very ſufficient one, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93455:9"/>
that we have an opportunity given us at the ſame time alſo to gratifie our ſelves in ſuch further alterations and improvements which we our ſelves deſire. For muſt the Story of <hi>Tobit</hi> and his Dog and that of <hi>Bell</hi> and the Dragon always ſupplant Canonical Scripture in our Churches, and we be forced to read ſuch ridiculous things to our people inſtead of the Word of God? muſt we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be forced to read the old Tranſlation of the Pſalms, and impoſe that on the people for true Scripture, which in ſo great a number of places quite differs from it? muſt we always be forced in our addreſſes to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty with a flattery not to be warranted, to call eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry King that reigns over us moſt Religious, though the whole tenor of his life may be quite the contrary; and pray that he may be kept and ſtrengthned in the true worſhipping of God, though openly profeſſing ſo falſe a worſhip as that of Popery? And muſt we alſo be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſtill to put that abuſe upon the power of the Keys committed to our charge, as to excommunicate, and thereby thruſt out of our Churches ſometimes the beſt of our people for being right or wrong overthrown in ſome penny or twopenny Cauſe in our Eccleſiaſtical Courts? And muſt we always be neceſſitated to pronounce all damn'd that do not believe every tittle in <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Creed which ſo few do underſtand; and on the contrary to declare every man ſav'd at his burial how wickedly ſoever he liv'd all his life before? And muſt we always be bound to many other grievances and defects of this nature, which I could tell you of, and ſtill deny our ſelves all redreſs under the burden of them, by refuſing all thoſe deſirable alterations and improvements which are now in our own power to effect, becauſe ſome of our Brethren are obſtinately bent to doe nothing for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of thoſe that diſſent from us? In ſumm, it cannot be denied, but that there are many things in our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93455:10"/>
Liturgy which may be amended and improved, many defects in our Diſcipline and Conſtitutions which may be ſupplied, and abundance of other particulars in our Church which may receive a great advance for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabling us to promote Religion and Piety, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſin and iniquity among us. And ſince the King and Parliament are now ſo well inclined to comply with us in all theſe particulars, which we have ſo often laboured for in vain in other times, provided that we will on our ſide doe what juſtly we may to ſatisfie our diſſenting Brethren for the ſake of peace and union among us, which the neceſſities of our preſent circumſtances doe ſo much require for our common ſafety; it is a barter of that advantage on our ſide, that none I think can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe that have any regard to the honour of God, the good of his Church, or the true intereſt of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</p>
            <p>But to all what I have ſaid I very well know many objections will be made, which I daily hear from thoſe who are of your opinion in this matter. The firſt is, That altering any thing in this now conſtituted Church will be like the plucking of a Beam out of a well built Houſe, and that it cannot be done without endangering the whole Fabrick. To this I anſwer, If all had been of this mind we could never have reformed from Popery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Argument would have been as ſtrong againſt all alterations then as now; but I thank God we alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the better then, and ſtill preſerv'd our Church, and therefore I hope we may be able to doe ſo ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice thereto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is objected, If we once begin to alter, where ſhall we ſtop? To this I anſwer, Whenſoever any thing is propoſed to us which is not fit to be done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's objected, If we yield now, they will ſtill be craving more, and never reſt till at laſt they have taken
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93455:10"/>
all from us. To which I anſwer, When they doe this, then it will be time enough to reſiſt them; in the <hi>interim</hi> let us not refuſe them what is juſt and ſitting for us to grant them, leſt thereby we make good the old Saying, <hi>Omnia dat qui juſta negat</hi>; and we give them an advantage againſt us, by our obſtinate rigor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt yielding any thing, to get that power on their ſide which may deprive us of all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It's objected, That ſome of thoſe alterations which they require are in things as ancient as the Primitive Church, from which we ought not to vary, as may be inſtanced in the Croſs in Baptiſm. To which I anſwer, That we are not bound to retain all things that were uſed in the Primitive Church. For if ſo, why have we not ſtill their Love-feaſts and their Deaconeſſes, which have been long ſince diſuſed in all Chriſtian Churches, and yet the mention of them is as ancient as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves. For in truth it is not ancient uſage, but the neceſſities and exigencies of the Church that are the reaſons of all its conſtitutions and eſtabliſhments, which are to be framed in every Age as will beſt ſute with the promoting of the honour of God, and the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his People, to which abundance of things might very well ſerve in the primitive times, which will not now; and therefore to ſay, that what was in uſe, in the primitive times muſt be retained now for this reaſon onely without any other to enforce it is juſt the ſame as if we were bound to revive all the old <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Laws, becauſe they were the ancient Conſtitutions of this Land, without conſidering whether they are uſefull to us or no.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth Objection is, That it will be a reproach to change. To which I anſwer, That it will be a much greater reproach obſtinately to reſiſt a change when there is good reaſon for it. And therefore I cannot approve
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93455:11"/>
the confidence of that Gentleman, who hath lift up his banner againſt the whole intent and deſign of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, with a <hi>Nolumus Leges</hi> Angliae <hi>mutare.</hi> For doth he think we are bound never to make any new Conſtitutions in our Church, or aboliſh old ones, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the exigencies of it doe require? If ſo, why have we any Convocations at all? for is not the whole intent and reaſon of theſe aſſemblies of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of this Church, to conſider its grievances and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the ſame manner as the Parliament doth thoſe of the State, and from time to time, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, provide remedies for them, and that by aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old Conſtitutions, as well as by decreeing new ones? and hath not the Church ever aſſerted this power as one of the moſt eſſential things which belong to its Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? and muſt it now renounce all this for the ſake of this Gentleman's <hi>motto?</hi> and now, in this critical time, when its ſafety doth ſo much depend upon what it ſhall doe for it ſelf, rather ſit quietly down and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh to death, than make the leaſt motion of effort to ſave it ſelf. If this be it which this Gentleman would have, we have no reaſon to thank him either for his Speech or his <hi>Motto,</hi> the laſt of which, I ſuppoſe, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him beſt, becauſe it carried a double ſtab with it, the one againſt the Church, and the other againſt him that was his greateſt benefactor to promote him in it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſixth Objection is, That we have no reaſon to alter any thing for the ſake of Diſſenters, becauſe the fault of our diviſions is not from any Conſtitutions of ours, but from their obſtinacy and perverſeneſs in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably diſſenting from them. To which I anſwer, That I acknowledge all this to be true, that it is not the Church which is the Cauſe of our diviſions by any of its conſtitutions or impoſitions, which are all rational and good, but they onely who refuſe to conform to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93455:11"/>
them. But it doth not follow therefore, that when nothing elſe will remove the diviſions now raiſed among us on the account of theſe things, or again reduce Diſſenters to the Unity of the Church, but ſome alterations in them, (which without the leaſt prejudice to our Church, or the Worſhip of God therein we may lawfully make) it may not be a great fault in us now to be over obſtinate in theſe matters, and that we ought not rather when there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us ſo great a good, as the Peace of the Church and the Salvation of ſo many therein (which it's to be fear'd may be too much obſtructed by theſe diviſions) be ready to comply with them as far as lawfully we may for the ſake hereof. For they being the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>k and the infirm whom we are ſent to heal, our part to them muſt be that of a Phyſician, who, when he finds his Patient, through that peeviſhneſs which is commonly incident to the ſick, obſtinately refuſe an wholſom medicine which he preſcribes him, doth not for this reaſon immediately caſt off all care of him, but thinks of ſomething elſe more agreeable to his palate and humour, that may doe as well.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſeventh Objection is, If we make thoſe alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and ſo often change, how ſhall we anſwer the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who will upbraid us with it? To this I anſwer, As well as we did in the firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in 1662. or, if this be an Objection, as well as they can us for their alterations by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the late reformation of their Maſs-books at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the laſt Pope's aboliſhing ſeveral Offices concerning the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. The eighth Objection is, We ſhall by theſe altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſſatisfie our own People. To which I anſwer, Why more now than in 1662. when all readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with and approved the like alterations? but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more noiſe is made of this Objection, than there is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93455:12"/>
truth or reaſon in it; perchance there may be ſome few ignorant and weak People, that may be over zealouſly affected to theſe matters among us, but they being our own, I hope are capable of being better inſtructed by us; than to think any of thoſe things in which the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are deſired ſo ſacred as not to be meddled with: For this is to attribute that to the appointments of men, which is due onely to the Divine inſtitutions, and is a ſinfull ſuperſtition, in which they ought by no means to be indulged, but are as to this to be corrected, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed by us, under whoſe care they are.</p>
            <p>And thu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> far having ſhewn you what neceſſity is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ent to the alterations that will be propoſed in this preſent Convocation, from the great obligation we have to remove the Sciſms and heal the Diviſions that are among us, I ſhall in the ſecond place ſhew you another reaſon of this necſſity from the promiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have obliged our ſelves ſo to doe. For the Biſhops, in their Petition to King <hi>James,</hi> promiſed that they would come to a temper with the Diſſenters, whenever put in a legal way, and this promiſe all the Clergy in the Land have ſeemed to approve of by owning that Petition in which it was contained, as they all plainly did who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to read that King's Declaration in compliance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and therefore now we are put in a legal way by being called together in Convocation, we are bound to make this Promiſe good. For hereby we have not only raiſed the expectations of the Diſſenters, but alſo of the whole Nation too, who are earneſt for the ſake of the publick good and peace of the Kingdom, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between us ſhould be compoſed; and if we doe nothing in complyance herewith, what can we expect, but that the general clamour of the People will be raiſed againſt us hereon, as a baſe and falſe ſort of men, who can promiſe fair in times of adverſity, and forget all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93455:12"/>
performances when they are over, and we become the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of every man hereon, I know the anſwer hereto is, that the Diſſenters will do nothing on their part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this temper, and that after all that we can doe on ours we cannot have aſſurance that any one of them will come over to us thereon, and therefore it will be in vain for us to proceed any further on this Project. To which I reply, Firſt, That it is by no means true that all Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſo averſe to a reconciliation with us, as this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuggeſts, for I know multitudes that on granting the alterations propoſed would moſt gladly come in and unite themſelves to us. That their Miniſters are not ſo forward as to this I believe to be true, becauſe they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many of them very beneficial Conventicles, where they have a more plentifull Income, greater reſpects, and a larger power than they can hope for in a Church Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, would rather for the ſake of ſelf intereſt continue as they are, and have no Comprehenſion at all, than to be brought into the Church thereby to their loſs. But with the People I know it will be otherwiſe, who will in large numbers come in to us as ſoon as thoſe alterations ſhall be in our Churches; and when they are once come off, it will not be long ere their Miniſters alſo will be forced to follow. But, Secondly, ſuppoſe it true, That no Diſſenter at all would be brought over to us by the Conceſſions propoſed, yet I ſay that we are ſtill bound as well by intereſt as duty to perform what we have promiſed: For by doing our part herein, firſt, we ſhall leave them without excuſe, if they be not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereon, and deliver our ſelves from abundance of their clamour, which we are now continually vexed with by them on this account. Secondly, we ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give ſatisfaction to the Nation, who expect this from us, and fix them thereby the more firmly to us. For ſay we what we will of the ſtrength and number of thoſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93455:13"/>
that are for us, let us not deceive our ſelves, As they that are zealous for the Diſſenters are no great number, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they that are zealous for us. The main body of the Nation I look on to ſtand indifferently affected both to them and us, and although they now come to our Churches, yet are they as ready to joyn alſo with them were they in the publick Miniſtry, as in the times of <hi>Cromwell</hi> hath been ſufficiently made appear. For they think not the Controverſie between us of that moment, and therefore cry loudly to us to agree, and take it very ill that ſuch diſcords and diviſions ſhould be ſtill maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Nation ſo much to the prejudice of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace and ſafety about ſuch trifling matters as they think them to be which we contend with each other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. And at preſent I muſt tell you they are readier to caſt the blame of all this rather on us than them becauſe they are now the ſuffering party. But if we do our part on this occaſion, and make all thoſe ſteps to peace and agreement which are propoſed, we ſhall not onely ſet our ſelves right with them as to this, but if the Diſſenters do not hereon come in and comply with us, they will ſo plainly manifeſt themſelves thereby to be a ſort of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and unreaſonable people, that the whole Nation ſhall condemn them and juſtifie us, and be thereby firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed on our ſide ever after. But on the contrary if we do not our part, but break our promiſes, and reject the preſent opportunity put into our hands of doing our beſt towards the reſtoring peace to this poor divided Church and Nation, which all now ſo earneſtly deſire, and the exigency of our preſent affairs do make ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for our ſafety, we ſhall ſo far loſe the people of the Land, and give our Adverſaries that advantage over us thereby, as I fear may become our total ruine.</p>
            <p>But, Thirdly, another reaſon there is which ſhews the neceſſity of our doing what is propos'd, becauſe if we do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93455:13"/>
not doe it moſt certainly the Parliament will. For it may be very well remembred, that in the laſt Seſſions the Bill paſt the Houſe of Lords in order hereto, and when it came down into the Houſe of Commons it was by their deſire that the matter was referred to us, and if we now do nothing in it, you may aſſure your ſelf the Parliament will reſume it again, and doe it their own way, and they have the whole thanks for it, and we onely the odium of the whole Nation for refuſing it. To prevent which let us not caſt the preſent opportunity out of our hands of doing the thing our ſelves: for we as Divines are beſt able to doe it as it ought without prejudice to the Church, whereas if we caſt it into the hands of Laymen, they may inſtead of altering Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials ſtrike at Eſſentials, and ſo make a breach upon the Religion it ſelf to the undoing of all. And although this ſhould be avoided, as I fear it will not in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars I could inſtance, as particularly in that of our Orders, yet the leaſt miſchief we can expect will be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to extinguiſh all Convocations for the future, and reſolve the whole power of the Church into the two Houſes of Parliament, and thereby perpetually fix that reproach of the Papiſts upon us, that our Religion is a Parliamentary Religion. And whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> is now met together onely to be <hi>felo de ſe</hi> is that which the Members of this preſent Convocation are ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired to conſider.</p>
            <p>But in anſwer to all this your third head of Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tells us, That how neceſſary ſoever this may be from the abovementioned Reaſons, yet this is no proper time for it, when ſo many of the Fathers of our Church, and other eminent perſons of the Clergy by their Suſpenſion ſtand incapacitated to act with us in this matter, and that becauſe if this be now done, when their conſent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had in the doing of it, they will renounce it all,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93455:14"/>
and by ſticking to the preſent Form create a new Schiſm among us, and thereby as great a breach be made in the Church on the one hand, as poſſibly can be made up on the other. And this I hear is a reaſon much inſiſted on to defeat the whole deſign and intent of this Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation But in anſwer hereto I muſt tell you thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſons are very little beholding to them that talk of them at this rate, there being nothing that can be a more bitter Libel againſt them. For is it poſſible to imagine that thoſe who have ſo eminently ſignalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed themſelves in the defence of the Church, and ſo readily yielded themſelves to be Confeſſors for it (as all well know in the late Reign) ſhould now on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den turn their hands againſt it to wound and deſtroy it, and all this onely out of a deſperate peeviſhneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſome infelicities at preſent upon them which none of us can help. Far be it from thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Fathers of the Church to become guilty of ſo great a wickedneſs againſt it, and I muſt tell you it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ever ſhould, whatſoever ſome men may talk hereof to ſerve their own purpoſe. For how can they who have ſo long<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> preached and wrote againſt Schiſm and the wickedneſs of it in ſeparating from the Church without a juſt cauſe, now become guilty hereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when there is no cauſe at all to drive them to it? Should we indeed put any thing either into our Liturgy or Conſtitutions, which is contrary either to the Doctrine or the Precepts of our Religion, I muſt confeſs then there would be reaſon for them to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and I my ſelf would make one of their number; but thoſe that are moſt hot againſt the deſign of this preſent Convocation do not tell us that any thing of this is likely to be done therein, and therefore we may ſuppoſe the Liturgy after its preſent review will have nothing of this therein, and that any then ſhould ſeparate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93455:14"/>
from us in that where they can find no fault to object is a thing that cannot be imagined, but of ſuch onely as are moſt perverſly bent againſt Reaſon and Conſcience to doe all the wickedneſs they can to gratifie a peeviſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. And therefore thoſe that talk after this rate of thoſe excellent and moſt Religious perſons have a great deal to anſwer for to them for the injury which they doe them by this ſlanderous and vile imputation. But ſince they will have it ſo we will for once (begging their pardon for doing ſo) ſuppoſe what they ſuggeſt to be true, that thoſe who are now of ſo tender a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in reference to the Oaths, will have none at all as to this which is a much plainer caſe, but go on in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all which we ſhall do in this preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to make that Schiſm which they would fright us with, the hurt will be ſo little which they will be able to doe us thereby, as that it will not need either to be feared or regarded by us. For their number is ſo ſmall, and the Proſelytes they are like to get ſo few, and the reſentments of the State will be ſo heavy upon them, as being enemies to them as well as us in this oppoſition, that they can no ſooner appear in the Schiſm which is talked ſo much of, but they muſt immediately be cruſh'd and fall to nothing, and therefore to talk of this as ſome do, in ſo formidable a manner for the obſtructing all the good intentions of this preſent Convocation, is a Scare-crow which Knaves may lift up, but none but Fools can be frighted therewith.</p>
            <p>And thus far having ſhewn you the neceſſity which urgeth us to doe what may become us in this preſent Convocation, methinks the caſe is ſo plain, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine from whence it is that the preſent oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ariſe, unleſs it be that ſome, when they hear of Reformation, are afraid of their Church power and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93455:15"/>
Church promotions. If this be the matter, as I doubt it is, that makes ſo many hang off from the publick good of the Church at this time, I deſire they would conſider whether they doe not take the moſt effectual courſe to bring that about which they fear. If by ſuch moderate abatements as are required we give ſatisfaction to the Nation, they will be the better inclined to bear with us in all things elſe, and make the continuance of our eſtabliſhments more laſting among them. But if on the contrary, by our refuſal, we provoke them againſt us, I know not but that, inſtead of that moderate and juſt reformation which they will now be contented with, they may take the matter into their own hands, and bring us to that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which we are ſo much afraid of, and deprive us of all. And of this we have a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Caſe of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Had they granted any moderate Conceſſions to the juſt demands of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and yielded them but ſome of thoſe things which are now a burthen to them, and which they would be gladly rid of, if they could with reputation, I doubt not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might have retained its power over the whole Latin Church till this time; but their jealouſie of this power making them rigorous to yield nothing, hath put them in the direct way to loſe all. And if we follow the ſame courſe, I doubt the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will enſue. In ſumm, ſuch bye ends are always moſt unjuſtifiable in Eccleſiaſtical Councils, in which no conſiderations of ſecular intereſt, but thoſe onely which may beſt tend to the Honour of God and the Salvation of men ought to influence all our determinations, and could we but all come together with this mind, I ſhould think our ſelves ſo ſure of the bleſſing of God upon all our endeavours, that I durſt promiſe you all the good ſucceſs from this Convocation that can be deſired, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever appearance there may at preſent be to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:93455:15"/>As to the account which you deſire of our Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings hitherto, I can onely tell you, that on Monday laſt we choſe our Prolocutor, and adjourned to this day, and are now again adjourned till Monday next, and then we expect to have our Commiſſion to act and fall to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. The firſt thing to be brought before us will be the reformation of the Kalendar, that is, whether the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal Leſſons ſhall be ſtruck out or no; and here I apprehend the main Queſtion will come to the debate, whether Alterations, or no Alterations: If the latter be carried, you will have your deſire, and I my liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to return home, where the old ſaying, <hi>Quos Deus perdet dementat,</hi> muſt neceſſarily have that influence upon my mind, as to make me fear our total ruin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be long behind after ſo great an infatuation; if it muſt be ſo, I am ſure our ſins have deſerved it, and God endue us with Patience to ſubmit thereto.
