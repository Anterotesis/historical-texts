            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The GROUNDS and OC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CASIONS of the CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEMPT of the CLERGY and RELIGION Enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; in a Letter Written to R. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that here is <hi>first,</hi> a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> Presupposed; with a <hi>search</hi> into The <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Occasions</hi> of it: and <hi>Then,</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:103632:3"/>
               <hi>Resolution</hi> upon the Question, Pag. <hi>3.</hi> That <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> are the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions</hi> of that <hi>Contempt.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, the Author of this <hi>Letter</hi> takes wonderful pains to <hi>Prove</hi> the <hi>Clergy contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> by Endeavouring to <hi>make</hi> them <hi>so.</hi> First, he dresses you up a <hi>Vicar</hi> in a <hi>Fools-Coat,</hi> with a <hi>Capons Feather</hi> in his Cap, and then laughs at him. But all this while; he tells us in his Preface, That <hi>he has a most solemn Reverence for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in General; and Especially for that of England.</hi> Now how to reconcile The <hi>Clergy</hi> in the <hi>Preface,</hi> with the <hi>Clergy</hi> in the
<pb facs="tcp:103632:3"/>
               <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>Title-Page,</hi> I cannot imagine; for he has a <hi>solemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> it seems, for the <hi>One,</hi> and A <hi>Contempt</hi> for the <hi>Other:</hi> Unless he will say, that he speaks of an <hi>Utopian Clergy, Before,</hi> and <hi>After;</hi> and of the <hi>English Clergy</hi> in the <hi>Middle;</hi> or that by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the <hi>Clergy</hi> with <hi>Restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But without more ado; It is the <hi>Generality</hi> of the <hi>English Clergy,</hi> that he is Pleased to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Beggers;</hi> And when he has framed to himself, out of <hi>Plays, Clubs, Old Stories, Phancy</hi> and <hi>Invention,</hi> a <hi>Pitiful, Comical, senceless Sir John,</hi> without either <hi>Brains, Mode,</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:103632:4"/>
               <hi>Money;</hi> This is it, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers over to the World for the <hi>Character</hi> of That <hi>Clergy.</hi> And it is as Pleasantly Drawn, as if <hi>Sir Roger</hi> himself had set for his Picture. We shall refer the <hi>Merit</hi> of the Cause to its Proper place, and only offer a word or two at Present, by way of <hi>Enquiry</hi> into the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Occasions</hi> of his <hi>Enquiry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does he make this <hi>Enquiry,</hi> for the Information of <hi>Himself,</hi> or of <hi>Others?</hi> If the <hi>former;</hi> why does he <hi>Publish</hi> it? If the <hi>latter;</hi> I would fain know, to what <hi>End,</hi> and with what <hi>design</hi> the Thing is done, unless it be to Vnhinge the Government. The
<pb facs="tcp:103632:4"/>
               <hi>first</hi> Point in Consideration, <hi>is This; Whether</hi> the <hi>Clergy be contemptible,</hi> or <hi>Not?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, most Naturally Follows, in the very next Place, <hi>This Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> Whether or no shall the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Believe</hi> their <hi>Teachers;</hi> and <hi>follow</hi> their <hi>Guides?</hi> For most undoubtedly, they will do, or not do, the one, and the other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion they have of them, or Reverence for them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: If he tells the People but What they knew before, he might have saved himself that Labour: But if he Pretends to a further discovery, It looks as if his Business were not so much to <hi>shew</hi> that the <hi>Clergy are contemptible,</hi> as to
<pb facs="tcp:103632:5"/>
Procure that they may be <hi>thought</hi> so; and in a word, to set up the <hi>Church</hi> for a <hi>Jack-a-Lent,</hi> for every Man to throw a Cudgel at: Especially considering that the whole Project is Carried on with the Spirit, and Liberty of a <hi>Farce;</hi> and <hi>Calculated,</hi> so Pat, to the <hi>Meridian</hi> of the <hi>Rabble;</hi> that if <hi>Merry Andrew</hi> had but hit upon it time Enough; 'Tis forty to one we should have seen the whole Story, ere this, in a Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet-Play. And why all this to the <hi>People?</hi> Alas! They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it, unless they should fall to their old Trade of Reformation again, and one would Think we have had Enough of that Already.
<pb facs="tcp:103632:5"/>
Nay, put the Case, that the <hi>Monkey-Tricks, Apes-faces,</hi> and <hi>Fooleries,</hi> which he fastens upon our <hi>Clergy,</hi> were all True; (The contrary whereof is as clear as the Sun) <hi>He's but an ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Child</hi> yet, <hi>that lays open the nakedness of his Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor indeed does the stress of this Imputation lie so heavy upon the <hi>Illiterate, Imprudent</hi> or <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous</hi> part of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as upon the <hi>Government</hi> it self. For, without dispute, those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creatures which he makes himself so merry withal, <hi>would</hi> be <hi>Wiser,</hi> and <hi>Wealthier</hi> if they <hi>could:</hi> But the Charge lies upon their <hi>Superiours,</hi> for <hi>Chusing</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103632:6"/>
and <hi>Providing</hi> no better: And this is no other than the old Trick over again, of wounding our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours through the sides of their Ministers; and tearing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment all to Pieces, under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of mending it.</p>
            <p>Neither will it much help the matter, to say that this Enquiry was not intended so much for a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> of the despicable Faculties, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, of their Spiritual Guides: as for a <hi>Hint</hi> to <hi>Authority,</hi> in order to their better Provision, and supply. For first; there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion at all betwixt the Dignity of the Subject, and the manner of handling it: betwixt the solemnity
<pb facs="tcp:103632:6"/>
of the Pretence; and the licentious Freedom of the Stile: which runs altogether in a vein of Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Humour, and Drollery: and it is not usual for Men to <hi>address,</hi> to <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>Parliaments</hi> in <hi>Raillery</hi> or <hi>Burlesque.</hi> Now as there is a <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> on the <hi>one</hi> hand, there is not so much as any <hi>Probability</hi> (I might have said <hi>Possibility</hi>) of <hi>Benefit</hi> on the <hi>other.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Beside the Indecency, and Incongruity of the Application, The Inquisitor seems to be no less Mistaken in his <hi>Expedient,</hi> than in his <hi>Method.</hi> For it may be Observed, that notwithstanding his distribution into <hi>Fools,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:103632:7"/>
               <hi>Beggers;</hi> All his <hi>Beggers,</hi> are <hi>Fools</hi> too <hi>over and above;</hi> and subjected indifferently upon <hi>both Accompts,</hi> to <hi>Derision,</hi> and <hi>scorn.</hi> So that unless he can find a way to Cure Their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as well as Their <hi>Poverty,</hi> when our Governours shall have done their best upon the Point of <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> and <hi>Revenue,</hi> we shall be still as much at a loss as ever, upon the more material Points of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he would have the <hi>Clergy new-modell'd,</hi> and the <hi>Poor Fools</hi> he talks of, turn'd to Grass again by <hi>Hundreds,</hi> with <hi>Whites Centuries</hi> of <hi>Scandalous</hi> and <hi>Insufficient Ministers,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:103632:7"/>
then the Work were done.</p>
            <p>And yet after all this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Mischief, <hi>Intended,</hi> and <hi>Contrived,</hi> I have still the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Perswade my self that it is all but <hi>Chance-medley,</hi> and that the Gentleman has no <hi>malice</hi> in his <hi>Heart.</hi> Not only because he Gives us to Vnderstand in his <hi>Preface,</hi> (by way of Anticipation) that he is no <hi>Male-content,</hi> either <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may seem to be; but a man may gather as much, methinks, from the very Air of his Writing, which savours more of a <hi>Droll,</hi> than of a <hi>Mutineer.</hi> But this does not acquit him yet of Great Inadvertency, in a freedom of this
<pb facs="tcp:103632:8"/>
nature. These <hi>Squibs</hi> and <hi>Crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> may do well Enough, in a <hi>fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting place,</hi> or <hi>season;</hi> but such a Pamphlet to the <hi>Multitude,</hi> and in <hi>This Juncture</hi> too, is like a <hi>Fire-work</hi> into the <hi>Powder-Room,</hi> it blows up all into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: And though it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke <hi>Laughter,</hi> and make <hi>sport</hi> for a while; yet in the End, it runs naturally into <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know very well, that in a <hi>second Letter</hi> of <hi>Observations</hi> upon an <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>former;</hi> our Author would be thought to take <hi>another Biass,</hi> in turning the Point of the Satyr upon the <hi>Nonconformists:</hi> but that shift
<pb facs="tcp:103632:8"/>
will not square at all with the scope of his Pretensions. For in stead of <hi>small,</hi> and <hi>Beggerly Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,</hi> they have just <hi>none at all;</hi> neither is <hi>their Ignorance,</hi> a <hi>scandal</hi> to <hi>our Ministry,</hi> but on the contrary, an <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Advantage,</hi> upon the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>To Close up all in a Syllable; There's a pretty Fardle of Tales bundled together, and they have had the hap to fall into such hands as had rather lose a <hi>Friend</hi> (not to say their <hi>Country</hi>) than a <hi>Jest.</hi> We shall proceed now to a Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Letter it self.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The first is this, That neither <hi>Ignorance</hi> nor <hi>Poverty</hi> do always necessarily infer <hi>contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second, That <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> are most injuriously fasten'd upon the present <hi>English</hi> Clergy.</p>
            <p>The third, That if the <hi>English</hi> Clergy be not duly valued, but lie under some <hi>contempt,</hi> it is to be attributed to other, and those far different reasons.</p>
            <p>And first of the first, That neither <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> nor <hi>Poverty</hi> do always necessarily infer <hi>contempt.</hi> Not that I am much in love with either of them, or intend to write a Panegyrique in their Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but only vindicate their innocence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103632:11"/>
so far, as to show, that admitting my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries bold Hypothesis were true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the English Clergy is both <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>ignorant,</hi> (which we are to examine in due time) yet it would not follow that their <hi>contempt</hi> must needs be derived from those two sources: for it is well known to all that are vers'd in Things and Books bearing date a little before yesterday, that a great part of Mankind have and do still account <hi>Poverty</hi> a thing <hi>sacred,</hi> and make <hi>Ignorance</hi> the Mother of their <hi>Devotion,</hi> as well as <hi>Admiration.</hi> First, as for <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> however it may render <hi>private</hi> men inconsiderable, yet it hath no such neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary influence and effect on <hi>publick</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, (bating me that mortal sin of a <hi>School-distinction</hi>) whose reputation and esteem is not ever built upon, or preserv'd by their Learning and Knowledge, but sometimes to be attributed purely to the dignity of their Rank and Place. Though the <hi>Mayor</hi> of the Town be but a <hi>Thatcher,</hi> and guilty of so little Scholarship, that he goes about to read his Commission with the <hi>wrong</hi> end upwards; yet by vertue of his <hi>Gown, Mace,</hi> and other Ensigns of Power and Government, he shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

in stead of <hi>God</hi>: And that he and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity (upon whom that Priesthood was entail'd) were had in great honour by the People, is to be attributed to their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously solemn <hi>Consecration,</hi> their rich Attire, and distinguishing <hi>Vestments,</hi> their <hi>Mitres</hi> and holy <hi>Crowns,</hi> and their sacred <hi>Vnction,</hi> design'd on purpose to beget and maintain a venerable esteem of them in Mens Minds, together with Gods express command they should not be <hi>evil</hi> spoken of, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. and his severe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon such as did not respect their <hi>persons, Lam.</hi> 4.16.

great awe. Not to insist upon the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, obscene, and villanous Rites of the more barbarous Nations; their sacrificing Men and Children to the Devil, and worshipping all manner of things for Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, excepting only the true <hi>God</hi> that made the World; I shall only note in <hi>transitu</hi> how things stood with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> who pretended to be the <hi>civilized</hi> People: for whatever <hi>Pliny</hi> boasts to the contrary, their hands also were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dipp'd in <hi>Humane</hi> Blood, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> have observed; and their Superstitions were as nonsensically <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> as <hi>numerous.</hi> And however their Priests by the Devils delusions seem'd to <hi>presage</hi> future evens from the Entrails of Beasts, flight of Birds, and the like; yet they were not requir'd to be any great <hi>Conjurers</hi> at Learning: all the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments their <hi>Curiones, Augures, Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, Pontifices, Salii, Aruspices,</hi> and the rest of their Orders pretended to, were only such as these, That they were of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy unmaimed, legal Years, could butcher and dress a <hi>Bullock,</hi> and it may be <hi>dance</hi> handsomly, and <hi>sing</hi> indifferently, and <hi>eat</hi> well; a steady <hi>Hand,</hi> an acute <hi>Knife,</hi>

So far was <hi>Ignorance</hi> from breeding <hi>contempt,</hi> that the Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in those days seem to me to use it as the great mean to preserve the respect of all their Religious Rites and Persons also. They knew the <hi>Vulgar</hi> do more earnestly admire little things and devices hid from them, thinking some great vertue or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery couched under whatsoever they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not. And he that hath but half an eye may see, that <hi>Rome Christian</hi> (who will needs be Sovereign Lady of the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> as her old Grandame was of the <hi>Heathen</hi> World) proceeds upon the very same principle, having established <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> by a Law, and requiring <hi>Mass</hi> to be said constantly in an <hi>unknown</hi> Tongue; <hi>unknown,</hi> I say, as well to the <hi>Priest</hi> who reads it oftentimes, as to the <hi>People</hi> that hear it. What mean all their fictitious <hi>Reliques,</hi> those many Loads of <hi>Timber,</hi> (as they would make) said to be pieces

of our Saviour's <hi>Cross</hi>; the infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of forged <hi>Nails,</hi> vended for those that pierced his <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet; Iohn Baptist</hi>'s <hi>Head</hi> preserv'd miraculously in <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> several places; <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s <hi>Humm,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>Milk? &amp;c.</hi> These and a thousand such little Inventions, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary Tales, as they are undeniable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of a Catholick <hi>stupidity</hi> amongst them, so they were never intended to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> their Clergy, who are believ'd to work <hi>new</hi> Miracles every day by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful application and management of the <hi>old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, To look a little more home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: We are none of us such <hi>Fools,</hi> but our Mistriss <hi>Experience</hi> may inform us, that the most rude and <hi>illiterate</hi> Men have sometimes been admired and followed by the multitude, as the only powerful and <hi>heavenly</hi> Preachers, whilst in the interim a wise and very learned Clergy hath been despised, ejected, and put to silence under pretence of <hi>Insufficiency.</hi> What Parts or Learning were those Mountebank <hi>Divines</hi> guilty of in the late times of Rebellion, who yet made a shift to Preach almost all <hi>England</hi> out of their <hi>Wits?</hi> Were not

Did they not give <hi>Glasses</hi> at random, and make false Consequences without fear or wit, often laying the whole <hi>weight</hi> of the Story upon some slender <hi>Circumstance,</hi> as that <hi>Dives</hi> went to Hell because he was <hi>Rich,</hi> and the like? Yet these were the only <hi>Boanerges</hi> in those days, who like a Land-stood car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all before them. <hi>Populus aliquando vult decipi,</hi> especially when <hi>Authority</hi> (though but usurped) favours the design: For had they enquired into the Cheat, they might easily have discover'd that many of these painful <hi>Bawlers</hi> were no more <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> than those <hi>Geese</hi> which sav'd the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then how egregiously is our wise Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-mender mistaken here in one moiety
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103632:14"/>
of his Hypothesis? Alas! <hi>Ignorance</hi> is so far from exposing a <hi>publick</hi> Person, that (allowing him Power and <hi>Authority</hi> with it) it is the only way to rear and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his esteem amongst the generality of Mankind, who are themselves unlearned; and if the Preachers great business be to influence and engage the Peoples affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for that end, he must be sure to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with none but <hi>Thimble</hi> and <hi>Bodkin</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, he must renounce his vain <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> he must beware of all <hi>Carnal,</hi> though never such <hi>Rational</hi> Discourses; take all his Books and <hi>burn</hi> them, (there is a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Text for that, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.) and teach wholly by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and then his business is done, <hi>Never man spake like this man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That <hi>Contempt</hi> was ever Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verties fatal Handmaid, is one <hi>Doctor</hi>'s judgment indeed; but if he be found sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, what if he should talk rather like an <hi>Apothecary</hi> in that too? Surely the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent part of Mankind don't use to judge of things by their gaudy outside, to esteem the Horse by his Trappings, the Ass by his burden, or the Mans <hi>Worth</hi> by his <hi>Wealth.

                  <l>Quam quòd ridiculos homines facit—</l>
               </q>
amounts to no more than this, that Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (abstractly consider'd without all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick Worth and Parts) makes men ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous amongst flouting Heathen: (for 'tis well known that the Principles of Christianity oblige us to make such Men objects rather of our Pity and Charity:) for even the sober Heathen had brains e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to distinguish between a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and an Idiot, a good Man and a bad; and none but Fools amongst them were wont to put the <hi>Man</hi> into one Scale, and the <hi>Money</hi> into the other, and thereby guess at his just price.

Passions. And I remember a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in <hi>Epicurus</hi> his School, (if yet he was not more his own Master) doth not only, like an arch Wag, laugh at all the rest of the vulgar <hi>Deities,</hi> but professedly lashes the <hi>blind</hi> God of Wealth (as if he were a <hi>blind</hi> Bear) through many of his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> especially that ycleped <hi>Timon,</hi> where he tells you, that Pride, Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Effeminacy, Violence and Fraud, do ever crowd in at the door with <hi>Plutus,</hi> whereas Labour, Wisdom, Temperance, Fortitude, and a world of other Vertues, are wont to march under the Conduct of <hi>Poverty.</hi> Amongst the various Sects of Philosophers, only the Peripateticks seem to have a kindness for Money, as one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary ingredient for making up the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> of their <hi>Summum Bonum:</hi> the rest generally declare against it, and value a Philosopher in his thread-bare Cloak, or Cynical Tub, above <hi>Croesus</hi> and <hi>Midas,</hi> those gingling Pack-horses, or <hi>Alexander</hi> that prodigious Robber, with all his spoils. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> in particular profess themselves Volunteers for Poverty, and speak more sense (whether dissembling or in earnest, is not a half-penny matter) to render <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:103632:16"/>
contemptible, than some body else can do <hi>Poverty,</hi> with all the artifices he has. In a word, a man might be honest, vertuous and wise in those days, though he was not Master of both the <hi>Indies:</hi> nay, such an one, though brought to his shifts by Tyranny or Chance, and forc'd to the servile office of drawing water meerly to get bread, should be gladly receiv'd, and easily believ'd by the best of Men.</p>
            <p>But we need not stand to the verdict of these Ethnick Oracles only, since Christs own Jury of Life and Death, his Apostles, have given it against our Adversaries false Indictment: St. <hi>Peter,</hi> their Fore-man, speaks the sense of all the rest, (excepting only <hi>Iudas,</hi> who for his love of Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongst other reasons fell from his place) <hi>Silver and Gold have I none.</hi> The Kingdom Christ claimed was purely spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and that old Sophisters large offer not likely therefore to succeed, when he said, <hi>All these will I give thee, &amp;c.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the first Promulgers of his Gospel, to forsake all when they followed him, to carry neither purse nor scrip in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that the World might be convinced he stood not in need of any common helps
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103632:16"/>
and artifices to plant his holy Religion, and perswade Men to embrace it: for the more low and improbable <hi>means</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments are, the more admirable certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the <hi>effect:</hi> it made the arrogant <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves pluck in their horns, when they met with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a poor Mechanick beating them at their own Weapon; that a parcel of mean illiterate Fisher-men, and such like, should reform a debauched World, and plant the Christian Faith in all Nations, is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough that the Hand of God was in all this, who works his Will to the more advantage sometimes by balking the assistance of the Rich and Learned: And though when the Church was under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, those primitive Christians laid all their Estates at the Apostles feet; yet they employed them wholly for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches publick use, and are not believ'd to have lick'd their fingers, and enrich'd themselves thereby. I never heard that St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself left one penny stock in his pretended Successours Coffer.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, since the <hi>World</hi> is come into the <hi>Church,</hi> and Kings have embraced and undertaken to defend the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103632:17"/>
               <hi>Faith,</hi> the face of things is most reasonably alter'd, and a competent Patrimony set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the Church in general: That of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular is pretty well to live, as we say, for matter of maintenance, and many of her Grandees may possibly keep up their Reputation by their vast Wealth, and outward Splendour: but yet every body knows, that several of their Religious Orders are professed <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eants,</hi> and sworn Votaries to <hi>Poverty</hi>; and these are so far from being laugh'd at, that they are had in mighty reverence and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative admiration by all of that Belief. Nor do I see that <hi>accidental</hi> must needs make a Clerick ridiculous, more than <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Poverty; nay, without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the former deserves most to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being sometimes many an honest Mans inevitable doom, as well as <hi>Iob</hi>'s and <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s, whilst the latter is of meer affectation, and superstitious choice.</p>
            <p>And therefore I would intreat our wise Author to suppose a thing that <hi>may</hi> be for once, for you see he is very prodigal of Hypotheses that <hi>may not</hi> be. Suppose a Church under the persecution of Rebels, and sacrilegious Usurpers, where the rich

               </gap> of the World by an uncircumcised Crew of Miscreants, whose fault is that? Neither their <hi>Poverty,</hi> nor <hi>Exile,</hi> nor <hi>all</hi> their <hi>sufferings,</hi> impair their Reputation amongst sober, religious, and loyal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who rather admire and applaud their resolved <hi>Fidelity</hi> to God and the King, let Men and Devils do their worst. <hi>Benè fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere &amp; malè audire Regium est:</hi> the dirt and reproaches cast upon them by foul-mouth'd Men, rebounds all upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; their unjust slanders are our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>honour,</hi> their detractions <hi>add</hi> to our esteem; the <hi>blots</hi> and false aspersions they cast upon our good names, do but, as so many <hi>spots,</hi> set off their beauty: indeed, if <hi>Cato,</hi> if <hi>Laelius,</hi> if the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s should contemn and defame me, (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) I

should be moved; but let the Rabble say what they will: Mean while, 'twere strange to say these worthy Men were thus despis'd and handled because they were poor, whereas the contrary is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; their fair Revenues, Lands and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, the Gold and Silver Vessels of the Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were the undoubted baits that tempted the avarice of Men sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously disposed, to fall foully and falsly upon their Reputation.</p>
            <p>Now from the Premises, every Novice in Logick may infer, that the Ignorance of a Clergy-man doth not necessarily ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him contemptible with the vulgar, nor his Poverty amongst the wise and learned; and consequently that my <hi>first</hi> Proposition is true.</p>
            <p>But what if it be? will he say; if the <hi>second</hi> be false, you are but where I left you.

<q>That Ignorance and Poverty are most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously fasten'd upon the present Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Clergy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the clearing hereof, it must be first stated how far we are agreed, and wherein we differ; and then I shall leave it to impartial Readers to believe and judge who hath greatest reason and truth of his side.</p>
            <p>We are agreed in the first place (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume) whom we mean by the <hi>present Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Clergy,</hi> viz. such Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, as are now (or were at least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout last <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term) actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103632:19"/>
in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So that we exclude first, all that having sometime been of our Clergy, are since <hi>dead,</hi> and so cannot <hi>de jure</hi> render such as are now <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live</hi> contemptible: for what is that to me, if my <hi>Predecessour</hi> forty or fifty years ago could not say his <hi>Commandments,</hi> or tell how many <hi>Apostles</hi> our Lord had, or that he baited a <hi>white Bear</hi> now and then in his Sermons, or talk'd beside the Cushion? There's not the same reason for <hi>Preaching</hi> sure, as for <hi>Original Sin,</hi> that it should be entail'd upon all Posterity; and yet our Author is so ingenuous as to produce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances before he was born (the truth whereof might perhaps be question'd too) to serve his present purpose, as you shall see anon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we exclude also all the <hi>Non-conforming</hi> Brethren, of what Sect or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty soever, who have indeed excluded themselves to our hands, by departing schismatically from our Communion. We intend not to answer for their ridiculous extravagancies in the Pulpit, more than their other faults: for what do their gross <hi>abuses</hi> of Preaching concern the Orthodox Clergy, who abhor to tread in their steps?
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103632:19"/>
Men may as well charge upon us the old <hi>Monk</hi>'s Proof of a plurality of <hi>Worlds,</hi> from that Text, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.17. <hi>Annon decem facti sunt mundi?</hi> or the ignorance of those two other Disputants, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving resolved that ten thousand <hi>Spirits</hi> might dance upon a <hi>Needles</hi> point, could not determine where the <hi>Piper</hi> must stand all this while. Yet this will be found too some bodies close way of reasoning; some factious Separatists have used foolish Phrases and childish Metaphors in their Preachments, <hi>ergo,</hi> the English Clergy is Ignorant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We are agreed further against the brain-sick <hi>Catharists</hi> conceit, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not to see a Clergy made up all of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Worthies.</hi> It is suppos'd on both sides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that every <hi>Vicar</hi> is not oblig'd to be as <hi>rich</hi> as the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; and that two or three in a County may be connived at, although they be not altogether as <hi>learned</hi> as Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi> We know full well that there is no Profession in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein all are improved to the same Perfection: There was, and always will be an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> or two amongst the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> some <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Empiricks</hi> amongst
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103632:20"/>
               <hi>Physitians,</hi> some <hi>Idiots</hi> in the Schools of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>Dunces</hi> in the number of pretended <hi>Scholars,</hi> some <hi>poor</hi> Gentry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the <hi>rich,</hi> to make up the Harmony of things; and that it were a downright piece of Sophistry to condemn any whole <hi>Profession</hi> and Order of Men, for the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, mistakes, and absurdities of some <hi>few</hi> Individuals thereunto belonging. Thus far I must hold my Gentleman's Nose to the Grind-stone, and make him agreed whether he will or no; for otherwise he fights with his own shadow, and fathers faults upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi> which are either committed by those who are not of that rank, or are not a sufficient number to make a denomination.</p>
            <p>So that the great difference or Ball of contention between us, is, Whether the <hi>generality,</hi> or at least a <hi>great part</hi> of our present English Clergy deserve the brands of <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>ignorant,</hi> or not? He does not only take it for granted all along, but expresly affirms it, and that with a <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> pag. 81. (as if the Lord's <hi>Lot</hi> were a meer <hi>Lottery,</hi> wherein there are an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Blanks</hi> for one <hi>Prize</hi>) but my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Proposition doth with as much
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103632:20"/>
Confidence and more Reason deny it.</p>
            <p>First, As for Ignorance, I blush for him, to think he could find no where to fasten that, but upon one of the most learned Churches in the World; which as it hath always been able to deal with the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable <hi>Roman Giants</hi> on the one hand, and those undermining <hi>Separatists</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (for <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Puritan,</hi> like <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s Foxes, though looking and running two several ways, yet are ever joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the <hi>Tail</hi>) so I am bold to say, it is now more plentifully furnisht with Men of singular Worth, universal Knowledge, and great Clerks, than ever it has been since the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Now although he can expect but little <hi>favour</hi> from me, yet I will do him the <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> to believe he never intended to bring our Reverend <hi>Prelates</hi> into his Indictment, nor yet the worthy Deans, and other Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries in the Church, Men generally of known Abilities, some of whose Works do not only <hi>praise</hi> them in the <hi>Gates,</hi> but are also famous throughout the <hi>World.</hi> Nor do I think him so ingrateful to our <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,</hi> as to deny that they now flourish more than heretofore with all sorts of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103632:21"/>
good Literature, very learned Men, and accurate Preachers. Nor do I believe he aims at the <hi>City,</hi> since they are fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Labours of their Pastours, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they quarrel them sometimes for their too much Humane <hi>Learning, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> as being hard words many of them were not brought up to. No, the <hi>Ignorance</hi> he upbraids us with, must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us in the <hi>Country,</hi> or no where. Now it is not probable there should be many Dunces amongst the <hi>Parsons,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering they hold their Benefices either from the <hi>Broad Seal,</hi> (for obtaining which 'twere great rashness to think they give not as ample <hi>Testimony</hi> of their Parts, as a Man must do for his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can procure an ordinary <hi>Brief</hi>) or from some Spiritual or Temporal <hi>Lord,</hi> (and it were somewhat sawcy to think ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them keeps a <hi>Fool</hi> for his <hi>Chaplain</hi>) or some Collegiate <hi>Society,</hi> (and 'twere as strange they should search all about for an <hi>Hocus,</hi> when they have so many good <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> at home unemployed, and fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) or some Civil <hi>Incorporation</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> (and they are not so easily bribed, but will have their choice of several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103632:21"/>
all of good note) or lastly, from some <hi>private Patron</hi>; and there lies all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, lest he having an <hi>Oak Tree,</hi> or good <hi>Horse</hi> to sell, should close with his best <hi>Chapman,</hi> and require no more <hi>Latine</hi> skill in his <hi>Clerk,</hi> than to render [<hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum dabis?</hi>] into current <hi>English</hi> Money. But I hope such sordid practices are very rare; I'm sure 'tis below the Spirit of a true English <hi>Gentleman,</hi> (who can sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his whole Estate to serve his King and Church) to stoop to such a pitiful Bribe or Bargain, forgetting Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science both at once: Besides, if any that wear that Name be so far degenerated, as to expose a Benefice to <hi>Sale</hi>; yet where is that bold Son of <hi>Simon,</hi> who shall dare to be the <hi>Buyer?</hi> He must be a prodigious <hi>Sot</hi> indeed, who will pawn his own <hi>Soul,</hi> by living in a continued perjury, to be put into a capacity of saving <hi>other mens:</hi> So improbable it is there should be many ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Parsons. And if I may guess at other <hi>Diocesses</hi> by this, I must tell our pragmatical Author, that I know very few <hi>Parsons</hi> who will turn their backs of him in any solid piece of <hi>old</hi> Learning, many of them being aware of his <hi>new</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103632:22"/>But the whole strain of his Book tells us, he aims at a cowardly triumph over the little <hi>Vicars</hi> and <hi>Curates,</hi> though he is not likely to have his end of them neither. <hi>One</hi> of them has answer'd him already, (but that he was so civil to his old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, as to be too too free and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal in his <hi>Concessions</hi>) and, for ought he shall ever know the contrary, <hi>I</hi> may be <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Vicars and Curates in <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Corporations,</hi> (which make a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of the Nation) himself grants they are mostly very <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>judicious persons:</hi> but then he tells us a piece of worshipful News, that Christ came not to save <hi>Mayors</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and <hi>Merchants</hi> only, but Country-people also, whereby he requires me to follow him into the <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,</hi> to find out that <hi>Ignorance</hi> we are Nosed withal, and hitherto are at a loss for. And the truth is, I have made it more my business than ever he hath done, to enquire into these Men of a <hi>low Church-Dispensation,</hi> (as we must phrase it) and will maintain it against him or any other, be he never so confidently <hi>ingenious,</hi> that many of them are Men of very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103632:22"/>
Worth, and want nothing but a little of his boldness to shew their Parts, and a Friend at <hi>Court</hi> to provide them of good Benefices. The generality of them (though perhaps they aspire not to be made the Kings <hi>Professours,</hi> nor can split the hair exactly in determining the <hi>five Points,</hi> or confuting <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> yet) are very sufficiently qualified for the discharge of their <hi>Cures.</hi> Nay, there's scarce any amongst 'um all, but preacheth <hi>once</hi> every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and that with good gravity, honest sobriety, and to take sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Parishioners; and if there be here and there one less knowing than others, you shall be sure to find him at it <hi>twice</hi> a day, Bishop <hi>Andrew</hi>'s his old Rule being worn out in some places, viz. <hi>He that preaches twice every Sunday, usually prates once.</hi> In a word, if upon due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination our Author had found but <hi>ten</hi> men of worth amongst all the Vicars of <hi>England,</hi> had he been a merciful Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, he might have found out a very good Precedent, to have <hi>spared</hi> the <hi>rest</hi> for their sakes: But since he writes at random of Men he hath never studied, and hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so much pains to impose upon the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103632:23"/>
World, with a parcel of prodigious Whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers dress'd <hi>a la mode,</hi> since we defie him to pick out <hi>Ten</hi> amongst us all who have not Learning enough to discharge our places, let him hereafter keep his <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> to himself, for it belongs to very <hi>few</hi> of our Profession.</p>
            <p>Nor is he much more ingenuous in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the <hi>Poverty</hi> of our inferiour Clergy, (for them alone he must mean) by making it far more extream and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate than in truth it is. For if any man hath such a miraculous Faith, as to take his word, rather than believe his own eyes, he must needs fancy them a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of sneaking <hi>Mendicant</hi> Friars, who live from hand to mouth, who are pincht with want of the common necessaries of life, and spend all their days in studying only to stave off those two troublesom Creditors, the <hi>Back</hi> and <hi>Belly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it must be confessed that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not now so rich, fat, and well-liking, as she was in <hi>diebus illis</hi> his days, and consequently not able to settle such plentiful Portions upon her <hi>younger</hi> Children as she would: for she lost a considerable Collop by the <hi>Pope,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:103632:23"/>
(however our Author is so civil to the old <hi>Gentleman,</hi> as not to mention him) who laid a fair foundation of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating 3845. of the 9284. Parishes then in <hi>England,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Basire</hi> notes out of <hi>Cambden.</hi> And when she had somewhat pick'd up her crumbs again, by the accession of new Revenues, King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Eighth knowing as <hi>infallibly</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, that the Church-Lands were very <hi>good Lands,</hi> could not forbear wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after his <hi>Holiness</hi>'s <hi>Copy,</hi> but gave her such a <hi>tearing Purge,</hi> that she hath never recover'd her Complexion since. Not to mention how far Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> did <hi>patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zare,</hi> thanks be to God our <hi>Vicarages</hi> are not all so poor as they left them; for, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Author's memory fails him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he speaks not a syllable of any late <hi>Augmentations:</hi> No, he never heard that our Reverend Bishops, and Deans, and Chapters, have (by the gracious Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the eternal Honour of His present <hi>Majesty</hi>) competently augmented most, if not all the small <hi>Vicarages</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them respectively. And now I have told him, it would be a good jest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if he should write an effectual piece
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103632:24"/>
to make the Sky fall; I mean, to perswade all other Impropriation-mongers to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low so good an Example, and bring them to some satisfaction however, for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair he should ever win them to refund the whole, and make us all <hi>Parsons</hi> again, although it be a grievance to our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that <hi>Vicarages</hi> and <hi>Sacrilege</hi> came first into <hi>England</hi> together from <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the same <hi>Cloak-bag</hi>; and besides, Experience tells us, that Church-Lands (like the <hi>Ark</hi> of God amongst the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims</hi>) have been but a <hi>plague</hi> to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and a <hi>canker</hi> in the Estates of their Purchasers, as saith the Heathen Prophet, —<hi>Vix gaudet tertius Haeres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though we dare not be so bold as to say with my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> that all <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> since the 27 and 31 of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Eighth, stand obliged to God in Conscience to reduce the Patrimony of the <hi>Church,</hi> (to which he adds, that since they have debarred Christs Spouse of a great part of her <hi>Dowry,</hi> it were reason they made her a competent <hi>Ioynture</hi>) yet thus much we dare boldly say, that our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Sovereign</hi> and this present <hi>Parliament</hi> have already given a signal earnest of their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103632:24"/>
pious intentions, by restoring that part of the Churches <hi>Patrimony</hi> which was bought and sold by those unhallowed <hi>Rumpers</hi>; and our little Historian was unworthy to mention that Noble Act, (reserved for some great Hand to record it) for which their Names shall be had in <hi>everlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, those <hi>Vicars</hi> whose Incomes are but <hi>small</hi> as yet, content themselves to make a <hi>Vertue</hi> of <hi>Necessity,</hi> and cut their Coat according to their Cloth. <hi>Enough</hi> sometimes is as good as a <hi>Feast,</hi> and a Dinner of Herbs is more pleasant and acceptable to some, than a stalled Ox attended with all varieties is to others. Not one of an hundred of the Clergy but is as well provided for as those the Poet cries up for <hi>the happy Men, Queis Deus parcâ dedit quod satis est manu.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have oft admir'd to observe how contentedly, yea, how plentifully several of them live upon a little; and though I have imputed it somewhat to their own prudence, frugality, temperance, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off many artificial necessities others create to themselves; yet I could not but call to mind the <hi>Widows Cruise</hi> of Oyl; and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103632:25"/>
Barrel of <hi>Meal</hi> that never consumed while they were feeding a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and almost fancied God gave them Blessings other Men know not of, and made some <hi>secret</hi> addition to their store: Nay, I have known some of them grow insensibly into the number of the <hi>Rich,</hi> whilst many of their Neighbours have (by their own impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or some unlucky accident) lived to bury fair <hi>Estates</hi> before them, and left nothing when they died but a <hi>Wife</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, and five or six pretty <hi>Children</hi>; by way of Legacy to the Parish. However, admitting they steer but <hi>Agur</hi>'s middle course between the two extreams all their lives, it is sufficient for my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and I have reason to conclude, that <hi>Poverty</hi> as well as <hi>Ignorance</hi> is most injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously attributed to the generality of our present English Clergy, <hi>Quod erat demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though I am not obliged to take any notice of the Gentleman's whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Discourse, because it is built upon a false foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> A pair of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his own forging; yet for diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sake, we'll give him his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> for once, provided he never ask it more, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103632:25"/>
see what work he makes on't: we'll allow him to stand in the Air with <hi>Archimedes,</hi> only to see what <hi>Knacks</hi> and <hi>Feats</hi> of Activity he is dexterous at.</p>
            <p>When he hath told us with much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, that the generality of our Clergy are <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Beggars, parti per pale,</hi> he proceeds to give us a reasonable accompt both of their <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Poverty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great part of their pretended <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> he lays upon the <hi>old-fashion'd</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and discipline of <hi>Schooling,</hi> to assure us he is a well-wisher to some <hi>new</hi> Model, he knows not what, but is content at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to be only so far a <hi>Regulator,</hi> as to mention some very mischievous <hi>abuses</hi> of Youth in common Schools, which I shall enquire into by and by: for it were not amiss to inform him by the way, that all Men are not of the <hi>Fanatick Skip-Iack</hi>'s mind, for <hi>new</hi> Models and Methods, (more than for <hi>new</hi> Moons, and <hi>new</hi> Gods) provided the old have been found by long experience neither uncertain nor ineffectual. <gap reason="foreign">

consequence.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103632:26"/>
but yet it argues no great wisdom to abandom them for any <hi>new</hi> ones sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be guilty of as many more. I now proceed to consider the abuses our Author observes in the <hi>old</hi> received way of School-Education.</p>
            <p>The first is, That Boys are kept in pure slavery to <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> words, till 16 or 17 years of age: so that if you will believe him, <hi>Rider</hi>'s Dictionary and <hi>Scapula</hi>'s Lexicon are the only Books they do, or at least need converse with for that purpose. To remedy this abuse, (which yet is of his own making) he starts the fancy of putting them upon <hi>English</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: that doubtless would be as pleasing as <hi>Tityrus</hi>'s <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Nuts</hi> to them who are naturally inclin'd to ease and idleness, but would not so well satisfie their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who send them to School chiefly to learn <hi>Amo</hi>'s and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>'s, for so we are taught to call the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tongues. But that they should fall upon <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Philosophical</hi> Discourses for that end, rather than <hi>Homer, Virgil, Tully, &amp;c.</hi> is such a monster, as the teeming <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> ne'er brought forth the fellow of it: 'twere <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> indeed, to put Boys
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103632:27"/>
upon puzzling their tender Brains about crabbed <hi>Theories,</hi> and knotty <hi>Problems,</hi> such as grown Men of the profoundest judgments can scarcely fathom or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; as if <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Shoes would fit a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> as if <hi>Lambs</hi> could wade where <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants</hi> are forc'd to swim, and every little <hi>Philistim</hi> could play at Quarter-staff with <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Beam.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a sort of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which, as it was calculated for the nonage of the World, so it is still best accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated and suited to younger Capacities, I mean, <hi>Poetry,</hi> the old Philosophy of all, flourishing many Ages before <hi>Aristotle</hi> was born.

Arts and Sciences were then in their infancy, and their way of teaching was not to tell downright truth, reason home and bluntly, and make irresistable Demonstrations; but to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate Vertue and Knowledge by merry <hi>Tales,</hi> and innocent <hi>Fictions</hi>; and if I mistake not, they borrowed that mode, as many other things, from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:103632:27"/>
who used then to be instructed about high and heavenly matters by Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows taken from below. Now give me leave to show our Author the difference even in his own story of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> which he imagines to be so tedious to Boys: but that's his errour, they naturally <hi>love</hi> sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and though they have not capacity enough to understand a Logical Definition of <hi>Rashness,</hi> and conceive a clear notion of <hi>Presumption</hi>; yet they will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the moral of that <hi>Fable,</hi> and tell you the Young Man had better have taken his Fathers disswasive, — (<hi>non est mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale quod optas</hi>) and that none but <hi>Fools</hi> will venture on difficult Tasks they are not able to manage; and consequently I infer, that to put <hi>Boys</hi> upon the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and solid parts of <hi>Learning,</hi> were to make them hazard <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s destiny, <hi>i. e.</hi> breaking the neck of all their parts: so that let him be as singularly wise as he will, and spend his breath in vain, which might have better served to cool his <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-broth,</hi> the Books ordinarily read in Schools, will still be found most proper for Boys, in order to their gaining those two famous Languages, and sowing the

seeds of Knowledge in their Minds.</p>
            <p>Another abuse of Youth, and loss of time, he reckons the <hi>Homerick</hi> rumblers, and large Repetitions of other <hi>Authors</hi> appointed sometimes for their <hi>Break-fasts,</hi> which he will have to be as <hi>dreadful</hi> to <hi>them</hi> as an <hi>old Parliament-Fast,</hi> (an odd similitude by the way; and had the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son used it, 'twould have been laught at sufficiently; for let the World judge if any <hi>Text</hi> in the Bible be not more like an <hi>ingenious Picture,</hi> than a Break-fast is like a <hi>Fast</hi>) whereas indeed they are not tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som to any but <hi>Dolts</hi> and unhewen <hi>Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,</hi> who are never likely to be fashion'd into <hi>Mercuries.</hi> Now if he alone be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that this practise of common Schools is not only pardonable, but of very excellent use, who can help it? Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body else knows, that Children have a moist and supple Brain, like soft Wax, capable of any impressions, and that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> is the most early faculty of the Soul, which exerts it self in the very dawning of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Cogitation,</hi> (whereupon <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> calls it the <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Muses</hi>) and is in its prime and meridian vigour before <hi>Imagination</hi> or Fancy, much less <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:103632:28"/>
and Judgment, come perfectly to them; these requiring a much different, if not quite contrary temperature: And common experience tells us, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member nothing so firmly and lastingly as what we did and learnt in our younger years; and that Grammar and Languages are gotten chiefly by <hi>Memory,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more easily attained by <hi>Boys</hi> than grown Men. The learned <hi>Spaniard</hi> in his <hi>Trial</hi> of <hi>Wits,</hi> observes very well, that if a <hi>Biscain</hi> of thirty or forty years old come to dwell in <hi>Castile,</hi> he will never master and speak that Language cleverly; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he comes a <hi>Boy,</hi> he grows such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient thereat in two or three years, that one would swear he was born in <hi>Toledo.</hi> If <hi>Memory</hi> therefore be the first and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal faculty to be improv'd for gaining Languages, it was capriciously done to blame the custom of common Schools for what they ought rather to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> as well for exercising a Lad's memory often in the general, as for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>high</hi> and <hi>brave-sens'd Poems</hi> to it in particular, since out of that, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Store-house, the <hi>Fancy</hi> is afterwards enrich'd and raised to an aptitude for Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103632:29"/>
and Poetry, and the <hi>Iudgment</hi> also by degrees comes acquainted with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, be they never such <hi>high Moralities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do I know any such <hi>silly Academicks</hi> as he describes, who upon reading <hi>Tully</hi>'s Offices, and the best Poets over again at their maturer years, do not take double delight and satisfaction to one that never saw them before.</p>
            <p>As for that Objection in the close of his Paedagogical abuses, I suppose it was started more to dally and play with, than to answer: for it is most true still, that all mischiefs and faults in <hi>Schooling</hi> refer as well to <hi>other</hi> learned Professions, as to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and it neither is by him, nor can be made out by all the <hi>Logicks</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> how it should come to pass that the very same method of <hi>Schooling</hi> daily produces more learned <hi>Lawyers,</hi> more eminent <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,</hi> and yet more ignorant <hi>Divines</hi> than ever.</p>
            <p>The next complaint he makes, is of the <hi>inconsiderate sending all sorts</hi> of <hi>Lads</hi> to the <hi>Vniversity</hi>; which because it is the first truth he hath yet spoken, I shall be so ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as to grant it, (not absolutely, and for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103632:29"/>
his sake, but) upon condition I be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to interpose some Remarks and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions upon his Discourse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>Doubtless <hi>Socrates</hi> was in the right, that, as his Mother, though an expert <hi>Midwife,</hi> could not deliver a Woman who was not with Child; so neither could her <hi>Son</hi> make his Scholars bring forth any Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unless they had understanding to <hi>conceive</hi> it. And <hi>Cicero</hi> might have been so wise as to have examined his Son <hi>Mark</hi>'s Parts before he sent him to <hi>Athens:</hi> for albeit he committed him to an able Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Cratippus</hi> his care; yet the Lad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but a <hi>Cods-head,</hi> and the Oratour was forc'd to confess at last, that resisting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was but like the <hi>Giants</hi> fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Gods. Galen</hi>'s Father was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advised when he put him upon the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Physick,</hi> perceiving he had a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wit and inclination for that Science; though <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Parents again were as much out, who concluded by the Bulls, Horses, and Men of Wax he delighted to make in his Childhood, his Genius more suited with being a <hi>Statuary,</hi> than a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher.</hi> However, it is a truth generally
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103632:30"/>
confess'd, that Lads ought to have Parts and Capacities for those Professions to which they are respectively designed. What if a <hi>Borish</hi> Parent be so partial or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as to think his great <hi>Head</hi> is an infallible sign the Boy will make a sound <hi>Philosopher,</hi> or able <hi>Theologue?</hi> Other Men know, that the biggest <hi>Oranges</hi> have the hardest and thickest Sculls, and afford the least quantity of Juice: And what if a fond <hi>Mother,</hi> by the advice of the small <hi>Pedant</hi> at the sign of the very same little <hi>House</hi> by the <hi>Church-yard</hi>-side, be resolved to make her Zon <hi>Dick</hi> a Scholard, (of all the rest?) Certainly Tutours are neither bound to work <hi>Miracles,</hi> nor yet to accept of <hi>Hobson</hi>'s choice: for (whatever is sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to the contrary) I have known divers returned by the next <hi>Carrier,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, to the place of <hi>Execution</hi> from whence they came. But all this while let Examinations in the University be never so strict, some will prove Dunces to the Worlds end, through their idleness, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing their Studies, or decay of their Parts, and others be rejected who might have prov'd Miracles of the Age, though at present they seemed to be of slow and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103632:30"/>
heavy Parts: for we have no infallible Standard whereby to know assuredly this Lad will, and that other can never make a <hi>Scholar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Spanish</hi> Author (honest <hi>Iohn Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arte,</hi> who seems to be as well skill'd in this affair as my <hi>English</hi> one, yea, as <hi>T. B.</hi> and <hi>R. L.</hi> put together) tells it me for a very truth, that there is sometimes a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dulness in Children, which argues a greater wit in another age; and some Boys of quick Parts, and a ready Ingeny, like Summer-fruits, have flagg'd and wither'd in a short space, and according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Soon ripe, soon rotten,</hi> prov'd very ordinary and dull Men. And therefore I cannot but commend and recommend the practise of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> in this, who make not a rash judgment of Children's facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whilst they are conning their first <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> but stay till they come to years of discretion, and then make a close enquiry what they are, and which way their Parts lie, whether to Poetry, Physick, Oratory, History, Mathematicks, Law or Divinity; and then, by confining them to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Study,</hi> bring them to a considerable perfection therein, whilst others gargling
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103632:31"/>
all manner of Books that come next, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves with a smattering of <hi>all</hi> kinds of Learning, but prove excellent in <hi>none.</hi> To sum up this particular, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the premises, that though we may be sometimes deceived in guessing at a Lads parts, yet most certainly those <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> and <hi>Grammaticasters</hi> are blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who pitch upon the most unlikely of all the number for the <hi>Scholar</hi>; and <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,</hi> are not much more to be excused if they receive such an one upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest or commendation.</p>
            <p>After ability in reference to Parts, I must follow my Leader to examine the Lad's abilities in Purse: And 'tis denied to be any common practise for Parents or Friends to send a Boy to the University, who sit not down first and count the <hi>cost</hi> and <hi>charges,</hi> and intend not to contribute something at least to his subsistence: if they do, I would fain know what <hi>Tutour</hi> will admit him, unless he resolves to be a <hi>Father</hi> to him, and adopting him for his own, designs to furnish him with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries for <hi>Back</hi> and <hi>Belly,</hi> as well as those for the <hi>Head.</hi> It must be confess'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that all have not so large Incomes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103632:31"/>
as some; but yet withal, that they whose supplies are two profuse, are in a fairer way to miscarry than such as have rather too little: many are forced, for want of that <hi>same,</hi> to live in honest servitude, and the narrow compass of <hi>Sizers</hi>; what then? Must it therefore follow they are condem'd to such drudgeries as <hi>Chamber-sweeping, Water-fetching,</hi> and <hi>buying</hi> of <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Eggs?</hi> That's as very a Flam as all the rest: No, the main duty requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at their hands, is only to hold a <hi>Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> and College-Commons will not keep them at that from morning till night, but afford them sufficient intervals as well for their <hi>Studies</hi> as <hi>Recreations.</hi> What Man is ignorant that too large Allowances often make Lads prove idle and debauched? whereas on the contrary, they whose maintenance is short, as knowing what they must trust to, and being to lay the foundation of their own fortunes, and live by their wits, are usually the closest Students, and make the most eminent Scholars. <hi>Venter Magister artis,</hi> was <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>'s Motto, and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his <hi>Golden</hi> Scrap — <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:103632:32"/>
Poor Lads may be suppos'd to bring a considerable <hi>stock</hi> of Parts along with them, though little else, and their own wants will spur up their industry to improve them to the utmost, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to shut our School-doors against all of inferiour quality and low fortunes, were an incomparable device to advance all learned <hi>Professions,</hi> or rather to stock an University with a loytering kind of Cattel, commonly call'd <hi>Drones</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Indeed the project of maintaining all there till they come to be <hi>Masters</hi> in <hi>Arts,</hi> I could like well, but that, upon consideration of the premises, I find it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually impossible with the rest of his <hi>easie</hi> Proposals? What then? Must they down at four years end upon the top of the <hi>Pack,</hi> and thence skip into the Pulpit? More words to a bargain sure; let the young Man stay till he be out of his time, before he sets up for himself: How then must he live till he come to be of <hi>Spiritual</hi> age? for Philosophy is a very <hi>idle</hi> thing when one is <hi>cold,</hi> and the small <hi>Systeme</hi> will not satisfie Nature: Is the Bishop of the <hi>Diocess</hi> bound to give him <hi>Orders</hi> to keep him from starving, or being a Parish charge? No dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

of that, because he is too young, but that we are told there is a thing call'd a <hi>Dispensation</hi> to be got, which will make you as <hi>old</hi> as you please. I thought he had been <hi>old</hi> enough without a <hi>Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to have had more wit and manners than to slander and revile Gods <hi>high Priests,</hi> by making the World believe every No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may <hi>(prece vel pretio)</hi> procure holy Orders.

There is indeed a Proviso, that <hi>Fellows</hi> of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges</hi> (who are requir'd by their local <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi> to be in Orders at such a prefixed time) be dispensed with in respect of their want of Age; but what is that to <hi>Country</hi> Parishes? That there may be, or is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a frequent abuse in this particular, (as he would needs intimate) is no less than a downright forgery. Now whereas he enquires how all those Stripplings that commence yearly must live till they come to an holy maturity, I answer first in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that they do live somewhere; and

Secondly, and more particularly I answer, That many of those Commencers design no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s Calling; many more betake themselves to the <hi>Law,</hi> Civil or Common, and to <hi>Physick</hi>; several who intend the <hi>Ministry,</hi> have competent <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi> of their own; and himself grants that well nigh a <hi>fifth part</hi> are preferred in the <hi>Vniversity:</hi> all these deducted out of his two hundreds, the Remanent will not be very great, (and considering they are none of them more immortal than other Men) if he please, he may assign them to be Governours of <hi>Grammar</hi> Castles, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to some good <hi>Gentlemen</hi>'s Houses, to be their Childrens Tutours, and their own Companions. Indeed if our Gentry entertain <hi>Scholars</hi> to save a

I confess I've read of a certain <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, who received <hi>Thesmopolis</hi> the <hi>Stoick</hi> into her Family, and to testifie the singular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and kindness she had for him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her beloved <hi>Bitch</hi> (I've quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got her Name) now very pregnant, to his care and tuition; and who so fit as the <hi>Philosopher</hi> to be trusted with such a <hi>Iewel</hi> in his bosom? For, as they jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed, she had the advantage of easing Nature against his prominent-silver-<hi>Beard</hi>; and not long after, by his careful management of the Natural <hi>Causes,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited her precious <hi>Whelps</hi> in his learned <hi>Lap.</hi> Whether <hi>Lucian</hi> made the story to jeer the <hi>Stoick,</hi> or <hi>Lady,</hi> or both, or tells it for a true relation, it matters not, since he was but a meer <hi>Stoick,</hi> and she but a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Madam.</hi> But there's as little wit as truth in that fetch, that any Christen'd

               <hi>English Gentleman</hi> should make the same person his own <hi>Confessour</hi> (or <hi>Companion</hi> at least) and the <hi>Groom</hi> of his Horses Bed-chamber. His Tales are not well laid together: for is it not extreamly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that one who rubs his Horses scabby <hi>heels,</hi> should be such excellent company for Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he, forsooth, must be call'd down to say <hi>grace</hi> to every <hi>Health?</hi>

But stay! whither will this <hi>Chevalier</hi> Errant lead me? for like a Dog that hath lost the scent, he is continually roving about for new Game. You see what a <hi>Preacher</hi> he's likely to make, if ever he be effectually called by some fat <hi>Benefice,</hi> where <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth took no <hi>Toll</hi>; for he is quite run from his <hi>Text</hi>; and if you please to call in about <hi>seven</hi> Pages backwards, you'll find him there only preparing his Lads for the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity,</hi> whereas here he hath pack'd them down into <hi>Country</hi> again, and makes them stand <hi>sighing</hi> and <hi>picking</hi> their <hi>teeth,</hi> while the <hi>Knight</hi> and my <hi>Lady</hi> are at their

Dainties. And because he is used to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess every ones faults but his own, I must tell him he forgets himself much, and is preposterous: for had he design'd to treat us methodically, our first course should have been <hi>School-Butter, College-Commons</hi> the second, and the <hi>Chickens</hi> and <hi>Tarts</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served till the last: and yet the Man is so confident as to say, he <hi>now</hi> passeth from <hi>Schooling</hi> to the <hi>Vniversities.</hi> Which, that he may not seem to do very abruptly, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlopes here one thing more to bring the Boys and his Discourse together, that is, a <hi>good constitution</hi> of <hi>Body</hi> necessary for Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Well! how shall we do to know this? Why, repair to the <hi>Physitians,</hi> cries he: Very good; but the best of them pretend to no more than good <hi>Guessers,</hi> whether at Health or Diseases, and unless they had a Spirit of Prophesie, and could foretel a Boy's <hi>Quomodo valet</hi> seven years hence, or could fix a <hi>healthy constitution</hi> where they find it, or when they pleased, the whole fabrick of this advice will prove (says my Author) as thin as a <hi>piece</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks:</hi> for if it be lawful for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our own Senses in this <hi>Sceptical</hi> Age, <hi>Constitutions</hi> are as variable as the Moon,

            </p>
            <p>Nor should he have needed to argue <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> whether by following his idle Crotchets <hi>Vniversities</hi> should abate of their number and ancient splendour: for if ever they be induced thereby to change theit laudable customs, for his <hi>Eutopian</hi> Experiments, I'll venture to give him my <hi>Mother</hi> for a <hi>Maid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>ours,</hi> he professeth a great esteem for them, and their <hi>Governours</hi> Wisdom, (just as he complemented the Clergy in the beginning of his Book) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not prescribe them any <hi>new</hi> Scheme of Education: but yet such a rare <hi>Architect</hi> he is, that you'll find him build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presently above the <hi>Top-stone</hi> of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s <hi>own laying.</hi> Not that he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine

positively whether the Old or New <hi>Philosophy</hi> be the best, not he for the World; but only tells us in short, that <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Monarchy</hi> is long since at an end, (and all the old moth-eaten <hi>Statutes</hi> (which mention him honourably) out of date, together with a certain little <hi>Oath</hi> thereunto belonging) and we are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent absolutely under the Government of a <hi>Democracy,</hi> or new Commonwealth of <hi>Atoms.</hi> To let that pass, I shall enquire into those two things that so much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct University-improvements, and he intends to regulate perhaps, but not till the <hi>King</hi> makes him our <hi>Visitour</hi>; one whereof he reckons a defect, the other an abuse.

the design to admirable effect in <hi>Physick</hi>; (<hi>Bonds,</hi> you see, could <hi>oblige,</hi> and <hi>Purges work</hi> then without <hi>Latine.</hi>) Nor was it reasonable that <hi>Divinity</hi> should stand out: for, to make a Through-Reformation, the <hi>Independents, Anabaptists, Antinomists,</hi> and other Factions, set up publick <hi>Schools</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and other places, (by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence of one <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> but not him in the <hi>Acts</hi>) wherein they frequently held <hi>Declamations</hi> and <hi>Disputations</hi> in their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Tongue,</hi> to train up the Old, and gain New Proselytes to their several Parties: so that he must not have the credit of this project. But that he may go to work more like a <hi>Philosopher</hi> than they, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to back his design with some <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> The first is, That the Language learned <hi>Men</hi> must live by, is the <hi>English,</hi> there being no use of <hi>Latine</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but only to <hi>checquer Sermons,</hi> and make <hi>Salveto</hi>'s to some <hi>Dominatio vestra.</hi> Bate me an Ace, quoth <hi>Bolton!</hi> The Language <hi>Plum-sellers</hi> indeed and <hi>Cheese-mongers</hi> live by, is the <hi>English,</hi> and 'tis enough for them to read English Histories, Romances and Plays, if not too much. But hath the <hi>Parson</hi> no more use for <hi>Latine?</hi> Hath he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103632:36"/>
none but the <hi>Assemblies</hi> Notes, and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Divines</hi> to consult? Hath he neither Councils nor Fathers, Philosophers nor Historians, Oratours nor Poets, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatours nor Criticks, nor any Books in other Languages to advise with, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his own Knowledge, and convince all Gainsayers? If it be said that <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Oh <hi>Preaching,</hi> that's the All of his business, the very Marrow-bone of the matter; yet there will be some use of <hi>Latine</hi> however, till <hi>Lycosthenes, Polyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaea's,</hi> and the German <hi>Systems</hi> be done into English; for these are the only wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Authors a great part of our Clergy are allowed by him. But in earnest, what a strange Caprice is this, to put young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars upon reading <hi>English</hi> Writers, as if the Language of their Country would not be familiar to them as well as others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all this stir? Those old <hi>Dotards,</hi> our wise <hi>Founders</hi> and <hi>Fore-fathers,</hi> thought they rather ought to be interdicted <hi>English</hi> Authors, and confined wholly to <hi>Latine</hi>; it being too sad a truth, that many Lads of very good Parts, having (by their School-masters neglect) no great skill in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> sit down at <hi>English</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103632:37"/>
and by this means are perfect strangers to the most learned <hi>Writers</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>Thus much I could grant him, were it for his purpose, that English can't be throughly understood and master'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a competent skill in Grammar, and the Greek and Latine, from which many of our English words have their origine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the reason that Boys and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though speaking indifferently well, yet seldom or never write true English. Nor is there any thing but vain merriment in that observe, that some young conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Students</hi> write bombast and high-flown <hi>Epistles</hi> into the Country. Is this for want of <hi>English?</hi> No, nor for want of <hi>Ignorance</hi>; but a childish affectation of being out of the vulgar road, and rather for want of <hi>Brains</hi> and <hi>Latine:</hi> for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet met with a Lad that could give you an ingenious and pithy Discourse in <hi>Latine,</hi> but he could frame you the same with ease and advantage in his <hi>Native</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect.</p>
            <p>Another Argument he brings to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend English Exercises, is, That they are so far from hindring their Latine-improvement,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103632:37"/>
that they tend very much to its advantage. Nay then, Gentlemen, look to your Pockets, and let them read <hi>English, English, English,</hi> to the end of the Chapter. And how is this Paradox pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
<q>Why, by telling you a small story of a certain <hi>Academick Youngster,</hi> (<hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Nemo</hi> by name) who having finisht his postures at Table's end, made a silly Oration in Latine, <hi>(though he gives it in English, and who knows whether it be faithfully translated?)</hi> wherein he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that his Muse and half ne'er drank above size q. of Helicon; that he hath neither Stars nor Glories, Phrases nor Pearls, nothing but a shady Grove, or purling stream to describe, <hi>&amp;c..</hi>
               </q>
And so, for fear of wounding your patience, he makes his Leg, and <hi>exit:</hi> fare him well! Granting all this were as true as that the Sea <hi>burns,</hi> though 'tis hardly that, yet what doth it argue? Yes, he tells us, That if the Lad had first determin'd in <hi>English</hi> what he intended to say in <hi>Latine,</hi> he would have discern'd and avoided all these impertinencies; which is a <hi>postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> we do absolutely deny: for had he taken that course, he could but have done
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103632:38"/>
his best, his utmost still, although it must cost him double the pains; and 'tis a fond thing to imagine the Boy is wiser in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> than in <hi>Latine,</hi> supposing he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands both. The true reason why he made such a <hi>Chicken-broth</hi> Discourse, was, not for want of skill in <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> but for want of <hi>fancy</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Parts, Judgment and Years; for <hi>Child</hi> is but <hi>Child,</hi> and <hi>Boy</hi> is but <hi>Boy</hi> still, however this Mans <hi>Geese</hi> must be all <hi>Swans,</hi> his imaginary <hi>Lads</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to declaim against <hi>Quinctilian,</hi> and cope with <hi>Cicero</hi> himself at a solid and fleshy Oration: so that if any one be so childish as to believe he comes to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity to learn English, let him know he is abused, and made to begin at the wrong end. Let him read and digest the best <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Authors for his purpose first, and lay in a stock of substantial Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Ancient and Modern; and then when he comes of age, and years of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (before he engage in the Pulpit) we'll give him leave to read the choicest <hi>English</hi> Books to advance his stile, and give him a perfect command of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue.</p>
            <p>The other Indictment he draws up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103632:38"/>
Universities, is for retaining an ancient custom of <hi>Ioquing,</hi> as if himself were all this while <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>serious,</hi> or above those small Dispensations. Like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Beardless <hi>Apollo,</hi> he summons all <hi>Tripus</hi>'s, <hi>Praevaricator</hi>'s, and <hi>Terraefilius</hi>'s to <hi>Parnassus,</hi> to give them fair warning that nothing must henceforth go for Wit, but what is full measure according to his <hi>Standard.</hi> As for their little conceits, he knocks them all o'th' head with one solid and ponderous Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> They are useful neither in <hi>Law, Physick,</hi> nor <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Ergo,</hi> they are good for nothing: <hi>Tanquam ex Tripode quidem dictum!</hi> But Sir <hi>Tripus</hi> would answer him with a <hi>non sequitur:</hi> for they are not only innocent Recreations of themselves, (when they quit their subjects indeed to fall foul upon <hi>Governments, Persons,</hi> and <hi>Functions,</hi> like you know who, they expect to be called <hi>eoram Nobis,</hi> and sent to <hi>Bocardo</hi> or the <hi>Black Rod,</hi> without Bail or Mainprise) but of excellent use too if handsomly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged; it is to be considered that <hi>Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is a great Promoter of Health in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and an easie <hi>Amulet</hi> against some distempers that hang about <hi>sedentary</hi> Men
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103632:39"/>
in particular: it unbends the Mind, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens the distended Nerves of the Soul, and revives its drooping Spirits after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner; and why then must it be deemed a Capital Crime to interpose one merry <hi>Scene,</hi> to set off a serious and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Act,</hi> more resembling a <hi>Long-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Fast</hi> than I know what? And if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> diverted himself sometimes in playing with <hi>Partridges,</hi> whilst he was writing his mysterious <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> why may not <hi>grave</hi> Men have their Spleens tickled, though but with <hi>Straws</hi> and <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> rather than crack their Sculls with Voluminous <hi>Positions,</hi> long-winded <hi>Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> and endless <hi>Disputes</hi> about some Cross-grain'd Theory? Wherefore 'tis not material though these lighter and more airy kind of Exercises are not, nor ever were intended to be useful in Law, Physick, or Divinity, so long as they have a laudable end, and wholsom effect of their own. Nor is it necessary one that hath got the right knack of <hi>Ioquing,</hi> should follow that trade all his life, more than he who happens to act a <hi>Fool</hi>'s part well in two or three <hi>Plays,</hi> may be supposed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after to quit the <hi>Stage. Dulce est de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipere
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103632:39"/>
in loco</hi>; a prudent Man at different times and places knows when to be in jest or earnest. No Man ever dreamt that King <hi>Iames</hi> made <hi>Dull-man</hi> in <hi>Ignoramus</hi> a <hi>Bishop,</hi> for acting a Dull-man all his life, but for being one of the wisest Men in the company, as he afterwards approv'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>In the next place, (like some Sir <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Would-be</hi>) he traduces our <hi>Terraefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>'s and <hi>Praevaricator</hi>'s not a little, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting them as Nibblers at an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous <hi>word,</hi> and Quibblers upon <hi>Lilly</hi>'s Poetry, or at best but Tossers of an Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iom out of <hi>Logick,</hi> with a <hi>Hocas Pocas, &amp;c.</hi> whereas they oftentimes produce as good fancy, ingenious humours, lively action, well contriv'd Ironies, merry Fictions, mimical Gestures, and Burlesque Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, as any I find in his <hi>little Letter,</hi> yea or the <hi>great Don</hi> of <hi>Mancha.</hi> In a word, this difficult Province being usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally assigned to the choicest Wits, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable to fancy they must needs prove <hi>Iack-puddings</hi> in the Pulpit or elsewhere, especially when we recount how many of them of late years have arrived at consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Preferments both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:103632:40"/>And now let the World judge if these two little things are not mighty Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to a Clergy-man's improvement in Academick Studies! Indeed if he could have impeacht our <hi>Vniversities</hi> of some real abuses, as that kissing goes by favour, I mean, that a great number of the Youth are committed to the care of such <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,</hi> whose ignorance hath made them sordidly <hi>servile,</hi> and their flattery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd them to be <hi>Favourites</hi>; or of such others who are of too large Principles and Practises in their Religion, and own no other, perhaps, but <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s <hi>Creed</hi>; or could he have complained justly, that our <hi>Degrees</hi> lie as open as the High-way for all Comers; that <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Seals</hi> to Letters <hi>Testimonial</hi> are common as Stones in the Streets, and never denied to the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible Dunces, and the like, he might have lighted on something that did really incommode all learned <hi>Professions,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Clergy</hi>; but since he could find no such <hi>Camel-like</hi> faults amongst them worth the mending, I wonder he should be so Boyish as to make all this noise and strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meerly to catch a few <hi>Gnats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:103632:40"/>From the <hi>Vniversity</hi> he persecutes the Clergy-man into the <hi>Pulpit</hi>; and though he confesses he has no Authority to give Rules of Preaching, yet you must expect him to be as free of his Censures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as if he were <hi>Archbishop</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as we advance to enquire into His abuses of Preaching, I must needs whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per an old advice into his ear, <hi>ut Titulum Legat.</hi> For if I well remember, he is now inferring the Contempt of the Clergy from the Topick of their <hi>Ignorance:</hi> And is it not strange any Man in his wits should go about to prove that, from the towring <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,</hi> and profound <hi>Learning</hi> of some, and the abundance of <hi>Latine, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> said to lard the <hi>Sermons</hi> of others? Besides, 'tis strange any Man should be so loftily eloquent, and deeply learned as to want common prudence, and not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his audience, and distinguish between an University and a Country Pulpit. But the Plot is very visible; for, resolving to hook in the whole Clergy into his Lob's Pound before he had done, he hath now divided them into two Reverend Classes,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103632:41"/>
of learned Mad-men, and ignorant Fools. 'Tis well his word is no slander. In the mean time, it's oft the People's more than Preacher's fault he is not clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, who being either captious or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious (like the old <hi>Pharisees</hi>) will shut their eyes against Truths made out as clear as the Sun, because against the grain, and not for their turn; and though with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> he reason plainly of those plain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, <hi>Righteousness, Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Iudgment</hi> to come; yet like <hi>Felix</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the quick, they either bid him go <hi>his way</hi> for this time, and stay till they send for him, or cry out with <hi>Festus,</hi> The <hi>Man</hi> is certainly <hi>besides himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I know no Law he transgresses if the Preacher now and then quote a <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Author in a vulgar Auditory: None but <hi>Calumny</hi> it self would have charg'd him at a venture with <hi>Ostentation</hi> and <hi>Vanity.</hi> Why might he not rather do it to distinguish him from a <hi>Gifted</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Conventicle, who talks all of his own head in home-spun English? And why not to show that very learned Men are of his Opinion, and that he desires not his Auditours to believe it because he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103632:41"/>
said it, but because it is <hi>true?</hi> Authority is a more effectual Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> than a Demonstration, because seldom ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. What though few or none under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him those very words, so long as they apprehend him in much more than they can remember? Should he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course all in English, and like a Scholar, he must not expect to be intelligible all along to common capacities, more than those <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in a Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi> read in English.</p>
            <p>There is a sort of Preaching our Author seems to favour, (if he favour any) by dividing a Text into <hi>one</hi> part, I mean, by making a long continued <hi>Harangue</hi> upon some certain subject; which, if well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, would be found more useless and unprofitable than those said to be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced full of <hi>Latine,</hi> partly for its want of method and due helps of memory, and partly for being full of Latinized-affected-English. For I'll assure you, the Vulgar understand Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s easie Greek, and Saint <hi>Austine</hi>'s, nay <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Latine, as well as they do the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular passages, and whole frame and drift of such a <hi>Discourse.</hi> They know not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103632:42"/>
an <hi>Interpreter</hi> what you mean by your <hi>rational</hi> Notions, <hi>ingenious</hi> Principles, and <hi>sublime</hi> Moralities; your <hi>fervid</hi> Parturien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>parturient</hi> Agonies, and <hi>zealous</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the People; your <hi>Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and interchangeable <hi>Ratifications</hi> of Peace; your <hi>adjusting</hi> differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Animal and Divine <hi>Life,</hi> and a thousand more some of our pretended Masters of <hi>Reason</hi> have raked out of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zets</hi> and late <hi>Rodomontado</hi> Authors, to make them a <hi>Schibboleth</hi> of distinction, whereby they would be thought wiser than the common <hi>Herd</hi> of Mortals. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man in his way; yet they are not always the wiser and more rational part of Mankind, who are so charitable as to think themselves so.</p>
            <p>But the Greek and Latine <hi>Shreds</hi> are not always lost; for there is sometimes an <hi>all-wise</hi> Patron, or <hi>all-understanding</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Peace at Church. Not to envy him his wonted happiness in <hi>Epithets,</hi> though he lay it down dogmatically for a certain Maxim, That there is as great a future reward in saving one that takes <hi>Collection,</hi> as the <hi>best</hi> Man in the Parish, and consequently they should be preacht
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103632:42"/>
at both alike; yet other Men think they may warrantably take more pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a <hi>potent</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> Person, than any one of the <hi>little</hi> People, because in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>him</hi> they usually gain half a Parish. <hi>Harmonides</hi> the Minstrel being now Master of his Art, ask'd his Tutour <hi>Timothy</hi> what course he must take to get him a Name and esteem all over <hi>Greece?</hi> his answer was, That it would be a tedious and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less piece of work to show his skill to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinary <hi>Mechanick,</hi> besides that such are no competent Judges: But the most compendious way to do his business, was to give a <hi>Specimen</hi> of his Art to some few of the <hi>Potentates,</hi> of the chief and leading Men in all <hi>Greece,</hi> and when they are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd (said he) with an Opinion of thy Excellency, all the World will presently commend and admire thee by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>Lucian</hi> tells the Story. And we know that the World lives more by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> than <hi>Precept,</hi> that the <hi>Farmer</hi> is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily of his <hi>Landlord</hi>'s Religion, and that 'tis sometime more in <hi>His</hi> than the <hi>Parson</hi>'s power to make his Tenant a good <hi>Church-man,</hi> or an idle <hi>Sectary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> (saith
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103632:43"/>
he) make no such distinction in their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. A Metaphor taken from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick</hi> way of arguing; because they did not in some Circumstances, we may not in any. What if our Saviour's Auditors were all of a piece, all of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; the Text doth not say any of the <hi>Learned,</hi> or any <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Squires</hi> were there: Nay, another private Text asks the Question, (which I take for little less than an universal Negative) <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Pharisees belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on him?</hi> The Gospel was first preacht to the <hi>Poor,</hi> and not many <hi>Wise,</hi> not many <hi>Noble</hi> were called, they being loth to stoop from their Grandeur, and renounce all their Carnal Wisdom, as it required: but since the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Faith, surely there's more use of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi> to convert and confirm them, than the rude Vulgar.</p>
            <p>As for the sequel of his Discourse about Preaching, an hundred to one if it be not <hi>like</hi> something or other. It is not like the Picture of a <hi>French</hi> Lady, who gave the Painter five Livres more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to correct the defects of Natures Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and make her an exact Beauty: But

rather like some <hi>Dutch piece</hi> representing a company of <hi>Anticks</hi> and <hi>Apes-faces,</hi> where every one squines or grins, snears or mumps e'en as it pleas'd the <hi>Painter.</hi> Or if you will, 'tis like a Pedler's Stall, I have seen, managed by the little <hi>Iohn</hi> of all Trades in his narrow-brimm'd <hi>Beaver</hi> pincht to a point; how busily he struts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, crying, (<hi>Come buy my ratling</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, <hi>my Ginger-bread</hi> Similitudes, <hi>my dainty laced</hi> Prefaces, <hi>ingenious</hi> Pictures, <hi>exact</hi> Compasses, <hi>Iews-Trumps, Hobby-Horses,</hi> Thimbles <hi>and</hi> Bodkins, <hi>Divine</hi> Knicknacks <hi>and Conceits: Here's your</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua fortis, Sal Armoniack, <hi>Tops, Pears, and Pomegranates, Violins, Trebbles and Gingles, new Songs, new Moons,</hi> new <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacks,</hi> new; <hi>see here, what is't you</hi> lack?) till all the Infantry in Town flock about him to gaze at his little less than <hi>Tredes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>-variety of Miracles. Even so —</p>
            <p>But in earnest, let's enquire seriously into the main things he says make Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ridiculous, <hi>i. e.</hi> Harsh Metaphors, childish Similitudes, foolish Prefaces, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Divisions, cunning Doctrines, odd Expressions, and such like, and how far they are true, or concern the present Clergy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:103632:44"/>In the first place, we are much obliged to the Gentleman that he doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and tie us up so strictly, as that we must upon all occasions call a <hi>Spade</hi> a <hi>Spade,</hi> (at our peril) but allows us the common priviledge of all Oratours, to use Improprieties sometimes, whether <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>'s at large, or <hi>Metaphors,</hi> which are the same thing contracted into one word, provided they be grave, decent, significant and pertinent: and had he denied us, the case would not have been much alter'd; for we are not to learn from him what singular use there may be of them many times for informing Vulgar <hi>Iudgments,</hi> and influencing their <hi>Affections</hi>; which is a reason special enough why our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> used this way of Preaching.</p>
            <p>But secondly, We deny all those instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be ridiculous which he is pleased to vend for such. For what if a Text should chance to be like an ingenious <hi>Picture,</hi> or <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Rod,</hi> or <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Dove,</hi> yea or like the very <hi>Man</hi> going to <hi>Iericho?</hi> Where's the false <hi>Latine</hi> all this while, provided the Application be natural and apposite? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Mechanick can tell him, that Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are not design'd to agree as one Plain
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103632:44"/>
doth with another; if they touch but in one point, as a Globe upon a Plain, it is sufficient. And if he quarrel with these and such like Comparisons, he is in a fair way to fall foul upon the most sober and even <hi>sacred</hi> Writings. What if the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher should upon occasion compare a <hi>Cloud</hi> to a Mans <hi>Hand,</hi> wise speeches to Apples of <hi>Gold</hi> in <hi>pictures</hi> of Silver, (provided they be not <hi>ingenious</hi> Pictures) <hi>Israel</hi> to the <hi>dust</hi> of the Earth, <hi>Iob</hi> to a Cruddled <hi>Cheese,</hi> Man to a wild Asses <hi>Colt,</hi> and his own <hi>dung,</hi> Confidence to a broken <hi>Tooth,</hi> Spirits to <hi>Frogs,</hi> the Soul to the <hi>Chariots</hi> of <hi>Amminadab, Hezekiah</hi> to a <hi>Weaver,</hi> a <hi>Crane</hi> and <hi>Swallow,</hi> the Jews to roaring <hi>Bears,</hi> the Word of God to <hi>Fire,</hi> a <hi>Hammer</hi> and a <hi>Sword,</hi> the Kingdom of Heaven to a <hi>Grain</hi> of Mustard-seed, a little <hi>Leaven,</hi> a <hi>Net,</hi> a lost <hi>Groat,</hi> the Son of Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> a <hi>Lamb,</hi> a <hi>Lyon,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Branch,</hi> with hundreds more of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? I'll assure you it may be done so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and significantly, for it has been done; and none but a <hi>profane</hi> Wit would dare to play with the least and smallest things when once made <hi>sacred. — Procul O procul ite Profani.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:103632:45"/>But amongst the rest of his <hi>Prefaces,</hi> I wonder he could not light upon one grown too common of late, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more needless (to say no more) than any he hath mention'd; I mean, a long conceived <hi>Prayer</hi> before <hi>Sermon,</hi> wherein the Preacher presents God Almighty with a large train of <hi>Titles,</hi> and recommends several persons to him under the notion of <hi>Right Honourable, Reverend, Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Learned</hi> and <hi>Worthy,</hi> Earls, Bishops, Knights, Doctors, Esquires, Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Proctours,</hi> Mr. <hi>Taxers, &amp;c.</hi> He could have told them that God Almighty need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be informed of any Mans <hi>Worth</hi> or <hi>Quality,</hi> and that those Titles were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to be offer'd up to God in a solemn <hi>Prayer,</hi> but to be directed to the <hi>People</hi> in an <hi>Exhortation</hi> (according to the LV <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>) to mind them of that due respect they owe to their Superiours. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he says nothing hereof for some reasons best known to himself, I shall for others say no more.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You must know that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Author hath lately been with the Man among the <hi>Tombs,</hi> and raked in dead Mens Ashes for several of the Stories
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103632:45"/>
he entertains you with. For instance, that Text against <hi>Non-residence</hi> and the device of the Triangular <hi>Heart,</hi> are both as old as <hi>Pauls.</hi> He that could not run without <hi>feet,</hi> was a famous <hi>Divine</hi> in his <hi>time,</hi> (he tells you) but that was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himself was out o'th' shell. Parson <hi>Slip-stocking,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,</hi> and many others whose <hi>Ghosts</hi> he brings in, have long since quitted the Stage; and admitting they were once of our Church, and did any of them act their parts ridiculously, yet what is that to the present Clergy? If he can't find in his heart to speak well of the <hi>Dead,</hi> and bury their infirmities with them, yet 'tis the heighth of injustice to charge the <hi>Living</hi> with their personal faults.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You may guess he was once of Mr. <hi>Nye</hi>'s, or Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s, or some such Reformado Congregation, or at least hath frequented <hi>Conventicles</hi> since more than the Church, by a great deal of the idle stuff, and lamentable fooleries he hath the honour to bring to light, it being well known, that canting expressions, and all that way of <hi>talking,</hi> is the proper and Characteristical note of a <hi>Separatist:</hi> And
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103632:46"/>
if he had been as <hi>ingenuous</hi> as the worthy Author of the <hi>Friendly Debates,</hi> he would have set the saddle upon the right Horse, and not have pinn'd the extemporary effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, sanctified nonsense, and intolerable fooleries of those factious Pulpiteers and Intruders, upon that Church they made it their whole business to pluck down by way of Reformation. It is no news to tell how instrumental many of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Authors</hi> he cites, were in that <hi>Great</hi> Work. Nor is it any Miracle that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was abused in those days, when a learned Orthodox Clergy was silenced for their malignant <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and their Pulpits filled with Shoe-makers, Taylors, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Threshers, Coblers, Tinkers, Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Bakers, Fishmongers, Wool-Combers, and all manner of Russet-Rabbies, and Mechanick Divines: No wonder if there was rare work made with <hi>Texts</hi> and <hi>Preachments,</hi> when every one borrowed his Similitudes and Language from his own Trade, comparing <hi>Iacob</hi> to a <hi>Thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Worm,</hi> Repentance to a <hi>Bull-rush,</hi> Man's Body to an <hi>Apple,</hi> his Soul to an <hi>Oyster, &amp;c.</hi> But to lay their grievous extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies at the door of the present Church, is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103632:46"/>
done so like a faithful <hi>Historian,</hi> as if the Sacrilege, Murders, Treasons and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide of those black-soul'd <hi>Rumpers</hi> should be unreasonably wrested to reflect upon this present most Loyal and Renowned <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, The residue of those little pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages and stories he laughs at, are either purely of his own invention, or abused and perverted into ridiculous by his Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Explications: Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears his Genius inclines him to Plays, Poetry and Romances, rather than Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: in those indeed he hath no Law, but to write what he and his Muses please; but in this he must expect to be confined wholly to <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I demand what mortal Man ever heard such terms as <hi>Star-board</hi> and <hi>Lar-board, Sterns</hi> and <hi>Fore-castles</hi> in a Sermon, since Pulpits made of Ships <hi>Beaks</hi> have been out of fashion? No, no, they are his own, as well as the <hi>rering, flanking, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching</hi> and <hi>storming</hi> a Text, together with those touches of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Systeme, <hi>solid</hi> Orbs, and the points of the <hi>Compass,</hi> and comparing the <hi>Moon, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to <hi>Violins</hi> and <hi>Trebbles,</hi> all his own, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103632:47"/>
meerly to give us some hints of his general Accomplishments. First he gives you a taste of his skill in <hi>Navigation,</hi> then in <hi>Military</hi> Discipline; for I can assure you he hath <hi>seen</hi> a Ship, and <hi>heard</hi> of a Fight: but for <hi>Astronomy,</hi> Oh <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my!</hi> —let him alone; and yet, if he make no better use on't, it is to be fear'd he was born under a three-penny <hi>Planet,</hi> (whether according to the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New</hi> Hypothesis it matters not) however he talks sometimes of keeping <hi>Ten Foot-boys,</hi> and being Secretary of <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Those choice Phrases of <hi>hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hewing,</hi> and <hi>splitting</hi> of Texts, (soft and gentle Metaphors taken from riving a tender <hi>Oak</hi>) making <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> a little Ring of Bells, together with the Latine Materials, <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus —silvestrem tenui</hi> — are all his own still. And if he be so good at the <hi>Forge,</hi> and can beat you an entire Fiction out of his own Brain, no wonder he hath a little dexterity at the <hi>File</hi> and <hi>Hammer,</hi> to work his matter into what shape he please, to add or detract, bend or straigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it as occasion serves. Indeed he wrests Mens <hi>Sermons</hi> like a Nose of <hi>Wax,</hi> as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103632:47"/>
Hereticks deal by the <hi>holy</hi> Scriptures, and makes the poor Parson wind and turn all manner of ways, as a <hi>Rider</hi> would do his <hi>Spanish Iennet.</hi> For instance, the story of making Christ a <hi>Shop-keeper,</hi> (however it comes not in hobbling with a <hi>reverence</hi> be it spoken) is most shamefully mis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, the greatest part of it owning no other Author but <hi>himself.</hi> He must pardon me if I credit my own Ears more than his lavish Pen, and any Man that will believe his own Eyes, may find the truth of what I say by consulting the Copy.</p>
            <p>Another he brings in Preaching about Episcopacy, from that Text <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30. <hi>Sirs, What must I do to be saved?</hi> And this (I must tell you) is nothing more than a confident Calumny: for <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was not the business of that Sermon. 'Tis true, the Preacher did by the way reflect upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (for it doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Lords</hi> in plain English) and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate what respect and honour was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Apostles and Pastours of the Church by those <hi>Primitive</hi> Converts: but that he should infer, that <hi>Bishops</hi> were formerly <hi>Peers</hi> of the Realm, and did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103632:48"/>
claim their priviledge of sitting in the House of <hi>Lords,</hi> is such a monstrous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery as you can scarce match it in all <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> though he is so civil as to tell us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand his true Histories are all false. And yet when his hand was in, he could not forbear slandering <hi>another</hi> person of Worth, with another of the same; who, though he did from that Text in St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Seek ye the Kingdom of God</hi>— Observe in <hi>transitu,</hi> that <hi>Monarchy</hi> was the best of Governments, as bearing a nearer resemblance to that of God himself, than any <hi>Aristocracy</hi> or Commonwealth; yet that he should use any such ridiculous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions as those, — <hi>It is not said the</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <hi>of God, the</hi> Army <hi>of God, or the</hi> Committee <hi>of Safety of God,</hi>— is a great untruth, second to none but that I told you of before; so easie a thing it is for a Splenetick <hi>Momus</hi> to take every thing by the wrong handle, and make that look ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous which was spoken never so well and soberly. Now (as we use to say, <hi>ex pede Herculem</hi>) by these instances you may jude of the rest, and guess at the Mans Ingenuity, the greatest part of all those Absurdities charg'd upon Preaching being
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103632:48"/>
either his <hi>own,</hi> or none of <hi>ours,</hi> who have but the least relation (so much as that of Journey-men) to the present Clergy. Wherefore, to shut up this Stage, though we account of such as tell us of our faults truly, modestly, and in private, as of our best Friends; yet we shall beware of them that do not only publish and divulge our private failings to reproach and upbraid us, but make them ten times more than we acknowledge, as of the most ill-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and pernicious of all our <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so I pass on to his second Topick, the Clergy's <hi>Poverty,</hi> to examine whether he hath betray'd more integrity in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting that. And because I have already shewed that the generality even of our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi> Clergy are not so dismally <hi>poor</hi> and shrimped things as he makes them, I shall content my self with some short Remarks upon him now, to leave a little room for my <hi>third</hi> and last Proposition, which, I presume, will end the whole Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
            <p>And here he proceeds to talk after the old wild rate, and hath set the <hi>second</hi> Part to the same Tune exactly with the <hi>first,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:103632:49"/>
taking the same extravagant liberty in his Expressions, Figures and Forgeries. There is the never-enough-to-be-commended <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony,</hi> that dispatcheth one half of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and what remains is made good by the prodigious <hi>all-confounding Hyperbole,</hi> by which he can blow up a <hi>Fly</hi> into the full proportion of five hundred <hi>Camels</hi> put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. When he seems to commend, he mostly jeers; what he pities, he abuseth: when he would deplore his Clergies rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Circumstances, he only laughs till the <hi>tears</hi> stand in his eyes. Take him at one end of his <hi>Glass,</hi> and he'll show you a Mole-hill grown up into a Mountain; and if there be occasion to look at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>high jingo, tanutus</hi> — the old massy Mountain dwindles presently into a young Mole-hill. At first he makes a formal face like some piteous <hi>Statue</hi> in the Wall, that would have us believe it bears up the whole Fabrick by its shrugging; as if it were a burden to his <hi>little</hi> Conscience that our Clergy is not so well provided for as the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of old: but all he drives at in the end, is only to let off a Querk or two, and certifie Mankind that the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men are a greater charge than <hi>Sheep</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:103632:49"/>
and <hi>Oxen,</hi> and that Money and Victuals were not <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> to cease with the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law. At length he shows upon the <hi>High Rope,</hi> and advances to the top of his design, his elaborate Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Vicar,</hi> which, that it might be to the life, he hath ransack'd all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances and Plays written since the King came in, for Accoutrements to make him the most despicable <hi>Lazarillo</hi> in Nature:
<q>For he discovers him walking pensively alone in his Church-yard, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cassock, or without Breeches, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it happen'd to be the <hi>Breeches</hi> or <hi>Cassock-year</hi>) and studying meerly how to live; casting with himself what Piggs, Geese and Apples are towards, who is likely to marry or die next, and sadly remembring that the last Kilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin of Drink is near departed, and that all his Treasure is reduced to one single Groat. Returning to the little Hut, his Mansion-house, he meets with new disasters to enhance his sorrows, a scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Mole had plough'd up most of his Globe, and the malicious Crows tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled down the remaining Grass: then sweep comes the Kite, and robs him of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103632:50"/>
the most hopeful Chick in all the brood: And to make up the <hi>Scene</hi> and ruine him quite, the Jack-daws and Starlings (idle Birds that they are!) scatter'd and carried away forty or fifty of the best Straws from his Thin-thatch'd Roof. Thus rack'd and tortur'd, he tries to weather out his melancholy by retiring into the little hole over the Oven, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Study, <hi>(contriv'd there, I suppose, to save firing)</hi> a pretty little <hi>Vatican,</hi> the whole furniture whereof is a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Systeme, a <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance of the same, a Boudget of old stitch'd Sermons, some broken Girts, with two or three yards of Whip-cord behind the door, and a Saw and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to prevent Dilapidations. But finding his Family cannot be maintain'd with Texts and Contexts, (the Child in the Cradle crying all this while for want of Milk) down he creeps again, and betakes himself to those Heavenly employments, of filling the Dung-Cart in dry weather, pilling of Hemp, and heating the Oven in wet; and, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his willingness to turn a Penny in an honest way, one day he went to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103632:50"/>
upon a Pannier with Turkies and Geese bobbing out their heads under his Canonical Coat: but alas, alas, in his absence the beloved Duck miscarries, or the never-failing Hen forsakes her wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nest, at which he either runs raving about the Yard like a <hi>Lunatick,</hi> or else confines himself to the little <hi>Hole</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, being e'en overwhelmed with grief and despair.—</q>
Now did you ever meet with such a Romantick Whimsie as this in all your Travails? Do you believe he really thinks this is a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>God</hi> he thus sets out, and makes so bold with? Doth he not fully betray that mighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence he has for the <hi>holy</hi> Profession, thus to prevaricate, and coyn an <hi>Eutopian Vicar</hi> meerly to laugh at? Besides, granting there ever was such a forlorn Creature as he describes, yet how ridiculous a thing is this <hi>new</hi> way of Argumentation which concludes from Particulars? For if you will take his word for good <hi>Logick,</hi> one instance or two reflects disparagement, and procures a general disesteem to <hi>all</hi> that Order of holy Men, <hi>pag.</hi> 98. As much as to say, that, if some of the Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> being decayed in their Estates through
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103632:51"/>
their Loyalty to the King, or by their own imprudence, their Children come to be <hi>Tapsters</hi> or <hi>Hostlers,</hi> or any other servile Officers, there must needs be a blot in the Scutcheons of all the rest, though never so flourishing, till Dooms-day.</p>
            <p>Now I shall not undertake to answer his mad Description, but only crave leave to tell you a <hi>Story,</hi> and give him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of bearing a considerable part in it, which (though it be a meer Fiction, and you are requested beforehand not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, yet) may seem perhaps as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and plausible as that he makes no scruple to publish for <hi>true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Spending some time in my Travails at the famous <hi>Hecdecapolis,</hi> I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to a certain Covent of the <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theri,</hi> who are said to have been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Religious Order, and I guess they might, by the ruines of a Chappel I found there, (looking now like a decayed Dove-Cote, from which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are fled for self-preservation) and many ancient Inscriptions in the Walls and Windows: but since they are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and free from all Laws, Vows and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103632:51"/>
Duties, (however it came to pass) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Obligations upon them but to live as their own Genius shall prompt them. In habit they differ not much from other Covents in <hi>Greece,</hi> excepting only this, that they more resemble some of the old conceited Philosophers by their <hi>Beards,</hi> which are above a Cubit long, and set accurately in mood and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. But lest I be mistaken, you must know they hate to be very like those <hi>Old</hi> Men either in their <hi>Opinions</hi> or <hi>Beards</hi>; for whereas they used to hang their <hi>Beards</hi> before in the natural place, these wear them most behind in opposition: besides, their Beards were truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly their own; but these by keeping their Heads too hot, have none of their own, (40 or 50 <hi>Straws</hi> of natural Thatch growing upon the place, being with them almost a Miracle) but make them artificial ones of the Manes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>She-Asses,</hi> cut off once in so many years for that purpose. As for Diet, I know no Covent in <hi>Europe</hi> which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does them; for rejecting all the old me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of living upon Bread, Water and Herbs, and such mean Dispensations,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103632:52"/>
they are plentifully furnisht with all sorts of provisions, from the Wing of an Ox to the Leg of a Lark, all manner of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties Seas or Rivers produce, together with all kinds of <hi>Vehicles,</hi> commonly call'd Liquors, from the most Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally prepar'd and spirituous, down to those of the inferiour Brew-house. Nor do I speak all this by conjecture or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, but as I found by experience; for one of the Fraternity perceiving me cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and inquisitive, as strangers use to be, would needs engage me to eat at their common Table to see their fashions, which I was easily perswaded to, as well to gratifie my hunger as curiosity: the manner whereof was briefly thus: We being summon'd together by their <hi>Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maton</hi> or Clock, and the Table spread, Proclamation was presently made by one of the Machines or Novices, in this short Grace, <hi>Ede, Bibe, Lude,</hi> and then down sate every one as he pleased, and fell to where he liked best. But they had the strangest names for their Meats as well as all things else, that, had not I kept to my old rule of believing my <hi>senses,</hi> had I not seen and scented good store of real
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103632:52"/>
Provender before me, I should have thought my self decoyed to some <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Banquet:</hi> for they call'd a good round Pudding, a solid Orb, (the Plumbs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling fixt Stars;) a Collar of Brawn, a Callous <hi>Cylinder</hi>; a Shoulder of Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a <hi>Triangle</hi>; a couple of Capons, Platonick <hi>Eunuchs</hi>; a Veal Pye, a <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone</hi>; a French Quelque Chose, a fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous <hi>concourse</hi> of delicious <hi>Atoms</hi>; and the Chafing-Dish under it, an <hi>Hypothesis</hi>; Sausages, a Dish of Circles; a heap of wild Fowl, a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> to mention no more. If they want any thing, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to ask it in the Language other Men use, but one cries, Transfuse me some brisk Lyaean Blood into that same Flute; another, Reach hither a few of those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Particles; a third, Pray anatomize that Quadrupede, and accommodate me with a <hi>quantum</hi> of the <hi>Spina dorsi</hi>; and much more I either understood not, or was not then at leisure to remember. When they had taken a free Dose of the <hi>Creature,</hi> as they call it, and their Bellies were grown hard as Drums, the Room began to eccho with their swaggering and bidding defiance to all the Learned
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103632:53"/>
Men that ever were in the World, always excepting themselves. One calls the <hi>Stoicks</hi> Fools for resisting Natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and curbing their Appetites; and the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> Mad-men for abstaining superstitiously from good wholsom Flesh: another doth but name <hi>Aristotle</hi> with his <hi>green</hi> Bag of Occult <hi>Qualities</hi> under his Cloak, and all the Company laugh out right, as if they had found a <hi>Mare</hi>'s-Nests a third brags of the antiquity of their Order, pretending with those <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi> they are elder than the Moon, and had a state of <hi>Prae-existence</hi>: a fourth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates his Telescope-Travels, how many Stars he found out that never were seen before, and peopled with Inhabitants: another jeers <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Systeme off the Hinges, for by this time it was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>World</hi> turn'd round. But I took special notice of one above the rest, (call'd <hi>Boccaline</hi> Junior, Secretary to the Order) who in less than an hours space, beginning with a Preface from <hi>Adam,</hi> ran through all Ages, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Orders of Men, and abused them pleasantly as he went: At first I took him for a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> for he could

raise the Ghosts of a hundred old Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, and make them all dance after his Pipe; he could make a Cat to speak; he could transform a Man into an Ass; dress the wisest up like Fools; and play with Religion it self, as if it were an old Dotage; but afterwards I understood he did all this by the Art of Memory, and only repeated the several Acts, Dogmes, Resolves, and Philosophical Decrees, (clubb'd and agreed upon by a Grand Committee of the whole House) which he is to keep by his place. Thus when they had fill'd their Bellies with Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and other good Chear, the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny broke up, and each retired to their several apartments: only my friendly Guardian took me aside, and honour'd me further with a sight of their Publick <hi>Library,</hi> which I wondred to find so thin of Books, their whole store being only <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Works, <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Dialogues, <hi>Cartes, Hobbs,</hi> and two or three more modern Authors, with two large Files, one of <hi>Gazets,</hi> and the other of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical <hi>News-Books</hi>; but he soon resolv'd me, by informing me that those Shelves were not long since crowded with all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103632:54"/>
sorts of ancient Authors, but by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon decree they had lately Voted them all to be burnt, as so much useless Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber obstructing the growth and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arts and Sciences; and were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon a new Model of Learning, more compendious and demonstrative than the old, which was shortly to be published. At the far end of the Room he shewed me a pair of fair <hi>Globes,</hi> full of Atoms as they could hold, which (he told me in my ear) were Materials to make <hi>new</hi> Worlds: for if one take never so many Bushels out, they still continue top-full, being supplied, he said, by a constant <hi>Effiuvium</hi> from some invisible Rock or Mine. The Classes formerly fill'd with Books, were now taken up with all sorts of Mathematical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Glasses, Pot-Guns, Crucibles, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Experience, Louse-Traps, Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letons of Ants, Fleas, and other little Gentlefolk, Tubes for Transfusion, the the Spleens of Gnats yet alive, several Limbs of Chimaera's, divers pairs of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicorn's Horns, Phoenix's Feathers, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora's Fins, and ten thousand Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Knacks I cannot reckon. When I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103632:54"/>
had sufficiently admir'd all these Rarities, I desired to be satisfied what Principles their Order owned? He was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what shie in answering at first, but when I importun'd him, he told me, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd few of those vulgarly received, some of their main and fundamental ones being to <hi>doubt</hi> of all things that are not demonstrated, gratifie their <hi>appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, preserve</hi> themselves, Philosophize <hi>freely, laugh</hi> at all the World for their <hi>ignorance,</hi> and close with no <hi>Sect</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but comply outwardly with that which is most in fashion, with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso, That they may abstain from Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious <hi>fasting-days</hi> and <hi>fasting-nights,</hi> and all other morose means of <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they acknowledging no other but the present Life.</q>
And thus in short, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thank'd him for all his Cavilities, I took solemn leave of him at his <hi>Covent-Gate,</hi> and now return home again to my little <hi>Doctor</hi> of Atoms, (not doubting but he will candidly interpret <hi>Trick</hi> for <hi>Trick,</hi> and swallow one Pill himself for those many he hath offered a whole Clergy) who by this time finds it to his purpose to caution us, that we have a special care
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103632:55"/>
of comparing Ours with the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church under Persecution, or the present small-preferr'd Clergy in that of <hi>Rome:</hi> for if we do, it is a plain case that Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth not always expose to Contempt, for then they were more obnoxious than we; it was not Money, but something else that preserv'd their esteem, the want whereof may possibly lessen ours, as I shall prove before I have done. And though he be seldom or never in, yet by and by he is still farther out, in giving us a reason why our Liturgy hath not its just estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Corporations</hi>; namely, because it is sometimes read there by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned</hi> Men: for he must either make us believe, that there were never any such Cattel in <hi>England</hi> as the famous <hi>Smectym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuans,</hi> whose task it was to Pray and Preach it out of reputation, to make room for their goodly <hi>Directory,</hi> or that the whole Tribe of <hi>Adoniram</hi> are since cut off and extinct, and don't carry on the same work still in their private Meetings, or at least that their giddy Followers would quickly forsake Conventicles, if they could hear the Churches Prayers read constantly by some Reverend <hi>Prelate,</hi> or Learned

            <p>His last complaint is, that 'tis a great hazard if so <hi>Poor</hi> a Clergy be not idle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate and scandalous. This indeed was an old Article devised by foul-mouth'd Sequestrators, against such as were fat and full, whose very <hi>Benefices</hi> were scandalous, but never urg'd before against the twenty or thirty pound Men: And all Calumnies ought to have some little probability in them, or the <hi>Devil</hi> himself cannot believe them. He told you before that his Vicar had but one <hi>Groat</hi> in the House, and who can imagine he should break an entire Sum to spend his Penny, especially when there is an <hi>Execution</hi> out against it too for Milk and Eggs? Nor is it likely those Parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioners should be so bountiful as to bear him out, whom he had described before to cheat him of his Geese and Pigs, and have so despicable an opinion of him for his tatter'd old fashion'd Habit. Thus he has done with his Grounds of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies disesteem, <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to mine, I must consider a little those particular <hi>Occasions</hi> (he says) concur to make them so pitifully Poor and Contemptible.</p>

But art thou in earnest, my excellent <hi>Contriver?</hi> Is the holy Function grown such a meer Drug in <hi>England,</hi> that it lies so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hands? Have we so many <hi>Tun</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> to spare? (a mannerly Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, pardonable from none but an empty Hogs-head:) so many hundreds ready to mount upon <hi>Pegasus,</hi> and ride down <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> for 25 or 30 <hi>l.</hi> a year? If this be true, then certainly it is not probable, that, having so great choice, we should be so meanly provided at home, as he hath been lamenting all along, but rather (small Preferments being better than none)

that all our Churches and Chappels are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Persons of no inferiour Worth. But is it so in very deed, that we have scarce employment for <hi>half</hi> their number? What then becomes of the other half? Who maintains them? or do they live upon the Camelion's Diet? or how got they into Orders? Either they were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to a <hi>Title,</hi> or not; if to a Title, (be it Spiritual or Temporal) there is somewhat to live on; if to none, their Spiritual Fathers are bound to provide for and maintain them by Law: so that here is yet no visible necessity of recurring to the Old Ordinance of clapping under <hi>Deck</hi> again for <hi>Transportation.</hi> But that one half of the Priests and Deacons now in <hi>England</hi> are Ordain'd to no manner of Title (as he would perswade the World to the great disparagement of our Prelacy) is a wild supposal savouring neither of <hi>Wit</hi> nor <hi>Truth.</hi> All that the greatest candour can say in his excuse, is only this, That upon the Kings Return possibly there were fuller Ordinations than before or since, the Bishops not knowing but there might be a scarcity and want of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to supply the places of those intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Lay-brethren, besides that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Lands lately alienated were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, and the holy Profession began to retrieve its former Reputation: And if we be at present over-stocked, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the true reason of it, the only ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence whereof will be this, that unless our Reverend Bishops shall please to hold their hands awhile, the <hi>old ones</hi> are not likely to be worn out first; I mean, many Persons of good Worth and Learning will be fain to spin out their days in a <hi>College</hi> Cell, who might have done better service <hi>abroad</hi> in their Generation.</p>
            <p>The next thing so much concurring to heighten our Clergies Poverty and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem, he laies at the <hi>Gentries</hi> door, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he shews himself as much a Gentleman, as a Master of Reason. Indeed I thought he owed abundance of thanks to his Stars, if he came off fairly in the business of my Cousin <hi>Abigail:</hi> But in for a thousand, in for fifteen hundred; and having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy set out the <hi>Clergy,</hi> he now proceeds to render the <hi>Gentry</hi> also ridiculous. But have not the <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Nobility</hi> too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served better at our hands, than thus to be traduced, for dedicating some of their

Sons to Gods Service?. Is this so ready a way to bring more Contempt upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and not rather a mean to redeem their credit, to make Church and State a compacted Body of one common interest, and keep a fair correspondence between Clergy and Laity, and prevent all future quarrels between them, which used to be grounded upon an old mistake, that they are naturally as little related, as the <hi>outward</hi> and the <hi>inward</hi> Man, or the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit?</hi>

And now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as you were. A very pretty Relation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! which if it were true, I would fain ask our little-mighty <hi>Oracle</hi> whether it

reflects more upon the <hi>Clergy</hi> or <hi>Gentry?</hi> Oh! without doubt it adds a great lustre to the Family, and commends his Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wisdom, Care, and impartial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when a <hi>Father</hi> leaves a thousand Pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to his <hi>eldest</hi> Son, and and plentiful Portions to all the rest of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> excepting only the <hi>Divinity Thing,</hi> who is left so poor it can but just creep, having nothing but <hi>two Spoons</hi> and a <hi>Pepper-Box</hi> to keep it from starving. But the World is grown too wise to accompt all Gold that glitters, or to shut their eyes till they be trapann'd into the belief of a falshood, though never so plausibly var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd o'er with specious Whimsies, and merry-mad Conceits.</p>
            <p>In the little residue of his Letter, he plays the meer Child, and takes great pains to blow up a few Bubbles and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline <hi>Globuli</hi> into the Air, standing at gaze after them till they burst and vanish: only in the close of all, he reminds his Reader, that he found the word <hi>Religion</hi> in the Title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And how much he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed in the whole <hi>Book,</hi> let other Men judge, and himself consider whether he be not obliged to a second Epistle, to beg

pardon of God and Man for writing the Name of <hi>Religion</hi> upon such a <hi>Fardel</hi> of scandalous Petulancies and Legendary Tales, unless he will be so ingenuous (now the <hi>High-Commission-Court</hi> is asleep) to undergo a voluntary <hi>Penance</hi> at some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Market-Cross, with the Title of his Accusation written under him, <hi>The Author of the Contempt of the Clergy and of Religion.</hi> Where I shall leave him, and proceed to my third and last Proposition, which is this, <hi>That if the English Clergy be not truly valued, it is to be attributed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and those far different Reasons:</hi> which once demonstrated and made good, it will appear evidently that his Letter being built upon a wrong Foundation, falls of it self, and may be burnt without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Truth or Reason, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I hope the deluded World will be undeceived.</p>
            <p>We must confess to our sorrow more than shame, that the holy Function hath been little set by, nay much disparaged and affronted of late years amongst us, (for by the Grace of God they have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved better at the hands of Men than every rash young <hi>Shimei</hi> will allow them) the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103632:59"/>
true Reasons whereof will soon appear, if we consider who and what manner of Persons they are who do most industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously throw Contempt upon them; and they must be either our professed <hi>Enemies,</hi> or pretended <hi>Friends.</hi> Now our Churches <hi>Enemies</hi> are reducible to <hi>three</hi> principal Herds or Bands: The <hi>first</hi> whereof are the openly debauched, profane, and Men A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistically disposed, who think they were born at all adventures, and came into the World, as the <hi>Leviathan</hi> was sent into the <hi>Deep,</hi> meerly to sport and take their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime therein; who are as wise in their own eyes as <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Fool,</hi> and say in their hearts, <hi>There is no God</hi>; who laugh at all things sacred, as being out of their Element, and make no more accompt of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> than of an ordinary piece of State-Policy. It may be they wear the name of <hi>Christians</hi> at large, and own themselves of <hi>ours</hi> rather than any other <hi>Church</hi> for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions sake, or saving their credit, or some secular interest: but if you examine their Principles and Practises more narrowly, they will be found to belong rather to the Devil's <hi>Chappel.</hi> For were they hearty and in earnest, they could not possibly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103632:59"/>
from all Sects of <hi>Religionists</hi> in the World, who do constantly admire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence their respective <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> in what quality or circumstances so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be. But the Grandees and most robust among these modern <hi>Sadduces</hi> don't level their scoffs and reproaches so low as the inferiour Clergy, the little <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars</hi> and <hi>Curates</hi> (that were <hi>impar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressus,</hi> and a fitter task for some young beginner, some <hi>Novice</hi> in Raillery, who hath just parts and skill enough to make a Cobweb-Net that will take the lesser Flies) but aim rather at the chiefest of our Church-Governors, it being a more noble Conquest, a more sure and expedite way to wound <hi>Religion</hi> (that's the great project) through their sides. They are so far from accompting the <hi>Elders</hi> that rule <hi>never</hi> so well worthy of <hi>double,</hi> nay <hi>single</hi> Honour, that they fear not to <hi>revile</hi> Gods <hi>highest Priests,</hi> to deride, slander and lampoon the most renowned Prelate, even when he hath his most solemn audience, when he is delivering his Embassie from the great <hi>Monarch</hi> of Heaven, to his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> here on Earth. So that it is no fault of our <hi>Religion,</hi> or of the <hi>Ministry</hi> thereof, but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103632:60"/>
ruinous decay of <hi>Christian Piety</hi> supplanted of late by Unchristian Practise, (for the true Causes whereof, I refer my Readers to that excellent <hi>Tractate,</hi> whose <hi>Author</hi>'s Name the World is hitherto unworthy of) which prompts this Herd of brutish <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> to defie and contemn our <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> both.</p>
            <p>A second Band of our Churches Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are the <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> who, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the advantage of our late intestine differences; and having learnt of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s pretented Successour to fish most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiously in <hi>troubled waters,</hi> have much augmented, if not doubled their ancient number. And he that made such a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous complaint of our being so much over-stock'd with <hi>Divines,</hi> had never heard of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> brags beyond Sea sure, Sir <hi>Edwyn Sandys</hi> tells us of, that the English <hi>Seminaries</hi> abroad send forth more <hi>Priests</hi> than our two Universities at home do <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters:</hi> And where should the Scene of their Action be laid more properly than in their own Country? What greater ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice can they do the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to infect and poison their Native Air with foreign Vapours? Who more fit to throw
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103632:60"/>
the Kingdom into a Church-relapse, than they who are so well acquainted with the Temper, Language, Manners, Customs, Laws and Religion of the Country? It is not to be question'd but they, and all the Proselytes they either find, or make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, are no Favourers of our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> or <hi>Clergy,</hi> but do privately and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (when they dare) calumniate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry both, as destructive to the Game and Interest they are to manage; and the true and only reason of their contemning and vilifying us, is an eager desire of enlarging their own Territories, that the <hi>Romans</hi> might come in once again, and take away both our <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that our Church neither is, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to be prized by them, more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they are pleas'd to call <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (because they cannot digest their corrupt Innovations for current Gospel) is their <hi>Goodness</hi> more than our <hi>Desert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> and last Body of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Enemies, are the <hi>Fanatick Recusants</hi> in the other extream: for though <hi>Manasseh</hi> declares fiercely against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> exclaims as much against <hi>Manasseh</hi>; yet both combine and unite their forces
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103632:61"/>
against the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> poor <hi>Iudah.</hi> And truly to speak freely, and give these latter their due, I must needs say the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath suffer'd very much of late in her <hi>Reputation</hi> by their means: for they are a sort of clamorous <hi>Zealots,</hi> restless and troublesom <hi>Saints,</hi> as ever pretended to be of <hi>Christs</hi> retinue, who are for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and all things but themselves and their own pernicious Opinions. <hi>Seneca</hi>'s character of unstable Men seems to be calculated particularly for them, <hi>Nihil liberè volunt, nihil abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutè, nihil semper:</hi> for they know not what they would have; and if you grant all their unreasonable demands, they are not satisfied, but still crying with the <hi>Daughters</hi> of the <hi>Horse-leech, Give, give.</hi> They had too precise thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to continue in our Communion; and therefore, like the young brood of <hi>Vipers,</hi> made their way through their <hi>Mothers</hi> Bowels to procure their <hi>own</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: And that there might be room for a <hi>new</hi> Model of Government, necessity obliged them to pluck down the <hi>old</hi> one first. To this end all their artifices, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Preachments,</hi> were directed, they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103632:61"/>
crying out against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Edom</hi> did of old against <hi>Ierusalem, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground</hi>; making nothing to call it oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biously the <hi>Prelatical Faction,</hi> (though themselves are forc'd to confess it is such a <hi>Faction</hi> as hath troubled the Church ever since the <hi>Apostles</hi> times) and by this means they quickly begat an <hi>odium</hi> in Mens Minds as well against the ancient Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, as against the Persons of the Bishops and Orthodox Clergy for their sakes. To them we owe all that Anarchy in Spiritual and Civil Matters, which, like a thick Cloud, did so long overspread us, and broke out at length into Thunder and Lightning about our ears; 'twas the fruit of their worthy Labours that our <hi>Goshen</hi> was turned into an <hi>Egypt</hi> by Usurping Tyrants who knew not <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and the <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> served for no other use a long time but to scourge the Sons of <hi>Levi.</hi> Nor is it any wonder that the prejudices they raised against our Liturgy and its Assertours are not yet worn out, considering how presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and in despight of all Law both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Civil, the Nonconformists still
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103632:62"/>
keep up their private <hi>Conventicles</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Brethren in all the false Notions they had formerly imbibed. But all this while the true reason that this whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (taking in all its sub-divisions) despise and oppose our Reverend Clergy, is, for their constant and approved Loyalty to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> and sticking close to both in all Weathers, it being their most sacred Principle, <hi>Not to meddle with them that are given to Change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How great a part of the Nation these three Squadrons of our Churches Enemies make, is too sad a Theme for me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon; they have over-spread the Land like Locusts, and 'twould puzzle a very good Arithmetician to compute them; it is sufficient for my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that none of them dislike our Clergy either for their <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Poverty,</hi> (for the more Rich and Learned it is, the worse they hate or envy it) but upon vastly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Motives; the first speak evil of them (and all things sacred) purely on the accompt of their own <hi>irreligion</hi>; the second, for their opposing the corrupted Doctrine and Discipline of <hi>Rome</hi>; the third, for their malignant <hi>Loyalty</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd

            <p>However, if we find out a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and substantial Reason why they are also wanting in their due estimation of the Priesthood, than either of those two our small Conjecturer hath hit upon, his business, I presume, will be compleatly done; he may e'en sit him down and guess again, or rather take the Poets advice along with him for the future,

               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:103632:63"/>Now if we would speak out, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer plainly and truly how it comes to pass that so many of our pretended Friends give us not due respect and honour, we must say it is because our <hi>Clergy</hi> are not publickly allowed the <hi>Authority</hi> due to their Function, and necessary for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the power of the <hi>Keys</hi>; I mean, the want of that godly Discipline of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>Penance</hi> in the Primitive Church, which our Church of <hi>England</hi> hath long since wished for, and Sir <hi>Edwyn Sandys</hi> saith might have been better restored in all the <hi>reformed</hi> Churches to its Primitive sincerity, than utterly abolished and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as in most places it is: for although we do justly charge the present Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for corrupting and degenerating from this ancient holy Discipline by their notorious abuses of it, particularly by their laying the main stress and efficacy of it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the definitive sentence of <hi>Absolution,</hi> (which, according to the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, is given before any fruits of Repentance are produced, and requires no after penance, but a few <hi>Ave Maries</hi> and <hi>Pater Nosters,</hi> with some easie <hi>Alms</hi> to them that are <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and a little <hi>fasting</hi> to such as are <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>;

and sometimes for horrible Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and other lewdnesses, imposeth only the bare saying of their Beads thrice over, which they may dispatch too as they go in the streets:) their believing and teaching that by such like Penances the debt of temporal punishment is redeemed after the sin is pardoned, the people all this while making accompt of <hi>Confession</hi> as professed Drunkards do of vomiting, and the Priest using it as a Pick-lock to tyrannize over, and torture Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and make way for the dangerous delusions of <hi>Indulgences</hi>; yet, I say, no Reformed Church can excuse it self, which to avoid their extravagant abuses, is faln into the other extream, and lets the sober use of so excellent a piece of Discipline grow into utter desuetude and neglect: for it must not, it cannot be denied in the first place, but that the power of the Keys (to be executed not only in admitting Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to Church-membership by Baptism, but also in rejecting Heretical, Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and immoral Professours, and then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving and re-admitting them into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, upon their unfeigned submission, and demonstrations of sincere Repentance)
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103632:64"/>
is founded immediately upon our Lords own Institution, and the Apostles and their Successours to the Worlds end, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Authority from, and act by the same Commission given them, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Whatsoever ye</hi> bind <hi>on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven</hi>; or as it is explained and renewed, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.23. <hi>Whole sins soever ye</hi> remit, <hi>they are</hi> remitted <hi>unto them; and whose sins soever ye retain, they are retained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor, Secondly, can it be denied by any Man that is acquainted with the Sects of the <hi>Montanists, Novatians, Donatists,</hi> and <hi>Meletians,</hi> and understands the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Primitive Church, legible in the Writings of the Apostles, ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils, (particularly that of <hi>Elvira</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> held divers years before that at <hi>Nicaea,</hi> and therefore counted as ancient as any the Church hath) but that the cure of sin by penance is an unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Tradition of the Apostles. Not to mention many other obvious Texts to that purpose, the most natural and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s charge to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay hands suddenly on
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103632:64"/>
no man, neither be partaker of other mens sins,</hi> must needs be fetcht from that known Apostolical Custom, of admitting lapsed Christians to penance and the Prayers of the Church by imposition of hands.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and lastly, Secret Confession of Sins (otherwise not notorious) in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their cure, hath been the inviolate practice of the Western (bating their abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses aforesaid) and also of the Eastern Churches, particularly that of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> even to this day; and it is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and pressed as a duty incumbent on the generality of Christians, as well by the ancient Fathers as modern Authors both of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and also of the Reformation. The <hi>Augustine</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession says peremptorily, <hi>Impium esset ex Ecclesiâ tollere privatam Absolutionem,</hi> That it were an ungodly, a sacrilegious thing to rob the Church of Christ of private Absolution. And <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in his <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Concil. Trid.</hi> gives a fivefold accompt of the use and profitableness of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of private Confession.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the information of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant concerning the true knowledge, the degrees and heinousness of sin, and the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103632:65"/>
right way of performing repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For Physick, <hi>viz.</hi> how each sin is so to be cured and mortified, that it may be avoided for the future, and what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life is to be opposed to such and such sins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For Counsel, that in doubtful cases Pastours may advise and instruct their Flocks out of Gods Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For Spiritual Comfort, to relieve disturbed Consciences.</p>
            <p>Lastly, (because Absolution is to be given only to such as appear truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) that the Pastour himself may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured whether he ought to <hi>bind</hi> or <hi>loose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular refuseth the benefit of it to none, urgeth it <hi>in extremis,</hi> and requires it for quieting of troubled Consciences, as is manifest in her several Offices of the <hi>Communion,</hi> and the <hi>Visitation</hi> of the sick. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, woful experience tells us, that the practice of this holy Discipline hath been declining every day more and more ever since that desperate opinion was first broacht in the World, That Men are <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by believing they are predestinated to life,</hi> (which resolves all Christian Duties into
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103632:65"/>
a new notion of <hi>Faith,</hi> little different from a <hi>strong fancy</hi>) and is now grown almost utterly out of fashion amongst us, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (I fear) likely to recover its ancient practise. Now the want of this most reasonable and necessary Discipline, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with very many dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, such as these: The practise of religious Duties in general runs to decay: Men grow accustomed to, and at length hardned in their sins, by satisfying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a superficial repentance, or none at all: They content themselves with a palliative cure oft-times in stead of a sound one, by reason of their own ignorance or partiality; for every Man hath not skill enough to be his own Physitian; and they that have, do wilfully mistake sometimes a Cordial for a Corrosive: They rush un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily upon that <hi>Tremendum Evangelit Mysterium,</hi> (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calls the Sacrament of the Eucharist) without due preparation: They fall into Heresies and Errours by leaning to their own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, by mis-interpreting or mis-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the holy Scriptures, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting with, and submitting to better Judgments: Their Consciences are seldom
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103632:66"/>
quiet, but like the troubled Sea, boysing up despairing thoughts, because they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not themselves to the Delegates and Commissaries of Him, whom the <hi>Winds</hi> and the <hi>Sea obeyed,</hi> I mean, the Priests of the living God: They venture their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon slender and uncertain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and hinder their Pastour from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the best Offices he can for them, (and most likely to succeed) in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: All that they will allow him, is, to shoot at rovers, and preach his heart out in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stising sin in general, whereas an occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal private conference with <hi>Him</hi> now and then, were much more probable to effect their particular cure. No Man ever doubted, but one good remedy well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by a skilful Hand, is more likely to cure a Man of the Gout or Dropsie, than the hearing of five hundred Anatomy-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures to that purpose. And amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>other</hi> ill conseqences, this is evidently <hi>one,</hi> That the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> is in part taken away, the due Authority of the Priesthood restrained and impaired, and consequently their esteem lessen'd, their Function not valued as it ought to be by the People, and their Persons sometimes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103632:66"/>
exposed to Contempt: And therefore let but this ancient holy Discipline be restored amongst us, either by a publick Act of the Church, or by the unanimous practise of those that profess themselves of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and then let common sense judge if these effects will not necessarily follow upon it: The Life of Religion will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow more into fashion: Men will be more careful of discharging their Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Vow, more afraid of sin, more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in their Repentance, Fastings, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Works of Charity, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the People must needs believe that their Pastours <hi>belong to God more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Folks</hi>; they cannot but have a hearty respect, and honourable esteem for their Spiritual Guides and Physitians, who watch daily over their Souls, by whose prudent Conduct, faithful Advices, and ghostly Comfort, they live quietly and peaceably here in all Godliness and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and in the end attain to Everlasting Life.</p>

            <head>The Conclusion.</head>
            <p>NOw having so fair an occasion offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, give me leave to expostulate a while with all those who profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of our Communion, and yet do not heartily respect and value the <hi>holy Function,</hi> meerly because they neglect the use of that Catholick and Apostolick Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline aforesaid, and I have done.</p>
            <p>When our <hi>Enemies</hi> reproach us, we can bear it cheerfully, <hi>rejoycing</hi> (with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41.) <hi>that we are counted worthy to suffer shame for his Name.</hi> But if you that are our <hi>Companions</hi> and dear <hi>Brethren, who walk together with us to the House of God as Friends,</hi> Psal. 55. who have eaten frequently (not of our <hi>Bread</hi> perhaps, as <hi>David</hi> complains, but) of the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> administred by us; if <hi>You</hi> also undervalue our Persons or Office when we deserve it not, (so far we are compelled to boast of our Infirmities) <hi>Forgive us this wrong.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; — an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served slight from her own <hi>Sons</hi> is the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103632:67"/>
greatest stab you can make at your indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Mothers</hi> Heart. Wherefore let me beseech you in Her Name to take these few short particulars into your most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impartial thoughts.</p>
            <p>Consider, First, that whilst you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>unkind</hi> towards us, you are all this while much more <hi>cruel</hi> to your selves: for we lose only a Temporal Good, your favour, but you deprive your selves of many Spiritual Comforts, and possibly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard your Eternal too.</p>
            <p>Consider, Secondly, that you are easily perswaded to send for a Physitian when you lie sick of a malignant Feaver, and to conceive a good opinion of him when (under God) he restores you from Death to Life; and what should be the reason that a mortal <hi>Body</hi> is prized so highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an immortal <hi>Soul?</hi> or what pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is it to be more sollicitous for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving a <hi>Temporal,</hi> than for securing an <hi>Eternal</hi> Life? Neither Physitian is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do you much service, if you defer consulting them till the last gasp upon your Death-bed, as the manner of some is; and if you be shie of discovering your Disease to <hi>either,</hi> what expectations
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103632:68"/>
can you reasonably have of being cured? <hi>Si erubescat aegrotus Medico vulnus confite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, quod ignorat Medicina, non curat,</hi> saith St. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon this very subject: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord and Master hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> to us, yet you must give us power to exercise them upon you by your own voluntary act, or you cannot reap due advantage by them.</p>
            <p>Consider, Thirdly, that the Apostles express command is general, that ye should <hi>confess your sins one to another,</hi> St. <hi>Iames</hi> 5.16. Now the reason of that command is clear both by the Context and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that ye may have the benefit of the Prayers, and Christian <hi>advice</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> no Man being a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judge in his <hi>own</hi> cause. Much more then ought you to unbosom your selves, and disclose your grievances to your <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours,</hi> who are presumed to be best able to solve your doubts, and supply your spiritual wants, and who <hi>only</hi> are intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ as his Delegates to <hi>absolve</hi> sincere <hi>Penitents</hi> from all their sins.</p>
            <p>Consider, Fourthly, that you have been often importuned in the former Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation before the <hi>Communion,</hi> to repair to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103632:68"/>
your <hi>own,</hi> or (in case of his sickness, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent age, or any like infirmity) some <hi>other discreet and learned Minister of Gods Word, and to open your grief to Him, that ye may receive ghostly comfort, counsel and Absolution for the relief of your distressed Consciences.</hi> And how many sad instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did our late Times produce of those, who by neglecting this (very) <hi>old</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Duty, and puzzling their Brains with <hi>new</hi> Notions of Gods unsearchable <hi>Decrees,</hi> not only lost their <hi>Wits,</hi> but fell into utter despair of ever being <hi>saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider, Lastly, how provident and tender your Mother the Church is, lest your <hi>secrets</hi> should be at any time betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, your <hi>privacies</hi> made <hi>publick</hi> by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful or imprudent <hi>Confessour:</hi> for in her 113 Canon she pronounces such an one <hi>Irregular ipso facto:</hi> that is to say, the party so offending doth not only forfeit all the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Preferments which he hath at the present, but renders himself uncapable of receiving any other for the time to come: and <hi>Confession</hi> made upon such security, will be as saving to the <hi>fame</hi> of the Penitent, as the <hi>Absolution</hi> to his <hi>Soul,</hi> as the Learned Doctor <hi>H.</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:103632:69"/>And so I conclude all with my hearty Prayers to God for you, that He would enlighten and quit your Minds from all Prejudices, and incline your Wills to the unanimous and speedy practice of so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Christian Duty, (or Priviledge rather) so immediately concerning the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Gods</hi> Glory, the redeeming the Honour of His <hi>Priests,</hi> and the eternal Salvation of your own <hi>Souls,</hi> through Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi>

            <p>THese Papers had long since been in the Press, but that I heard of a second Part of the <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> coming out, by the <hi>same</hi> Author, which I was willing to see and peruse before I published them. And although I find it to be another mans Province to make a Reply to that, (if yet such a trifling piece of Impertinence be worthy of any) and am resolved not to be so pragmatical, as to thrust my Sicle into another mans Field; yet I think my self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned briefly to animadvert upon those particular passages therein, whereby the Author seems to mince the matter, and excuse himself, or put by the thrusts, and weaken any argument I have made against his first
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103632:70"/>
Letter. I begin with those passages, where he alters the scene, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of our Clergy, which (saith he, <hi>pag.</hi> 33.) the <hi>whole world have always admired, and have reason still to do, and our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to dread,</hi> And again, <hi>pag.</hi> 35. <hi>I know no reason to deny that the Clergy of the Land doth daily considerably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</hi> And again, <hi>pag.</hi> 184. <hi>It is a sign of nothing but perfect madness, ignorance, and stupidity not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the present Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>affords as considerable Scholars, and as solid and eloquent Preachers, as are any where to be found in the whole Christian World.</hi> This is somewhat like; I hope we shall bring him to speak truth in time. Now our Clergy is either strangely improved in a very short space, or else <hi>T. B.</hi> hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his mind; for it is not a year a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go since he laid the imputation of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> upon the very same
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103632:70"/>
Clergy to which he now attributes so much <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Wisdom.</hi> I have already shewn that his <hi>first</hi> Letter is built upon a false foundation, and consequently, that the superstructure thereof is as weak and sensless, as if he had spoil'd so much paper to give us an account of the grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why a Tub should hold as much water with a Carp of twenty inches long in it, as without it, when all this while, upon experiment, there is no such matter: and I have only this to say now, that he makes us but a poor requital in this; He first breaks our head, and then pretends to give us a Plaister. He calls us all at naught, and then says he did not <hi>design</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us harm: He wounds and stabs our Reputation so deep, that it's past his skill to cure it suddenly (as good a Mountebanck as he would be thought) without leaving a dreadful skar behind; and he is much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103632:71"/>
to the world, if they will rather credit these his second thoughts, and take them to be as unalterable as his last Will and Testament.</p>
            <p>In the next place he is forced to confess what I had urged at large a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, by acquainting us (<hi>p.</hi> 62.) who they were he chiefly intended to charge with <hi>rude, immodest,</hi> and <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most blasphemous discourses</hi> in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and putting them off with those <hi>little</hi> mollifying sentences, as <hi>it were,</hi> as <hi>I may so say, and with reverence be it spoken</hi>; they <hi>were those</hi> (says he) <hi>who in the late times (and have not as yet left it off) called themselves God's special Saints, his Favourites, and</hi> (as I <hi>may so say</hi>) <hi>his Intimado's, but in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were more Oliver's than Gods</hi>; (meaning, I suppose, St. <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> who was canoniz'd at <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> and the rest of those Trumpeters of Sedition who were Chaplains to that Grand <hi>Vsurper.</hi>) And again, to stop
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103632:71"/>
the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> mouth, he tells them (<hi>p.</hi> 101.) <hi>that their dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are as much concerned as any body else</hi> (in his first Letter) <hi>and have as great a share in those Instances that are produced out of idle Sermons:</hi> So that his way of arguing is most prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously clear and convincing (as I have formerly intimated.) <hi>Peters</hi> and <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> &amp;c. preacht Rebellion, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Blasphemies: <hi>ergo,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Clergy did cut off the Kings Head. Now I appeal to all mankind, if it be fair play to make a Linsey-woolsey History of Conformists and Non-conformists, of the Loyal and Orthodox Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> and those persidious Apostated Sons of <hi>Korah,</hi> without all manner of distinction, (they being of more irreconcilable Principles and Practices, than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant and a Papist,) and then father the faults of the guilty upon the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; as <hi>Nero</hi> charged the Christians
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103632:72"/>
with firing of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he knew it was done by himself, and his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Nay, he is not content to do it himself only, but brings in the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> to bear false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for him (<hi>pag.</hi> 81. of the first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) by wresting his words from their intended and plain sense, as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is: for the <hi>usual Preaching</hi> Mr. <hi>Th.</hi> chastiseth as a <hi>hinderance rather</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> is that of the factious Separatists, (not of our Orthodox Clergy) whom he there calls <hi>their</hi> Preachers, and charges them further with their <hi>Will-worship</hi> Prayers after <hi>Sermon,</hi> whereby <hi>evil Doctrine</hi> (saith he) is <hi>repeated to God, for a blessing of his Spirit upon it,</hi> as you may see at large in his Book of <hi>Iust Weights and Measures,</hi> cap. 22. pag. 152, 153. And therefore this <hi>ingenuous</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man must not think to shelter himself under the sober Author of the <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Debate</hi> his wing (although he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103632:72"/>
would fain make him his Voucher and Paralel, <hi>page</hi> 83.) for the <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison</hi> (as I may so say) is very odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. A Garment suited to the fickle <hi>Moon,</hi> cannot well fit the constant <hi>Sun.</hi> Surely there is some small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>one</hi> that relates the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> absurdities of <hi>false</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, spurious Church-men, who have renounc'd the Faith of English Christians; and <hi>another,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes to pin <hi>false</hi> stories and fooleries upon our <hi>true</hi> genuine and learned Clergy: as much as to say, because <hi>that Author</hi> calls it <hi>murder</hi> to kill a man upon the Kings High way, <hi>ours</hi> may be allowed to say it is also <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> for a Judge to sentence a Felon to die, upon Conviction, or for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner to do his Office.</p>
            <p>In other places he makes a face as if he had a mind to commence Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, eat his words, repent of his manner of expression, and perswade
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103632:73"/>
us of his good meaning, and honest intentions at the bottom: for he says (<hi>pag.</hi> 81.) <hi>I am not yet come to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of self-conceit and confidence, as to recommend my own words, phrase, or style; and I had rather the Answerer should find fault with the manner of my expression, and delight himself in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is not suitable to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than be guilty of so much folly and impudence, as vigorously to maintain or magnifie the same: Only thus much Sir</hi> (speaking to <hi>R.

represented unprofitable, or ridiculous</hi>: And (<hi>pag.</hi> 101.) <hi>It was altogether against my design to bring any of the Clergy into contempt,</hi> &amp;c. A fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession one would think, but it must be examined with much tenderness and charity, or there will be found very little of reality in it: For if it be <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>Impudence</hi> to maintain the <hi>style</hi> and manner of <hi>expression</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> Letter, as not <hi>suitable</hi> to the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> why does he carry on the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, and continue the same strain in the second? He says further, he did not put in one <hi>idle</hi> or <hi>extravagant</hi> word (into the first part) on <hi>purpose</hi> to make any of the <hi>Clergy Contemptible</hi>; and 'tis strange men will not believe him, when they find it one great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of his <hi>second</hi> Adventure, to <hi>keep people awake</hi> still, that is, to rake up some hundreds of <hi>idle extravagant</hi> words, meerly to expose his <hi>Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> who is <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103632:74"/>
it was altogether <hi>against</hi> his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> to bring his <hi>Answerer</hi> (and the rest of his Brethren) into <hi>Contempt,</hi> when he laughs all along, rather than writes at him, and only tickles the skirts of the business with affected flourishes, answering his most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial objections, with fine stories of a <hi>Cock</hi> and a <hi>Bull,</hi> and <hi>Heyte Teyte's,</hi> or to <hi>morrow</hi> morning I found a <hi>Horse-shooe</hi>; but I must tell him, that, to perswade the world we <hi>intend</hi> no hurt, and design honestly, when our actions visibly run counter, is an old, an antiquated <hi>cheat</hi> that will not down with wise men now adays, being fit to be owned by none but such ungodly miscreants, as could take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and at length murder their lawful <hi>Sovereign,</hi> under pretence of <hi>meaning well</hi> all this while, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi> only to make him a <hi>glorious</hi> King.</p>
            <p>To proceed; better late than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103632:74"/>
(<hi>p.</hi> 86.) he takes notice that the <hi>Bishops have augmented the Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in their gift,</hi> (and who knows but he <hi>intended</hi> to put in the Deans and Chapters too) and tells us of <hi>sums</hi> of <hi>money</hi> employed towards the redeeming of the <hi>great Tithes, of Impropriations restored,</hi> and of the <hi>good Inclinations</hi> of this present <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. but this should have been done in his first Letter by right, and perhaps he had done it there, but that he <hi>did</hi> not think on't; or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>did</hi> think on't: for it would have taken off somewhat from the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> and shrimpedness of his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, he was then describing. However he falls to <hi>salving</hi> again at the foot of this page, saying, <hi>I hope I have said nothing to abate the charity, or good purposes of pious Benefactors, or to stop the assisting hands of our present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</hi> No? then he is infinitely obliged to them that they don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103632:75"/>
him; for if all those he calls the <hi>Poor Clergy,</hi> be so <hi>Ignorant</hi> as he makes them, (assigning the particular reasons to shew it impossible it should be otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi> their mean Education, want of <hi>Money, Books, Time,</hi> and such other things, without which few men prove very great Scholars) 'Tis pity their maintenance should be made better; 30 <hi>l. per an.</hi> being rather too large and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent an allowance for such pitiful fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as he most invidiously and falsly makes them. But thanks be to God, our present Governours and Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors don't take all for current Gospel that every gifted Lay-Brother talks at rovers, knowing full well that the generality even of our inferiour Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are of good worth and note; and see no shadow of reason in <hi>both</hi> his <hi>Letters</hi> (nor ever will in an <hi>hundred</hi> more of the same stamp) to alter their <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> Intentions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:103632:75"/>Lastly, whereas he fancies (<hi>page</hi> 101.) that, <hi>if any are so weak, and so regardless as to mistake him,</hi> (viz. by thinking his design was to bring the Clergy into Contempt) <hi>they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some of the giddy and soft-headed Non-Conformists, or some of the idle and inconsiderable Laity,</hi> I must assure him that a very great part of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> Clergy and most <hi>considerable</hi> Laity too are very much of the same opinion, it being past their skill to find out any more rational and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible end that should prompt him to make such an Adventure in <hi>English,</hi> since, had he clothed his Discourse in (that so much despised thing called) <hi>Latine,</hi> it could not have been half so obnoxious. And albeit in the sequel of his discourse he bids the <hi>Papists, Non-Conformists, conceited</hi> new <hi>Philosophists,</hi> modish <hi>Gallants, Hectors,</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> of the age hold their tongues, showing he can make
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103632:76"/>
the best of them all ridiculous if he please; yet what satisfaction is this to the injured <hi>Clergy</hi>? he sends them more company indeed, but such as they never much delighted in; and he must not think he can undeceive such men with as much ease as he hath deceived them: for (let him write till Doomsday to the contrary) they will take him at his first word, and believe he hath given them sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficient reason, <hi>grounds,</hi> and <hi>occasion</hi> to blaspheme the <hi>holy Function.</hi> In the mean time, since, a man of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors parts and confidence may play with any <hi>other subject</hi> in the world as well as <hi>this,</hi> and abuse any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of men whether Gentry, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Physicians, Citizens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilst he takes the liberty of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he pleases, by inventing false stories, adding to, pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wresting such as are, in part, true, and carrying on the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103632:76"/>
whole work of a Romancer, I hope all sober Christians, will think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the worse of, but rather increase their esteem and good opinion of so <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> a Clergy.</p>
