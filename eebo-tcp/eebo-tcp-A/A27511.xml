                  <note>Attributed by George Thomason and in most bibliographies to Richard Bernard, minister of Batcombe. In a 1661 edition, with a somewhat different title, the authorship is ascribed to John Barnard, minister of Batcombe. Since Richard Bernard was minister at Batcombe 1613-1641, and was succeeded by Richard Alleine, it is evident that the publisher either incorrectly attributes the work to Bernard or gives him the wrong Christian name. It is not clear whether Richard Bernard, a Puritan, held such views upon episcopacy in 1641. This work may have been by John Bernard, a Presbyterian, author of the Independents catechisme, 1645. cf. Emanuel Green, Bibliotheca Somersetensis. 1902. v. 2, p. 165.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>They are pleaſed with the peoples ignorance, and their contentedneſſe, reſting in a long read ſervice without bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtruction, holding reading to be preaching, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching no part of divine ſervice, that ſo ſuch ſilly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be nufled in groſſe blindneſſe, periſhing for lacke of knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53538:19"/>They ſuppreſſe Lectures and Sermons in the afternoone and allow no queſtions in Catechizing, but onely ſuch as be in the very common Catechiſme much hindering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of knowledge.</p>
               <p>They will permit no Miniſter to preach, or to expound in his own Pariſh without paying for a Licenſe, for which when he hath paid, they never care whither hee preach or no.</p>
               <p>They will allow none of the people to ſeeke for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, when they want it at home, nor yet preſſe the Miniſter to the diſcharge of his duty, but trouble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>They never trouble any Miniſter for neglect of his duty in preaching. But diligent preachers they have a jealous eye over, and are ready to take an occaſion to vexe them as not for their turne.</p>
               <p>They ſinfully trouble thouſands of Churchwardens and Sidemen, making them ſweare to their Articles, which cannot be obſerved.</p>
               <p>They hinder prohibitions, ſtop the courſes of Law, and terrifie both <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Iudges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They dare to fine and impriſon without Law, going beyond all Spirituall power, yea, the Lawes of our Land.</p>
               <p>They have ever beene plotting to enſnare Chriſts pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters, that they might roote them out.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They preſſed upon them ſubſcription, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and ſo caſt out very many.</p>

               <p n="3">III. They procured the reading of the Declaration for prophaning the Sabbath our Lords day, and hereby many were ſuſpended, excommunicated, and ſome deprived.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. When they ſaw, that all theſe things would not bring to paſſe their intended miſchiefe, they lately framed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53538:20"/>
a wicked Oath, to be tendered to all Gods Miniſters, which whoſoever would not take, ſhould be ſuſpended firſt, and after deprived.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to make up the meaſure of their evils, they have illegally given a Subſidie to be extorted from us, under the name of a benevolence, which whoſoever ſhall refuſe to pay, is utterly undone according to their mercileſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in a book publiſhed, which now they are loath ſhould ſee the light, and be read of any judicious, and religious Lay men.</p>
               <p>They are the cauſe of the Diviſion and Separation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, by their Lordly rule, their rigour in exacting conformity, and their cruell dealing with ſuch as doe not obey their Lordly wills.</p>
               <p>They ſuffer <hi>Papiſts</hi> and nouriſh <hi>Arminians</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of their Church, to the diſturbance &amp; danger of the true Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and this whole ſtate.</p>
               <p>They allow to vaine people Revils, <hi>heatheniſh vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, vnchriſtian meetings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that on the Lords day to prophane it, and have procured a Declaration for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Licentious liberty in every Church, and ſuch Miniſters as refuſed, they did ſuſpend, excommunicate, and ſome they deprived. The like never heard of in any Church of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They will have bowing to Altars, and yet permit noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offenders, yea <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Murtherers</hi> condemned, (if they have gotten pardons) to come to the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before ſatiſfaction be given to the Congregation; yea drunkards, blaſphemous Swearers, infamous Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and other vile perſons may receive, and not be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if they can ſatiſfie their Courts, and free themſelves from thence, though they doe not manifeſt their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Congregation, eating and drinking the holy Sacrament unworthily to their owne damnation, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe
