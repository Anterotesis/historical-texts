            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An account of ſome Grounds and Reaſons of the Innocent Sufferings of the people of God called Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AKERS, and why they teſtifie againſt the vain cuſtoms and practices of the World.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>FRIENDS.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange unto you, as it doth unto others, to hear that ſo many of our Friends ſhould be caſt into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, there being few Goales or houſes of Correction in <hi>England</hi> to which ſome of them have not been commited, &amp; you partly know, how many of them are this day in Bonds, and it is no leſs ſtrange to us, that ſuch frequent and heavy ſufferings, for matters of conſcience ſhould come upon us and our brethren, who for the moſt part have been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with you and others, for caſting off that yoke of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which at the beginning of the late wars, lay upon the honeſt people of this Land; which made many fly into ſtrange Nations, and to ſeek habitations in the deſerts; but we wonder the more, that they ſhould come from thoſe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted our friends (that ſo much have pretended the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience) and many of themſelves practiſed the ſame things for which we now ſuffer.</p>
            <p>May we not ask what hath been done by our friends? What Lawes are theſe which they have broken? Whoſe Perſons, or Poſſeſſions have they wronged? What force or violence have they uſed to any man? Have you found them in Plots, or guilty of Sedition, or making reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt authority? Have they not patiently born the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſufferings that any people of this Nation ever lay under, ſince <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes, without murmuring, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents?
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115771:15"/>
And when have they ſought to revenge themſelves, or troubled you or others, to be repaired for thoſe many injuries and falſe impriſonments which they have endured? How have they been counted as Sheep for the ſlaughter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecuted, and deſpiſed, beaten, ſtoned, wounded, ſtocked, whipped, haled out of the Synagogues, and caſt into Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and noyſom Vaults, where many of them have dyed in bonds, ſhut up from their Friends, denyed needful ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for ſeveral dayes together, not ſuffered to have Pen, Ink, or Paper; And when they have layen there many moneths, and ſome of them years, denyed a Legal tryal, continued from Seſſions to Aſſizes, and from one Aſſizes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and no eqnity to be found, from Judge, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</p>
            <p>If it be anſwered to us they are common diſturbers of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, they will not pay Tythes, they will not ſwear, they will not put off their hats, they travel up and down from one country to another, without a Magiſtrates Paſſe, and on the firſt dayes to meetings at great diſtance, they will not pay fees, when they are brought into Courts, nor plead in the formes there uſed, nor give ſecurity to keep the Peace, or to be of the good behaviour, when the Juſtices of the Peace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; And we have Lawes, or cuſtomes, that require theſe things ſhould be done.</p>
            <p>It is forgotten what was one of the great cauſes of our late Wars, the ſufferings that then was impoſed, and lay upon many for matters of conſcience; And was it not a chief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of our fighting, that we might enjoy the freedom of conſcience, as well as outward rights, not onely in the Inner man (for that the Biſhops, or high Commiſſion Court could not hinder) but the free exerciſe in all acts of Piety, and Religion, of what the Lord ſhould make manifeſt unto us? but whether this was then intended, or is now perverted, it is that which is our right, which we muſt claim, and no man may take from us; for this we know, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> alone hath right to rule over the conſciences of men, unto whom every one muſt give an account of himſelf, according to the juſt, perfect, and unchangeable Law of God which is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with that alone of God, which is made manifeſt in man,
<pb facs="tcp:115771:15"/>
which he hath ſhewed unto him, by wch every one ſhal be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the laſt day, when the book of conſcience ſhal be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore all unequal, imperfect &amp; changeable Laws of men we do deny, and by them, and for their tranſgreſſion we ſhall not be judged of the Lord; And all Lawes made in their wills, by their wiſdoms in the things of God, which concerns religion, and the free exerciſe of a good conſcience towards God and man, againſt them all we do bear witneſſe, and knowing the commandments of the Lord, and what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, and having taſted his tender love, to thoſe that keep them, and felt his terrors againſt all diſobedience, we are made willing to bear the greateſt ſufferings, rather then ſin againſt God; and in this ground we ſtand not careful what man can do unto us, or ſay of us, nor to give him an anſwer in this matter; For whether it is better to obey God, or man, Let him judge.</p>
            <p>Yet here to prevent miſtakes, we do with the like clearneſſe declare our free and willing ſubjection in the things of this World, to every ordinance of man that is juſt (according to the Righteous Law of God) and our work is not to weaken, but to ſtrengthen the hand of the Magiſtrate, by labouring to bring all to own that of God which ſhould exerciſe their conſciences; To do in all things, as they would be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in which is fulfilled the Law and the Prophets, which takes away the occaſion it ſelf of the Law, and brings to live in peace and love, wherein ſhould be the Magiſtrates joy and glory.</p>
            <p>And do but look back to the crimes charged againſt us, and all the ſufferings we lie under, and you may clearly ſee, that not for any evil done, or juſt Law broken that concerns man, are we thus puniſhed; but for things which concernes our God, and chiefly for bearing our witneſſe, as we are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord againſt the falſe Prophets and hirelings of theſe dayes, who by their fruits are made manifeſt, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto us, but to many thouſands beſides; yea, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of all the ſober people of the nation, their own hearers will confeſſe it; and we ſee and know that they and all Miniſtries and worſhips in the World, ſet up and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the will of man, ſhall periſh and come to nothing, and
<pb facs="tcp:115771:16"/>
the Riſe of theſe men, their growth and end, we comprehend, and ſee their downfall haſten greatly; and all the powers of the earth ſhall not be able to ſupport them, and with them ſhall fall their Tithes, their Temples, their gleab-lands, and offerings, their ſet dayes of worſhip in their wills, and all Laws limiting the Holy one, made to uphold their craft, and bleſſed are they, who through the day of tryal ſhall ſtand in their witneſs faithful unto God, not fearing what man can do unto them.</p>
            <p>Do not you approve Chriſt Jeſus his going into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? And do not you own the Apoſtles, who went into the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues every Sabbath day, and into the Market places to teſtifie of Chriſt Jeſus, and reaſon with the people? And do not you commend <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin, John Wicliffe,</hi> and others (as famous for their zeal in publiſhing abroad what then was manifeſt unto them,) and thoſe perſons which in <hi>Q. Maries</hi> dayes, went into the Popiſh Steeple-houſes, to bear witneſſe againſt their ſuperſtitions, which cauſed her to make a Law againſt them, by which many of them then ſuffered, and by which the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> till the laſt Parliament were guarded, and is it now become an offence to practiſe the the ſame things? And is that a juſt Law made by the late Parliament, by which many have ſuffered? are not the Prieſts ſprung from the old root of Epiſcopacy and it from the Pope? and are they not forced to fly thither for their vindication? And is not the ſpirit the ſame, (which makes theſe Laws) to ſupport them? How ſhall the Kingdomes of the earth, the Papiſts, Turkes, Infidels, Heathens, be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Your Prieſts ſit down in their eaſe, and will not go; They call themſelves Miniſters of the Reformed Church; and have not you taught other Nations how to make lawes, to reſtrain the Teſtimony of thoſe whom the Lord ſends, and is ſending into all the corners of the earth?</p>
            <p>Did the Command of God which gave Tithes to the Jewiſh Prieſthood concern the Gentiles? was not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to the Jews themſelves diſannulled, when the Prieſthood was changed? did ever any of the believing Jews pay Tithes to the Apoſtles, or any of the Gentiles either? Did not the Papiſts bring in this doctrine, and oppreſſion;
<pb facs="tcp:115771:16"/>
Did not many of the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> dayes witneſs againſt Tithes, and was not that an Article, for which ſome of them ſuffered? and do not you own and commend thoſe Martyrs, or do you judge them for holding an Error? hath not all or moſt of thoſe Countries that turned from the ſope, and are called Reformed, caſt off Tithes with the Pope, and were aſhamed of them? And is it the Glory of <hi>England,</hi> who pretends to the higheſt Reformation to keep up Tithes, (the Popiſh Prieſts maintenance) and firſt Fruits, and Tenths (the wages of the very Pope himſelf) &amp; to hale before Courts, caſt into Priſons, and ſpoil the Goods of all thoſe who for Conſcience ſake cannot pay them? Let that of God anſwer.</p>
            <p>And how many have, and at this day do ſuffer becauſe they cannot ſwear, which Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles above all things forbids? how are the Commands of Chriſt made void by the Cuſtoms and Traditions of men? were it not eaſy by turning the Law againſt lyars and falſe witneſſes (which the Law of God is againſt) to find out that which your Law againſt falſe ſwearing never did or could diſcover?</p>
            <p>Do you own Chriſt Jeſus, of whom the Jews that put him to death gave this witneſs, That he reſpected no mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Do you commend <hi>Mordecai?</hi> who could not give the outward honour and bow to <hi>Haman?</hi> and do you regard his words, whoſaid, I know not how to give flattering Titles to men, for my Maker would ſoon take me away? Hath not God made of one mold, and one Blood all Nations to dwell upon the face of the Earth? and doth not he that reſpects Perſons commit ſin, and is convinced of the Law as a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor? and muſt it now be an offence not to put off the Hat, or give reſpect to the Perſon of him that hath a gold Ring, and fine Apparel? Hath not all the earthly Lordſhip, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and oppreſſion ſprung from this Ground, by which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have been exalted, and ſet up one above another, trampling under foot, and deſpiſing the poor? And is it not eaſy to ſee that power and authority without contempt may be preſerved, the power honoured, obeyed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto, and the Perſon reſpected?</p>
            <p>Hath not the great and heavy oppreſſions of the Law been long felt and cryed out againſt, the long delayes in
<pb facs="tcp:115771:17"/>
Courts, &amp; the great Fees of Officers, which cauſeth many to be exceſſively rich out of the Ruines of the Poor, which hath brought an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Law it it ſelf? for to the Poor, the remedy is frequently worſe then the deſeaſe; and while people are free to feed this deceipt, there is little hope to have it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. And how full of lyes, deceipt, pretences, and needleſs circumſtances are all your pleadings and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to the burthen of many mens Conſciences, and ruine of their Eſtates? and how vile and wic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> are the greateſt of Lawyers, that will plead any thing for money, and by their ſubtilties do moſt commonly hide &amp; cover the truth? And when do the Judges reprove it? And how treacherous and deceitful are the Solicitors and Attorneys, that truth or honeſty can ſcarce be found amongſt them? And how do thoſe eat up the people as it were Bread, and grow great and rich, by raiſing and increaſing ſuites, troubles, ſtrife and debates amongſt their Neighbours? and we ſeeing theſe oppreſſions, are made to bear our witneſs againſt them, and cannot uphold them, and our Teſtimony ſhall not be in vain.</p>
            <p>And how is the power given to Juſtices and Judges to bind to the Peace and good behaviour (being left to their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) turned againſt the moſt peaceable, and beſt behaved Perſons amongſt men, meerly becauſe they cannot bow to their wills, and hold their tongues when the Lord God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to ſpeak?</p>
            <p>Do you commend Chriſt Jeſus, his Apoſtles and Saints, who were ſent to preach the Goſpel, and travelled from Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to City, from Nation to Nation, from Countrey to Countrey, that the ends of the Earth might hear the glad tidings of Salvation? and do you commend thoſe they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Puritans,</hi> for going many miles to worſhip the Lord? and do you now condemn thoſe that practiſe the ſame thing? would not your Law againſt Vagabonds have taken hold on Chriſt and his Miniſters, and hindred their work? by it have many honeſt and good people ſuffered moſt ſhameful whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and impriſonments, who were travelling in their own Countrey, about their outward and lawful occaſions, that were of conſiderable Eſtates and could not be counted,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115771:17"/>
Vagabonds; and what uſe is made of this Law, throughout the Nation, you cannot but hear.</p>
            <p>Are not theſe things like the ſayings of thoſe who ſaid, Had they lived in the dayes of the Prophets, they would not have perſecuted and put them to death? and yet they Crucified Chriſt; and ſo the cry at this day is againſt the Jews for their cruelty, when themſelves are found exerciſing the ſame things againſt his Saints and Members.</p>
            <p>Long hath the Beaſt reigned, who uſurped power in theſe things, and the falſe prophets, who have over-ſpread the Earth, &amp; the great Whore, who have made all Nations drunk with their abhominations, and the Wine of their fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with whom the Kings of the Earth have committed Adultery, whom Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, and before the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles deceaſe did come, who went cut from the Apoſtles, and put on their cloathing, but inwardly were diſtroyers, ravening Wolves, which the whole World went after, who turned againſt the Saints, who kept to the Spirit (the life which they went from) and made War with the Saints till they overcame, and their power reached over the whole Earth; But now is the Life riſen, and is again made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt which they went from, which gives to ſee before the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy was; Now is the Lamb riſen, and riſing to make War with the great Dragon, the Beaſt and falſe Prophets, and now ſhall the great Whore be taken, and her fleſh ſhall be burnt with fire, and the Saints ſhall have the Vict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

            <p>NOw to this I ſhall ſay and anſwer; firſt, as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſpirits of people concerning this cry, all the rude and ungodly people, as drunkards, and the prophaneſt of men, they glory apace at this newes, and rejoyce at this mightily, as if ſome great prize were befallen unto them; and it makes them rude, and violent enough to the breaking of the peace in the Nation; but thus it is with but the worſt ſort of people in the Nation, who are rejoyced with theſe tidings, that the Quakers meetings muſt be broken; but as for the honeſt people, ſuch as be ſober and ſincere, thouſands that had a hand in chuſing this preſent Parliament, never intended to ſend them up to <hi>London</hi> for ſuch a work; and the cry is by many of the ſober people, if they go about ſuch a thing, they will deſtroy themſelves, undoe themſelves,

and leave their names a reproach; Why ſay the people? (we have a Teſtimony before us) hath it not been upon that Rock of limiting tender conſciences in former dayes, that hath broken many before theſe, which might be examples to theſe, not to do the ſame things? and many ſober people are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at ſuch newes, and it makes their hearts ſad, whoſe conſcience and the witneſſe therein doth anſwer that we are the Lords people, and it ought not thus to be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, as the newes reports; ſo that by this newes of the intended purpoſe, to break the Lords peoples meetings, the ungodly and prophane, are gratified, and ſtrengthened in their wickedneſſe, and the righteous are made ſad; And further, as for us, we have been trodden down, and made a prey unto our enemies, and the gates of death and Hell have ſtroven againſt us already, but have not prevailed unto this day; for the Lord is with us, and who is it that ſhall prevail againſt us, and I may ſay what is this that is reported to be done? What ſhall duſt and aſhes do, and man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils? and who are they that ſhall break down that which the Lord hath a purpoſe to build? who ſhall be able to proſper in going about it? or what ſucceſs ſhall God give to that work? I tell you nay, it is the Lord that hath raiſed us up, and we have given our power to him, to ſtand by him, and to be protected, defended and upheld by him alone, and we cannot give our power to any mortal men, to ſeek that from them which is not in their hands to give; the power of the Lord God is over you, he that is our keeper and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in whoſe hands is your breath, to deſtroy it utterly, if you do that which doth offend him; for you ſhall know that we are the Lords people, by whom we ſhall ſtand and grow in dominion and authority in his life, and the dread of the Lord ſhall be upon our enemies, though they one gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie another, with intention of evil againſt us; yet the Lord ſtoppeth the purpoſe of his enemies, and turnes it backwards upon their own heads; And this I ſay from the Lord, if ſuch a thing be in your hearts, conceiving to be brought forth by you, it is a birth that will devour you, ere ever it ſpring out of your bowels, it will be too heavy a burthen, and you ſhall never have ſtrength to deliver it; this is the word of the Lord

to you, it ſhall be a Rock to overthrow you, and it will be a ſnare to catch you, and if any ſuch thing proceed from you, it will break you, and your own wickedneſſe will deſtroy you. Alas! do not you ſee evidently the hand of the Lord fight for us? yea, we have evident teſtimony of his preſence, that he is and will be with us unto the end, and if any wil be blind, let them be blind, for theſe tidings do not trouble us, neither are we thereby moved, no not to beg of any man the contrary, for we cannot give our power unto you, nor come under the power of this World, no not to beg of you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a good conſcience, that you ſhould forbear the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling your intents; but this it is in the Name and power of the Lord, though he requires nothing of you to exalt his Kingdom by your power, nor to preſcribe him a way, how he muſt be worſhipped, yet he requires that you ſhould do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt him, nor his people, by limiting the ſpirit of the Lord; and I ſay the Saints of the moſt High can not give their power to you, to ſtand or fall thereby, nor to go by the authority thereof, to exalt the Kingdom of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; they can beg no ſuch thing, nor deſire it of you, for it is not in your hands to give his work of ſalvation unto the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; you cannot give nor lay one ſtone in the building of his bleſſed Temple, but he alone will do it, and not by the arm of fleſh; yet doth he require, that you ſhould do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt him, nor abuſe your power, but and if you do, he will reward you according to your deeds, and this you will find and feel in the day of God, when he brings vengeance, and Judgement upon you, and when he ſets his Kingdom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you all, and that comes to reign over the Nations, which now is a ſufferer. And when I firſt heard the newes ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the Nation, of ſuch intentions, to break the Quakers meetings, many conſiderations paſſed through me, will theſe go ſaid I in the ſame way, that many have been deſtroy ed in before them? Will theſe run upon the ſame rock? will theſe take in hand to limit God, and to ſet him a way? and ſhall all theſe ſufferings of the Lords people for theſe many years be finiſhed by theſe, that all the unjuſt dealings, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Saints, may be upon them? Is there no wiſe man among them, nor none that feareth the Lord, that he

may be preſerved from deſtruction? and is this their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Parliament, to deſtroy Gods heritage? The Lord, nor the people of this Nation that fear God, have not intruſted them therein; but if it be ſo, ſaid I in my heart, if this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs be intended, and if they do ſo greatly abuſe their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they ſhall leave their names as a reproach to after ages, and their memories ſhall rot, and their wickedneſs ſhall lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for evermore; but I conſidered that we having given our power to the Lord, from him we have found to this day, and do alwayes ſeek defence, and to be carried on, and by him we ſtand, and to him we fall; &amp; not to mortal men, who are as clay in the hand of the potter; wherefore let the wiſe in heart conſider theſe things, and lay them to mind; for if they ſhall proceed to that wickedneſs, the nations, ſhall they never ſettle in peace, nor ſhall their Rulers, receive a bleſſing, but they ſhall be a curſe unto themſelves, &amp; to all under their authority; and this is a Teſtimony to all ſober people, ſhewing unto them all, where our confidence is, and in what it remaines; And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs if the heart of the wicked be ſtrengthened againſt us, and their hands made ſtrong to deal violently, yet ſhall the righteous rejoyce, and be exceeding glad; for the day of redemption and everlaſting peace is come unto his people, that do and have waited for him, and all under him ſhall bow and bend, and he will make his peoples cup over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, and ſpread their table, even in the fight of their enemies, and they ſhall fear, and the terror of the Lord ſhall lie upon them, and when they have executed their violence, then ſhall the Lord deal violently with them.</p>

            <head>A Cry of great Judgement and vengeance upon the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, near to be executed, as it was received from the Lord into his ſervant.</head>
            <p>ON the eighteenth day of the firſt month, as I was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in <hi>Warwick</hi>-Shire, my Meditations being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, and upon the cauſe of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Nation; and how unjuſt and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous their woful ſufferings have been executed upon them within theſe few years; even when I was pondering of theſe things, in the deep conſideration thereof, it came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me from the Lord, and the cry went through me, the Lord will be avenged, the Lord will be avenged upon his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and he will avenge the cauſe of his people; and this cry ſtuck cloſe upon me for ſome hours, that the Lord would ſurely execute his judgments upon the oppreſſors of his heritage, who have ſpoiled and troden it down, and ſought to deſtroy it; And I conſidered and took into full view in my Spirit, how grievous, how ſad, and how unjuſt the ſufferings of Gods people have been within theſe few years, and my heart was even broken therewith, and my Spirit even melted; and it came upon me from the Lord, ſaying, Write unto the Rulers, and yet once more warn them of that recompence, and of that indignation which is at hand upon them; even a juſt recompence for all their deeds; and as they have done, even ſo ſhall it be done to them; as they have ſought to deſtroy the generation of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, even ſo ſhall they be deſtroyed from off the face of the earth; and as they hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> unjuſtly judged and condemned the innocent, ſo ſhall they be condemned and juſtly judged of the Lord; and as they have caſt the bodies of the poor Lamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Chriſt into Priſon, and been a ſnare upon them, even ſo ſhall they be inſnared, and into captivity ſhall they go; and as they have cauſed the goods and poſſeſſions of the innocent to be ſpoiled and made a prey, even ſo in like manner ſhall the curſe of the Lord ſpoil their ſubſtance; and as they have done, ſo ſhall it be done unto them; and as they have mete
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115771:21"/>
to others, ſo ſhall it be mete to them again. And I ſaw a great miſery and deſolation nigh at hand, even the Sword of the Lord, and it ſhould ſlay them; and I beheld it was made ready for the ſlaughter: and in the ſenſe of theſe things a ſadneſs fell upon my Spirit, conſidering the deſolation and the judgment that is at hand, to be executed upon the cruel oppeſſors.</p>
            <p>Wherefore all ye Rulers, and all ye that have troden down the heritage of God, and ye that have diſregarded thoſe many warnings that ye have had; I ſay unto you all, in the power of the Lord God, in his Dominion, and by his Spirit, this is once more a warning to you from the Lord, &amp; that theſe things muſt ſurely come to paſs, and be fulfilled in their ſeaſon, and no man ſhall be able to deliver his brother; but every man ſhall bear his own burthen, and drink his own cup prepared for him; and though it hath been counted a light thing amongſt you, and you have diſpiſed the reproof, and gone on without fear, yet in as much as the Lord hath ſpared you, and not ſpeedily executed judgment upon you, but rather waited for your return; yet the dealing of the Lord towards you in ſparing of you, you have not accepted, and therefore ſhall his judgments be the greater upon you. For if you do now come to the witneſs in your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, What evil hath this people done? Whoſe Ox have they taken, or what have they deſired of you? or what have they ſought from you? or wherein have they been a burthen to you, Saving that they have reproved you for your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and deſired your Repentance? Would you but now at laſt come to conſider this, and confeſs the truth in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, will not that tell you, that they have ſuffered pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently all things that you have cruelly impoſed upon them? and have not they walked peaceably towards you, &amp; humbly, meekly &amp; juſtly among their Neighbours? and have they not been meek &amp; innocent even as Lambs, and as the ſheep before the Sbearers? and have they wrought offences towards any? have they ſought the overthrow of the Government, or have they ſought vengeance againſt their enemies? or what injury have they done to any mans perſon, or eſtate, ſaving to Satan and his kingdom? Have they not ſought to reform,
<pb facs="tcp:115771:21"/>
and reclaim the ungodly from their wayes? and have they not pittied and prayed for their enemies? and have they not in all things walked in good conſcience towards the Lord, and towards all men? Yea, my friends, in the day of the Lord, when the witneſs in your conſciences ſhall not be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but ſhall ſpeak plainly, and when the impartial Judge ſhall appear upon his Throne, then ſhall you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge theſethings.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſay unto you, receive the judgment of the Lord to purifie you, otherwiſe the judgment ſhall deſtroy you; and now come to be more wiſe, that ſome of you may be as a brand pluckt out of the fire, and be reſerved from being conſumed; for the viſitation of the Lord is near an end, when his loving kindneſs will be ſhut from you, and his long ſuffering turned into fury; and he will make you know that we are his people with whom you have thus dealt, yea, you ſhall ſuddenly know it, the time is not long till he will crown his people in the ſight of his enemies; he will crown them with praiſe and with righteouſneſs, with honour and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and he will keep them in ſafety, even when ſorrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes you about; his mercy and loving kindneſs ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend towards them, even when his wrath and judgements doth ſmite you, and confound you. O what ſhall I ſay unto you! for the deep ſence thereof remains upon my heart; for when I conſider how that in all ages the Lord did avenge his peoples cauſe, &amp; when the time of their ſuffering was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he brake the bonds of iniquity, and ſet them free; thus did he with his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and many times it was his way with his people to bring them low by ſuffering, and then to raiſe them up again in glory; and he ſuffered their enemies for a ſeaſon to glory over them, that he might bring them down; and thus he did in <hi>England</hi> in the caſe between the Biſhops and their crew of perſecutors, and the poor people at that day called <hi>Puritans:</hi> Did not he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found that perſecuting crew, and deliver his people? And is not he the ſame to effect the ſame work at this very day? Yea doubtleſs, and much more will he do it, in as much as the manifeſtation of truth is more clear then it was in their dayes, and in as much as the Rulers and people of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:115771:22"/>
have rejected a more clear Teſtimony, then either the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes, or the Biſhops and Prelates in their dayes; even ſo much the more will the Lord God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his vengeance with more violence, in a more manifeſt way, and all ſhall know, that it is he that doth it, and he will ſet his people free; for he hath regarded their ſuffering, and he hath ſaid it is enough; for he hath tried them, and found them faithful; and all this hath been ſuffered to prove them, and not to deſtroy them; and like as he hath preſerved them in patience, and peace through it all, even ſo will he give them hearts to walk anſwerably to their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and as they have abounded in patience in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſo ſhall they abound in praiſes everlaſting in the day of their Freedom; and the earth ſhall be glad, and ſhall yield the increaſe and bleſſing; the Heaven and the Earth ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and the heart of the Righteous ſhall leap for joy, when the Lord hath broken the yoke of the oppreſſed, and ſet his people free, inwardly and outwardly, and then ſhall they ſing unto the Lord over all their enemies who ſhall be tormented and vexed in the Lords ſore diſpleaſure, for their reward cometh, and their recompence ſhall be even as their work, and he will give unto them ſorrow and anguiſh, in ſtead of rejoycing.</p>
            <p>But again, when I conſidered the long ſuffering, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and forbearance of the Lords innocent people under all their ſufferings; and when I looked at their innocency, and at their Righteouſneſs, and Spirit of Holineſs with which the Lord hath bleſſed them, my heart was made glad in the conſideration of this; and the more was my joy, the more that I beheld their innocency, and the guiltleſneſs of their cauſe, whereby the unjuſtneſs of their ſuffering did the more appear; and withal when I looked and beheld their increaſe under all their ſufferings, and how that the Lord had turned all theſe things to their good, and to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all their enemies; how that, by that way, wherein their enemies intended to deſtroy them from being a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; even thereby did the Lord moſt wonderfully increaſe them to be a great people; for through all have they grown in life and power, in ſtrength and in number, and through
<pb facs="tcp:115771:22"/>
it all have they been incouraged to follow the Lord with more zeal and boldneſs; and in the conſideration of this I did rejoyce, with magnifying the Lord for ever, that he had brought forth his praiſe even through the wickedneſs of the wicked, and he had increaſed his people, and exalted them through the cruelty of all their enemies; and that through all oppoſition they were attained to a happy reſt, and through all the tempeſts of great trials, they were arrived into the harbour of renown and great glory; and when I conſidered this, how that the Lord had given them dominion, and brought their life to reign over all their enemies, theſe things were a joy unto me; and looking back into ages, ſeeing there was nothing, nor any people for generations, that had grown, and riſen through all oppoſition like unto theſe; wherefore it is a ſign and a Teſtimony that we are the Lords, and that theſe things are of him, and from him, and by him alone, that he might be praiſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Again, when I do conſider, how that the Lord hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this people, even out of the duſt; and them that were not a people, are become a people; and the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked Nations, by them that were not a people within theſe few years; and the Lord hath carried on this work amongſt his people, not by any thing of man, nor by the arm of fleſh, but in pure innocency and ſimplicity hath it been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; not by the wiſdom of this World, nor by men in places of honour, and of power in the Nations; for all that has been wanting to them; and what they are, it is through the oppoſition of all this; for they have had none of the great men of the Earth on their ſide to defend them and eſtabliſh them, but all hath been againſt them; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven oppreſſion and tyranny executed upon them, rather then any approbation, or juſtification from men in outward au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; ſo that truly it may be ſaid, that there hath been nothing of man in this work, but all of the Lord by his own power; and in a contrary way to all the falſe ſects and falſe churches, hath the beginning and carrying on of theſe things been; for we know that all the falſe ſects in this Nation hath riſen &amp; been eſtabliſhed through the countenance of men in
<pb facs="tcp:115771:23"/>
place and power; and upon man and the wiſdom of this World, and authority of the powers of the earth, hath the riſe and fall of all falſe churches depended; and as the powers of the earth hath ſided with them, ſo have they been ſet up, and at the diſpleaſure of authority, have been caſt down. But as for this people, they are raiſed of the Lord, and eſtabliſhed by him, even contrary to all men; and they have given their power only to God, and they cannot give their power to any mortal men to ſtand or fall by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward authority, and to that they cannot ſeek, but to the Lord alone, who heareth their cry, and will avenge their cauſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let all the perſecutors bow before the Lord, and let all the Saints walk humbly in his ſight; and let them continue in that innocent life in which they have begun; and let them never forget the mercies of the Lord, and what he hath brought to paſs, who hath manifeſted great things, and will do more and more to the confounding of all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and to the praiſe of his elect people. And all ye Saints upon the earth, have ye the Lord in reſpect continually, and turn you not unto Idols, but let the Lord be your joy for evermore.</p>
