            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>IN pious Times of Old, in <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Reign,</l>
                     <l>Wherein no Strife, no Envy, no Disdain,</l>
                     <l>Defac'd the Colour of that Candid Throne,</l>
                     <l>Where Innocence unrivald sat alone;</l>
                     <l>Where no forc'd Laws were in his Kingdom found,</l>
                     <l>Before Ambition did divide the Ground:</l>
                     <l>Virtue did then her brightest Light bestow,</l>
                     <l>And sway'd the Motions of this World below.</l>
                     <l>But since she did her Face unkindly shrow'd</l>
                     <l>Behind the Curtains of a sable Cloud:</l>

Then Envy sprung those Vipers which did prey,</l>
                     <l>On Innocence and Virtue Night and Day:</l>
                     <l>Then she gave Laws to all the World beside,</l>
                     <l>Taught Avarice to flow with ev'ry Tide;</l>
                     <l>Into the Bowels of their State, which then</l>

                     <l>The World in Sin grew older ev'ry Day,</l>
                     <l>And upstart Lights new Converts did convey</l>
                     <l>To unknown Lands, where as they came and spread,</l>
                     <l>Vice did in Triumph shew her daring head:</l>
                     <l>I long to see the Threads of Time full spun,</l>
                     <l>Hoping the Golden-Age may then come on;</l>

                  <head>On a Lady who slighted my Love.</head>
                  <lg>
                     <l>SO when all's calm, and no Clouds blind the Day,</l>
                     <l>The Pilot hoises Sail and puts to Sea;</l>
                     <l>But when he's gone, and lost the Sight of Shore,</l>
                     <l>The Winds rise high and he is seen no more.</l>
                     <l>I thought such sweetness in a Face, like thine,</l>
                     <l>Would like the fixt Stars Splendor, ever shine;</l>

Such beauteous Order in thy Face was found,</l>
                     <l>'Twas that first drew me to the Fairy Ground,</l>
                     <l>In that fair Spring I thought to quench my Fire,</l>
                     <l>Fev'rish I came, more fev'rish I retire.</l>
                     <l>Those former Wounds which I receiv'd from you</l>
                     <l>At your Disdain gush out and bleed anew:</l>
                     <l>The Arrows of your Love stick fast in me,</l>
                     <l>You shot them in, and you must make me free:</l>
                     <l>I've got within the Circle of your Heart,</l>
                     <l>Th'enchantment must be broke e're I depart.</l>
                     <l>From Love's destructive Brink I will retire,</l>
                     <l>The Child once burnt still wisely dreads the fire.</l>
                     <l>To what shall I this wicked Love compare?</l>
                     <l>Mistress of endless Sorrow and despair;</l>
                     <l>But justly I my ill laid Plots may blame,</l>
                     <l>With too much fierceness I pursu'd the Game:</l>
                     <l>Had I hood wink'd this metl'd Love of mine,</l>
                     <l>E're now I'd seen the trembling Dove resign;</l>
                     <l>But Love is like the Cockatrice's Eyes,</l>
                     <l>If it first strikes it kills, if struck it dies.</l>

                     <l>Stretcht here at length, in Ease my Body lay</l>
                     <l>Swell'd with the Hopes of some luxurious Prey;</l>
                     <l>Casting my Amorous Eyes around the Plain,</l>
                     <l>Wild to possess, I spy'd a lovely Dame,</l>
                     <l>Thrice I saluted her, and thrice I said,</l>
                     <l>Peace to the lovely Nymph, peace to the lovely Maid:</l>
                     <l>She, so surpriz'd at this, made no reply,</l>
                     <l>But still survey'd me with a scrnful Eye;</l>
                     <l>Jealous at last, turning away her Eyes,</l>
                     <l>She calls for Help, but finding no Supplies,</l>

                     <l>Ere long I caught my <hi>Celia</hi> by the Hair,</l>

O Heav'ns! what Charms her Beauty did inspire,</l>
                     <l>Conquer'd at once with Wonder and Desire.</l>
                     <l>Weary, we both sat down, and breath'n our Loves,</l>

                     <l>Coucht on her Breast my Fancy sporting lay,</l>
                     <l>And strove to scare her pensive Thoughts a way:</l>

                     <l>Often my furious Hand did strive to know</l>

                     <l>Hot in pursuit, often I said, My Dear,</l>
                     <l>Ah shall I, shall I but inhabit here?</l>
                     <l>The Land is fruitful, grant me this one thing,</l>

                     <l>The Crop's but small that you will gather here;</l>
                     <l>And will you, will you do this pleasant Sin?</l>
                     <l>Hereafter it will Torture you within.</l>
                     <l>But all her Art such faint Resistance made,</l>
                     <l>Herself was almost by herself betray'd;</l>
                     <l>With so much Doubt and modesty she strove</l>
