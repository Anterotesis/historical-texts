         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Introduction to the
Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Never (Reader writ
a book, with greater
hast, nor with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
danger; for the
Enemies of that subject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I write, will call me enemy,
the Corrivals flatterer, the
friends weake, and he perhaps
himselfe, will deeme me rash;
one will believe I have said
more then is said, another
will undertake to know I have
said lesse; some will make me
<pb facs="tcp:95485:4"/>
say, that which I would not
say, and to conclude, it will
be much lamented, that I have
taken such a freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of speech, I doe humbly
intreat the Lord Duke to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
me, his friends to beare
with me, his competitours to
know, that I write not in flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and his enemies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that I write not in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
            <p>I confesse it an undertaking
of no great discretion, to write
the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of any man, without
knowing whether he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it, a hate, or a kindnesse;
and I shall peradventure be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited
with thee my reader
incredulous, that I can set down
<pb facs="tcp:95485:4"/>
rules of policy, and cannot put
them in practice; for that I
could say, the Byt-maker can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
byt a horse; but I meane
not to make that servile, which
is Architectonicall, nor write
my selfe a master, wherein I am
but a Scholler.</p>
            <p>I could say, that if a little
house, and a great City, be not
the same, that then likewise,
the policies of Princes will not
be the same with that of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
but there I expect no
glory.</p>
            <p>I seeke for no excuse, all my
actions are without policies,
for I my selfe am without inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests;
professing my selfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to be most affectionate to
<pb facs="tcp:95485:5"/>
my friends, &amp; most devoted to
my Lords, and this is a known
truth to such as know me.</p>
            <p>Nothing did more suspend
my pen from writing this
booke, nor more retard my
provocations to print it, then
the being most assured, (the
perversenesse of the times make
mee speake it) that the world
which is full of interests and
flattery, will judge mee too, to
be full of interests and flattery;
but now I returne to your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
(great Favourite) and
here doe publiquely protest,
that I have writ for truths sake
first of all, for so, nay more
then so, do your great actions
merit; then, after that ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb facs="tcp:95485:5"/>
for so much and much
more, I am indebted to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
offers, which so exceeding
lovingly, you did make bee
made mee, in times that were
to me calamitous. And if I
have not lighted upon any
thing, that suites with your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
I doe humbly again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to excuse mee; but if
you doe happily, value my will
to merit a reward; any reward
whatsoever, that is not either
your favour or your praise,
should by mee, be reputed for
an insufferable injury, and I
should be compel'd by necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to call your Excellency by
the name of ingratefull. My
family hath never knowne,
<pb facs="tcp:95485:6"/>
how to deserve rewards in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> with any other pen
then with the Sword; nor with
any other ink then with blood;
and I am still likewise ready,
both with the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if not to deserve, yet at
least to serve.</p>
            <p>I am not of so poor a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that I am forced to
write for a reward, nor am I
of so arrogant a disposition, as
that I write to give instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but I am least of all so far
from vain, as not to write for
praise, which peradventure is
my due, if not because I merit
it, yet in regard I seeke it; for
though this affecting of praise
be not to be commended, yet
<pb facs="tcp:95485:6"/>
is it out of question to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
because it is borne with
us; because it seldome times
dies before us, and it many
times makes us live longer then
we doe live.</p>
            <p>I intreat thee Reader, and I
humblie intreat thee, (that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my writings have beene of
any merit with thee, either by
unloading thee of idlenesse, or
by withholding thee from
drowsinesse) to be willing to
favour me with a beliefe, that
in all my past &amp; present books,
I never have meant, nor doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meane, to blame any living
man, either particular Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
or private; the heartie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
which I bear my Lords,
<pb facs="tcp:95485:7"/>
nor the tender affection which
I beare to my friends, never as
yet hath, nor never shall have
power, to make me forget that
reverence, wherewith I am
obliged unto Princes, or that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
whereof I am a debtor to
all men. As for my writings
they are not figurativelie, but
literally to be interpreted, nor
have they anie breath but what
they breath; I write not after
the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> manner, nor have
I said, but what I say; And
since I am not willing to say,
that which I have not said, be
pleased not to make mee say,
what I say not. I seriouslie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
that if anie, for what cause
soever, be moved to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:95485:7"/>
mee; my purpose is to
afford him no answer; for if he
write against what I have faid,
either that I have said will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it selfe, or else it will not
merit a defence; and then if he
write against what I have not
said, it nothing belong unto
me to defend it.</p>
            <p>For a Conclusion, be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
Reader; that the book is
not yet finished; nor indeed
can I desire to finish it, if I doe
not desire to out-live him, who
is worthie to outlive time, and
to hold out with all eternitie;
the All that I write, is not the
All that the Duke hath done,
nor all that hee will doe, but it
is onelie a little that I came to
<pb facs="tcp:95485:8"/>
heare of, of the infinite of that
which hee hath performed; it

the wages of labour, honour is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

            <p>If honours or titles grow common,
they have no rewards of worth, nor
are they, when they are sold.</p>

            <p>Leagues are not alwaies hurtfull,
and fearefull, but alwaies envied, and
hated.</p>
            <p>To despise riches is a great vertue,
but to distribute them is a greater; for
morall vertue consisteth not in being
poore, but in making ones selfe poor.</p>
            <p>He that will not be rich is unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
he that flings it away is vain, but
he that spends it commendably, is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
and magnanimous.</p>
            <p>He that cancels wealth out of a wise

if the Prince fall not into tyrannie, and

            <p>Souldiers are not enriched by their

            <p>A Favourite that increaseth the
Princes means, increaseth also the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of the people, for a rich Prince is
not taking but giving, therefore a
holding Prince is more desiderable,
then a bountifull.</p>
            <p>The reason of State, and Religion
are so conjoyned in Christian Kings,
that they are not to be disjoyned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucifers</hi> intention was not to exalt
himselfe above God, but to withdraw
his subjection from, that so of one, he
might make two Gods.</p>
            <p>There are two reasons of State, one
of God, the other of the Devill; that
is to come neare to God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
great, this is to goe from God,
<pb facs="tcp:95485:15"/>
and to make himselfe great.</p>
            <p>Such as are inflexible in receiving,
are so in giving, the same severity
that they use against themselves,
makes them uncharitable towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>A Favourite is to esteeme the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
done to his Prince, as done to
himselfe.</p>
            <p>He that receives every thing is too
covetous, he that takes nothing is too
severe, he that gives alwaies is too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall,
and he that never gives is too
miserable.</p>
            <p>A magnanimous Favourite, will
helpe by liberality, when he cannot
by justice; and if he cannot intercede
to the King for them, he will give like
a King to them.</p>
            <p>Man is a reasonable creature, but
when he layes aside his justice, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
himselfe of reason.</p>
            <p>Justice hath a Sword in one hand
to punish, and a ballance in the other
hand to weigh mens merits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95485:16"/>To pardon such whose natures are
enemies to nature, may be magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
but not to punish them is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
            <p>The man offended may pardon the
offence, but the Judge must punish the
offender; who is therefore called God,
because he doth not punish as man,
but as God.</p>
            <p>The Judge in punishing the malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,

            <p>All States yea Tyrannies are gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by an Aristocracie; to wit, by

becomes nothing, if he do every thing,
he savours of a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>Every science to be well learned,
and every office to be well discharged,
<pb facs="tcp:95485:16"/>
requires a particular quality of the
braine.</p>
            <p>He that is employed in businesse of
State, ought not to be superiour to it,
for so he will despise it; nor inferiour,
for so he will come short of it, but
there must be a sutable equality of the
affaires they are employed in, to their
capacities.</p>
            <p>He that is more afraid to sinne in the
presence of the Prince, then of God;
he doth as it were doubt of that which
is certain, and is as it were certain of
that which he doubts.</p>
            <p>All our errours proceed from our
ignorance of God, for though we
know that he is, yet we know not
what he is, because we see him not as

            <p>Princes can have no better masters

               <pb facs="tcp:95485:17"/>As in Sculpture men are not now
shaped with the same habits they wore
of old; so moderne States are not now
to be ruled, after the manner of the
old Romanes.</p>
            <p>The World is like an Instrument of
many strings, alter one, and all are
out of tune.</p>
            <p>As Empericks are to be condemned
in Physick, so are Exemplaries to be
abandoned in policy, for we are not
to make use either of ancient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
examples.</p>
            <p>Many examples are required to make
a rule; many of them are dangerous,
as being not from prudence, but from
fortune, which is not to be presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in businesse, but to bee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>Meates which stay only in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
do not nourish the body, so
history which remain only in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,

            <p>Polititians are not to operate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:95485:18"/>
to the judgement that they have
raised upon the reading of these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>Princes are not by subjects to be saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
against, but to be praised if past,
followed if present, and to be wished
for, if future.</p>
            <p>If Satyrs be false they move laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
if true, they excite choller, they
then that punish them, approve of
them.</p>
            <p>To be blamed with a lye comforts,
for it intimates a not being able to be
blamed with a truth.</p>
            <p>Princes that find themselves galled
with truth, fall into fury, because they
perceive that known, which they did
not believe to be known.</p>
            <p>Liberty of speech, and writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Prince, causeth him to loose his
respect, which once lost, produceth
rebellion.</p>
            <p>It is better timorously to avoid dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
then confidently to encounter
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95485:18"/>If beauty moves to love, it incites
to compassion, which is formed either
from the quality of the person, or of
the businesse; this is produced from
feare, that from love.</p>
            <p>Feare is of things future, love of
things present; therefore though feare
be more active, yet the person present
moves more compassion, for that
which is, hath much more vigour then
that that may be.</p>
            <p>Woman was made not against the
intention of nature, but for generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
from the assaults of whose beauty
we are better preserved by distance,
then by resistance.</p>
            <p>To blame competitors is either a
signe of great good, or of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and when it proceeds not
from zeale, it proceeds from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie.</p>
            <p>Though an Artist at first, make
some excellent Artificer his object;
yet afterward he reflects more upon
the greatnesse of the art, then of the
Artist.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95485:19"/>To stand firme in a good opinion is
constancy; in a bad, is obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
            <p>He that is chiefe of the counsellers,
is not alwaies found to be chiefe in
counsells.</p>
            <p>The object of the understanding is
truth, if it be quieted with that which
may be, and may not be, it is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Monarchies are supported by two
base Pillars, that is, by Executioners
and Sergeants, as the sweetest gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
are by the basest excrements of
beasts.</p>
            <p>The office of executioner, which
was performed by <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Eliah,</hi>
is now for want of zeale to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
left to the meanest people, as also
that Princes might not seeme terrible
to the people, and so be more feared
then loved.</p>
            <p>The most capitall offence in conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
is to conceale the conspirators,
for he that knowes a rebellion, and
<pb facs="tcp:95485:19"/>
holds his peace, shewes more feare
then love.</p>
            <p>Tyrants by their wickednesse, have
made the revealing of conspiracies an
infamy, and the plotting of them a
glorie.</p>
            <p>The Prince as a Physitian ought to
use his subjects that are sick of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
roughly, not to kill but to cure
them.</p>
            <p>Not only ought fortune to be pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on a wheele, but also every thing
else in this world.</p>
            <p>Cities that rebell against their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
though they overcome, yet fall
into many inconveniencies, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of their Countrie, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the people, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of their Exchequers,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The love of interest which is a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
doth easilie overcome all other
loves, which are but children.</p>
            <p>The space of an hundred yeares, is
the bredth of the channell of the river

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95485:20"/>Rebellions are unfruitfull, vain, not
without great danger, and extreame
great losse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> dealth courteously with
the <hi>Graecians</hi> in beating down the
walls of their Cities; for so they made
them the more vertuous, and lesse
rash.</p>
            <p>Mens good complexion is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their death, because being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of it, they fall into disorders that
kill them.</p>
            <p>Wars sprout out again, when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours

            <p>Warres many times would not be,
if the greatnesse amongst equals did

were not jealousies amongst inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</p>
            <p>The covetuosnesse of Princes to get

            <head>THE
POVRTRAIT
OF THE
Politick Christian Favourite.
Originally,
Drawn from some of the actions of
the Lord Duke of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Lucar.</head>
            <head type="sub">Written to the Catholick Majestie of
PHILIP the Great, and the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
that name.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Write unto your <hi>Majesty,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of your <hi>Majesty,</hi> I write
of your Favourite; it is said
that <hi>Moses</hi> spake with God
in the Mount, and yet there
are that believe, that he spake with an Angel:
sometimes Angels are the figures of God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95485:25"/>
with us, Favourites, the figures of Angels
with Princes; Princes, of God with men:
that magnanimous Heroe, whose stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
victories did not violently take away, did
give; when he saw the prostrate prisoner
Queen at the foot of his chariot, did value
himself able to make <hi>Alexanders</hi> an errour
in it self, glorious; which his greatnesse
mounted already to so sublime a degree, did
manifest.</p>
            <p>If amongst Authors of an admired Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
there hath been any one found that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
a Prince praise-worthy, because he had
a minister worthy of praise, how much more
is your Majesties due, who hath a servant of
great condition, one that you have elected
and made? What glorious action shall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
wherein thy great Favourite, may
not acknowledge you the actour: either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you have concurred with your assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
or because you have given an influence
with your grace, or have dictated, nay ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
it, by your wisedome and greatnesse.
In this subject (great Potentate) I will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
out your image, not the true one, but
the likest; God did not disdain to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
shaped under the semblance of a man,
and worshipped, not because man can be his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95485:25"/>
               <hi>Image, but because he made him after his
Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laborious it is, but it is profitable to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister
the egregious performances of men in
being: They wound and they heale, and
where they heale they also wound: Their
resounding doth awaken, reprove, stirre up,
and leaves no place for sloathfulnesse,
to passe the time idly away, in the laments
of the time. If one man of vallue be borne,
the fame of that one, produceth a thousand,
for if she being fruitfull should not bring
forth, the world would be now one only
mans, because he being sterill, would not
have produced so much as one.</p>
            <p>The glory of those that are past, like the
King of Bees, hath Majestie, and greatnesse,
but hath no sting: It wounds not, it inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats
not, disanimats, if it be examined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath no soule, it makes humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
lamentable, that glory dispicable, which
being neither enjoyed by the soule, nor percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the carcase, doth first remaine vaine
with the body, and then without it vainest of
all. It is an <hi>accident</hi> will accost a <hi>substance,</hi>
and where the substance dies, if it be, it works
not.</p>
            <p>The Actions of Predecessours that they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95485:26"/>
may be praised, require no more, then to bee
flourishingly related; it is with them as with
<hi>pictures,</hi> for it is sufficient, if they be but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-like
painted, no consideration is had, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Actions be true, or the Pictures bee
like; in as much as the Acts of the Ancients are
not knowne, nor the Originalls of the draughts
are not seen; but he that writes the deeds, or
drawes the picture of one that is alive, let him
look for censure, and that from the weakest,
since papers have no soules, and cloathes no
tongues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men are sometimes without eyes; nay,
though they have them, they see not colour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have them not without colour.
Every one judgeth of every one that writes,
according to his owne affection;</hi> one shewes
himself a flatterer, and another malicious.
I doe professe (it is true) to be infinitely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to this exalted <hi>Heroe,</hi> but it shall never
be discovered, that I rather <hi>sordidly</hi> defile,
then <hi>faithfully</hi> satisfie that obligation, which
as it is deriv'd from the vertue of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
will not be pai'd with the viciousnesse
of flattery. I should not much lament to
incurre that blemish from such as are his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulours,
so I might be quit from it in his
conceit: For I hold it farre more facile, to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95485:26"/>
make the <hi>Duke</hi> blush, then to make them
look pale, in the relating of his great Acts, I
will expect more liberty from envie then
from modestie, because there is more vertue
in him, then there is defect in others.</p>
            <p>Your Majestie then is humbly intreated,
to beare with the weaknesse of my writings,
too unequall for successes. I grant it to bee
more easie to speake then to doe, when that
which is spoken is to bee done; but it is
peradventure easier to doe then to speak,
when a man is to tell what hath been done:
<hi>The</hi> Drammaticke <hi>that is represented in</hi>
Sceanes, <hi>is more forcible then the</hi> Epick, <hi>that
is read in</hi> Papers, <hi>yet is that personated part
much inferiour in spirit, to that which is seen,
for if it have a soule, yet it hath not that
soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let that comendation neverthelesse bee
granted to these writtings, which is custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
given by him that loves, to
the face that is pictured: For if penns be
not inferiour to pencills, and words to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
it will be acceptable to your <hi>Majestie,</hi>
to behold expos'd to veiw those Actions
drawne, howsoever not to the life, which
your <hi>Majestie</hi> hath thought worthy of
your generous affections. I know right
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95485:27"/>
well that this Pourtrait should not have
been adventured upon, but by an <hi>Appelles,</hi>
and by an <hi>Appelles,</hi> who drawing from all
the favourites, of all Kings and great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
all the beauties that did adorne them,
being in him united, he should present him
to the sight of Your <hi>Majestie.</hi>

<hi>Olivarez;</hi> was the sonne of <hi>Henry Guz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who was the Embassadour for his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Majestie</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Lady
<hi>Mary Pimentelli,</hi> a Lady of most worthy
vallue.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Imaginative</hi> faculty, be of force to
imprint an impression in tender and plaine
conceits; and that it hath any part in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
of shapes to the <hi>Formative</hi> power,
what conceit may wee presume it to forme,
or what shape to represent in that Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which approved of no other discourse then
of that of the King, nor conceited the forming
of other conceits then of his service? I doe
not exclude the service of God, because that
holy Kings, intent unto Gods honour, cannot
be well serv'd, if God be not first serv'd.</p>
            <p>If men would seek when they doe seek
for wives, to joyne themselves to <hi>worth</hi> as
well as <hi>wealth;</hi> their rich estates would often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95485:27"/>
be more hereditary, as being more secure
from mens treachery, and lesse submitted to
the insultings of <hi>fortune,</hi> which although it
sometimes doth hinder the working, it takes
not from them the being.</p>
            <p>He was not borne in <hi>Rome,</hi> and for
twelve yeares space went up and downe with
his Father, who was surrounded with
troublesome negotiations; sometimes in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely,</hi>
sometimes in <hi>Naples,</hi> in both which
Provinces he sate in the throne of <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is not a mans Country where he was
borne; but that under which hee was borne.
Man was esteemed by men of old a <hi>Tree</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed,
because as the Country of a Tree is the
soyle wherein its roots are placed, so the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of a man is that Heaven to which he is
exposed: To stay in ones native Country, to
vindicate himself amongst his owne, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a true Tree, and a reversed man; such
as these are for the most part are like to those
plants, which being planted in the fatnesse of a
fertile soyle, doe grow bulky oftentimes, but
unfruitfull: The Oaks, that are set and grow
on the barren mountaines, brought up among
stormes, winds, tempests, they feare not the
impetuous furies, of the blustering Northerne
gusts; but if they grow fat in the calmenesse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95485:28"/>
of delightfull plaines, and luxuriantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
they are but feeble, and endure no
stronger gales, then warme refreshing breaths
of <hi>Zephyrus,</hi> or else they are made leaflesse or
blowne downe.</p>
            <p>He being return'd into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
journied far in vertues, disposed himself
to the study of the Lawes; not to defend
causes, by cases of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Sempronius,</hi>
but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> defend States with the prudence of
the Lawes Expoundors.</p>
            <p>The Law is a Book of <hi>Politicks,</hi> yet few
Lawyers now are <hi>Politicians:</hi> They were
that made it, but they are not that learne it;
because they only learne that which is done,
and not to what end it hath been done: Very
few of those that know the Lawes understand
them; Hee that seeks Authority without
Reason, is reasonlesse. To deprive the Law of
reason, is to take the soule from men and from
themselves; this comes thus to passe, because
that which is <hi>Politicall,</hi> is in many become
<hi>Mechanicall:</hi> And whereas Law was at first,
the legitimate Daughter of <hi>Judgement;</hi> it is
now made the adopted Daughter of <hi>Memory,</hi>
and Legists of <hi>Rationalls</hi> are become <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This man was created Rectour of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95485:28"/>
Vniversity of <hi>Salamanca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee that could have <hi>Lyncaeus</hi> his eyes,
would sometime know with little children in
the cradle, that the Starrs doe prattle, and shew
themselves by the matter, with the souls, if not
hindred by it, for surely they are not helped;
then are the nfluences more secure though then
they be more impotent, and it may be that God
would, that they have lesse force in that age,
that is to predominate over their power.</p>
            <p>The influences of the starres are alwaies the
same, but they seem not so, because the men
that receive them, are not alwaies the same;
the Actions of the Active search for a good
disposition of the patient, that their issue may be
prosperous. That starre which would make
<hi>Cyrus</hi> great, because it found him among
Children made him King of Children: And
certainly it was the selfe same starre, which
afterwards finding him amidst the Armies,
made him the King of the <hi>Persians.</hi> That
Aspect which made the Earle in <hi>Salamanca</hi>
the first Rector of the Vniversity, is the selfe
same Constellation, that finding him in the
Court of the greatest Monarch, did make him
one of the Princes of the <hi>Vniverse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this time died the Lord <hi>Ierosme</hi> his
elder Brother; so that he who was the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95485:29"/>
second birth was now become the first.</p>
            <p>The first borne because it is given by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be the first. The guifts of fortune
are oftentimes likewise given them by men:
This custome peradventure is not in use to
reward them, but to succour them; they that
are begotten last doe sometimes become the
valiantest; the seeing them to be borne more
unfortunate, is an argument to us of their
valour. Who knowes whether men either
by a motive of the soule, or by some other
instigation have not known this truth, and
have repaired thither with presents of gold,
where the reparations of vertue were
wanting.</p>
            <p>It is a greater good fortune to live a while
a second and then become a first, then to be
borne first; When riches precede vertue they
oftentimes hinder it, and when they follow it,
they helpe it; he that is borne first, believes he
hath roome to preserve the splendor of his
Progenitours with the splendor of his gold, as if
riches were the leaven of ignorance; whence it
is, that those goods which in times past were
the rewards of <hi>industrie,</hi> are oftentimes now
become the servants of <hi>sluggishnesse;</hi> But such
as are borne in the second place, to quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of the outrages of fortune, cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95485:29"/>
into the Armes of toyle, so that where
they cannot equall in wealth, they exceed in
vertue, and make it evident that it is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to many to be borne unfortunate.</p>
            <p>At this time likewise his Father died,
whereupon, hee was compelled to make a
journey from Contemplation to Action.</p>
            <p>Study is an idlenesse, and if it be a businesse,
it is a businesse of idlenesse, it would be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
appetite, if it were not an act of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
it weakens minds, and wearies bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but it is a sweet kind of losse because it is
insensible; to be alwaies among Books, is a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongst the living, and a living among the
dead, or indeed it is rather a dying to all, and
peradventure not a living to ones self; The
Common-wealths of old time, did repute it
most pernicious to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace a reputation, upon any
other indeavours, then upon imployments of
vallour; for they did know, that to withdraw
the understanding from the effeminatenesse of
Sciences, it was most necessary, that as they
were without fruit, so to make them without
glory. All worldly men aspire unto glory, if
they be not foolish, and now that glory consists
as well in knowing as in doing, and all men are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>apter to contemplation then to action; most
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>men runne that course to which they are most
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95485:30"/>
inclinable, and it may be all men would runne
it, if nature which hath made youth unable for
operation, did not mak it likewise discrepant
from study. He that to avoid the title of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
entitles it laborious; either I deceive my
self, on he deceives himself, or else he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
Study is a delight, and when it is not
a delight, it is no labour, but is a passion, that
doth trouble, but not molest, because it is but
little in the matter, and doth not dissolve the
continuation.</p>
            <p>Hee went to the Court, and thither went
he Learned, he went not thither ignorant.</p>
            <p>The Court is not a Grammer Schoole, it
gives not the first <hi>Aliments,</hi> nor doth it teach
the first <hi>Elements:</hi> the food of it is not milke,
it seldome produceth, it refines; to study, and
to serve well are incompatible, but yet to serve
well it is necessary to have studied.</p>
            <p>Princes are oftentimes in a great dearth of
wise men, because they make them not, and
many would make themselves so, if study
would render them as meritorious, as service,
but in regard, that as soone as they begin to
serve they merit; and not as soone as they begin
to study; Men for the most part dedicate that
youth to the Prince, which they should have
disposed to Learnings; whereupon it comes to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95485:30"/>
passe, that their merrit is at the last numbred
by <hi>yeares,</hi> and not weighed by <hi>actions,</hi> and they
are sometimes in the number of yeares, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
by some piece of <hi>Arras,</hi> that was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them.</p>
            <p>There was offered him an Embassage to
<hi>Rome,</hi> with an assurance, that he should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
obtaine the honour of <hi>Grandee,</hi> a title
merited by his Father, but denyed him
by death; but the Earle knowing that
to bee a <hi>Leiger Embassadour</hi> was but an
<hi>inclosure,</hi> would not accept of it, not being
able to obtaine that greatnesse, that should
have advanced him.</p>
            <p>It is not the property of man to stand
still, he is under a world, he is alwaies move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and he himself is a moveable world;
when he goeth not forward, be returnes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
if not to where he was, yet to where his
desire was. He is a traveller and journies on
to felicity, he seekes it and finds it not, nor can
he be quiet till he hath found it, nor can hee
find it, till he be dead; motion is so naturall to
man, that if he cannot advance, because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand still he returnes; not that felicities
are tedioas to him, but because he hath not
found them; and being unable to proceed in
their search, he feares he hath out-gone them.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95485:31"/>
The waters which naturally descends, if it
meet with a resistance, because it cannot stay,
ascends, and hopes that motion will convey it,
to its end, for rather then to imbrace a stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that is out of its nature, it moves against
its nature.</p>
            <p>Although the Earle gave not an occasion
of offence to any, he ranne notwithstanding
the danger of death; one time by foure
Murtherers that waited, way-led him, at
the going into his house; another time, by
three of the same disposition, that did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Coach, when he was in it, all alone;
yet was he alwaies fortunately delivered, he
not being aware of the perill.</p>
            <p>Those men are thinly served that enjoy an
immaculate fortune, because those <hi>Starrs</hi> are
very rare, that have an unmix't Ray. The
greatest, and most benigne Aspects of the
Firmament, are not without their petty vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
whereupon it falls out that such as are
most fortunate, have not an unperplexed feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
Fortune cannot be sincere, in a world,
that hath not an Element which is pure,
nor a thing that is not mixt; Though I know
not what of molestation, which is never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the greatest fortunes, is borne of I know
not what of <hi>Malignity,</hi> that is alwaies found
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95485:31"/>
in the greatest Starrs.</p>
            <p>Occasion was offered to settle a Court
for <hi>Phillip</hi> the fourth the great, in regard of
a marriage with <hi>France,</hi> and then was the
Earle nominated for a Gentleman of his
Chamber.</p>
            <p>He that in those times had the mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Monarchy (with all respect be it
spoken) either did not care to eternize the
favour he had, or did not know the vallue of
the Earle, in closing of him to the Prince;
to surround him with contraries was idle,
the worth that is accompanied with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
can by no contrary be extinguished
but by death. It would have been better
to have sent him farre off from the Court,
placing him in some Government, which is
an honourable, and ordinary exile of unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
worthy men; no inkling of their
Actions, although very great, doth ever come
to the Prince; for distance thawes them, and
if they doe arrive to his eare, they are
brought by the Favourites meanes, and so
doe seem rather his that brought them, then
his that performed them.</p>
            <p>Worth is a <hi>Ray</hi> that cannot be hid, if it be
not extinguished, nay rather it is a <hi>Sunne,</hi>
which alwaies shines where it is; Though
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95485:32"/>
some black cloudes oppose it, it gives light,
for such oppositions have not so much obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as that hath splendor; either the breath of
the Prince doth disperse them, or his Ray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
them, that it may clearely appeare; but
when the Sunne is farre off, when it is out of
our <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> it shines not, or if it shine a
little, that Ray is not known for his, which
strikes not in a strait line, but reflects.</p>
            <p>The Earle being entred into the service of
the <hi>Prince,</hi> did find himself among a world
of contraries, that did stirre up his Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</p>
            <p>The life of man is a warfare, so that hee
which fights not, or stands not ready to fight,
either lives not or lives ill. Contraries that
surround us, if they be not stifled, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and they are not stifled, if they be not
met with in the cradle. <hi>The heat that is
little to maintain it self, stands in need of the
like to maintaine it, but</hi> great heate doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
most, when the contrary doth most
struggle with it. That power of <hi>Antiperista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
which is granted to the Elements, is not to
be denied to men.</p>
            <p>Amongst other disgraces the Prince did
one day tell the Earle, that he was reputed a
<hi>greevance;</hi> and he did humbly beseech him,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95485:32"/>
that when he could destroy him, he would
not doe it, in the presence of his enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> being taken by an Embassadour,
riding upon a stick in the midst of his boyes,
intreated him not to tell it to any that had no
Children, left of a tender, he should be reputed
a weake Father.</p>
            <p>The Earle is mortified by the Prince, and
intreats him not to tell it to any he doth not
love, for they would have believed, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
patience stupid, and that loving
soule servile.</p>
            <p>He doth noc labour to know the occasion,
nor doth he perswade his Master with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>because it is not the braine that loves but
the heart; his Arguments are affection, his
affection love;</hi> nor is the disgust likewise of
not being belov'd, without the thirst of the
lovers: If we take pleasure to be beloved,
when we are most beloved, wee take most
pleasure; nay when we are hated, if we love,
we love most. It may be too that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is not beloved, or that at the least there
is hope in the future: And that not being
beloved which makes him hope, makes him
likewise merit: He that loves, hath the
gaine of love for his end, and love for his
meanes; so that, he then that hath loved
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95485:33"/>
most deserves most to be beloved.</p>
            <p>When I speake of love, I speake of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
not a venereall love: But yet to speak
truth, they are but a little unlike; for both
of them have their radication in the soule:
If the lascivious be transmitted into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it is by accident; <hi>and like the Sunne,
which defuseth its light where his Globe is
not,</hi> otherwise violences would pacifie
lovers.</p>
            <p>The Earle did know that the words of
the <hi>Prince</hi> were dictated, not said, and that
howso're the voice did fell him, the eye
did raise him; so that hee did not remaine
without consolation, nor did the Prince leave
him without love. The Favourites of that
time were then aware they had erred, they
did seek to amend their amisse, by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to bring in the Earle, into the service of
the King; but he would not leave the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Sunne, for the setting.</p>
            <p>It is a great good fortune to find a Prince
disingaged; to take away a place from one
that hath used it with vertue is hard, with
wisedome is blame worthy, and is generally
reputed malicious, but he that comes into a
vacancie, doth easily get in: No machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> downe this wall; they make
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95485:33"/>
the Prince try his patience, and he by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
augments his merits: They tempt him
with honours, and he by refusing justifies his
affection. Finally, <hi>when they perceive, that
they are not able to trample upon the ruines of
this great man, they endeavour to surmount
his heights, and to top them they lay hold upon
the ladder of his affection, but all in vaine, for
that wall was built too high, to serve for a
Basis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle did remaine in this instability,
untill there fell a division amongst the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
of those times.</p>
            <p>There is a Politician that affirmes, that
power and concord can hardly be found in
the same place; and he saies it in a time,
when he pretends to have found it. He did
not observe peradventure, that such as did
appear most powerfull were not so, except it
were they that were nearest allied, and the
nearest of bloud of the veines, not of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.
The self same Author, did likewise
another time in the processe of his writings,
light upon two, that were equally, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and concordant; and this did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the morality of that one, because
he that could not moderate the base affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of riches, it is not to be believed, that he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95485:34"/>
could temper the urgent provocations of
domination, and it was lesse occasioned by
the diversity of their professions, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wholly intent to policy, and the other
to warre. If a Favourite will not exercise
Warre in his owne person, he may make it
be exercised, and hath roome enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
charges, without dividing his owne Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
I beare within reason, the being Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
of a Tyrant, for when peradventure
he did not love them, he did reverence them;
there can be no discourse, that can set downe
a secure manner of carrying ones self with
such men, who although they have, doe not
use it, but to become worse then other men.
These did feare falling, now one, and now
another trembled, that he that stood fast,
upheld his staggering companion, and hardly
did the one fall, that he drew not the other
to the precipice: <hi>A spotlesse Favourite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of no companion, but he makes him his
enemy; he that desires one, seemes to desire
aid against he barbarousnesse of the</hi> Prince,
<hi>and seemes to accuse him for a Tyrant.</hi> It is
true that the inability of a man, in the
mannaging of great undertakings, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
company, but <hi>ambition will not brook<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it,</hi> he hath recourse to the dependencies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95485:34"/>
Feare indeed admits it, because he hath not
the grace of the Prince, may be releeved in
the burdens, but not in the dangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phillip</hi> the third went into <hi>Portugall,</hi>
and the <hi>Prince</hi> with him, the Earle took this
occasion to attend the affaires of his owne
family, but long he stayed not, for he neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
was to returne to the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyberius</hi> did judge it so dangerous an
hazard to be farre away from the <hi>Prince,</hi>
that hee conceiv'd it well done, when hee
could not waite upon the body to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the carcasse; he would have them bee
neer then likewise when the <hi>Prince</hi> was not:
But the Earle fear'd no distance of place;
The love that the <hi>Prince</hi> bare him was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
nature. They that say, habit is like
nature are deceive'd, it is not a <hi>Coppy,</hi> it is
an <hi>Originall,</hi> it is called another nature, not
because it is not nature, but because it was
not, it is borne with us, if not with us, in us:
The Art that is believ'd to imitate nature,
doth imitate it, and after likewise doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
times produce it, and often times surpasse
it. <hi>That love which is in Habits, receives no
Detriment by a little distance, but it rather
excites it to operation;</hi> because that habit
which is necessarily produced by actions
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95485:35"/>
doth not necessarily produce actions. The
subject whose abilities are of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to his <hi>Prince,</hi> cannot be absent for a
small time, but it redounds to his great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
<q>A rest that is interposed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Musick, if it be alone, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the delight, but if it hath company
destroyes it;</q> the eare is in expectation of
the following harmony, and when it comes
quickly, embraceth it, but if it stay long, it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
it; the expectation that is short, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
the desire, and desire, love; but that
which is long doth weary the desire, and
makes love be laid downe, and he that once
laies downe his love, takes it not up againe;
<hi>love is a kind of slavery, that is sweet, when it
is not knowne, and it is not knowne when it is
not free:</hi> It is good to make the losse of a
presence to appeare, but it is not good to be
so long absent, as that it be provided for;
For in such a case, though a man may retaine

               <hi>Phillip</hi> the third, being sick to death; the
precedent day to the day of his death; the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95485:35"/>
Earle in this sort spake to the <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With bended knee I beg of Your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
to grant me the liberty to goe to <hi>Sivill,</hi>
and for so much time at the least, to leave
the Court, untill Your Highnesse enter into
possession, both of Your Kingdome and
Officers, which at this time governe.</p>
            <p>To whom the <hi>Prince</hi> answered. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sicknesse is at height enough, and if it
please God to punish me with his death, I
cannot trust any, more then you, in the new
and troublesome Government; because I
am confident of your affection and abilities.
The King dyed, the Prince succeeded in the
Kingdome, and the Earle held the possession
of his favour.</p>
            <p>There was a Prince and peradventure the
wisest of any, who comming to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Empire, made a shew of not
desiring it, and the Earle who without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
is the wisest of Favourites that
ever was borne, doth make a shew to refuse
the favour that was presented him; <q>the one
had a purpose to sift the mind of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
the other to find out the heart of his
King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the greatest testimony of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and moderation, that it was possible for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95485:36"/>
the Earle to manifest; not in that he had
the heart to refuse a Kingly favour, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had the braine to discourse it.</p>
            <p>How is it possible, that any man, that is
not this man, seeing himself arrived to one of
the greatest fortunes of the world, could be
able to struggle himself, out of the hands of
joy, to cast himself into the pawes of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
<q>Discourse requires, quiet, order'd,
and restreined spirits, whereas joy, like the
wind breaths in the center of a man, and
sends forth spirits to the circumference,
dilating, troubling, and confounding
them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The first of the counsells that the Earl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
gave his <hi>Majestie,</hi> was to call out of Exile
many of his subjects, of approved worth, of
which was Doctor <hi>Pietro</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
of <hi>Villa-Franca,</hi> and one of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of State.</p>
            <p>To repeale from banishment, such as are
men of worth, is an act of so worthy fame,
that <hi>Agrippina</hi> the wise, being scarce entred
into the power of ruling, did think shee
did abolish a multitude of faults, by her
calling home <hi>Seneca</hi> out of banishment.</p>
            <p>If worthy men demerit, the qualities
merit: <hi>It is ill, when for the mans sake ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95485:36"/>
are banished; but it is worse, when for his
vertues sake the man is exil'd.</hi> In punishing
there is something of pardoning to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
for worth; <hi>for justice should be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
should her ballances equal a pound of gold
to a pound of durt, for having equall weight.</hi>
The people have worth in great esteem, and
it is true too, that they have punish'd it, but
it was only when they fear'd it. In Monarchy,
where they doe not feare it, they applaud it;
and when they see a man of worth is puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
they grieve as if his worth, and not his
errors suffer'd. In jealous Common-wealths,
and unsecured Principalities, he deserves great
punishment when he doth ill, who did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a great reward when he did well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot run a greater hazard, then
when the best becomes worst. A Tyrannous
government, hates and fears worthy men: A
popular arrives not to so much corruption as
to hate them, it only feares them, but neither
the one, nor the other doth enjoy them; in
as much, as envy neither ascends, nor descends.
<hi>It is only an</hi> Aristocracy, <hi>that envies, feares,
and hates them:</hi> And sometimes when they
doe not feare them, they make as if
they did: It would defend it self with the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ckler of weaknesse, from the blemish of

               </gap>alice. Worth is in the most happie Estate,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95485:37"/>
under firme, and confirm'd Principalities:
If, where the Princes are not Tyrants, there
should not oftentimes be Favourites; they
doe not feare the losse of their governments,
but Favourites feare the losse of their favour;
<hi>They cannot be Tyrants over others, if they
be not first so over their Princes.</hi> Whereupon
it comes to passe, that Princes oftentimes,
of an upright intention, have without tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing,
tyranized, because they were tyrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
upon.</p>
            <p>He devided the Kingdome in two parts,
bestowing upon <hi>Don Baltazar</hi> of <hi>Zuniga</hi>
his <hi>Vncle,</hi> the charge of the Consultations,
and businesse of State, and reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the charge of the house, and the care of
the Kings person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The He, that is greatest in Councell, is
not therfore the greatest in favour.</hi> Favour
is not the Daughter of the Interest of State,
but of the affection of the mind; the one
makes a man respected, the other makes him
beloved: To arrive to the one instructions
may be laid downe, but none can come to
the other, that is not borne to it; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
distinction <hi>Tacitus</hi> did see, but he did
not understand it, or I understand not him.
He makes a question whether the favour of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95485:37"/>
a Prince come by destiny of birth, or indeed
by the Counsells of our Prudence; I say it
comes from both: The one hath all the part
in that favour which makes us be loved, the
other hath a great part in that which makes
us deare. When a Favourite doth every
thing it brings forth hatred, when nothing
is done without him, it brings forth the
same effect; Though that hatred be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
the one is impossible, the other is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
<hi>The first mover, moves only it self,
and all the other Heavens doe follow it; when
they doe not follow it, nor move with it, they
move by it.</hi> I undoubtedly hold that thereis
not any motion in Heaven, howsoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> that doth not
depend upon that first motion, and that if
that should stand still, all the rest would be
at a stay; nor let any man tell me, that the

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95485:38"/>Where the interest of his King is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and the right of justice, he hath no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
nor he knowes no friends, because the
King is his cheifest Parent, and his greatest
friend; and therefore although he were able
by that way of his power, to have succoured
<hi>Don Pietro</hi> of <hi>Giron,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ossuna,</hi> his
Kinsman, yet did he leave him in the hands
of justice, where he died in prison. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he could have set at liberty <hi>Don
Roderigo</hi> of <hi>Calderon</hi> yet he did it not, but
did only manifest his friendship, to his
posterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Prince like the Sunne, is the Father of
all his subjects, if not univocall, equivocall,
if not as a particular man, as an universall;</hi>
but he cannot be a Father if his subjects be
not sonnes, and love him not more then a
Father. The <hi>paternity</hi> of a man hath <hi>bloud</hi>
for the foundation, the <hi>paternity</hi> of a Prince,
<hi>love;</hi> this is to be greatest when it is most
necessary, and it is most necessary where it
constitutes, where it followes, and doth not
alwaies follow. Hee that loves not the
Prince, more then he loves others, because he
renounceth his <hi>sonship,</hi> he desires that <hi>pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
be denyed unto him, and that the King
of a <hi>Father</hi> doe become a <hi>Lord,</hi> that he of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <hi>sonne</hi> may become a <hi>servant.</hi> He that could
constitute a Principality like this, wherein
the subjects should be more zealous for their
Princes good then their owne; it would bee
needlesse for him to prohibit <hi>a proprium.</hi>
Mine and thine, which forme the particular,
destroy the publike, if the particular be not
turn'd into the publike. A wise man knew
that necessaty well, and therefore in his
Common-wealth, he took away all kindred
of bloud, and knowledge of goods; hee did
not then offend in <hi>knowing</hi> the errour, but in
the <hi>correcting</hi> it, he took all the occasions of
vertue away, putting man into the hands of
<hi>necessity,</hi> and whereas he ought to have had
recourse for a remedy, to establish the civill
Lawes; he hasted to destroy the naturall, and
would rather desire a not <hi>desiderable,</hi> then
seek for that which he thought <hi>impossible.</hi>
In the correcting of great errours, there are
alwaies as it were great ones committed,
yea, and sometimes greater, but they doe not
oftentimes seem so, because they are believed
necessary, and sometimes they are not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are profitable; <hi>extreame mischeifes;
call for extreame remedies, yet extreames are
never good, but in comparison of worse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did not place his kindred, but such
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95485:39"/>
as were worthy in the service of the King;
nay rather he took away the Lievtenancy of
<hi>Castile,</hi> from a good subject, who for the
names sake of his mariage, would have been
to him most faithfull, and gave it to an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
man, that had no kind of relation to
him; and one who did undergoe a kinde of
reluctation to accept it, being unwilling
to relinquish that sweetnesse of repose, to
which he had retired himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a thing blame worthy in Princes, to
suffer worth to be retired, for it is a signe, that
either they doe not know it, or that they hate it.</hi>
If they send them not into exile, yet there
they leave them, and to leave them there, and
to send them thither, is all one. <hi>When cattle
come home to their hovells before night, it is a
signe of a tempest.</hi> Men doe it, not that
they may doe ill, (for vertue is a beame of
divinity that doth no ill) but because they
are deprived of that good, that hinders the
doing of ill: It is not only to be blamed in
Princes, that they suffer worthy men to bee
retired, but it is likewise a fault in the men
that they are willing to be so. <hi>Hee that
serves not his Prince, and knowes how to serve
him, is worthy of a severer punishment, then
he that serves him ill, not knowing how to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95485:39"/>
serve.</hi> A <hi>negative</hi> occasion concurres as
well to losse as a <hi>positive,</hi> when it is oblig'd
to hinder it; nay the obligation hath a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to make the <hi>negative</hi> become <hi>positive:</hi>
Retiring is only granted as a reward to such
as have wrought: <hi>He that retires himself
and hath done nothing, will have his reward,
before his merit;</hi> but he is mightily deceiv'd, in
as much as this, which is reputed a plentifull
recompence to men that have done enough;
is certainly an excessive punishment to such
as have been idle. <hi>The quiet which followes
motion is the Rest of the moveable, that which
preceeds motion is the wearinesse of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
He that is alwaies in motion is without
a body, he that is never in motion is without a
soule.</hi> There is a strife in man between the
soule and the body, the body is of its owne
nature immoveable, and would not stirre;
the soule which is the beginning of motion,
would move the body, that it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
it to motion, it doth promise it felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it is sometimes perswaded and consents,
but after that the soule with the body is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted,
to whither it is able to be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without lighting upon felicity; hopelesse
now to find it in motion, is likewise perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
perswaded by the body, to find it in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95485:40"/>
rest, and so deceived, suffers it self to bee
brought to rest, whether it voluntary goes
either desperate or undeceived. It is a
great deceit to believe to be able to be quiet
and live; it is not true that rest is a reward,
but it is alwaies a most insupportable paine
to him that hath laboured most, the world
affords not quiet, he makes a journey to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that goes about to seek it, and he is come
to his journeyes end, that believes hee hath
found it. <hi>A man may indeed rest, and yet
not be at quiet, nay for the most part, he is most
unquiet when he is most at rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke</hi> found the service of the
King, puddled by his servants, and not being
able to resist what was past, he made good
orders to provide for what was to come, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the which the example of his owne
cleare proceeding was not the least, which
was confest and admir'd by all, yea by such
as could not abide him.</p>
            <p>Gold doth blunt the edge of the sword,
and weighs downe the ballance of justice;
<hi>He that sells justice, sells his</hi> Prince, <hi>when he
can find a Chapman.</hi> The gold that holds
not out at the <hi>test,</hi> was false and did deceive;
the <hi>man</hi> that holds not out <hi>against gold,</hi> doth
cozen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95485:40"/>Some Princes have given money enough
to their seruants, that they should not sell
themselves, nor sell them; but <hi>that hunger
which is not naturall, but sickly, admits not of
satiety:</hi> That hunger is not in the man, it is
in the gold, so that who so increaseth that
body, increaseth its hunger; there is no cure
for it, but to make them loose the love of it,
and that cannot be made to be lost, if the
Favourite be not the first that looseth it:
<hi>The power of example is greater then that of
the Law,</hi> because it hath no power; the Law
works with <hi>violence,</hi> example operates with
<hi>love;</hi> the one raiseth desire and produceth <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi>
the other without raising the desire,
produceth <hi>feare;</hi> if the Favourite be not to
be sold, then is he above all price, but the
most part of them that bagg up money, heap
it up to buy the Favourite.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke</hi> hath not a Favourite,
nor knowes he what friendship is, or Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
when the businesse of the King is in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
His servants have no power with
him, they intrude not into businesse, they
falter not; There may be a <hi>Symon</hi> like him
that <hi>Lucian</hi> speaks of, that may have served
a long time, as a helper to Audiences, but did
never advance so farre, as that <hi>Symon</hi> did,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95485:41"/>
to raise a family of the <hi>Symoniades,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when he came to know, that one of his
servants had recommended a businesse to one
of his Officers, he put away the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and took away the love recommended
from him that had it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Prince which loves his subject, gives
him Principality, that subject that returnes
love to his Lord, gives it him againe;</hi> but the
subject, that loves another, takes it from
him, is rebellious, making him, whom hee
loves, Prince, if not of others, yet of himself,
and is ungratefull, though profitable, though
faithfull, though he love him.</p>
            <p>These are the obligations of a subject, but
it is the obligation of a Favourite, that is
more beloved then others, to be carefull that
he love more then others, and more then he
loves any other.</p>
            <p>It would be an easie matter for Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
to reforme the Pallace of a King, if it
were not a hard thing to order his owne
house; for the first is not reformed, if this
be not first put in order. <hi>All the lines of a
Favourite, yea those that reach from his owne
house, are to have, but one only centre, and that
is, the Pallace of the Prince;</hi> He that rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to greatnesse, to Offices, to Honours, his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95485:41"/>
servants, kindred, or friends, doth make his
owne house the <hi>Centre,</hi> and the Kings house
the <hi>Circumference.</hi> It is a rule among Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
to advance seruants, kindred and
friends, that they may have many supports
to uphold them; but it may be, that that is
no good rule, and without all question it is
no good signe, that favour hath no good
foundation, that is not fixt upon its owne
worth; <hi>a wall that hath a firme bottome, hath
no need of a Buttresse,</hi> if ruine doe not threat
it, and then assistants of that necessity, doe
rather thrust downe, then uphold favour, in
as much as, they never leane to it, but they
crow'd it. <hi>The Hunter should vainely toyle
himself, to overthrow the Elephant, if hee
would not leane against something;</hi> but hee
doth leane to uphold himself, and often
falls, because he leaned: Even so the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of a Favourite, serve him as little for a
support; but indeed it is he, that is of use to
them for an upholder, and they doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
beare so much upon him, that they lay
him along. The Favourite is vigilant not to
offend the Prince, because he hath none neare
to defend him; but his Favourites are bold,
feareles of loosing the favour they have not;
and hope to be protected by the favour they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95485:42"/>
have; whereupon it comes to passe, that the
Prince oftentimes molested, is compel'd to
punish them, and then finding his Favourite
in the crow'd, in the overthrow of them he
is destroyed.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke,</hi> having made a discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that <hi>Riot,</hi> was the ruine of <hi>Spaine;</hi> hee
gave life to the Law by practise, but he most
of all quickned it by the example of the
King, and of the Court, a course in admirable
reputation, in the times of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and so
celebrated by Authors of venerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>The practicall law was shewen to <hi>Tybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
but he would none of it; wherein, if he
did not dissemble, hee shew'd great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to conceale great wisdome; he made it
believ'd that hee conceiv'd it odious, and it
was in a Prince peradventure that was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Tyrant; who knowes whether indeed
he did not think it hurtfull, and that he did
serve his turne with the defects of impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to hide those of his will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The lawes of Tyrants, are suspected snares
to punish, not advertisements for correction.</hi>
The ends of Tyrants are to impoverish, and
they are accustomed to propound occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
for consuming of Patrimonies, then to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95485:42"/>
give instructions, for the procuring of
wealth. It may be <hi>Tacitus</hi> rellished not my
reason, because he thought it not a good one,
and to speak truth it is not a good one. Store
of money can procure particular friends, by
the mediation of guifts: The purses of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
cannot raise Armies, but that which
is spent can purchase a generall applause. The
common people love to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee magnificence,
for they know by nature, that <hi>the vertue of
magnanimity, consists in glorious actions;</hi>
though they <hi>winke,</hi> they are not <hi>blind,</hi> though
they see not the Sunne as it is, yet they see
where it is. Princes doe more often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves in applauding riches, then
the people doe; <hi>For Princes doe sometimes
honour them most, that have most, the people
them only that employ most;</hi> they hate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
ousnesse, and extoll bounty, because they
hope to have some benefit by that which is
spent, but dreame not of getting that which
is hoarded: The people that are the dreggs
of the Commons, are not so ignorant as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
would make them; they alwaies have an
eye upon vertue, and though they be not so
foreseeing as Princes, and lesse understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then the Nobility, yet have they lesse
feares of the one, and lesse envy of the other;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95485:43"/>
they draw not their swords upon vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor
doe they pollute it with malice; alwaies
when it is great they know it, and alwaies
when they know it, they extoll it, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
it: And therefore <hi>a Tyrant hath more
reason to feare money that is spent, then many
baggs that are lockt up, because it is an easier
possibillity for Citizens to depose a</hi> Prince <hi>by

               <hi>Don Baltazar</hi> of <hi>Zuniga</hi> died, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Lord <hi>Duke</hi> would not take upon
him the whole weight of businesse, he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the King to appoint as assistance, three
men of excellent abilities, who were <hi>Don
Agostina Missia,</hi> the Marquesse of <hi>Monti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,</hi>
and <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> of <hi>Giron,</hi> who
were to propound all businesses, to the end
that his Majestie might bee able to elect
what he pleased, when he heard them nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
and so proceed to practise; to
which he did perswade him with a disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed
ingenuity (that which became his
afforded favour) full of Learning, eloquence
and love, representing to his Majestie the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the best of Kings.</p>
            <p>This and many such like discourses, which
for their exquisite politenesse would enable
my Relation, and make the infinite worth of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95485:43"/>
the <hi>Duke</hi> more famous, are not by me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
in this present worke, because that I
having written it (I call God to witnesse)
without his consent, I reputed it not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to publish them to view, without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from him that performed them, but
it doth me good neverthelesse to believe that
he will one day be pleased that some more
eminent pen then mine, shall divulge them
to the world, not to defraud him of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
of being the first to informe Favourites,
how to serve their Prince, and Princes how
to governe their people.</p>
            <p>He that shall write as the <hi>Duke</hi> did,
will discover a knowledge of the great
good inclination in his Master, and declare
himself to be a faithfull Favourite.</p>
            <p>To with hold Princes from businesse, may
be a laudable effect, but alwaies of a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
occasion; if <hi>prudence</hi> produce it,
it is an ill signe for the <hi>Prince,</hi> if <hi>sagaeity,</hi> it
it is worse for the <hi>Favourite,</hi> because it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
intimates the one <hi>wicked,</hi> the other
<hi>unable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There have been some that have deem'd
it, an irrevocable maxime for Favourites to
estrange Princes from all manner of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but it may be that they peradventure
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95485:44"/>
have thought it ought to be so, because they
have found it done so; they would have
one <hi>draught</hi> serve to one <hi>species</hi> in a world,
wherein nature hath not made any thing
originall that is not different; to give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
precepts to one that never was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and hath too too much strayed from
the right, is a sure destroying of him Hee is
not at the first capable of more then of an
indifferent good; he must be first <hi>healed</hi> and
then <hi>perfected;</hi> there is no doubt, but that
a Favourite who feares not his Prince as he
ought, doth utterly ruine himself, if he suffer
his manner of proceeding to be corrected,
or if he let his Prince come into action.
The good old man of <hi>Chio,</hi> said, that when
a Physitian met with a contagious distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<hi>he was not on the sudden to reduce it to
what it should be, but to what it was at the
first,</hi> because to that then it ought to come.
Nature which does help to expell a worse
distemper then its owne, doth resist to
bring in a better. It might peradventure
be credible, that that Master would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
this, who did desire a Tyrant indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
good, not that he should stay there,
but because he imagined, that he could not
at the first be reduced to a superlative, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95485:44"/>The examples of this most wise Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
would bee of no use to the vigilant.
<hi>Sound mens food is most dangerous for the

            </p>
            <p>Necessity of state importuning Taxes,
and the <hi>Duke</hi> knowing how much it grieved
the people, to see their contributions given
away; he writ a Discourse to his Majestie,
wherein he discovered the great errour, that
Princes ran into that proceeding, and that
there was not wanting to his Majestie, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
Orders, Honours, Offices, Degrees,</hi> and
<hi>Greatnesse,</hi> to satisfie the merits of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
without either distasting the subject, or
impoverishing the Exchequer: This counsell
was the occasion, that the King began ro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerate
his deserving subjects, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings
of his subjects, with honours and
dignities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riches are not the pay of worth, they are
the wages of labour;</hi> he that <hi>buyes</hi> it <hi>vilifies</hi>
himself, he that <hi>sells</hi> it, is <hi>vile</hi> already: The
operation of worth produceth its reward,
for it produceth honours, and he that hath
it, can pretend nothing more, then some
markes that he hath it: Of this condition
are <hi>Greatnesse, Titles, Orders, Habits,</hi> and
of this nature were the <hi>City Crownes,</hi> the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95485:45"/>
               <hi>Collars,</hi> and the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of the Ancients.
Such rewards if they grow common, give
no honours, nay rather they loose that they
have, when they are bestowed on such as
have it not. There was a time when reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
did not emptie the Kings Coffers, and
it was a time fertile in worthy men; <hi>they
were most rewarded, who were least rewarded.</hi>
Honour was then a very great price, and the
price of vertue only; <hi>But when that which
was a price, began to be at a price, it lost value,
and made men loose their courages, so that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and worth became both mercenary, and
men lusted rather after the wealths, that
bought them, then after the qualities that got
them.</hi> The originall of so much errour and
confusion, was derived from such Princes,
that were needy and poore, and thereupon
gave more honour to the wealthy, then the
worthy; but these would not have had need
of riches, if they had not made them necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
with taking away the reputatiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of
worth. The <hi>Spartans</hi> were a while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
gold, and the first <hi>Romanes</hi> if they had
it, did not adore it: <hi>States</hi> have many times
encreased with <hi>money,</hi> but never without
<hi>valour.</hi> It may be it did not concerne Kings
to keep it in credit, such are not the most
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95485:45"/>
valarous but the richest, they have given re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
to what they alwaies have, to assure
them of that, which sometimes they have not.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> went into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to
get the <hi>Infanta Maria</hi> to wife, and for
some other respects of the Palatine his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in law. When the Lord <hi>Duke</hi> stood
firme upon this resolution, that when the
King of <hi>England</hi> should in his Kingdome,
grant all that in favour of the Catholike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
without which there was no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of a match; that then the Catholike
Nation should accord to all that, that the
conveniency of State required, nor would he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver depart from this Catholike vow, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he well enough understood, (that if
the King of <hi>England,</hi> would not consent to
this proposition, as he did manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
he would not) the issue, that he insisted
upon with a potent King to the enemies of
the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and that he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
Warrs, which would more load the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
then any man else; because they
take from him the commodity of enjoying
the degree that he doth possesse, and oppresse
him with turmoyles, cares, and necessities,
that attend them.</p>
            <p>This Counsell was the counsell of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95485:46"/>
               <hi>Duke,</hi> and the counsell and the <hi>Duke</hi> are
worthy of the highest praise, hath no need
of my pen. I doe here lye downe, with all
reverence and humility, at the feet of Pope

            <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> being but ill satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and returned into <hi>England,</hi> joyn'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with other of the Emulours, and enemies
of the King, in the League of <hi>Avignion,</hi> the
Articles whereof were, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
should set upon <hi>Brasile,</hi> that the Army of
<hi>France,</hi> with the assistance of the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> should fall upon the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
and that the King of <hi>England,</hi> should goe
with a Fleet for a designe upon <hi>Cales;</hi> that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95485:47"/>
the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> with Protestant As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociats,
should infest the Empire, that the
<hi>Venetians</hi> should furnish the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
with money, and the <hi>Grizons</hi> with money
and munition, to make an inrode upon the
<hi>Valteline;</hi> that a peace should be procured
between the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Persian,</hi> that the
<hi>Turke</hi> might enter by the way of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
and <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> by <hi>Transilvania;</hi> that
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> should send Cannons and
Cannoniers; to the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Affricke,</hi>
that they might beseige <hi>Mamora</hi> and <hi>Lara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>
All these stormes were dispers'd,
first by the breath of God, then by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Catholike King, and by the
counsell and providence of the Lord <hi>Duke;</hi>
there was a Fleet supplied in <hi>Brasile,</hi> which
recovered the <hi>Sconce,</hi> whereof the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
were Masters, in the Bay of <hi>All Saints;</hi>
two Armies relieved <hi>Genoa</hi> and the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi>
the one set at large that which was at
the last gaspe, the other did maintaine in the
<hi>Valteline</hi> the Catholike Religion.</p>
            <p>The Englishmen were expected with so
furnished a preparation, that after they of
<hi>Cales</hi> had killed some five thousand of them,
the rest returned home, wearie and afflicted.
The <hi>Hollanders</hi> did loose <hi>Breda.</hi> The King
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95485:48"/>
of <hi>Denmarke</hi> was beaten in a battle, and
betook himself to his trenches. The <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
were repulsed from <hi>Mamora,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachy,</hi>
with a great losse. After which
successes, there was a peace made, whereby
the Church obtain'd great authority, the
Catholike King great applause, and the
Lord <hi>Duke</hi> no small reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When Leagues thrive, Iealousie breakes
them, when they doe not thrive, feare breakes
them,</hi> but they seldome overcome, if they
doe it not in an instant; they have large
forces, but not long, in regard that they are
for the most part composed of ordinary
powers, and Warrs do quickly consume their
treasures; but it is not so with Monarchs.</p>
            <p>A League is a body of a facile corruption,
it often resolves into the first matter, and
that abandoned, it remaines but an empty
power.</p>
            <p>Many Sciences, and Arts, have one and
the same object, but never considered after one
and the same manner, and howsoever they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
to move toward it; yet they agree not in
the operation. The Tailor goes to the same body
that the Philosopher doth, but when hee
hath cloth'd it, he leaves it, because it is not
ever to be cloath'd. The Physitian goes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95485:48"/>
to the same body, and when he hath heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, he goes his way, because it is not alwaies
to be cured: The Philosopher alwaies stands
fast there, because it is alwaies moveable. <hi>So
in Leagues, all have power for the object,
but by a diverse manner, some because they
receive hurt by it, some because they feare it,
some because they envie it: The first being
quit from hurt, they goe away because it is
not alwaies hurtfull; the second secured from
feare, they goe away, because it is not alwaies
fearefull; so that at the last, there remaines
none but the last, which doe alwaies envie
it, because it is alwaies to be envied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King would have given the Lord
<hi>Duke</hi> a great Donative, and would likewise
have authoriz'd him to have transported
from new <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>China,</hi> a ship laden
with marchandize; an advantage, which
would have been of great commodity to
him, but of an answerable damage to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Spaine:</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of neither, because he would not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
his established rule.</p>
            <p>I conceive this so necessary an action, and
so concerning his reputation, that I should
not commend it, if the ignorance of many,
that have not so known it, did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95485:49"/>
it admirable; The act is so profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
that he who is not perswaded to it by
prudence, is to suffer himself to be brought
to it by prevision. To accept of what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
incurres blame, and what refused,
merits glory, is a testimony either of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or foolishnesse. Worldly men that
are not of this Alloy, walke to the <hi>Temple
of glory,</hi> but the passage is so steep, that they
have need of a Waggon: Some have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
the <hi>Chariot of worth,</hi> and some to the
<hi>Cart of riches;</hi> whereupon it comes to passe,
that as they are to be borne withall, who
seek them, to make themselves glorious, so
are they to be reprehended, who hunt after
them, to make themselves be blamed.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke</hi> forbeares not to take
the stipends belonging to his Offices, which
he personally performes, not applauding,
that drynesse of the conceites of those mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
men, that blame riches.</p>
            <p>Vertue (I speak now of morall vertue)
doth not consist in being poor, but in making
ones self poor. <hi>He doth not adore but despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
money that spends it; he that would not
be rich, is an un profitable poor man, and a
cruell fool. He that casts riches into the sea,
is a poor vaine man, and an envious fool; He
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95485:49"/>
that possesseth wealth, and spends it commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably,
is a rich, magnanimous, and a wise libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man.</hi> I confesse that the despising of
riches is a great vertue, but it is a greater in
him, who having them <hi>distributes</hi> them, then
in him, who having them, <hi>throwes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
or not having them avoides them:
These men doe not despise them, but they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
feare them or envy them; in the one,
appears the greatnesse of a gallant mind, in
the other basenesse and vanity. <hi>Hee that
cancells riches out of a wise mans heart, doth
cancell out of the Catalogue of vertues, part
of magnanimity, and all liberallity; to flie
the meanes that make vertue, is to fly vertue.</hi>
That morall Philosopher, that did so much
blame riches, had so much as made him
blame-worthy; and whereas at other times,
he was wont to contradict his sayings with
his sayings, in this particular he did it with
his doings; and gave us to understand, that
he did despise them, because he had them
not; and that then they are only to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd,
when they may be fear'd.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke,</hi> perceiving a delay in
the promotions of Counsells in the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls
for a long time, occasioned about dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
of precedency, hee did cull one out of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95485:50"/>
every bench, forming thereby a Councell, by
whom there might be a provision made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the difficulties that did arise;
which proceeding of his brought an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
commodity to the affaires of the
King.</p>
            <p>The Generalls did take out some one
souldier, out of every Company in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to make a squadron, calling it by the
name of the <hi>squadron volant,</hi> as active, upon
and in all occasions.</p>
            <p>Nature (if I be not deceived) hath given
spirits to all the parts of man, that they may
worke; but then taking out some one from
every one, makes a Globe, which must speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relieve in businesse, and interpose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
likewise in the offices of the other
parts.</p>
            <p>These are the spirits that runne to the heart
in feare, that flie into the face in shame, that
helpe the vitall, and succour the animall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and that they are taken out from the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
parts will clearly appear, when we shall
observe, that in the vehement operations of the
spirits, in one place, the other spirits doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
feeble and weakned.</p>
            <p>He that is dexterous in businesse, merits
great praise, and he lengthens our life, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95485:50"/>
shortens it. Man finds a kind of lust in it;
the luxury of it are the ceremonies, the strifes
of precedencies, and many other like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
which to his discommodity sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
it. It would be more needsull to
make a law against the dispatch of businesse,
then against sumptuousnesse, feasting and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell;
<hi>For the time that is lost, is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then the money that is consum'd.</hi> It grieves
a man that his life is short, and yet he doth
his businesse, as if it were of many ages: He
complaines of idlenesse, and makes his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
so. Life is consum'd in idlensse, and it
is over-plus of life, they call it short, and it
is long, for that which advanceth, is more
then that which operates. <hi>Man hath a
rule to mourne by nature, so soon as he is
borne, he should give thanks, and as soon as hee
is borne he mournes,; being arrived to the use
of reason, he bewailes his life as calamitous,
come to years forgetting that he cal'd it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
he is sorrie it is so short: It is indeed
too long, for it is a way that reacheth from the
Earth to Heaven; he that desir'd to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and to be with Christ, desired it should
be shorter. They are to suppose it short, that
by missing their way, goe the right way to
hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:95485:51"/>He is a great intercessour to the King
for good Officers; if any of them come to
old age, and so cannot serve, he procures
them rewards as if they did serve, as he did
to <hi>Don Francisco</hi> of <hi>Contreras,</hi> President of
<hi>Castile,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>Such servants as serve for respects, deserve
to be rewarded with their respects, and that
their reward may end, when that service is
ended, because the profit of the one, doth
terminate with the work of the other: <hi>But
no time should abridge the reward of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
that serves for love, for though
to serve, he ceaseth not to love.</hi> There is no
remuneration more fertile, nor of lesse bulk,
then that which is bestowed upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepidnesse
of a servant: It fills the Court
with servants, and empties no Exchequers;
few arrive to it, few hold out to it, and all
aspire to it, because, <hi>as feare makes us doubt,
that all that may come to passe which is not
impossible, so desire makes us hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke</hi> had one only Daughter,
and because he had no more, he conceived it
necessary to marry her into his stock, and
or this purpose he propounded to the King,
foure Subjects, that his Majestie might make
choice of one of them; the prudent answer
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95485:51"/>
of the King, worthy of the eminences of his
understanding was, whatsoever shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for you, shall be acceptable to me:
Be it your care to chuse, and it shall be mine
to enrich him as your Sonne in Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Astrology is in all parts fals, but false est
of all in matters of marriages, because men are
not married, nor doe they marrie according to
their inclinations, but for some ends, and that
is the cause of the change of tempers in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
because some by-respect hath its share in
marriages.</hi> It is true, they are voluntary,
otherwise they were of no value, but that
will, was not that which was made with us,
but that which we did make. Inclinations
that belong unto manners, are not alwaies to
be followed, for the temper is surely exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
and if it be not good, they are not
good; but inclinations to generation, may
be prosecuted with more security, because,
<hi>the constitution ordinarily desires, either the
like that conserves it, or the contrary that
corrects it,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke</hi> would not have restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his Election (nay certainly he ought not
to have done it) to his own Family, if he had
not found such a man in it, as he could not
peradventure have found the like, in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95485:52"/>
whole Kingdome, and it was the Marquesse
of <hi>Torall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were lawfull for me to Print some
few leaves, concerning the precepts, which
the <hi>Duke</hi> gave to the Marquesse his sonne
in Law, when he did elect him, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and it is a truth, that the great subjects
of Princes would learne more by those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements
how to regulate and governe
themselves, then by all the Books, that I have
written. His Daughter was married to
this Marquesse, with a generall joy of all;
but that cheerfulnesse was soon turn'd into
sadnesse, for when she had brought forth a
dead daughter, she was a dead Mother.</p>
            <p>Philosophers do make a generation a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
instinct; for say they, in regard that
man cannot eternize himself in the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall,
he seeks to eternize himself in the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
by children, but they are deceived, for
that is not perpetuated, is so perpetuated,
but it may be, man doth rather desire them
for his consolation and love. <hi>Nature to
eternall us, hath not been willing that wee
should seek for childeen, from any where else,
then from the soule that she hath made eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;</hi>
or if they be desired to be loved; then
are they not desiderable by the <hi>Duke,</hi> who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95485:52"/>
hath so great a King to love, and so eminent
an understanding to eternize him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> remained hopelesse of successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his bloud, being without sonnes.</p>
            <p>The desire of generation, which for the
benefit of the world is to be only of the
good, if it were not likewise among the bad,
Cities would not be so great, and perdaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would be better. I could be amaz'd
that the Heathen Law-makers, who had no
regard to Relgion, would be carelesse in this
point, if there were not an impossibillity
of resisting, such an inconvenience, without
running into greater; It is a weaknesse to
believe that they forbeare it, for the increase
of the number of Cities; <hi>Since it is the
quality and not the quantity of subjects, that
makes Common-wealths to be great.</hi> The
condition of the world is lamentable, for
<hi>nature as if shee were covetous, or envious,
makes those plants most fruitfull, which are
most unprofitable, and is rather a Mother in
law, then a Mother; to such as are necessary,
we should have reason to complaine us of her,
had not she had it first, to complaine her of
us. For sinne, that did infest the generation of
man, did likewise infest the generation of the
Earth.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95485:53"/>The death of his Daughter, made the <hi>Duke</hi>
abandon all intention of advancing his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
if he ever had had such a purpose, and
wholy betook himself to the service of God
and the King.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke</hi> (with pardon let me
speake it) did not arrive to the true <hi>Idea</hi> of a
Favourite, when his Daughter died. He
that hath Children loves them, thinks how
to make them great; and <hi>he that intends the
greatnesse of his Family, is one that love his
owne respects, and doth not satisfie, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a perfect Favourite.</hi> The love, that
is the due of a Prince, consists altogether of
good affections; it is alone splendor, and
infinite lights do forme it; to it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
the affections of tendernesse, which is
toward children, and the reverence due to a
Father, the cordiallnesse, wherewith we love
a friend, the naturallnesse wherewith we
love our selves; and he that hath another
Friend, another Sonne, another Father, and
who indeed is not himself transform'd into
his Lord, is not worthy to have his heart.
That the <hi>Duke</hi> was such an one, was well
discover'd, in the sicknesse that the King had,
upon the first of <hi>August,</hi> in the year 1627.
for he did all that was possible for a servant
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95485:53"/>
to do that his Lord might live, and so farre
as was permitted to a Christian, to
dye if he dyed. And when he was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by his friends at that time, to have some
regard to the maintenance of his own
health, he thrust them from him, with a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
choller.</p>
            <p>If the King dye not, his privacy cannot
dye, and indeed he cannot desire it life, if
he live not; if he could have been deprived
of that affection wherewith he was bound
to his Prince, whom he lov'd so much, and
lov'd him so much, either he was not a true
Private, or would not have been: For a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
is call'd a Private, because he is to be
Private to his will, to all his affections, to
all his passions, and transformed only into
the service of God and of his Lord. <hi>They
that sitt musing upon what may happen, love
not their Prince, but themselves, either they
have not the service of their Lord for their
end, or they thinke of beyond the end, when they
thinke of something after the end.</hi> I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that if the King had dyed, the <hi>Duke</hi>
had dyed with him, and if not dyed in the
world, yet to the world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> perceiving, that God would
forme in him a servant, without affection,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95485:54"/>
onely destinated to the service of his King,
did embrace it with all his soule, and all his
body, digesting in his brain the Chaos of the
whole Monarchy, wherein he spent sixteen
houres of the day, reserving to himselfe, but
only eight, for his sleep, his nourishment and
his own businesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The body of man consists of many parts, the
body of a Monarchy, of many affaires; both
which are divers; I was about to say contrary,
but in the whole man, and the whole monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
there is one and the same consent &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy:</hi>
A thousand Artificers concurre to
the building of an house. A house as I may say
doth consist of Wood, of Iron, of thornes, of lyme,
of Sand, but it is not enough, that all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
be together that build it, to make it a
house, nay that every piece by it selfe, were in
its due order, yet would this gathering together
be nothing more then a confusion; but here is
required an Architect, who uniting them in
his understanding, doth concoct, and regenerate
them, who raising the forme from the parts,
may produce that from the mixture, that it
may not be stone alone, nor lyme alone, or onely
Wood or onely Iron, nor all these things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but an house, which doth consist in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
harmony, that is the soule of these things,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95485:54"/>
that have no soule, even so (as I take it) is the
Chaos of a Monarchy, in the forming and
upholding whereof, there is a concurrence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Officers, and howsoever each of them
might operate well enough, in his peculiar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
yet would it for all that be but a confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if there were not, one onely Architect, by
whose direction should be ordered and disposed;
All the particulars, which otherwise would
loose the proper forme, and onely have part of
the All.</p>
            <p>Man consists of soule and body, but the
soule and the body do not make a man, but <hi>it
is necessary, that there be an Vnion, which though
it seeme nothing, is a reall Entitye:</hi> It seems
as it were a prejudice to a Monarchy, which
intimates one, that the first influences of it
are received in more; as it, that it did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
that more before the one, whereas it
should produce, first the One, because from
that One, and from him which are more, the
more is produced.</p>
            <p>Who so will know, the sincerity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Duke, let him consider how he
did advance the Cardinall of <hi>Tresco</hi> to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
of <hi>Castile,</hi> although his friends per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the contrary, conceiving that he
would run into some danger, by the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95485:55"/>
the Cardinall being the Creature of the
Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and of the Marquesse of the
<hi>Seven</hi> Churches, the one being falne from
being a Favourite, &amp; the other put to death,
in the time of the Duke; his well-willers did
insist upon it, that there being no want of
persons for so principall a place, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for him to have respect to his own fafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when he might do it, without dammage
to the Kings service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The grosse matter that makes the bow of
policy, doth not bend sometimes, and the thin
doth sometimes breake;</hi> the way of the
one is broader, but is longer, it seemes more
secure, because if it precipitate, it doth it lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely,
if it arrive, it arrives likewise slowly;
the other is shorter but it is slippery, and
sometimes precipitates speedily, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
comes sometimes to the end, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be learned in bookes, it requires many
circumstances, and who so wants one of
them, wants a foot, if he slip, he falls: He
that will performe it, must necessarily know,
how to produce it of himselfe, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a great power of the understanding,
and a great strength of knowledge, of how
much, is to be done, and when it is to be
done. There is a rule in policy, that men
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95485:55"/>
cannot be brought into (howsoever other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
very able) if they be not dependants;
it is a grosse kind of policy, which avoids
present danger; but not blame, and that puts
the future into a peradventure, if it happen,
that a businesse shipwrack, which hath been
taken out of the hand of some able man, to
give it to a dependant, although fortune have
all the share in it, yet is it given to Election,
and the losse of credit &amp; sometimes of favour
is the consequent.</p>
            <p>There is another rule, which able men may
come to, though they be not dependants, or
friends, and this is a subtile policy, which
assures against dangers, and produceth praise,
but it requires a great eye to see it, and a
greater to manage it.</p>
            <p>When he is not our friend, that is friend
to another, that is not our friend, his not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us is not to be hated, for where he loves
not, he loves not because he loves; his not
being a friend is accessory in him, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the nature of the Principal; So soon as the
one ceaseth to be, the other gives over loving,
but where there is enmity, &amp; enmity proceeds
from a bad nature, it ought not to be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted
with losse, and it may be given over
without shame, because the malignity which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95485:56"/>
would put the benefit in danger doth secure
from blame, it is very odious to all, it brings
not forth worth but destroyes it, it would be
likewise avoided of all, if it were not that
<hi>many seeke rather to beate downe then to
build.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Spaine</hi> which did enrich other Provinces
with gold and silver, was grown so meanely
poore, by the disorderly value of brasse mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
that trading was now in part given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
among the Provincials, and wholly left
of by strangers; which was occasioned, not
by the moneys coyn'd by the King, but by a
masse of false money brought in by Enemies;
when the Duke resolutely (though resisted
with great obstinacy, by the most part of the
Officers) did councell the King, to cry it
down, to halfe the worth, which put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
to the benefit of the people made them
hasten to erect a statue, to the providence of
their most loving Soveraigne, not without
honourable mention of the Lord Duke.</p>
            <p>The profit of the Prince in such an errour,
holds no proportion with the losse of the
subject, it hinders traffick with strangers, and
difficults it among his home merchants,
where the profit is great, there will not be
wanting some, that will adventure to falsify
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95485:56"/>
coyne, whence it is, that afterward in the
computation of the money he doth find, the
losse greater then that which he hath made;
<hi>there was a Common-wealth, that liv'd a long
time with leather money, but their lawes did
admit of no strangers, so that here they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
no traffique; they did tolerate no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and by these two they did hinder falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of money.</hi> A State that could have no
necessity of trading with strangers, and a
Prince that could find means to assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from coyners, either in regard of some
speciall materiall, or that he could find an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discoverable,
or inimitable forme from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he might be able without detriment to
his subjects, either to that matter, or that
forme, or likewise to some other matter,
that is far more vile then gold, give the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of gold; but because stamps are easily imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
it is necessary to have recourse to such
a materiall as is not easily found, and that
which is every where dispersed, not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
commerce, and to be secured from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is by accident, that gold is of such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
rare it is, because it is rare; Christall is
likewise beautifull, cleare and transparent;</hi>
if Gold be like the Sun, Christall is like the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95485:57"/>
Skye, the brittlenesse of it doth not villify the
worth, nor take away the beauty, but rather
increaseth the respect; the Pearle which is
more brittle then gold, and for its originall, is
not more noble, being the daughter of the
Moone and Water is more precious then gold;
but if that Gold be like the Sun, and that the
Sun be the principall Agent here below, and
that the Agent endeavours alwaies to make
that, which it makes like it selfe, why doth it
make the mettall so seldome? why doth it not
produce more gold then lead? It may be the
Sunne is not so powerfull an Agent as man
thinkes it is, it is hindred by the obscure mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in which it works, it is resisted by the grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and coldnesse of the earth, against which
it workes; for if one of these Agents were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

would either have become by this time wholly
Earth, or the Earth wholly Heaven, or if they
should be alwayes, and in every place of equall
strength, there would be no generation. <hi>It is
therefore no wonder if gold be so scarce in
the world,</hi> because it is not produced without
a great victory, and that is not obtain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

goe they much thither, for they goe not
thither. <hi>These</hi> Phaetons <hi>when they come to
touch that fire of Heaven, are for the most
part thunder strook by</hi> Jove. It is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
that howsoever, Prudence, be that,
which is necessary to the maintenance of
privacy, yet is not alwaies the true practised,
but for the most part the false. <hi>There is a
Prudence that hath reall good for its end, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which seems so; the one is pure, the
other puddle,</hi> both cry men up, and both
greatly exult; the one with the greater se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
because it is much more benigne, the
other with much more mirrour, because it
hath more eagernesse. <hi>The braines of a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
man is as a waving sea, alwaies unquiet, it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95485:59"/>
neither hath rest, nor gives rest, it destroies, or
will build, or will maintain: The foundations
of its height, are the ruines of others; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
a feare in the Prince to make it self ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
it will make him a Tyrant, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
makes it self so; it is an Art which
imitates Prudence, like the Artist that imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
Nature; it takes no pleasure if it doe
not deceive, and is most pleased when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
most, leaving to be, when it leaves to
cozen; it stands upon the very brink of a
precipice, and because it cannot alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
there is one time when it headlong falls.
The braine of the Prudent man is placide and
and loving, breathing nothing but sweetnesse,
nothing but quiet, it builds up what others
ruine; and if it sometimes doth destroy, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
not to raise its owne house, but to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it: It makes the King good, by shewing
him what is profitable; it makes him
love, to make him be beloved. A prudent
man falls not from favour, if the Prince
falls not into tyranny; and if some casuall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
doth thrust him from the Mountain of
Grace, hee goes but downe, hee tumbles not.
Greatnesse of the Prudent, are influences from
benevolent Starrs; and because they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by little and little, like high Towers,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95485:60"/>
they are continued high, upon their owne foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.
Witty men goe high, but they grow
not high, they are like balls of earth, which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
compel'd, by some compulsion, doe
swiftly passe through all buildings, and when
they are at the highest heights, they fall, and fall
not but they break.</hi> If <hi>Tacitus</hi> had ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the fall from privacy, as well to sagacity,
as he did to satiety, I would have borne with
his other part of speech, where he shewes
it rarely sempiternall, because it is rare for
men to have prudence, and such men are
most rare, which placed on high, maintain
it; and he that did attribute so much to the
power of domination and inchantment of
obsequiousnesse, might well think all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
fraile, all prudence fleeting.</p>
            <p>He hath made some Rivers in <hi>Spaine</hi> to
be made Navigable; he made some veines of
gold to be found, not for covetousnesse of
gaine, but to be able to diminish the grive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of the subject, without being wanting
to the businesse of the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Gold is profitable to conserve and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to encrease States. <hi>Some Politicians have
made it inferiour to reputation, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
reputation hath no other price, but the
reward which gold gives it; they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95485:60"/>
in this, because,</hi> they sometimes see men
forsake a rich Prince, to goe serve a Prince of
reputation, this experience hath been true, but
it came not so to passe, because reputation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeth
more then gold, but because the worth
of one in reputation, gives more hope of gold,
then the Exchequer of a rich man gives gold;
those Souldiers are ill apaid, that are alwaies
paid; and they are well pleas'd that are ill
paid: the ordinary price of their lives hardly
keepes them alive; Sackings, Inroades, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
Victories, are the advantages that enrich
the Souldiers, and they expect them most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
from such as they know most repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The Favourite that encreaseth the Revenues
of his master doth likewise encrease the Estates
of the people, one of whose great felicities is,
to have the Prince rich, for when he takes not
away, he gives, and when he gives he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
a holding Prince is more desiderable then
a bountifull; <hi>Donatives enrich but few, but
they empty the store, that must be restored
by the impoverishnesse of all.</hi>

            <p>The most Christian King of <hi>France</hi> had
besieged <hi>Rochell,</hi> and suspecting that it would
have been relieved by the King of <hi>England,</hi>
he did, by the means of the Marquesse <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boulle,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:95485:61"/>
his Ambassadour Extraordinary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Navy from <hi>Phillip</hi> the fourth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Councell of the <hi>Duke</hi> advising, it was
consented him; and was an Act of great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
by delivering <hi>France</hi> from so long an
oppression, with so much commodity to the
Catholike Faith.</p>
            <p>It was thought that the <hi>Duke</hi> erred in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of state, in preferring the service of God,
to that of the King, but he cannot erre in the
service of the Catholike King, that erres not
in the service of God; if any impious man
hath in his Instructions, seperated the reason
of State from that of God, yet are they so
conjoyn'd in the concernings of this King,
that no distinction of any understanding can
disjoyn them. God who hath manifested
unto us his Election of this Family, for the
defence of his Religion, hath not left a place,
that it may be taken away by the quicknesse
of spirit; so that if some Officer, of small or
no Religion, should by chance spring up, he
could do no hurt but to himself with his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
intention, finding himselfe thrust on, by
a nimblenesse of spirit to those actions, which
cloathed with the zeale of God, would be
laudable parts of prudence; but in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of reason of State, I conclude it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95485:61"/>
to be necessarily that of the Devill, when it
is seperated from that of the Lord. I believe
that <hi>Lucifer</hi> had no intention to raise himself
to such a height, as to be above God, for then
he would not have had an intention to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the Vnity, but to betterit, which he by
the naturall gift only of science, did know to
be impossible: He then had a thought to exalt
himself, by withdrawing himself aside, and so
going from one, to make the number of two,
upon which afterward as upon a Center, he
did designe his Circumference diverse from
that of God, nor could he go from the one,
but that he must be bad, because <hi>all that is
good is One.</hi> God drawing a line from his
Circumference, did to make the number of
three, create man: the Devill likewise thrust
out a line from his circumference, to make
the number of foure, and did seduce him.
God who would not leave man in the hands
of the Devill, came to redeem him, and
made the number of five, and although he did
not take away from him the excitement that
seduceth him towards the number of two,
yet he gave him the grace that reduced him
towards the One, whereupon man remained
free (not being able to designe a Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
upon himselfe, because there is no other
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95485:62"/>
Circumference to be given, then of the One,
and of the Two, nothing els being found but
good or evil to determine it; Operating well
upon the Centre of the one, and operating
ill upon the Centre of the Two. As there
are two Circumferences, so are there two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of State; the one of God the other of
the Devill, that of God, is to come neare to
God, to be great; that of the Devill is to
go far from God to make himselfe great,
what discourse then of a religious understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
shall ever deterre us from the spoiling
the nest of the Heretiques, if we be able to do
it? He that can do it, and doth it not, doth
sin, and doth inlarge (as much as in him lies)
the Circumference of the Devill. He that
can do it, and doth it, doth enlarge (by what
is in his power,) the circumference of God.
Have sins power to defend States, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
power to destroy them? Oh King! oh
Grandee! oh Catholique! what thing think
you, can defend your Kingdomes, not your
treasures, not the Armies, it is God defends
them, because you have defended him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you do defend him; and that you may
defend him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Emanuell of Merveses,</hi> Generall of
the Fleet of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> wanting sufficient means
to maintain him at Court, &amp; to defend him
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95485:62"/>
from some oppositions, advertis'd about the
discharge of his trust, was resolv'd to be gone,
&amp; leave a Deputy; which the Duke perceiving
by him, when he went to get leave of him
did not consent that he should depart with
dammage to his reputation, and yet being
unwilling to hinder the course of justice, did
offer himselfe to his assistance, as he did in
effect to his purse, so did this magnanimous
Fauourite, reserve the rewards that were
bestowed upon him to helpe deserving men
upon their occasions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a more blessed thing to give then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and peradventure the reason is, because
he that hath the commodity of giving; is more
happy, then he that hath the necessity of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
most happy then is he that gives and
not receives. He that receives and gives, is
not the man that gives, but he that gave it
him; such as are inflexible in receiving, are so
likewise in giving: the selfe-same severity
that they use against themselves, makes them
little charitable towards others: the Lord
<hi>Duke</hi> was able to have relieved an Officer of
so great merit, with that, which was his, of
whom he had well deserved, but he desired
to do it with his own, because he was a well
deserver of the King. A Favourite is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95485:63"/>
the service done to his Prince, as done
to him, and to repute himselfe obliged to
whom the King is, if he gives to him that
hath served well, he merits for those works,
that he hath not done, but rewarded; he
should prize his goods more then his life,
more then his understanding, more then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that would wast himselfe, and not his
Estate in the Kings service; the part of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
is as hard as part of receiving; he that
receives every thing is too covetous, he that
takes nothing is too severe; <hi>he that gives al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
is too prodigall, and he that never gives
is too miserable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Rhetorician</hi> that thought it a difficult
thing, to perswade a Judge to give what was
his own, and to be no hard matter to winne
him to give what was another mans, would
have been upon a false ground with the <hi>Duke;</hi>
Oh the gallant and true magnanimity of a
Favourite, who helpes by <hi>liberality</hi> where
he cannot by <hi>justice;</hi> and will rather be a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
himselfe, that he may winne who is to
loose, then that justice should lose, who is
alwaies to overcome; the Subjects that have
worth in them, may contend with certainty
of reward, when they serve a Monarch, whose
Favourite is such an one, that if he do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95485:63"/>
to the King for them, he gives like
a King to them; who will believe that a man
will not be liberall of another mans purse,
when he is franke of his own when he is to
be so; I was about to say, when he needs not
be so, I will say when he cannot be.</p>
            <p>Never was there a Favourite so courteous
in Audiences, so loving to Councell, to assist,
to comfort, and to hearken, I would set
down multitudes of glorious examples, but
because they are many, I will let them all
alone, because I would carry away the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
for brevity.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more desired or more
deare to the people then audience, and there
is no Officer, that can give it more, or ought
to give it more, then he that is most just.
Some there are, the which I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through zeale of justice, or ruggednesse
of nature, do heare with little patience, and
answer with little love, such as they will not
listen unto; whereas indeed they should
have been harkned unto patienly, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforted; it is necessary to shew love to
all, being merry with them that have what
they would have; compassionating others
that want of their riches; to the end that
the gainers may ascribe the obligation of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95485:64"/>
their gaining to their favours, and the loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
may lay it only on necessity: They are
no competent givers of audience, that do
not do that which is just, for when they are
assailed by the powerfull reasons of such as
are concern'd, they are compel'd to dismisse
them with an, I will have it so: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
afterwards the offended subjects call
them, and by good reason call them, the
Willers of wrong, because they will, in as
much as because they would, they wronged
them.</p>
            <p>But the Lord Duke, who doth hold in
his hand the ballances of <hi>Astraea,</hi> as well in
matters of <hi>favour</hi> as of <hi>justice,</hi> doth easily
pacifie such as he accepts against, making
them to know that they are either overcome
by <hi>merit,</hi> or by <hi>law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know not what to say of the Prince, I
might happily say that of him, that I say of
the Favourite, that he hath not only an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse
in the administration of justice,
but that he hath no lesse in the granting of
courtesies. <hi>Man is of himself a reasonable
creature, but when he deprives himself of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
he layes aside his reason, and is but only a
creature.</hi> The friends of the Favourite are
to be such as merit, and such to be most
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95485:64"/>
his friends, that merit most; the friendship
that is grounded without reason, may be said
not to be without unlawfull appetite, and
because it is not without passion, it is not
without reason; man hath not so much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to have as he thinks he hath. If we
should not love God above all things, wee
should sinne, and if we love such as merit
little, we may erre; it is a great matter cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
that charges are unjustly given, to
such sometimes that are to administer ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
I will not call this a <hi>liberty</hi> to do fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
but a <hi>licenciousnesse</hi> and an abuse,
which makes a great confusion in the world;
the greatest honour doth of justice belong to
him which is of greatest worth, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
punishment is his due by justice that is
the greatest offendour, and questionlesse <hi>if
there could be found ballances which should
weigh merits, as there are some to weigh
transgressions, I should wonder why justice
should be painted onely with the sword in her
right hand, and not likewise with Cities, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and Monarchies, that she may as it
were weigh them, not to the end, to reward
merits, but to the end to punish offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all Kingdomes could have such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95485:65"/>
as this, which would as diligently
weigh deserts, as failings, and that he would
take away that false liberty of granting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
which doth so much harme, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
so much hatred to the Prince, how
would they be without confusion, without
laments, and alwaies full of worthy men and
happy; but it may be this is not in use, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Princes would not be known to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated,
either to be of more value then
others, or to hold the Principallity unjustly,
or els to lay it down.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke</hi> is so easie to pardon inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and so much an enemy to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that many have thought it reason of
state to be his Enemies; there was a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
man, who upon no occasion of his, nor
for any just reason, had a pistoll prepared to
kill him, and having confest this with many
other faults deserving death, the Lord <hi>Duke</hi>
did make his punishment to be chang'd into a
long imprisonment, from thence he got
means to get free, yet left he not the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his heart, but being discovered he
was forc't to hast him out of <hi>Spaine</hi> to get
into another Kingdome, where he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Duke</hi> having notice of it, he

yet that is not it, which ruines the

great injustice, it is odious, it is ingratitude,
it is blamed of all, because the example of it,
is prejudiciall to all, it is reason of State, to

            <p>The Judge cannot render Evill for Evill,
when he cuts of a limbe. or takes away life;
he doth justice for injustice, he doth good
for ill; Man sinneth in doing, either because
he doth it, when he ought not, or because
he doth it not as he ought, or that he doth
more then he ought; Plants are not unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

            <p>In the distribution of offices and dignities,
the Lord Duke, came seldome to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and oftentimes jumped with the people;
in knowing who was to be elected, when he
is to be elected; And this course doth not he
only, but the King likewise strictly observes
in Ecclesiasticall offices, laying that burden
upon the shoulders of his Confessours to
choose such as are propounded by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
though there be every moneth such a
quantity of them provided, that it amounts
to a hundred thousand crownes revennue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All states, yea Tyrannies, are govern'd by
an Aristocracy, for if the Magistrates doe
it not, the Officers doe, and they for Masse are
a Common-wealth. The Favourite is the
Dictatour, if he doe nothing, he becomes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
if he do every thing, he savours of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi>
What matter is it, or of what conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
for him to choose Offices for all;
it serves well enough that such as choose,
have chosen, for then is he assured, that such
shall be elected, as he himself would have
chosen: He is quitted from the hatred of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95485:67"/>
such as are left out, and looseth not the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of those that are elected, for they are
sufficiently oblig'd to him, in that they were
not hindered by him; and that which is best
of all, he is safe from the danger, of not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well elected. It is very hard to know
the ability of persons, thereby to rest confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in election. Experience deceives us,
and reason cannot teach it. Every Science
to be well learned, and every office to be
well discharged requires a particular quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the braine, and so as one mans being
eminent in a Science, is rather a certain signe
of weaknesse, then of ability in others; so
the managing of one employment with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
doth not conclude the same fidelity in
others, that are not the same. <hi>Nature when
she makes one only thing, she makes it for one
only end; she is not (as the Philosopher said)
like the</hi> Delphick <hi>Smith, whose knife did cut,
and saw, and bore.</hi> Either a witty Tyrant
knew this, or a subtle Politician made him
say it, when he left it written; That, many
who are sent into commands appeare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,

of employment, and others disgraced;
which doth not only proceed by a glancing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95485:67"/>
quality of the braine, but likewise sometimes
through the inequality of the businesse. A
man of great abilities thrust upon an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
businesse, despiseth it, regards it not, is
carelesse of it; and that man brought to
great affaires, makes it appear, he was lesse
then the least, because he was greater. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of a small Alloy, being employ'd in
poore affaires, and therein wholy intent,
come out with much applause, but advanced
to greater, they do fall to ruine, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
that the felicity which they had in the
small matters, was not the greatnesse of their
parts, but the sutable equality to their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities:
That Tyrant did desire this part in
his Officers, and that Polititian knew it for
excellent when he did command a subject,
not for his being superiour, but because he
was equall to businesse.</p>
            <p>The Lord Duke, to the end that the
Counsellours should alwaies be wary and
dilligent in the well performing of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
made a little window, to be made in all
the places of Councells, where though the
King, could not sometimes be present, yet
that they might alwaies doubt he might be
there.</p>
            <p>A Prince hath a similitude to God,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95485:68"/>
though infinitely inferiour, and yet man
makes him as it were superiour, whilst he is
carefull not to transgresse, because it may be
the Prince may be there, but takes no care at
all, though the Lord is there, as if he did
doubt of that which is certain, and were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of that which he doubteth. <hi>He that
durst not offend in the presence of</hi> Cato, <hi>did
audaciously offend in the presence of God.</hi> I
give not this as a signe of an annihilated
faith, but an asswaged faith; it is a point
that should be taught children, before they
know sinne, to the end they should not sin,
because they should know they did it in the
sight of God; it may be the having sinned
without shame, would not take away the
shame of sinne. It is a great matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that the quantity of offences, encreaset<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
should encrease the feare, because it encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the offences. <hi>But all our Errours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from our ignorance:</hi> Man cannot see
God alive; man knowes that God is, what
he is, but he knowes not that, which he is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in this world he doth not see him, as he
is. I doe not therefore wonder that the
Prophet called his sinnes, by the name of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95485:68"/>He did intreat his King, upon his knees,
that he would encrease his Talent, not only
by his experience, which by his continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in businesse he had gained, but by his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the stories of his predecessours; the
King followed his counsell, and one day as
he was reading, he fell into a large commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of one King in especiall, to whom
the <hi>Duke</hi> replied, that he would have been
much more worthy of praise, had he not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himselfe to be so much governed by his
Favourite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was given as an excellent counsell to</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
<hi>to the end he might suppresse</hi> Seneca, <hi>to
shew him who was his Master, that his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
were most powerfull Doctours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him;</hi> the Lord <hi>Duke</hi> likewise, to the
end that none should give the counsell against
him, did blame that King to his Majesty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he suffered himselfe to be led by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
as by a Master, making it appeare
to him, that his fore-Fathers are fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him, and therefore intreates him to
read the story of his Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicholas Machiavell,</hi> he would have
men have recourse to Ancient rather then
Modern Writers; he said, that if we make
use of the learnings of the Antient, for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,

if of their Lawes for judgme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, if of
their Statutes for imitation, why should we
not serve our turnes likewise with them by
imitation of their Actions, which is not a
thing impossible to be done, in as much, as
neither the Heavens, the Elements, nor men,
have changed their motion, order or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>I for my part (and I desire pardon) am of
a contrary opinion, yet do not I say that men
are changed, I rather say they are not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in Specie, or the Individualls, yet are
the actions changed which are not of the
Species, but of the Individualls; the quality
and quantity of meats, being now in our
times altered and changed, have made them
excusable, who have written Aphorismes that
once were true, but now are false; and this
alteration hath had great power in the
change of the Temperature, which being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
hath in part changed the manners.</p>
            <p>I do not say, that the heavens are not the
same, and that their motions are varied; The
motions are not the givers of influence, but
the Stars, nor the Stars neither without an
Aspect; The selfe-same Heavens then, the
self same Stars, the self-same motions do still
remain; but not the self-same Aspects, nor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95485:69"/>
never shall, and then if the self-same Aspects
shall never be, no more (in as much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them) shall the same effects be. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
things hath a connexion with the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour:
He that would consider, that there is
not one Constellation like another in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
would not mervaile, that there is not
one man like another on the Earth, and that
one action is not like another;</hi> but as in Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
that observation that is nearest, is least
false, so in policy is that example, that is most
moderne.</p>

               <hi>If Physitians goe not from the reasons of
the Antients, yet doe they in a great part, goe
from their Medicines;</hi> The thin and spare
dyets, that are appointed and taught by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi>
which are to give nothing, except
the disease be resolved on, when the judgment
is made on the fourth day, if all those times
they helpe, all other times they hurt; some
barly corns weight, that did serve them of old
for a competent food, would sterve us now.
The <hi>Hellebores</hi> which then did worke a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Medicines, would now extinguish Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
new diseases are now sprung up, new
Medicines are now invented, and the old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
and changed.</p>
            <p>The Lawes of times past, do serve these
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95485:70"/>
times, but they are such as judge between <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Sempronius,</hi> but not those that have
respect to the countenance of States: Nay
rather a great part belonging to manners are
changed; Our Religion hath established a
Canonicall Law diverse from the Civill Law:
Lawes of marriage are varied, those of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
are taken away; nor is there any thing
now spoken, of bond or free-man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Agrarian</hi> and the <hi>Iulian</hi> Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a multitude of others, are muffled up in
oblivion, nor there is the least City that
is built, that hath not built peculiar Statutes.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sculpture</hi> we imitate the Ancients to
make a man, which is alwaies the same, but
not to make this man which is alwaies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and <hi>as the Sculpture should be ridiculous
that being desirous to make a strong man, should
shape him out by the Statue of</hi> Alexander, <hi>so
likewise that polititian should be foolish, that
would endeavour to teach the maintenance of
our moderne Common-wealths, with the rules
and manners of the Romanes.</hi>

            <p>He that believes that after he hath read a
laudable example of our Predecessours, that
he is able by and by, to put it in practice,
is deceived; he should have need first to
change all the world: <hi>The world consists of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95485:70"/>
order and harmony, and it is an Instrument of

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Machiavell</hi> was likewise deceived in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that the helpe of history did consist in
the making use of example; and from this
errour, as from the Root, come all his fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in policy; <hi>As Empericks are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
in Physick, so are Exemplaries to be
abandoned in policy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ought not, not only, not to make use
of the Examples of the Antients, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
not of the modern; for they require too
great circumstances to come to be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and will aske a great many to make a
rule; Many of them are very dangerous, in
as much as they are not alwaies the sonnes of
prudence, but many times of fortune, and
<hi>fortune is not to be presupposed in businesse, but
to be desired.</hi> I blame not by this the reading
of history, for I commend it, and resemble
it to meats, because <hi>as meates, except they do
more then stay in the stomacke onely, they doe
not nourish the body' so if history stay onely in
the memory, it doth not forme the judgement,
they are changed, digested, and animated:</hi> If
all men had eminency of understanding, they
would have no need to read histories, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95485:71"/>
Phisitians, or trouble themselves to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Statues (I now insist against <hi>Machiavels</hi>
argument) to be Sculptoures: but because in
few, and a few times this eminency is to be
found, Polititians dispose themselves to read
Histories, and Sculptours to imitate statues;
and as Statues are of no use to Sculptours,
but for good, delineation, it being no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
to copy the very same, but to
make some varied with the manner dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from them: So Histories are little help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to Polititians, but only for the setling of
a good judgement. <hi>For they are not to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
according to the examples, but according
to the judgement that they have raised upon
the reading of the examples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Machiavell</hi> is to be borne withall, if he
be an Emprick in policy, because he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
an Emperick in physick, whilst he doth
say, that it is an experience made by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
whereupon the Phisitians of now a
dayes, doe ground their judgements; whereas
he should have said, that it is a Science of
wholsomenesse, unwholsomensse and Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>I fall to my Centre, and commend the
Duke, that commended the reading of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
to the King, on purpose that from
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95485:71"/>
them he might frame his judgement, and
that he should consider those of his fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that he might serve his turne with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and with lesse danger.</p>
            <p>If Libells and Satyrs be only against him,
he never punisheth, because he despiseth
them; but if they be against the King, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Officer, he makes the Delinquent
smart for it.</p>
            <p>A man that was a great Artist, said, that
a subject ought not to satyrize against one
that commands, but is to praise him that is
past, to follow him that is present, and is to
desire good Princes, but to reverence them
whatsoever they are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyberius</hi> began the law of high treason,
for his beginnings were very good; he did
not follow it, because they became bad.</p>
            <p>It was not Art, it was Nature; and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
was not encreased in that, till goodnesse
was diminished in him, himself he altred,
and it he altered, and because he ingraved it
in the tree of malice, as that encreased, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.
<hi>They that punish Satyrs approve of
them, if they be false, they move to laughter;
if they be true, they excite to choller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be blamed with a lye doth comfort, for
it intimates, a not being able to be blam'd with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95485:72"/>
a truth.</hi> That which is, is not neglected to
be said, when that which is not is said; but
those Princes, that find themselves galled by
truth, fall into fury, because they perceive
that known, which they did not believe to
be known, and it may be they did not know
it themselves, being flattered by others, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
likewise flatterers of themselves, and
since that they cannot hinder understanding,
but that they understand them, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
pens that they may not write, tongues
that they may not speak, that if it be not lost
in the memory of those that are, yet that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may come into the knowledge of those
that shall be, and truly Princes would have a
power in them to forme forgetfulnesse, if it
were in their power, as it is in ours to stop
pens, and stay tongues.</p>
            <p>I do not consent to the coneeit of the
Commons that Libels are good instructions
of Princes, I hate them as unprofitable, I
blame them as pernicious, I speak not to have
them approved of, but I say, that they are
not alwaies to be punished, without any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but that they should be sometimes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
<hi>Liberty of speech and writing against
a Prince without danger, makes him loose his
respect, and respect once lost produceth rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:95485:72"/>
to what few the advices and counsels of
such, as not managing the businesse of state
are never informd, upon what pin they turn?
A Prince in my opinion should erre in his
affaires if he take not the opinion of many;
I was about to say of all, if it could be had
without the communicating of his interests
to all. He that blames him and knowes not
his secrets, must remember, that so the God
of Heaven, might sometimes be blamed by
the rashnesse of men; if he that did know
his secrets had not stopped his tongue, with
the bridle of ignorance.</p>
            <p>The Lord Duke gives no audience to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
because he will not that married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
shame their husbands, as if that they
were the more able; and as for widdowoes
and maides, he hath assured them, that a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under their hand, shall have more power
to prevaile, then the sight of their persons.
He saith that the Seremonies which are to be

that takes pittie, loves.</hi> Compassion is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
formed from the quality of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
sometimes from the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
the one is produced from feare, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from love, the one hath the future for
object which is feared, the other the present,
which is loved; and albeit feare is more

            <p>It was told the Duke, that a great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of the greatest Potentate, found fault
with him; I cannot believe it, I will not
believe it, replyed the Duke; for it is not to
be surmised of a man of so great worth.
Though the Duke had reason to blame him,
and to conceit but meanly of him, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if he compar'd him to himself, who is an
Officer of so worthy fame, and worthy of so
high renowne.</p>
            <p>To blame Competitours, is either a signe
of great good, or of great weaknesse; for the
most part, when it doth not proceed from
zeale, it pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of its essence, is called inferiority. <hi>Hee

his Corrivalls, to make them great to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>He is not great, that is not so over inferiours;
but he is great, that is greater then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95485:74"/>
The worst comparison doth diminish
blame, but doth not forme a praise, the best
encraseth it. <hi>The Tyrant that did never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
other thing then to make his subject vile
and base, was ashamed when he knew them
base, because he knew that it made him base.</hi>
Such as will learne an Art or a Science, the
first object that they set before them, is not
immediately that of the Art, or that of the
Science; but an Artist, or a Scientiate, and
that not the greatest neither, but the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
(Our desires are short sighted, they see
but a little way off, and doubtlesse it is a
great matter, that the very same man, that
hath a mind so swolne, as not to be content
with the greatest things in the world, can
yet have it so little, as to believe he is to be
content with small things: The one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
pradventure from the businesse of the
matter, the other from the eminency of the
forme.) And afterward when the Artist or
Scientiate hath arriv'd to the first object, he
thrusts himself forward to another, never
ceasing to have some one man for his object,
till he hath passed all men; then is it in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
never to look back upon such as he hath
out gon, and as one that is altogether intent,
not to arrive to an eminency among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95485:74"/>
but of the profession; He reflects no
more upon the quality of the Artificers, but
onely considers the greatnesse of the Art,
whence it comes to passe, that when he speaks
not of others, and when he considers not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he manifests to have exceeded them,
and if by chance some speak to him of any
Artificer, he praiseth him, because he chose
the Art that he did chuse; he blames him
not, because he considers him, not as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
not arrived unto, but as a companion
to that object, to which he himselfe is not
arrived,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> is not an obstinate defendour
of his opinions, but if he doth meet with a
better, which rarely falls out, he embraceth
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some stand firme and setled in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
because it is good, and then it is constancy,
and some because they know not a better, and
then it is weakenesse, some because they will
not know another, and then it is obstinacy.</hi> It
seems to be a very secure course for the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
to be turn'd to the opinion that seems
to him the best, for if it happen well, it is so
where he accepts it, if it was not his, he shall
avoid inexplicable dangers, that hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to make himselfe the head of a party, if
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95485:75"/>
after he hath spoken his opinion he doth not
stand obstinately to maintain it. All opinions
that seem best are not so, because a man doth
not alwaies negotiate with the best, irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
is reputed weaknesse, and perhaps it is
the noblenesse of the understanding: the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it is that which cannot be false, if it
be quieted with that which may be, and may
not be, it is deceived; the man that is the
chiefe of the Counsellours, is not for all that,
found to be chiefest in Counsels, he that hath
got a strong Fort, is not to adventure it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the uncertainty of one issve; for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the gain are not equall in him; he
ought alwaies to propound businesse by way
of doubt, without hearing a case beyond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
or knot to be untied, or evasion
to be propounded, to that end that an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
may not be held, that may not be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Arguments, and defended by the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
which he hath propounded in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and in this case if they fall out
well, he shall have the honour of it, because
they were taken for the reasons that he had
adopted, if they prove ill, he shall not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
for he shall meet with those difficulties,
which he foresaw, and if by chance he hath
ometimes a desire to apply them, more to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95485:75"/>
one resolution then to another, he must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
to make some confident of his, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
of the businesse.</p>
            <p>True it is, that a subject of great worth,
that is not known, and moves not in a large
Spheere, after having exquisitely pondered
the reasons, may for once be the leader of an
opinion, because it is doubtfull whether the
losse or the gain may be greater to him. It is
necessary for a man to make himselfe famous
in the opinion of him, to whom he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
so, and to adventure himselfe to him
that will make him famous.</p>
            <p>The first day that <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Francisco</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treras</hi>
entred into his office, the <hi>Duke</hi> spake
to him after this manner:</p>
            <p>Many are the years that I have lived in
Court, and in those years I have seen many
Lords and Knights consume their Estates,
been sent to prison and be banished, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had brawles with representers of justice,
as Notaries, Provost Marshals, Sergeants and
such like; and yet I never saw any of those
hang'd; though it be impossible that such
kind of people, which are of inferiour condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should alwaies have reason for what
they do; and therefore it is to be believed,
that these being such as hale men to prison,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95485:76"/>
and such as forme processes, do find meanes
to unburthen themselves, to burthen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency then, shall do a great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to his Majestie, and a great good to the
Common-wealth, if you will ridd the Court
of this abuse; yet doe I not meane that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours
of any condition should escape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished,
(for that would diminish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that is due to justice) but that you
should cause such Officers that abuse their
Authority to be hang'd. This advertisement
that manifested the upright intention of the
Duke, did likewise notably comfort all the
Nobility.</p>
            <p>Monarchies, which are the great Colosses
of the world, are kept up by two of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
pillars that can be, that is by Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Serjeants; but what of that? <hi>Hath
not likewise every garden that is full of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
hearbs, rich in choicest flowers, fruitfull in
every plant, the basest excrements of bruite
beasts for its foundation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Monarchies were not degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Tyrannies, if zeale for God would alwaies
administer justice, then would there be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi>
found, that would put <hi>Agags</hi> to
death; <hi>Eliahs</hi> that would rip up the bellies
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95485:76"/>
of the false Prophets; But that zeale is lost,
and insteed of it we find, that subjects of
great bloud are ashamed to be Officers for
such imployments? So that it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to have recourse, to the vilest of the vile
people; and because the base fellowes which
undertake that charge, if they find it not
vile, do make it so: Princes were as it were
compel'd, yea, the very wisest of them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and uphold such kind of instruments:
For should they likewise have had them in a
base esteem, that weaknesse of the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would have drawn with it the ruine of
Dominion into consequence; but it may be
too, that it is a cunning in Princes, to put
these charges into the hands of people of a
vile condition, for such offices have in them
something of terrible; so that if they should
have joyn'd reputation to such terriblenesse,
I am not certain whether instead of making
the subjects only stand in feare, they would
not likewise have terrified Princes, whereas
now they cannot offend with that reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Prince giveth them, because he
defends them; they thinke it an errour to
punish them, by whom they punish, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Domination which relieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them in generall, relyeth upon every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95485:77"/>
as if that the neck of a rascall were
the neck of the Monarchie; but it is a too
too ordinary a course, to make justice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
impudent, that they may keep their
government untouch't.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ascot</hi> of <hi>Flanders</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

as she did assure the Catholique King of the

propounded by Count <hi>Henry,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rebels, so likewise she writ to him, that
by him he might be able to discover all the
persons of the Confederacy, and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
that they had; Now in regard that
the effects of it were begun to be felt in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
the King question'd the Duke of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

about it, whose answer was, that he knew
no more of any thing, then what he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to the most renowned <hi>Infanta;</hi> such
a Negation in so dangerous a businesse, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as if it deserved an imprisonment, but
the Lord <hi>Duke,</hi> who knew, that it did not
proceed from any ill mind in the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Ascot,</hi> but from a certai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them open which had trusted him, taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himselfe, the assurance of his not flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
did intreat his Majestie to question him
once again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:95485:77"/>Many there are, that believe that they
are not bound to discover what they know;
so that they do not, what they ought not,
but they do that, they should not, when they
tell not, that they know.</p>
            <p>It is the most capitall offence in conspiracy to
conceale the conspiracy, for if they be knowne
they are hindred, he that doth not run himselfe
into a rebellion, yet knowes of it, and holds his
peace shewes more feare then love.</p>
            <p>I confidently believe, that the character
of nobility of mind in the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ascot,</hi>
which made him loyall to his Prince, was the
very same thing that made him faithfull to
his friends; but what faith is to be observ'd
with such an one, as keeps not his faith? with
one that would make him unfaithfull, (I was
about to say, that had made him when he

this is not a conceit, but a truth that I write,
and yet are men oftentimes deceived with it,
running to what is false, under the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of what is good: Tyrants have been
the occasion of that great errour, who by
means of their wickednesse, have made the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95485:78"/>
revealing of conspiracies an infamy, the plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them a glory. It may too, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have co-operated in the work, by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them to come abroad imbroydered with
Encomions, therein publishing that Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
are good, if Princes be bad; how much
better had it been, to have made it utterly
detestable, then to leave it in the breast of
the passions of men, to judge first of the
Prince, and then of the conspiracies; our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
hath in part provided for it, such as
have impugned the Authority of the Pope,
being unwilling to have it in his hands to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
who are friends, either have a desire to
be, or would have a power to be, or else are
already Tyrants, they know not certainly
what the reason of State is, which (though
Religion move them not, that ought to move
them) should not only have a power to
make them believe this infallible truth, but
that they should likewise makeit be believed
by the Subjects. to the end, that whereas
there are now so many Tribunals of Subjects
that judge of the Prince, and so answerable
to that judgment, legitimate, or illegitimate
conspiracy, it might be brought to one only
just Tribunall, which is the Tribunall, of the
Vicar of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:95485:78"/>The King examined the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ascot</hi>
twice more, rather like a Brother then a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne;
and he still holding himselfe to his
first tale, the Lord <hi>Duke</hi> was desirous to talk
with him himselfe once again, in the presence
of the Duke of <hi>Atra,</hi> and the President of
<hi>Castile,</hi> to whom the Duke of <hi>Ascot</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that he had told what he knew, and
what the <hi>Infanta</hi> would have testified for a
truth, had she beene now alive; the Duke
that he might convince him, shew'd him the
letter of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> at which he was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
not being able to recover himselfe,
the King hereupon was inforced to commit
him into hold, with all the commodities that
were possible; when the Duke of <hi>Ascot</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon the Letter of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and
knowing the bounds of necessity, writ a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Duke, as to the man whom he had
alwaies known well affected towards him,
wherein he did unfold as much as was desired
to be known: the Duke carried it to the King
without opening it, and then upon his knees
did humbly beseech him to excuse the error
of the Duke of <hi>Ascot,</hi> as a thing that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from a false opinion, &amp; not from any ill
will, and in the mean time he took the leave,
to make his sword be restored him, that it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95485:79"/>
might appeare he was not restrain'd for his
own fault, and he gave order that there
should be an Edict of pardon published in
<hi>Flanders</hi> for all such, as had not made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
guilty by discovering themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scruples of honour, whereby Subjects
doe sometimes distast Princes, are rather
worthy of compassion then chastisement,</hi> what
ill will be feared from an honourable man?
the subject can do no harme to his Prince if
he be not infamous, <hi>then ought the Prince as
a Physitian to use the sick party roughly, not
to kill him, but to heale him;</hi> when a man
doth any thing for the honour of zeale only,
he works not by his own will, lesse against
his will, but out of his will, for that that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
him, is not in him, but without him.
To set upon which necessity, is not to do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
but to remove it: Honour should be
one of the most substantiall foundations, that
should uphold nature, if it were as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by good Lawes, as it is worm-eaten
with wicked opinions; but it cannot be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by good Lawes, if the opinion of
swaggering be not first taken away, and this
cannot be abolished, because it is a too ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
quality in Subjects, if Princes will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defend or inlarge their territories, the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95485:79"/>
advantages that men get by stoutnesse, and
the disadvantages that they receive by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlinesse,
makes this be dispised and that
applauded; so that many have valued swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerers,
for men of greatest spirits, as if they
had greater soules.</p>
            <p>The Lord Duke was likewise to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for the happy progresse in <hi>Germany.</hi> He
was the man that counselled the King to
send, and did make the provision, that the
Cardinall <hi>Infanta</hi> might go thither, a Prince
of great Spirit and magnanimous, of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
mind &amp; undaunted heart, whose beams
were scarcely discover'd Orientall, but that
they consumed the vapours, disperst the
clouds, and cleared the skye, It is question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
a great matter, but now adayes not new,
nay rather most usuall, that three Princes,
and they young ones, as the King of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>

of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> have terrified and supprest, the

of great reputation, bred up in the

            <p>All that are, and have been in the world,
have ordinarily periods, which are the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
Encrease, Stay, Declination, and
End. <hi>He that painted Fortune upon a wheel,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95485:80"/>
if that wheel were not Heaven, if that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
were not the Starrs, he was in an horrible
errour to picture only one thing in this world
upon a wheel, where every thing hath its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
wheel.</hi> It is true that Fortune often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
growes grey-headed with a man; but
that which did at one time raise him, is not
that which dejected him, because it may
turne. One hath a fortune, doth encrease,
another that throwes down, and declines.
I never wonder that foraigne Princes to
move Cities under Dominion to rebellion,
but I am amaz'd to think, that Cities will
be moved to it; for if they overcome they
cannot do it, but they must first behold, their
Countries destroied, their countrymen spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and their Exchequours consumed; so
that when they have wone, they have lost;
they do not take away Authority, they do
but change it; and the very same hatred
they had towards their old Governours,
they will place upon the new. <hi>It is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the man, it is against Dominion, which
never dyes, for the Princes be mortall, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
are immortall.</hi> They too much flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themselves with hopes of melioration in
mutation; if they trust in friendship, they
are vaine. <hi>The love of interest, which is a

Giant, doth easily overcome all other loves,
which are but Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be peradventure believed, that
there will be lesse desire of dominion in a
new Lord, who is not a new Lord, but by too
much covetous desire of rule, nay rather it is
to be feared as most undoubted, that he
will stop up the way by which he entred in
himself, that other may not be brought by
it. I will not particularize the mischiefs
that their losses would bring forth, they see
them that produce them, yet produce they
not so many as their victories would; they
are too too quickly falne under the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of so courteous Princes.</p>
            <p>If our Lord God would have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to shew in a glasse, to the Princes, and
Cities, that have moved commotions in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
upon future condition, that, which
such an Insurrection would have brought
forth, this so horrible a Tragedy, had not
now been to be seen; but he forbeare not
doubtlesse to present it to such eyes, as were
willing to see it. What understanding could
be so blockish as not to know it, did it but

likewise to make them lesse rash. The good

in Authority, or at the least greater in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
should not adventure (without security)
to be beaten down by them, whose losses it
may increase; because sometimes Princes are
not moved to great purchases, either because
they think them not necessary to be gotten,
and so content themselves, or because they
feare to loose, and so endanger not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but if by chance some violence spurre
them on to take Arms, they begin to believe,
that for to maintain their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reputation of not
being afraid, it is necessary to take them up,
and then they lay them not down, till they
have inlarged their Dominions, or increased
their Authority, <hi>but it is very true, that wars
come again to sprout out, because Conquerours
either know not how, or will not know, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are not able to make an end of their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
sometimes being full of glory they are
Satiate, sometimes afflicted by the charges,
affrighted by the many slaughters, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of quiet, they enjoy the present, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the future into the hands of Time

            <p>I certainly hold that Princes (I speak of
such as are past, after that they were come
the Monarchs) had a regard only to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of their states, and I believe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that they were oftentimes informed,
they could not be able to keep them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the taking in of some places, that might
threaten a disturbance; and then, assoon as
that was gain'd, they would begin to find
out another that might be prejudiciall to the
last that was got, and so indeed go infinitely
on, <hi>from whence peradventure it comes, that
by this insensible deceit, they have made it be
believed, that the desire to keep what they have,
hath beene a covetuousnesse to get large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Emperour alwaies <hi>Augustus,</hi> that
in his time saw the world in a calme; to keep
it in that tranquility which might have been
disturbed by envy and feare, more then by
any other thing whatsoever, had a purpose
not to dilate, but to restrain, and likewise
peradventure to fortify the Confines of the
Empire, thereby to be able the better to keep,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95485:82"/>
and more quietly to enjoy it, <hi>by his making
it knowne that the desire of domination was not
infinite, being terminated in a Prince that had
bounded the Imperiall Confines:</hi> He that was
the first that made faith violable, was the He
that did ruine the world, <hi>for had not men been
deceived by breach of faith, there would never
have been jealousie, and without jealousie envy
would have been of small account, because it
would have beene alone.</hi>
