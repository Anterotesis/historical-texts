         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

published this Treatise in Latine,
for the use of young Students in
<hi>Theology;</hi> by the earnest and
frequent entreaty of friends, he was induced
and perswaded to translate it into our vulgar
Tongue, for the benefit of these who understood
not the Latine; and for preventing the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of others, who, more forward then skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
were about the doing of it, and had once
so far proceeded, as to offer it to the Press,
without acquainting him therewith.</p>
            <p>When he had finished the Translation, his
purpose was to have dedicated it to your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and to have sent it abroad into the world
under your protection: but weakness and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the ordinary companions of age, and after
them, death (whereby God Almighty and

into his Master's joy) seasing upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could write an Epistle Dedicatory, it
was his will, that your honourable Name should
be prefixed unto it. In pursuance whereof, it
comes now, as an Orphan, to kiss your noble
Hands, fraughted with hopes of favour and
shelter for the Parent's sake, and of acceptance,
as a testimony of the sincerity of the respects
he carried to your Ladyships vertues.</p>
            <p>It hath the stronger plea for a tender recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it is the child of his age, being his
last labour, and being brought forth in his
seventy and second year; and that it comes
arrayed in a sute of Country-cloath, which
himself put upon it, being published according
to the Copy written with his own hand.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40880:4"/>
2. As to the first, what conscience is, It hath pleased
God, the soveraign Lord and Judge of all men, in the
Creation, to put in mans soul a natural power or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
whereby he might not only understand the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
will of God, (the only Lord of, and Law-giver
to, the Conscience) not only concerning what he should
believe and perform, but also might judge of his own
faith and obedience, whether performed or not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
yea, and might judge also of the faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of others, in so far as evidences may be had of
their conformity unto, or dis-agreement from, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
rule of faith and maners. This power of the
soul of man, whether it be considered only in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
aptitude and fitness to judge, (though not as yet,
or for the time, actually judging) or whether it be
looked upon as it is putting forth it self in exercise, we
call it by the name of <hi>Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The word <hi>Conscience</hi> is divers wayes taken; for
sometime by it is meaned the natural power of the
mind, to judge both of our own and others conformity
to the rule: and in this larger acception we say, <hi>Every
man hath a Conscience,</hi> that is, every man, whether male
or female, whether old or young, whether sleeping or
waking, hath a faculty, which may, and sometime shall,
judge of their own and others behaviour towards God.
Sometime it is taken for that natural power of the mind,
putting forth it self actually in exercise, by judging of
others; So doth the Apostle take it, 2 <hi>Cor. 5, 11. I trust,</hi>
saith he, <hi>we are made manifest in your consciences.</hi> But
here, in this Treatise, we take <hi>Conscience</hi> more strictly, as
it examineth and judgeth of our selves; for, in this
sense, it is most properly called <hi>Conscience,</hi> or joint know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
partly, because it supposeth, that God and
we know our obedience, or disobedience, to the rule
prescribed to us by Him; partly, because Conscience
imports, first, our knowledge of the rule; and, next, our
knowledge of our behaviour in relation to the rule, and
our comparing of these two together, and passing of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of our selves answerably.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40880:4"/>
4. Conscience, as it doth respect our selves, is no other
thing, in effect, then the understanding power of our
souls examining how maters do stand betwixt God and
us, comparing His will revealed, with our state, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and carriage in thoughts, words or deeds, done or
omitted, and passing jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ment thereupon as the case
requires: So that in the court of Conscience, (which
is Gods Depute in us, as it were) these five things are to
be considered; 1. the duty of self-examination; 2. the
thing we are to examine; 3. the rule whereby we are
to examine; 4. the process of the Conscience unto sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
giving; and, 5. the execution of the sentence, so
far as the Conscience may.</p>
               <p>5. As to the first, the duty of examination of our
selves and ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ging our selves, it is required of us, lest
we be judged of God and chastised with sharp rods,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. 32. and hereunto we are exhorted, <hi>Ps.</hi> 4. 4,
<hi>Commune with your own hearts upon your beds, and be still.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. As for the second, the thing which we are to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
concerning our selves, it is one of three, or all the
three, in their order; to wit, either our <hi>estate,</hi> whether
we be in the state of nature, under wrath, or not; or
whether we be regenerat and in the state of grace
through faith in Jesus Christ, or not. Of this speaketh
the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Examine your selves whether
ye be in the faith.</hi> Or it is our <hi>condition,</hi> whether being
in the state of grace our present disposition or inclination
of heart and affections be such, as becometh a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
or not. To this point of examination, Christ
doth call the Angel of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Rev. 2. 5.
<hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen.</hi> Or, the
thing we are to examine is our deeds, words and
thoughts actually done or omitted; the neglect of
which examination is reproved, <hi>Ierem. 8. c.</hi> and
<hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>7. The third thing to be looked unto in the court of
Conscience, is the rule whereby we are to examine our
selves in all, or any, of the former respects, which is the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40880:5"/>
revealed will of God in holy Scripture; wherein is set
down to us what we should believe, and what we should
do, and what is the reward of the obedience of faith, and
what is the punishment of disobedience. And here if
the Conscience be not well informed, and the rule closly
cleaved unto, the erring Conscience may swallow down
the grossest idolatry, and cry up <hi>Diana</hi> for a great god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess,
<hi>Act.</hi> 19. 28 and make the murtherers of the Saints
conceive, that in killing them they do God good service,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 2.</p>
               <p>8. The fourth thing is, the judicial process of the
Conscience, for giving such a sentence of direction for
what is to be done, or of absolution or condemnation,
in the point examined and found done or not done:
which process, if the Conscience be well informed, is
after the maner of clear reasoning, by way of Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme,
wherein we lay down the rule given by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Law-giver, in the <hi>major</hi> or first proposition.
Then we do lay our selves to the rule in the <hi>minor</hi> or
second assumed proposition; and from the comparison
of our selves, with the rule, we give out sentence in the
third room, which is called the Conclusion. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
If the Conscience be about to give direction for
what is to be done, it reasoneth thus,</p>
               <p>What God hath appointed to be the only rule of faith and
maners, I must take heed to follow it as the rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> the holy Scripture, God hath appointed to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rule of faith and maners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore,</hi> I must take heed to follow the Scripture as the
only rule.</p>
               <p>Or more shortly, the Lord hath commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and turn unto him, (offering reconciliation in
Christ) therefore it is my duty so to do.</p>
               <p>But in the process of the Conscience unto conviction
or absolution, sometime moe, sometime fewer reasonings
are used.</p>
               <p>As for example, for conviction, the process goeth
thus,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40880:5"/>
That which God hath commanded me, I should have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one:<hi>But,</hi> to repent and turn to Him, He hath commanded me;<hi>Therefore,</hi> I should have repented and turned to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> He that hath not obeyed the Lord, in repenting of
his evil wayes and turning unto God, is under great guiltiness,
and worthy of death, by the sentence of the Law;</p>
               <p>But, <hi>such a one am I,</hi> may every impenitent person say
of himself:</p>
               <p>And, <hi>therefore may conclude of himself,</hi> I am under great
guiltiness, and worthy of death, by the sentence of the Law.</p>
               <p>Likewayes, in the process of the Conscience, a
humbled person well informed, may reason thus,</p>
               <p>That way of reconciliation which God hath appointed a
self-condemned sinner to follow, I am bound to follow;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> this way (<hi>and no other</hi>) hath God appointed, that
the sinner, convinced of sin and of deserved wrath should flee
to Christ Iesus the Mediator, that by Him he may be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
sanctified and saved:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore,</hi> this way of reconciliation, <hi>and no other,</hi> I am
bound to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> Whosoever, by the grace of God, in the sense of
sin and deserved wrath, is fled unto Christ for righteousness
and eternal life and in Christs strength, is endeavouring to
give new obedience to the will of God, is undoubtedly a true
believer and child of God;</p>
               <p>But, <hi>such a one am I,</hi> may the humbled sinner, fled to
Christ, say of himself:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore,</hi> I am, by the grace of God, undoubtedly a true
believer and a child of God.</p>
               <p>And yet again he may go on, to strengthen his faith,
and to comfort himself in the Lord, thus,</p>
               <p>Whosoever in the sense of sin, poverty and weakness, hath
fled to Christ the Redeemer, resolved never to part with Him,
and hath consecrated himself, in the strength of Christ, to
endeavour to give new obedience to the will of God, he is an
heir with <hi>Isaac</hi> of the promised blessings, and may hope to
have them perfectly in possession at last;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40880:6"/>
But <hi>such an one am I,</hi> may the humbled sinner, fled to
Christ, say of himself:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therfore,</hi> I am an heir of the promised blessings with
<hi>Isaac,</hi> and may hope to have them perfectly in possession at
last.</p>
               <p>Such a process as this doth the Conscience of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat
man follow, when he reneweth the acts of his
repentance, and sentenceth himself worthy of what the
Law pronounceth against his sin; and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth
the acts of his faith in Christ, through whom
alone he is fred from the deserved curse of the Law.</p>
               <p>9. As to the fifth thing to be observed in the court
of Conscience, which is, the execution of the sentence
it hath pronounced; because the Conscience is set over
the man by God, as Judge-depute: therefore it goeth
about, in the name of God, by and by to execute, as it
may, the sentence justly pronounced by it; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature of the sentence, of condemnation or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
pronounced by it, it stirreth up divers motions
and affections in the heart; some of them sad and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,
some of them joyfull and comfortable. The
sad and bitter passions that follow upon the sentence of
conviction and condemnation, justly pronounced, are
shame, grief, fear, anxiety, vexation and such-like;
whereby the guilty sinner is either fretted, as with a
worm, or fired and tormented. Of this we have an
example in our first parent <hi>Adam,</hi> who, being convicted
in his conscience of sin and deserved wrath, did flee
from the face of God, all amazed and a frighted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
9. 10. <hi>The Lord called unto</hi> Adam, <hi>and said unto him where
art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I
was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid my self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Conscience, after it is furnished by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to absolve the penitent believer fled to Christ, doth
stir up more sweet and comfortable motions in the
heart, such as are, peace, comfort, joy, gladness, exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
confidence, and such like. An example whereof
we see in <hi>Paul, 2 Cor, 1. 2. Our rejoycing,</hi> saith he, <hi>is this,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40880:6"/>
the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly
sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God,
we have had our conversation in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Conscience, after it is wounded by the mans
transgression, doth the part of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> citing the man
before its Tribunal; and the part of an <hi>Officer,</hi> presenting
the man at the Bar; and the part of an <hi>Accuser,</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
the man for his transgression; and the part of
the <hi>Recorder,</hi> producing the book of Statutes; and the
part of sufficient witnesses, proving and convincing
him of the deed done.</p>
               <p>Again it doth the part of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> pronouncing sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and condemning the convicted transgressour; and
the part of a <hi>Sergeant</hi> and <hi>Marshal,</hi> binding the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
wretch; and the part of the <hi>Prison</hi> and <hi>Stocks,</hi>
pinching and pressing the bound sinner; and the part
of the <hi>Burrio,</hi> scourging and tormenting him.</p>
               <p>But the Conscience, after examination, finding the
man either innocent and free of the crime, or forgiven
and reconciled to God by Christ, after repentance and
faith, embracing the Redeemer, it doth the part of an
honest <hi>Friend,</hi> carefully comforting the innocent or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent;
and the part of an <hi>Advocat,</hi> excusing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the man against all challenges; and the part
of <hi>Witnesses compurgatours;</hi> and the part of the <hi>Iudge
absolving;</hi> and the part of the <hi>Rewarder.</hi> And so much
concerning the nature and use of Conscience, as may
suffice our purpose.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Cases of Conscience in general.</head>
               <p>A Case of Conscience, taken in a large sense, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
every accident which any way affects
or qualifieth the Conscience, And in this sense,
the perswasion and certainty, which the Conscience
may have, the soundness, health and strength of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40880:7"/>
may be called Cases and good Cases of the
Conscience.</p>
               <p>So also, any effect which the Conscience doth work
on the soul, such as are peace of conscience, comfort and
joy in the heart, may be called Cases of the Conscience
also.</p>
               <p>But the Cases whereof we are to treat, are the ill
Cases of the Conscience, whereby it is fallen from the
soundness and streightness it should have, which we call
by the name of wounds, diseases, and sickness of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
whereunto, that we may descend to speak more
orderly, a twofold difference is to be observed.</p>
               <p>2. First, we must put difference between a healthy
and a sick Conscience. A healthy Conscience is that,
which after examination of our wayes, according to
the rule of Gods Word, doth justly absolve us, and
speaketh peace to us toward God. Of such a conscience
it is said by <hi>Solomon, A sound heart is the life of the flesh,</hi>
Prov. 14. 30. by the <hi>heart</hi> he meaneth the <hi>conscience,</hi>
which ordinarly in Scripture is called the <hi>heart</hi> And
he saith, the sound <hi>conscience</hi> is the life of the flesh; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the body is so much in better case, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be at peace toward God. And this blessing is
allowed upon every believer in Christ, in his orderly
walking, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 7. God hath not given us the spirit of
fear, but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.</hi> A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in this disposition needeth not medicine, but spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
nourishment and exercise in all Christian-duties.</p>
               <p>A sick Conscience we call, that which either is sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of its own evils and dangers it is in, and sitteth down
securely, and resteth without a warrand; Or, which is
justly wounded, and labours under the sense of its pain;
or, which is unquiet upon mistakes and ignorance of
making use of the true remedy: of such a sick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
we are to speak, if possible, by Gods blessing, a
word in season may be spoken, to waken a secure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or to refresh the weary soul, that being recovered
from its malady, it may be able to feed upon the bread
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40880:7"/>
and water of life, and work the works of God in the
strength of Christ.</p>
               <p>3. Secondly, we must put difference between a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Soul and a troubled Conscience; for, the Soul is
more largely taken then the Conscience. The Soul
comprehendeth all the powers and faculties of the man;
but the Conscience, as we speak of it, is only one faculty
of the mind, judging of the mans moral ill or well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and so all cases of the <hi>Conscience</hi> are cases of the
<hi>Soul:</hi> but, all the cases of the <hi>Soul</hi> are not cases of the
<hi>Conscience.</hi> For, the Soul may be troubled while the
Conscience is not troubled at all; yea, a man may have
a commendable trouble in his soul, when he seeth God
dishonoured or His Church in hazard, whereby his
conscience is so far from being troubled, that such a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trouble strengthens his conscience in his address to
God, as is in many places of the <hi>Psalms</hi> to be seen.</p>
               <p>Again, a mans mind may be troubled by sundry na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or civil motives; while the conscience is allowab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quiet, as in losses of things temporal, fears, pains or
unexpected inconveniencies occurring; yea, there may
be passions and perturbations of the mind in persons
that are not capable for the time of the exercise of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as may be seen in young infants, and in the elder
sort, in fits of feaver, melancholy and phrensie: and yet
further, it is possible that passions, perturbations and
troubles of soul, may be found without any disease of
the Conscience; because our Lord Jesus, in the dayes
of his humiliation, was a man acquainted with sorrows,
but was not obnoxious to sin or any self-challenging;
for, he knew no sin in himself. He had trouble in his
soul, but could not have trouble of conscience, <hi>Iob:</hi>
12. 27. <hi>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
save me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto
this hour.</hi> Of the cases of the <hi>Soul</hi> we speak not here,
but of the sinfull diseases of the <hi>Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. There is also a third difference to be observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
common cases of Conscience, and these that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40880:8"/>
concern Regeneration. Common cases com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
all these questions and doubts, wherein the
Conscience is seeking light and resolution about the
rule of faith and maners, that it may better inform it
self about the sense of Scripture, and about the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof in the point of direction in faith and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
These common cases are of as large extent, as
the bulk of Divinity, as large as the Doctrine held forth
in Scripture concerning faith and maners: for, there
is not any one article of faith or duty prescribed, as a
point of piety or righteousness, about which questions
may not be moved and cases propounded, wherein
the Conscience may seek satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Of this hudge great tree, we take but only one branch
to speak of, so far as maketh for our purpose concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Regeneration.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Regeneration, what it is; and the regenerat
man, who he is.</head>
               <p>WE speak not here of the regeneration of elect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
dying in their infancy, God hath His
own way of dealing with them; but of the
regeneration of those who are capable of being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
called by the ministry of the Word which we
may thus describe,</p>
               <p>Regeneration (<hi>being one in effect with effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>)
is the work of Gods invincible power and meer grace,
wherein, by His Spirit, accompanying His Word, He quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a redeemed person lying dead in his sins, and reneweth
him in his mind, will and all the powers of his soul; convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him savingly of sin, righteousness and judgment, and
making him heartily to embrace Christ and Salvation, and
to consecrat himself to the service of God in Christ, all the
dayes of his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40880:8"/>
2. The main thing we must take heed to in this
work, is to give to God intirely the glory of His <hi>Grace</hi>
and <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> so that the glory of mans rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
be neither given to man, nor man made sharer
of the glory with God, but God may have the whole
glory of His <hi>free grace,</hi> because out of His own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
not for any thing at all foreseen in man, He lets
forth his speciall love on the redeemed in a time accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
And the glory of His <hi>Almighty power,</hi> because by
His omnipotent and invincible working He makes the
man dead in sins to live, opens his eyes to take up sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
the things of God, takes away the heart of stone,
and makes him a new creature, to will and to do His
holy will; And the glory of His <hi>Wisdom,</hi> who dealeth
so with His creature as He doth not destroy, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the naturall power of the mans will, making the
man regenerat, most freely, deliberatly and heartily to
embrace Christ, and to consecrat himself to Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
The reason why we urge this, is, because <hi>Satan,</hi>
by corrupting the doctrine of regeneration, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
men that they are able of themselves by the
common and the naturall strength of their own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
without the speciall and effectuall grace of God,
both to convert themselves and others also, doth foster
the native pride of men, hindreth them from emptying
and humbling themselves before God, keepeth them
from self-denyall, doth mar the regeneration of them
that are deluded with this errour, and obscureth what
he can, the shyning of the glory of Gods grace, power
and wisdom in the conversion of men: for, whatsoever
praise, proud men let go toward God for making mens
conversion <hi>possible,</hi> yet they give the whole glory of
<hi>actuall</hi> conversion to the man himself, which Christ
ascribeth to God only, and leaveth no more for man to
glory in his spirituall regeneration, then he hath to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in his own naturall generation, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. 6. 7. 8.
And the same doth the Apostle teach, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8. 9. 10.
and, <hi>Philip.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 13. <hi>It is God</hi> (saith hee) <hi>which worketh
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40880:9"/>
in you both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.</hi> And
therefore it is the duty of all Christs disciples, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their duty who are consecrat to God, to preach up
the glory of Gods free grace, omnipotent power and
unsearchable wisdom, to live in the sense of their own
emptinesse, and to depend upon the furnitour of grace
for grace, out of Christs fulnesse; and zealously to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the proud errour of mans naturall ability for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
himself, as they love to see, and find the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
blessing of the Ministery of the Gospel, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
accepted for true disciples at the day of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Christ the Judge at His second coming.</p>
               <p>3. For opening up of regeneration, these five propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
must be hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en. The first is this, the naturall
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of god; for,
they are foolishnesse unto him; neither can he know
them, because they are spiritually discerned, 1 Cor. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>The second is this, it is the Spirit of God which
convinceth man of sin, of true righteousnesse and of
judgement, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 9. 10. 11.</p>
               <p>The third is this, in regeneration, conversion and
quickning of a sinner, God, by his invincible power,
createth and infuseth a new life and principles thereof,
<hi>Psal. 110. 3. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy
power,</hi> and, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 21. and 6. 63.</p>
               <p>The fourth is this, the invincible grace of God,
working regeneration and a mans conversion, doth not
destroy the freedom of mans will, but makes it truely
free, and perfects it. <hi>Ier. 31. 31. I will make a Covenant
with the house of Israel and with the house of Iudah, and
will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their
hearts, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth is this, albeit a man, in the act of Gods
quickning and converting of him be passive, and in a
spirituall sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e dead in sins and trespasses, yet, for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
externall means, whereof God maketh use unto
his conversion, for fitting him and preparing of him for
a gracious change (such as are, hearing of the Word,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40880:9"/>
reading of it meditating on it, inquiring after the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, &amp;c.) the naturall man hath a naturall
power thereunto as to other externall actions, which
sufficeth to take away excuse from them who have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of using the means and will not use them, <hi>Matth.</hi>
23. 37.</p>
               <p>For clearing of the first proposition, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that the object of actuall regeneration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and effectuall calling, is the man elected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
by Christ, lying in the state of defection from
God destitute of originall righteousnesse, at enimity
with God, bently inclined to all evill, altogether unfit
and impotent, yea even spiritually dead to every spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
good, and specially to convert, regenerat or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: for albeit after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> there are
some sparks of common reason remaining, whereby he
may confusedly know that which is called spirituall
good, acceptable and pleasant unto God and fit to save
his soul; yet the <hi>understanding</hi> of the unrenewed man
judgeth of that good, and of the truth of the Evangell
wherein that good is proponed, to be meer <hi>foolishnesse,</hi>
and doth represent the spirituall object, and sets it before
the <hi>will,</hi> as a thing uncertain or vain; and the <hi>will</hi> of the
unrenewed man, after deliberation &amp; comparison made
of objects, some honest, some pleasant and some profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in appearance, naturally is inclined to prefer and
choose any seeming pleasant or profitable thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the object be naturall or civill, rather then that
which is truly honest and morally good. But if it fall
out that a spirituall good be well and in fair colours,
described unto the unrenewed man, yet he seeth it not,
but under the notion of a naturall good, and as it is
cloathed with the image of some naturall good, and
profitable for preserving its standing in a naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and welfare therein. So did the false prophet <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
look upon the felicity of the righteous in their
death, when he did separat eternall life from faith and
sanctification, and did rent asunder the means from the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40880:10"/>
end appointed of God, saying, <hi>Let me dye the death of
the righteous, and let my last end be like his,</hi> Numb. 23. 10.</p>
               <p>After this maner the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the gift and grace of the holy Ghost, and saving
grace offered to her by Christ, <hi>Lord</hi> (saith she) <hi>Give
me of that water, that I may not thirst again, and may not
come again to draw water,</hi> Joh. 4. 15. So also did the
misbeleeving Jews judge of the application of Christs
incarnation and suffering for their spirituall feeding,
Joh. 6. 33. 34. 35. for, <hi>The naturall man cannot know the
things of the Spirit of God, because they are spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi>
and the naturall man is destitute of the spirit of
illumination. 1 Cor. 2. 14. And the wisdom of the
flesh is enimity to God: for it is not subject to the law
of God, yea, it cannot be subject unto it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7.
The power therefore of the naturall or unrenewed man
is not fitted for the discerning, and loving of a spirituall
good, because he is altogether naturall and not spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
For, a supernaturall object, requireth a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
power of the understanding and will, to take it
up, and rightly conceive of it: But of this supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
faculty, the unrenewed man is destitute, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of spirituall discerning, he is dead, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern spirituall things spiritually.</p>
               <p>4. As for the second proposition anent a mans rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
the Lord, that He may break the carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of the person whom He is to convert, first,
sheweth him his duty by the doctrine of the law and
covenant of works, making him to see the same by the
powerfull illumination of the holy Spirit, and so taketh
away all pretext of ignorance. Secondly, He sheweth
him his guiltinesse and deserved damnation wherein he
is involved, and so taken away all conceit and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his innocency, Thirdly, He doth convince
him of his utter inability to satisfie the law, or to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himself from the curse thereof, either by way of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and obedience, or by way of suffering and paying of
the penalty of the violat law of God: And so overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40880:10"/>
all confidence in himself, or in his own works.
Whence followeth the elect mans desperation to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by himself, because he seeth himself a sinner, and
that all hope of justification by his own deeds or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
is cut off. Now, that this is the work of the holy
Spirit, is plain, <hi>Ioh. 16. 8. When the comforter, the spirit
of truth, shall come, He shall convince the world of sin, &amp;c.</hi>
And in this condition sundry of Gods dear children, for
a time are keeped under the bonds of the law, under the
spirit of bondage and sad conviction.</p>
               <p>5. As for the third proposition, the Lord after He
hath laid the sin of His elect child, who is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
to his charge by the doctrine of the law, first,
openeth up a light unto him in the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and lets him see, that his absolution from sin and his
salvation is possible, and may be had, by flying unto
Christ the Redeemer. Secondly, the Lord drawing
near hand the humbled self-condemned soul, deals with
him by way of morall swasion, sweetly inviting him in
the preaching of the Gospel, to receive the Redeemer
Christ Jesus, the eternall Son of God manifested in the
flesh, that by receiving of Him as He is offered in the
Evangel, for remission of sin, renovation of life, and
eternall salvation, he may close the Covenant of grace
and reconciliation with God. Thirdly, because the
fall of <hi>Adam</hi> hath bereft man of all spirituall and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
power, till he be supernaturally quickned and
converted by the omnipotent power of Gods grace:
Therefore the Lord s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>peraddeth unto morall swasion,
effectuall operation, and formeth in the soul a spirituall
faculty and ability for doing what is pleasant unto God,
and tendeth to save himself according to the will of
God. This infusion of a new life, sometime is called
the forming of the new <hi>creature,</hi> sometime <hi>regeneration,</hi>
sometime <hi>rising</hi> from the dead and <hi>vivification,</hi> or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the man, sometime <hi>saving</hi> grace and the <hi>life</hi> of
God, and the <hi>seed</hi> of God, having in it the principle of
all saving graces and habits, which are brought forth
afterward to acts and exercise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40880:11"/>
Mean time, true it is, that all men, because of their
inborn corruption, have an inclination and bent dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to resist the holy Ghost; But when the Lord will
actually convert the man, He overcometh and taketh
away actuall resistance, and doth so break the power
of naturall rebellion that it doth not for ever after <hi>reign</hi>
in him: for, if God did not take away actuall resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the man in his conversion, no conversion
should certainly follow, and God should be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of His purpose to convert the man, even when
He hath put forth His almighty power to work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
But God doth so wisely and powerfully stir up
this new infused life of grace, and setteth it so on work,
that the <hi>understanding</hi> and judgement like a counsellour,
and the <hi>Will</hi> like a commanding Emperour, and the
<hi>active</hi> power of the new infused faculty as an officer, do
all bestir themselves to bring forth supernaturall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Whence it cometh to passe, that the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
beginneth to look kindly on Christ the Redeemer,
and to desire to be united unto Him, and doth streatch
forth it self to embrace Him heartily, for obtaining in
Him righteousnesse and salvation, as He is offered in
the Gospel: And so he casts himself over on Christ
with full purpose never to shed from Him but by faith
to draw out of Him grace for grace, till he be perfected.
And here the man that was meerly passive, in his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and regeneration, beginneth presently to be active
in his conversion, and following conversation: for,
God giveth to him to will and to do of His good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
And he having obtained by Gods effectuall
operation to will and to do, doth formally will and do
the good which is done.</p>
               <p>6. As to the fourth proposition, when the power of
God is put forth, invincibly for the converting of a soul,
that invincible working is so far from destroying the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
liberty of the will, that it doth indeed preserve it,
and sets it right on the right object, and doth perfect it:
For, as when God openeth the eyes of a mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40880:11"/>
that he doth behold the wonders of His law,
when hee removeth the naturall blindnesse of the mind,
and maketh a man see that the Gospel is the wisdom
and power of God unto salvation; which sometime he
counted to bee meer foolishnesse, he doth no wayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the mans judgement, or understanding, but doth
correct, help, heal, and perfect it; So when the holy
Spirit doth powerfully and effectually move and turn
the <hi>Will</hi> of the man to embrace the sweet and saving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of Christs grace in the Gospel, and maketh him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatly
choose this blessed way of salvation, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all confidence in his own, or any others worth
or works, He doth not destroy, but perfect the liberty
of the <hi>Will,</hi> and raiseth it up from death and its dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
inclination, and maketh it most joyfully and
most freely to make choice of this pearl of price, and
blesse it self in its choice for ever. Therefore, let no
man complain of wrong done to mans free-will, when
God stops its way to hell, wisely, powerfully, gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sweetly moveth it to choose the way of life; But
rather let men beware to take the glory of actuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of men, from God, and either give it wholly to
their idoll of <hi>free-will,</hi> or make it sharer of the glory of
regeneration with God, which glory God will not give
to another, but reserve wholly to Himself: for, all men,
in the point and moment of regeneration, are like unto
<hi>Lazarus</hi> in the grave, to whom God, by commanding
him to arise, gave life and power to arise out of the
grave where he lay dead and rotting.</p>
               <p>7. As to the fifth proposition, We must distinguish
the work of regeneration from the preparation and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the man to be regenerat, whereby he is made
more capable of regeneration to be wrought in him:
for, the materiall disposition of him, fitting him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
is neither a part nor a degree of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for, albeit the Lord be not bound to these prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
dispositions, yet He will have man bound to make
use of these externall means which may prepare him;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40880:12"/>
because, by the use of externall means (such as are, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the word, Catechising and conference, &amp;c.) a
man may be brought more near unto regeneration, as
Christ doth teach us by His speech to that Pharisee, who
was instructed in the law and answered discreedy unto
Christ; <hi>Thou art not far</hi> (saith He) <hi>from the kingdom of
God,</hi> Mark. 12. 24. This preparatory disposition, in
order unto regeneration, is like unto the drying of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to make it sooner take fire, when it is casten into it.
For, dryness in the timber, is neither a part nor a degree
of kindling or inflammation of it; But only a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the timber to receive inflammation when the
fire shall be set to it, or it put in the fire, possibly, a long
time after. In these preparatory exercises then, no man
will deny, that the naturall man unrenewed, hath a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
power to go and hear a Sermon preached, to read
the Scripture, to be informed by Catechising, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Religion and regeneration, whereof God
when He pleaseth may make use in regeneration of the
man. Wherefore, whosoever in the preaching of the
Gospel, are charged and commanded to repent, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ, or turn unto God, they are commanded
also to use all these externall means whereby they may
be informed of the duty required, and of the means lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereunto; in the exercise of which externall
means, they may meet with sundry common operations
and effects of Gods Spirit, before they be regenerat or
converted, whereof the use may be sound not only in,
but also after, conversion; And if any man shall refuse,
slight or neglect to follow these preparatory exercises,
which may prepare him for conversion, he is inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
before God and man, and guilty of rejecting of
the offer of reconciliation, yea guilty of resisting of the
holy Ghost, of which sin and guiltynesse the holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
<hi>Stephen</hi> chargeth the misbelieving Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51.</p>
               <p>8. As for the regenerat man, he it is who in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of his sinfulnesse and deserved misery,
and of his utter inability to help himself, doth cast away
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40880:12"/>
all confidence in his own parts, and possible righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his own works, and fleeth to Christ offered in
the Gospel, that in Christ alone he may have true wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
righteousnesse, sanctification, and redemption;
and doth with full purpose of heart consecrat himself,
and endeavour, in the strength of Christ, to serve God
acceptably all the dayes of his life.</p>
               <p>For the ground of this description, we have the
words of the Apostle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 3. Where putting a
difference between the true people of God, and the
counterfit, he saith. <hi>We are the circumcision who worship
God in the spirit, and rejoyce in Iesus Christ, and have no
confidence in the flesh.</hi> In which description of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat
man, the Apostle first points forth unto us three
speciall operations of the Spirit of regeneration, then
three duties of the man regenerat.</p>
               <p>The first operation of the Spirit of God, the only cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciser
of the heart, is the humbling of the man in
the sense of his sin by the doctrine of the law, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off all his confidence in his own worth, wit, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
and strength to help himself. So that the man hath
no confidence in the flesh.</p>
               <p>The second operation, is the infusion of saving faith,
making the man humbled to close with Christ in the
Covenant of reconciliation, and to rest upon Him as the
only and sufficient remedy of sin and misery, so that
Christ becometh to him the ground of rejoycing and
gloriation.</p>
               <p>The third operation, is the upstirring and enabling of
the believer in Christ, to endeavour new obedience, and
to worship God in the spirit.</p>
               <p>As for the three duties of the man regenerat. The
first is, to follow the leading of the Spirit in the poynt of
more and more humbling of himself before God in the
sense of his own insufficiency, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shewing of all lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his own parts, gifts, works, or sufferings, or any
thing else beside Christ; <hi>He must have no confidence in the
flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40880:13"/>
The second duty, is to grow in the estimation of
Christs righteousnesse and fulnesse of all graces to be let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
forth to the believer imploying Him by faith, and
comforting himself in Christ against all difficulties,
troubles and temptations; <hi>He must rejoyce in Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third duty, is to endeavour communion-keeping
with God in the course of new obedience in all cases,
worshiping and serving God in sincerity of heart; he
must be a worshiper of God.</p>
               <p>As to the last thing holden forth in the Apostles
words, which is the undoubted mark and evidence of
the man regenerat and circumcised in heart, it standeth
in the constant endeavour to grow in these three duties
joyntly, so as each of them may advance another: for,
many failings and short-comings will be found in our
new obedience and worshiping of God in the spirit;
but, let these failings be made use of to extinguish and
abolish all confidence in our own parts and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that our dayly failings may humble us and cut us
off from all confidence in the flesh.</p>
               <p>But let not these failings so discourage us, as to hinder
us to put confidence in Christ; but by the contrair, the
lesse ground of confidence we find in our selves, let us
raise so much higher the estimation of remission of sin
and imputation of Christs righteousnesse, and stir up
our selves by faith to draw more strength and ability
out of Christ for enabling us to walk more holily and
righteously before God; and having fled to Christ and
comforted our selves in him, let us not turn his grace into
wantonnesse; but the more we believe the grace of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, let us strive, in his strength, so much the more
to glorifie God in new obedience: And in the circle of
these three duties, let us wind our selves up stairs toward
heaven: for, God hath promised, that such <hi>as wait on the
Lord, shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with
wings as Eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall
walk and not faint,</hi> Isaiah 40. 31.</p>
               <p>In the conjunction of these three duties, the evidence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40880:13"/>
of regeneration is found. If there be not a sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after all these three duties, the evidence of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is by so much darkned, and short for probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for, it is not sufficient to prove a man regenerat,
that he is driven from all confidence in his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and filled with the sense of sin and deserved
wrath, because a man that hath no more then that, may
perish in this miserable condition, as we see in <hi>Iudas</hi>
the traitour, whose conscience was burdened with the
sense of sin, but did not seek mercy and pardon. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it sufficient to boast of acquaintance with Christ,
and professe great respect to him, because many do cry,
Lord, Lord, who neither renounce their confidence in
their own righteousnesse, nor worship God in spirit;
for, of such Christ saith, <hi>Matth. 7. 21. Not every one
that saith to Him, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
God.</hi> Neither is it sufficient to pretend the worshiping
of God in spirit: for, all they who think to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their own works, do esteem their manner of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of God, true and spirituall service and worship, as
may be seen in the proud Pharisee glorying before God
in his own righteousnesse, and acknowledging that
God was the giver unto him of the holinesse and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
which he had, <hi>Luke, 18. 11. I thank Thee, O
God,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I am not like other men, extortioners,
unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican:</hi> for, of this
man Christ saith, he returned to his house unjustified,
that is, a man lying still in sin unreconciled.</p>
               <p>Neither is it sufficient to prove a man regenerat, to
confess sin and by-gone unrighteousnesse, and to promise
and begin to amend his wayes and future conversation;
for, so much may a Pharisee attain. And there are
many that professe themselves Christians, who think to
be justified by the merits of their own and other saints
doings and sufferings, and do disdainfully scoff and
mock at the doctrine of the imputed righteousnesse of
Christ; how many are they also, who think their by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
sins may be washen away, and be recompenced by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40880:14"/>
their purpose to amend their life in time to come? How
many are they, who, being willingly ignorant of the
righteousnesse of God, which is of faith in Jesus Christ,
go about to establish their own righteousnesse as the
Jews did? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
               <p>And how few are they who follow the example of
the Apostle, who carefully served God in spirit and
truth, but did not lean to his own righteousnesse, but
sought more and more to be found in Christ, not having
his own righteousnesse, which behoved to be made up
of his imperfect obedience of the law, but that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
which is by faith in Jesus Christ? <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
               <p>But that man, who daily in the sense of his sinfulness
and poverty sleeth unto Jesus Christ, that he may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by His righteousnesse, and endeavoureth by faith
in Him to bring forth the fruits of new obedience, and
doth not put confidence in these his works when he hath
done them, but rejoyceth in Jesus Christ the fountain
of holinesse and blessednesse; That man (I say) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
is regenerat, and a new creature, for so doth
the Apostle describe him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 3.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of divine Covenants about the eternall salvation of men; and
in speciall, of the Covenant of redemption, shewing that
there is such a Covenant, and what are the articles thereof.</head>
               <p>BEcause the healing of the sicknesse of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
cometh by a right application of divine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
about our salvation: therefore it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
that some measure, of the knowledge thereof be
opened up.</p>
               <p>1. A divine covenant we call, a contract or paction,
wherein God is at least the one party contracter. Of
this sort of covenants about the eternall salvation of
men (which sort chieflly belong to our purpose) there
are three. The first is, the covenant of redemption, past
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40880:14"/>
between God, and Christ God appointed Mediatour,
before the world was, in the council of the Trinity.
The second is, the covenant of works, made between
God and men, in Adam in his integrity, indued with
all naturall perfections, enabling him to keep it, so long
as it pleased him to stand to the condition. The third
is, the covenant of grace and reconciliation through
Christ, made between God and believers (with their
children) in Christ.</p>
               <p>2. As to the covenant of redemption; for clearing the
mater, we must distinguish the sundry acceptions of the
word <hi>redemption:</hi> for, 1. Sometime it is taken for the
contract and agreement of selling and buying-back to
eternall salvation, of lost man, looked upon as in the
state of sin and misery. In which sense, we are said to
be bought by Christ, both souls and bodies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.
19. 20. <hi>Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price:
therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your spirit, which
are Gods.</hi> And this may be called <hi>redemption by paction</hi>
and agreed bargain. 2. Sometime <hi>redemption</hi> is taken
for the paying of the price agreed upon. In which
sense, Christ is said to have redeemed us, by suffering of
the punishment due to us, and ransoming of us. <hi>Gal. 3.
13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,</hi>
being made a curse for us. 3. Sometime <hi>redemption</hi> is
taken for the begun application of the benefits purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the covenant by the price payed, <hi>Ephes. 1. 7. In
whom we have redemption through His blood, even the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sins, according to the riches of His grace.</hi> 4. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<hi>redemption</hi> is taken for the perfect and full possession
of all the benefits agreed upon between the Father and
Christ His Son the Mediatour. In which sense, we are
said to be <hi>sealed with the holy Spirit of promise, which is the
earnest of our inheritance, untill the redemption of the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
possession,</hi> Ephes. 1. 14. and Ephes. 4. 30. it is said,
<hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
the day of redemption;</hi> which is the day of Judgement,
when Christ shall put us in full possession of all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40880:15"/>
which He purchased by bargain and payment
for us.</p>
               <p>In this place we take redemption in the first sense, for
the covenant past between the Father and Christ His
Son, designed Mediatour, about our redemption.</p>
               <p>3. When we name the Father as the one party and
His Son Christ as the other party in this covenant, we
do not seclude the Son and holy Spirit from being the
party offended; but do look upon the Father, Son and
Spirit, one God in three Persons, as offended by mans
sin; and yet all three contented to take satisfaction to
divine justice for mans sin in the Person of the Son, as
designed Mediatour, to be incarnat. Whereby the Son
is both the party offended as God, one essentially with
the Father and holy Spirit; and the party contracter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
as God designed Mediatour personally for redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man, who with consent of the Father and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
from all eternity willed and purposed in the fulnesse
of time, to assume the humane nature in personall union
with Himself, and for the elects sake to become man,
and to take the cause of the elect in hand, to bring them
back to the friendship of God, and full enjoyment of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
for evermore.</p>
               <p>When therefore we make the Father the one party,
and the Son designed mediatour the other party, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Scripture, for the more easie uptaking of
the Covenant, let us look to one God in three Persons,
having absolute right and soveraign power according
to His own pleasure to dispose of men, looked upon as
lying before God (to Whom all things are present) in
sin and death, drawn on by ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s own deserving, and
yet for the glory of His grace resolving to save the elect,
so as His justice shall be satisfied for them, in and by
the second Person of the Trinity, the co-eternall and co-essentiall
Son of the Father.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>This covenant of redemption then may be thus
described.</hi> It is a bargain, agreed upon between the Father
and the Son designed Mediatour, concerning the elect (lying
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40880:15"/>
with the rest of manking in the state of sin and death, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by their own merit) wisely and powerfully to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
sanctified and saved, for the Son of Gods satisfaction and
obedience (in our nature to be assumed by Him) to be given
in due time to the Father, even unto the death of the crosse.</p>
               <p>In this bargain or agreement, the Scripture importeth
clearly, a selling and a buying of the elect, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28.
<hi>Feed the Church of God, which He hath purchased by His
own blood, 1 Cor. 6. 20. ye are bought with a price,</hi> and
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. The seller of the elect, is God; the buyer,
is <hi>God incarnat;</hi> the <hi>persons</hi> bought, are the Church of
the elect; the <hi>price,</hi> is the blood of God, to wit, the
blood of Christ, who is God and man in one person.</p>
               <p>This covenant of <hi>redemption,</hi> is in effect one with the
eternall decree of redemption, wherein the salvation of
the elect, and the way how it shall be brought about is
fixed, in the purpose of God, who worketh all things
according to the counsell of His own Will, as the
Apostle sets it down, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. unto the 15 verse.</p>
               <p>And the decree of redemption is in effect a covenant,
one God in three persons agreeing in the decree, that the
second Person, God the Son, should be incarnat, and
give obedience and satisfaction to divine justice for the
elect: unto which piece of service the Son willingly
submitting Himself, the decree becometh a reall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
indeed.</p>
               <p>But for further satisfaction, that there is such a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
between the Father and the Son, as we have said,
for redeeming of the elect, Scripture giveth us evidence
six wayes.</p>
               <p>The first way is by expressions, which import &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
a formall covenant between the parties, buying
and selling; the second way is, by styles and titles gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Christ the Redeemer; the third is, by expressions
relating to an eternall decree for execution and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the covenant of redemption; the fourth is, by
representation of this covenant in the Leviticall types;
the fifth is, by Christ the Redeemer now incarnat, His
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40880:16"/>
ratification of the covenant; and the sixth way is, by
holding forth to us the heads and articles agreed
upon, wherein the covenant consists.</p>
               <div n="1" type="proof">
                  <head>The first poof.</head>
                  <p>AS to the expressions, importing a formall covenant,
first, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 7. it is called a <hi>redemption,</hi> or a buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the elect out of sin and misery by blood, shewing
that no remission of sin could be granted by Justice,
without sheding of <hi>blood,</hi> and Christ undertook to pay
the price, and hath payed it.</p>
                  <p>Again, the <hi>inheritance</hi> which the elect have promised
unto them, is called a <hi>purchase,</hi> importing, that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poner
of the inheritance to the elect, must have a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
price for it, and that the Redeemer hath accepted
the condition and laid down the price craved for it,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 14. and so bought back lost heaven and
forfeited blessednesse to so many sinners, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
for sin, might justly have been excluded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
therefrom for ever.</p>
                  <p>A third expression is holden forth, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God <hi>disponer</hi> and God <hi>Redeemer,</hi> are agreed, that the
elect shal go free for God the Redeemer's obedience unto
the death, who hath now bought them with His blood.</p>
                  <p>A fourth expression is in plain terms set down by
<hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 6. 20. Ye are bought with a price:</hi> God the
disponer selleth, and God the Redeemer buyeth the elect
to be His conquest, both body and spirit. And <hi>Peter</hi>
more particularly expresseth the price of redemption
agreed upon, to be not gold or silver, but the blood of
the Mediatour Christ, the innocent Lamb of God, slain
in typicall prefigurations from the beginning of the
World, and slain in reall performance in the fulnesse of
time, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. 19. 20. 21.</p>
                  <p>A fifth expression is, that of our Lord Jesus in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Sacrament of His Supper, Matth. 26.
28. <hi>This is my blood of the new Testament, which is shed for
many, for remission of sins.</hi> Here an agreement between
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40880:16"/>
the Redeemer and God disponer, that these <hi>many</hi> which
are the elect, shall have remission of sins for the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
ransom of blood payed for them. The purchase
of this ransom of blood, He maketh over in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace and reconciliation to believers in Him, and
sealeth the bargain with them by the Sacrament of His
Supper.</p>

               <div n="2" type="proof">
                  <head>The second proof.</head>
                  <p>THe second evidence of this Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
past between God and God the Son Mediatour
designed, is from such titles and styles as are given to
Christ in relation to the procureing of a Covenant of
grace and reconciliation between God and us. First,
He is called a <hi>Mediatour</hi> of the Covenant of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
interceeding for procureing of it, and that not by a
simple intreaty, but by giving Himself over to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(calling for satisfaction to Justice, that reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might go on) for paying a compensatory price,
sufficient to satisfie Justice for the elect, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. 6.
There is <hi>one God</hi> and <hi>one Mediatour between God and man</hi>
(to wit, God incarnat) <hi>the man Christ Iesus who gave
Himself a ransom for all</hi> (to wit, elect children) <hi>to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
in due time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another title is given to Him by Job, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. 24.
Where He is called a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> a near kinsman, who
before His incarnation had oblieged Himself to take on
humane nature, and to pay the price of Redemption
(represented by slain sacrifices) for the elect His kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>A third title is held out, in that He is called a <hi>Surety</hi> of
a better Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. Whereby is imported,
that God would not passe a Covenant of grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
to men, except He had a good <hi>Surety</hi> who
would answer for the debt of the party reconciled, and
would undertake to make the <hi>reconciled</hi> stand to his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
And Christ undertook the Suretyship, and so
hath procured and established this Covenant of grace,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40880:17"/>
much better then the Covenant of works, and better
then the old Covenant of grace with <hi>Israel,</hi> as they made
use of it. This necessarily imports a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Him and the Fathers Justice, to whom He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
surety for us: for, what is <hi>suretiship,</hi> but a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
transferring of anothers debt upon the Surety,
oblieging to pay the debt for which he ingageth as
Surety?</p>
                  <p>A fourth title given to Christ, is, that He is a <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi>
by way of permutation; the <hi>atonement, Rom. 5. 11.
We have by Christ received the atonement,</hi> that is, that
which hath pacified the Fathers Justice and reconciled
Him to us, is made over in a gift unto us; for, by
Christ, procurement we have God made ours, &amp; Christ
pacifying God, put, as it were, in our bosome: for, God
having sold us to Christ, by taking Christs satisfaction
for ours, He hath come over to us as reconciled, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us Christ the Reconciler and the atonement, to be
ours. Here is an agreement made between God and
Christ, and the condition of the agreement between the
parties for our behoof, clearly imported and presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
                  <p>The fifth title given to Christ, is this, He is called the
<hi>propitiation, 1 Ioh.</hi> 2. 2. Whereby God is pacified, not
only for the believing <hi>Iews,</hi> but also for the whole elect
World, which should believe in Him. And if He be
the <hi>pacifying propitiation,</hi> then God hath satisfaction in
all that His Justice craved from Christ for the elect; and,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. He is called a <hi>propitiatory sacrifice,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God is so well pleased, that He makes offer of Him
to us, and sets Him forth to us for pacifying our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
through faith in His blood, to declare His righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
for remission of sins, without breach of Justice;
wherein, what price God required and was payed by
Christ, is insinuat and presupposed; for, satisfaction
could not be, except the price agreed upon, had been
promised and accepted before in Covenanting.</p>

                  <head>The third proof.</head>
                  <p>THe third evidence, proving that there was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Redemption past before the beginning of the
World, is, because the eternall decree of God was fixed
about the way of Redemption to be fulfilled in time:
for, <hi>Known unto God were all His works from the beginning,
Acts</hi> 15. 18. And whatsoever God doth in time, He
doth it according to the eternall counsell of His own
Will, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 9. Now, Christ the eternall Son of
God, being made man, laid down His life for His sheep.
<hi>The Son of man goeth, as it was determined, but wo unto that
man by whom He is betrayed, Luke,</hi> 22. 22. And whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Christ suffered, was by the determined counsell of
God, <hi>Acts,</hi> 2. 23. And God the Son, before He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnat,
declares the decree of the Kingdom promised
unto Him by the Father, and of the victories which
He should have over all His enemies, and of the felicity
and multitude of the subjects of His Kingdom, that
should believe in Him, <hi>Psal. 2. 7. I will declare the decree,</hi>
saith He; presupposing therefore the decree of God, of
sending His eternall Son into the World, to become a
man and to suffer, and thereafter to reign for ever, we
must also necessarily presuppose the consent of the Son,
making paction with the Father and the Spirit, fixing
the decree and agreement about the whole way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
to be brought about in time: for, the same
Person, Christ Jesus, who dwelt among men in the
dayes of His humiliation, <hi>Ioh. 1. 14. Was with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
from eternity: and as <hi>by Him all things were made,
which were made, Ioh.</hi> 1. 2. 3. So without Him nothing
was decreed which was decreed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22. to 32.
which also is manifest in the Apostles words, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.
<hi>He saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according
to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace,
which was given us in Christ Iesus before the World began.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, as before the beginning of the World, the elect
were given to the Son designed Mediatour to be incarnat,
and the price agreed upon; so also grace to be given in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40880:18"/>
time to the redeemed by compact, was given from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
unto Christ, their designed Advocat. Also, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
1. 3. 4. 5. we were elected in Christ, unto holinesse and
salvation and unto all spirituall blessings, and were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinat
to the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ. And
1 <hi>Pet. 1. 18. 19. 20. we are redeemed, not with gold or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but by the precious blood of Christ, who was predestinat
before the beginning of the world.</hi> Whereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that the Covenant between the Father and the Son,
was transacted concerning the incarnation of the Son,
and His sufferings, death and resurrection, and all other
things belonging to the salvation of the elect.</p>

                  <head>The fourth proof.</head>
                  <p>THe fourth evidence of the passing a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Father and the Son, is holden forth in the
typicall priesthood of <hi>Levi,</hi> by the altar and sacrifices,
and the rest of the leviticall ceremonies which were
prescribed by God: for, as these things were testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
preachings, declarations and evidences of a
Covenant, past of old between God the disponer, and
the Son the Redeemer, about the way of justifying and
saving such as believed in the Messiah by an expiatory
sacrifice, to be offered in the fulnesse of time, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed;
So also they were prefigurations, predictions,
prophesies and pledges of the Redeemers paying of the
promised price of Redemption. And this agreed-upon-price
(because of the perfections of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracters,
the Father and the Son) was holden and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as good as payed from the beginning of the World;
and the agreed-upon-benefits purchased thereby to wit,
grace and glory, were effectually bestowed on the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
before Christs incarnation, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> testifies,
<hi>Psal. 84. 11. The Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>is a sun and a shield, the
Lord will give grace and glory, and no good thing will He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
from them that walk uprightly;</hi> and, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 24.
<hi>Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsell, and afterward receive
me into glory;</hi> and that because the promised price of
Redemption was of no lesse worth, to give righteousnesse
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40880:18"/>
and life eternall to believers in the Messiah to come, then
the price now payed is now of worth to give for it,
righteousnesse and life eternall to these that believe in the
Messiah now come, Jesus Christ incarnat. And this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of saving graces, as remission of sin, and carying
on to life eternall, was sealed unto believers in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of reconciliation, by the appointed Sacraments of
circumcision and the paschal lamb.</p>

                  <head>The fifth proof.</head>
                  <p>THe fifth evidence of a Covenant past between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son Mediatour to be incarnat, is this,
Christ now incarnat, doth ratifie all these things which
the Father and Himself not yet incarnat, and the holy
Spirit had spoken in the old Testament about the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the elect, and the price of their redemption, and of
the conditions to be performed on either hand; And, as
it were of new, doth repeat and renew the covenant
which before was past between the Father and Himself
before He was incarnat: for, <hi>Luke,</hi> 2. 49. speaking to
<hi>Ioseph</hi> and His mother when He was about twelve years
old, He saith, <hi>Wist ye not, that I must be about My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
businesse?</hi> and, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 13. He presents Himself
pledge and surety for sinners before the Father, to be
baptized for them with the baptism of affliction, and to
fulfill all righteousnesse, as was agreed upon before, <hi>vers.</hi>
15. whereupon the Father doth receive and admit the
surety and His undertaking for payment, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. and,
<hi>Lo, a voice from heaven,</hi> saying, <hi>this is My beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased;</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 39. He standeth to
all things which were testified of Him in the Scriptures;
<hi>Search the Scriptures: for in them ye think to have eternall
life, and they are they that testifie of Me.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 36. He
professeth, that all that He doth, is with the Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and concurrence, and that He came into the World,
that He might finish what the Father had sent Him to do
and suffer, which He calls His work that He was about.
And more specially He shews the agreement past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Father and Him before He came into the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40880:19"/>
world concerning his incarnation, and the discharge of
his Mediatory office, and his power to give eternall life
to those that believe in him: for, the Father sent him
to be incarnat, <hi>vers.</hi> 37. and that he with the Father,
might give <hi>eternall life to whomsoever he will, and might
quicken the dead, vers.</hi> 21. and that he might exercise
judgement, authority was given to him as the Son of
man, <hi>vers.</hi> 27. Yea, he sheweth, that it was agreed upon
between the Father and him about all the doctrine
which he should reach, <hi>Iohn 8. 26. I speak to the World
these things</hi> which I have heard of him; and he sheweth
that they were agreed about the price of redemption of
the elect, and about his resurrection from the dead, and
that his death did fully satisfie the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 15.
<hi>As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father; and I
lay down My life for the sheep;</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 17. therefore
doth the Father love Me, because <hi>I lay down My life that
I might take it again;</hi> and, <hi>vers. 18. this commandment
have I received of the Father.</hi> And, <hi>Luke,</hi> 24. 25. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones
in short the sum of the covenant past between the
Father and himself, speaking to the two disciples going
to <hi>Emaus; O fools and slow of heart, to believe all that the
prophets have spoken, ought not Christ to have suffered these
things, and to enter in his own glory?</hi> But most briefly he
sheweth the whole mater so oft as he calleth the Father
<hi>his God,</hi> and that in respect of the <hi>covenant</hi> past between
God and him to be incarnat, and now incarnat indeed.</p>

                  <p>THe sixth evidence of the Covenant of Redemption,
past between the Father and the Son, standeth in the
heads and articles of the Covenant wherein they were
agreed.</p>
                  <p>Now there are as many articles of the Covenant, as
there are injunctions, commands and conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on the one hand, and promises to fulfill all on the
other hand; as many predictions as there are of
Christs sufferings, and promises made to the Church
through and for Him. Of these many, we shall touch
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40880:19"/>
only at four, whereby the faith of believers in Him
may be confirmed about their Redemption by Him,
and whereby the erroneous doctrine of them who eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuat
the Covenant of redemption of the elect, may be
refuted: wherein they teach, that Christ, by His obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
yielded unto the Father, even to the death of the
crosse, did purchase no more but a possibility of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and no more grace for the elect then for the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
as if He had not purchased a certainty of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be given to any, but had suspended all the fruit of
His suffering upon the frail, mutable, inconstant and
corrupt <hi>free-will</hi> of men; so that no man can by their
doctrine have more certainty of their own salvation,
then they have of the certainty and stability of their
own sickle mind and will: and so no more certainty
of their own salvation, then of their own perdition.
The order we shall keep in speaking of the articles of
the Covenant of Redemption, shall be this.</p>
                  <p>The first article, shall be of the persons redeemed.</p>
                  <p>The second article, shall be of the price of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be payed by Christ in the fulnesse of time.</p>
                  <p>The third article, shall be about the gifts and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
purchased for, and to be given unto, the persons Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
                  <p>The fourth article of this Covenant of redemption,
past between the Father and the Son, shall be of the
means and wayes whereby the gifts and benefits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased,
may be wisely, orderly and effectually applyed
to the Redeemed.</p>
                  <p>In ranking of these articles, we do not presuppose a
priority of one of them before another in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or time; But we choose to speak of them in order
of doctrine, for our more easie understanding of the
mater.</p>
                  <p>For, the Covenant of Redemption past between the
Father and the Son, is by way of an eternall decree of
the Trinity, comprehending all and whatsoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to Redemption. In the decerning of which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40880:20"/>
decree, there is not a first nor a last, but a joint purpose
of God to bring about and accomplish all the heads
and articles of the Covenant, each in their own due
time, order and way appointed.</p>

               <div n="1" type="article">
                  <head>The first article of the Covenant of Redemption
concerneth the persons redeemed.</head>
                  <p>THe redeemed in Scripture, are pointed forth under
sundry expressions; sometime they are called the
<hi>predestinat;</hi> sometime the <hi>elect;</hi> sometime these <hi>whom
God foreknew;</hi> sometime they who are <hi>called according
to His purpose;</hi> sometime <hi>they that were given</hi> to Christ
of the Father; sometime <hi>Christs sheep;</hi> sometime the
<hi>children of God,</hi> &amp;c. But whatsoever name they have,
the persons are the same, according to that of the
Apostle, <hi>Rom. 8. 29. 30. whom He did foreknow, them
He did predestinat to be conform to the image of His Son—Moreover
whom He did predestinat, them He also called;
and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
them he also glorified.</hi> The number and the
names of the persons here spoken of, are the same; and
they are called the <hi>predestinat,</hi> in regard that God hath
appointed them to a certain end, to wit, eternall life,
to be brought thereunto effectually by certain means
for the glory of Gods grace. They are called <hi>elect,
vers.</hi> 33. in regard God in the purpose of his good
pleasure, hath severed them from among the rest of men,
lying with them in the state of perdition by their own
procurement, and hath designed them to be partakers
of eternall salvation. They are called <hi>foreknown,</hi> and
written in the book of life, in regard God hath compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
them in his speciall love, no lesse distinctly and
unchangeably, then if he had their names written in a
catalogue, or book. And they are called <hi>given</hi> unto
Christ, in regard the redeeming of them, and bringing
them to life is committed to Christ. But by whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
name they are designed, the persons redeemed are
still the same.</p>
                  <p>2. But whereas the elect, given to Christ, are called
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40880:20"/>
                     <hi>the redeemed,</hi> it presupposeth, that they were considered
and looked upon as now fallen by their own fault, and
lying by their own merit in sin and misery, enemies to
God, and altogether unable to help themselves. For,
this much doth the notion of <hi>Redemption,</hi> or buying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
again import: and that it is so, is clear, because
the mercy of God, the grace of God, the good-will of
God, is put in Scripture for the only motive and impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
cause of Redemption, <hi>Ephes. 1. 7. 8. 9. In whom
we have Redemption through his blood, even the forgivenesse
of sins according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath
abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having
made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his
good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The Scripture sheweth us that there is an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
multitude of redeemed persons, and a sort of <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality</hi>
of them, extended unto all nations and ages
and states of men; so that this hudge multitude for
whose <hi>redemption</hi> Christs blood was shed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.
29. is justly called by the name of a world, an <hi>elect
world, Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. to be called out of that reprobat
world, for which Christ refuseth to interceed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.
9. the truth of this mater, the <hi>redeemed</hi> do acknowledge
in their worshiping Christ their Mediatour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9.
<hi>and they sang a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take
the book and to open the seals thereof; for, thou wast slain,
and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kinred
and tongue and people and nation</hi> These are the <hi>all men</hi>
whom God will have saved and doth save, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4.
these are the <hi>all men</hi> of whom the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3. 9. God is patient toward us (to wit his elect) not
willing that any of <hi>us</hi> should perish, but that <hi>we all</hi>
should come to repentance: And this the Apostle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
for a reason of the Lords deferring his coming, till
<hi>all the elect</hi> should be brought in, of whom many were
not yet converted in the Apostles time and many were
not yet born, and if Christ should not delay his coming,
till they were born and brought in to reconciliation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40880:21"/>
with God, the number of the elect should be cut short.</p>
                  <p>4. In no place of Scripture is it said, that <hi>all</hi> and <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man</hi> are elect, or every man is given to Christ, or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is <hi>predestinat unto life;</hi> in no place of Scripture
is it said, that Christ hath made paction with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>for all and every man without exception;</hi> But by the
contrary, it is sure from Scripture, that Christ hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
and procured salvation <hi>for all them</hi> for whom he
entered himself Surety. <hi>Their sins</hi> only were laid on
Christ, and in him condemned, satisfied for, and expiat,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 53. for <hi>these,</hi> and in <hi>their</hi> place he offered himself to
satisfie Justice, for <hi>them</hi> he prayed, <hi>them</hi> only he justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and glorifieth: for, the sentence of the Apostle,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. standeth firm; <hi>in Christ all are dead</hi> (to
the law) <hi>for whom</hi> and in whose room Christ did die.
And therefore for <hi>these his people</hi> the law is satisfied:
from <hi>these</hi> the curse is taken away, <hi>to them</hi> heaven and
all things necessary to salvation are purchased, and shall

he laid down his life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 15. 16. 26. he

Christ never purposed to lay down his life for those,

pray and die, and rise, and will raise them to eternall

                  <p>AS to the second article of the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning the price of Redemption, and the
sitting of the Redeemer for accomplishing the work of
Redemption, God would not have silver, or gold, or
any corruptible thing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. He refuseth all ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
that can come from a meer man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 8. But
He would have His own co-eternall and only begotten
Son to become a man, to take on the yoke of the law,
and to do all His will, that He alone might redeem the
elect, who by nature are under the curse of the law.
He would have Him the second Adam to be obedient
even to the death of the crosse, that by His obedience
many might be justified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is clearly confirmed by the Apostle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heb.</hi> 10. 5.
6. 7. 10. <hi>commenting upon the 7. and 8. verses of</hi>
Psal. 40. In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast
had no pleasure, then said Christ coming into the world, Lo, I
come (in the volumne of the book it is written of Me) to do
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40880:22"/>
thy will O God—by the which will we are sanctified, by the
offering up of the blood of Iesus once for all.</p>
                  <p>2. By Christs obedience we understand not only
that which some call his <hi>active obedience,</hi> nor that only
which some call his <hi>passive obedience:</hi> for, his active and
passive obedience, are but two notions of one thing; for,
his incarnation, subjection to the law, and the whole
course of his life was a continued course of suffering,
and in all his suffering he was a free and voluntary
agent, fulfilling all which he had undertaken unto the
Father, for making out the promised price of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and accomplishing what the Father had given
him command to do. His obedience, even to the death
of the crosse, did begin in his emptying himself to take
on our nature, and the shape of a servant, and did run
on till his resurrection and ascension. As for these his
sufferings in the end of his life, which he suffered both
in soul and body, they were the compleating of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
begun and running obedience, but were not his
only obedience for us, or his only suffering for us, for he
had done and suffered much from his incarnation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his last passion and death, but the highest degree of
his obedience, whereby he bought deliverance unto us
from sin and misery, and whereby he bought unto us,
immortality and eternall blessednesse in heaven, was
his death on the crosse compleating our ransom.</p>
                  <p>3. Whereas some have said, that one drop of His
blood was sufficient to redeem moe worlds then one, if
there wre any moe, it is but an inconsiderat speech, and
destitute of Scriptural authority; for when Christ had
suffered all things before the time of His death, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
Him to be crucified also, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 26. but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
Him not to suffer more then justice required for
a ransom, but only as much as was agreed upon, and
no less could satisfie. Now this commandment He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the Father, that He should lay down His life
for His sheep, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 18. For, the wisdom of God
thought good, to testifie His own holiness and hatred
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40880:22"/>
of sin, and to testifie His love to the elect world, and
riches of His grace toward them to whom He would
be mercifull, by inflicting no less punishment of sin on
the Mediator His own dear Son (taking upon Himself
full satisfaction to justice for all the sins of all the Elect
given unto Him to redeem) then the death both of His
body and soul for a season.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it was suteable to His holy and soveraign
Majesty, that for the ransom of so many thousands and
millions of damnable sinners, and saving of them from
everlasting torment of body and soul, no less price
should be payed by the Son of God, made man and
surety for them, then His sufferings both in His body
and soul for a season, as much as should be equivalent
to the due deserved punishment of them whom he
should redeem; and it became the justice of the infinite
Majesty offended, to be reconciled with so many rebels,
and to bestow upon them heaven and eternal blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for no less price then the sufferings of the eternal
Son made man, whose humiliation and voluntary obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
even to the death of the cross, was of infinite
worth and value; and therefore he yieldeth himself
to the sufferings agreed upon in the covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
both in body and soul.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The death of the soul is not, in all things, like
to the death of the body; for, albeit the spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the soul be made immortal and not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,
yet it is subject to its own sort of death,
which consists in the separation of it from communion

called the death of the soul, from which sort of death,
the immortality of the soul, not only doth not deliver,

                        </gap>s of the death suffered by Christ
in His soul, we may number, first, that habitual
heaviness of spirit which haunted him all the dayes of
His life, as was foretold by <hi>Isa. 53. 3. He was a man of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40880:23"/>
sorrows, and acquainted with grief.</hi> We hear He weeped,
but never that he laughed, and but very seldom that he
rejoiced.</p>
                     <p>2. He suffered in speciall, sorrow and grief in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the ingratitude of them, for whom he came
to lay down his life, <hi>we hid as it were our faces from him;
he was despised, and we esteemed him not, Isa.</hi> 53. 3.</p>
                     <p>3. The hardnesse of mens hearts, and the malice of
his own covenanted people, and the daily contumelies
and despightfull usage he found from day to day, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
his daily grief, as by rivolets the flood is raised
in the river; <hi>he was despised and rejected of men, Isa.</hi> 53. 3.</p>
                     <p>4. He was tempted in all things like unto us, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
in them all never tainted with sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. yet
with what a vexation of his most holy soul, we may
easily gather by comparing the holinesse of our Lord
with the holinesse of his servants, to whom nothing is
more bitter then the firie darts of the devil, and his sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
and sollicitations to sin: especially, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the variety of temptations, the hainousnesse of the
sins, whereunto that impudent and unclean spirit boldly
sollicited his holinesse, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. and withall, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
and pertinacy of the devil, who never ceased,
partly by himself, partly by those that were his slaves,
and partly by the corruption which he found in Christs
disciples, to pursue, presse, and vex the God of glory
all the time he lived on earth.</p>
                     <p>5. The guilt of all the sins, crimes, and vile deeds of
the elect, committed from the beginning of the world,
was imputed unto him, by accepting of which imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
albeit he polluted not his Conscience, yet he bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
his soul, binding himself to bear their deserved
punishment.</p>
                     <p>Now when we see that the vilest sinners, as liars,
thieves, adulterers, cannot patiently hear themselves
called liars, or thieves, nor bear the shame of the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whereof they are really guilty, with what suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of soul? with what clouding of the glory of his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40880:24"/>
holinesse, think we that our Lord took upon his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
such a dunghill of all vilenesse, then which, nothing
could more be unbeseeming his holy Majesty?</p>
                     <p>6. Unto all the former degrees of suffering of his soul,
the perplexity of his thoughts fell on him, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and astonishment of soul, when the full cup of
wrath was presented unto him, in such a terrible way,
as made all the powers of his sense and reason for a time
to be at a stand. Which suffering of his soul, while
the Evangelist is about to expresse, he saith he began to
be <hi>sore amazed,</hi> and also to be <hi>very heavy;</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
himself in these words, <hi>My Soul is exceeding sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
unto death, Mark,</hi> 14. 33. 34.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But did not this astonishing amazement of
Christs soul speak some imperfection of the humane
nature?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> It did no wayes argue any imperfection or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake
of sanctity in him, but only a sinlesse, and kindly
infirmity in regard of naturall strength, in the dayes of
his flesh; for, the mind of a man, by any suddain and
vehement commotion arising from a terrible object,
may without sinning be so taken up, that the swift pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
of his mind in discourse may for a while be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and the act of reasoning suspended a while: all
the cogitations of the mind fleeing together to consult,
and not being able to extricat themselves in an instant,
may stand amazed, and sit down a while, like Jobs
friends astonished. Now our Lord, taking on our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and our common sinlesse infirmities, became like
unto us in all things except sin. <hi>Daniels</hi> infirmity at
the sight of an Angel, was not sin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But doth not this astonishing admiration, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
lighting upon Christs soul, prove that something
unforeseen of him did befall him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Not at all; for, he knew all things that should
befall him, and told his disciples thereof, and was at a
point and resolved in every thing, which was to come
before it came. But this astonishing amazement did
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40880:24"/>
only shew forth the naturall difference between things
<hi>preconceived</hi> in the mind, and these same things <hi>presented</hi>
to sense: for, there is in the mind a different impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the preconceived heat of a burning iron, before it
do touch the skin, from that powerfull impression
which a hot iron thrust into the flesh doth put upon the
sense. In regard of which naturall difference between
<hi>foresight</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> between <hi>resolution</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi>
this astonishment befell our Lord, and in this regard,
Christ is said to learn experimentall <hi>obedience by these
things which he suffered,</hi> Heb. 5. 8.</p>
                     <p>7. Another degree of the suffering of our Lords soul,
is the interruption, for a time, of the sensible uptaking
and feeling of that quiet and peaceable injoyment of the
felicity of the humane nature, given (for the point of
right) unto it in its personall union with his God-head,
in so far, that in the midst of many disciples, Greeks and
Jews looking on him, the vehemency of his trouble did
not suffer him to hide his perturbation; for. <hi>(Ioh.
12. 27.)</hi> our Lord cryed out, <hi>Now is My Soul troubled,
and what shall I say?</hi> and, <hi>Mark,</hi> 14. 34. made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his exceeding heavinesse; <hi>My Soul is exceeding sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
unto death.</hi> In which words he insinuats, that
to his sense, death was at hand; yea, that in no small
measure, it had seased on him, and wrapped him up in
the sorrows of death, for the time, as in a net of which
he knew he could not be holden still.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But did not this hudge heap of miseries take
away from the humane nature, the felicity of its union
personally with his God-head?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> It did indeed hide it for a time, and hinder the
sensible feeling of it for a time, as it was necessary, in
his deep suffering; but it did not take it away, nor yet
eclipse it altogether: for, as a corporall inheritance
hath a threefold connexion with the person owner
thereof; so a spirituall inheritance hath a threefold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the believers soul. The first is, of lawfull
<hi>title</hi> and <hi>right;</hi> the next is, of <hi>possession</hi> of the inheritance
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40880:25"/>
according to the lawfull right; the third is, an <hi>actuall
fruition</hi> and present feeling of the use of the inheritance.
The fruition and felt benefite and use, may be marred or
suspended, &amp; the possession stand: and the possession may
be interrupted and suspended, and the lawfull right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
firm. Christ had not only an undoubted right to
this felicity standing unto him, by the personall union,
but also a fast possession of it, in as far as the personall
union was indissolvable. But the actuall felt fruition
in his humane sense and uptaking, was so long interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as the humane nature was diverted from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
for its present exercise, and turned to look
toward the sad spectacle of imminent and incumbent
wrath: especially when, and how long it was, as it
were, bound to the feeling of the present stroke which
did fill the soul with sadnesse and grief, anxiety and
vexation, without sin.</p>
                     <p>8. Neither did the vindictive justice of God, pursue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our sins in our Surety, stay here, but in the garden
went on to shew unto Christ the cup of wrath, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to hold it to his head, and to presse him to drink it;
yea, the very dregs of the agreed-upon curse of the law,
was poured into his patient and submissive mouth, as it
were, and bosome, and the most inward part of soul and
body, which as a vehement flame, above all humane
apprehension, so filled both soul and body, that out of
all his veines it drew and drove forth a bloody sweat
(the like whereof was never heard) as when a pot of
oyl, boyling up and running over by a fire set under it,
hath yet further the flame increased by the thrusting of
a firie masse of hot iron into it.</p>
                     <p>Hence came such a wasting and eating up of all his
humane strength, and emptying of his naturall abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
such a down-throwing of his mind, such a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and swounding of his joy, and so heavy a weight
of sorrow on him, that not only he desired that small
comfort of his weak disciples watching with him a
little, and missed of it, but also stood in need of an
Angel to comfort him, <hi>Luke,</hi> 22. 43.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:40880:25"/>
It is without ground, that some of the learned have
denied the cause of this agony to be the drinking of the
cup of wrath holden forth to him by the Father, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the sight of it only and of the perill he saw
we were into, was the cause of this heavy exercise: for,
the cup was not only showen unto him, and the hudge
wrath due to our sin set before him that he should see it,
and tremble at the apprehension of the danger we were
in, but it was poured into him, and not only on him,
that he for the sins of his redeemed should suffer it sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
and as it were drink it, that the bitternesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
might affect all the powers of soul and body: for,
the Scripture testifies, that not only upon the sight and
apprehension of this wrath and curse coming on him,
the holy humane nature did holily abhor it, but also
that he submitted to receive it, upon the consideration
of the divine decree and agreement made, upon the
price to be payed by him, and that upon the feeling of
this wrath this agony in his soul, and <hi>bloody</hi> sweat of
his body, was brought on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But, how could the pouring forth of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wrath upon his innocent and dear Son consist
with his Fatherly love to him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Even as the innocency and holiness of Christ
could well consist with his taking upon him the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our sins; for, even the wrath of a just man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
capitall punishment on a condemned person,
put case his own child, can well consist with fatherly
affection toward the child suffering punishment; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not to be doubted, but these two can well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in God, in whom affections do not war one with
another, nor sight with reason, as it falleth forth among
men; for, the affections ascribed unto God, are <hi>effects</hi>
rather of his holy will toward us, then properly called
<hi>affections</hi> in him; and these effects of Gods will about
us, do alwayes tend to our good and blessednesse at last,
however diverse one from another in themselves.</p>
                     <p>9. Among the degrees of the sufferings of Christs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40880:26"/>
soul, we may number not only the perturbation of his
mind and thoughts, but also the perturbation of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and especially his fear; for, his humane nature
was like unto ours in all things except sin, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
feared when it saw and felt the wrath of God, least
it should have been swallowed up by it, and of this fear
the Apostle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7.) beareth witnesse, saying, <hi>who
in the dayes of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
supplications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and strong cryes and tears, unto him that was
able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared.</hi>

                     <p>Now, albeit this seemeth the saddest passage of all
his sufferings, that he was feared for being swallowed
up, yet this his fear is not to be wondered at, nor is it
inconsistent with his holinesse; for when Christ assumed
our nature (as hath been said) he assumed also all the
common and sinless infirmities, passions, and perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our nature: Now it is kindly that the creature,
at the sight of an angry God should tremble; for, we
read, that the rocks and mountains have trembled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, when he did let forth his terrour; and it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to man, at the sight of a terrible object, at the
sight of a perill and evill coming upon him, but much
more already come upon him (especially if the evill and
perill be above all his naturall strength) to tremble
and fear the worst; and this becometh holy nature very
well to fear present death, off-cutting, perdition and
swallowing up in the danger, when God appeared an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and was hasting to be avenged on sinners in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their <hi>Surety,</hi> what could the humane soul of
Christ gather from this terrible sight, but that which
sense and reason did teach? In the mean time there was
no place here for his doubting of the issue and his
escapeing from being swallowed up; for, naturall fear
of the manly nature, arising from the infirmity of the
creature, differs very far from the fear arising from the
infirmity of faith in Gods faithfulnesse and power; and
naturall fear of the worst, can very well stand with the
strength of faith to overcome the naturall fear: for, as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40880:26"/>
the sensitive appetite may abhor a bitter cup of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
and cause all the body tremble for fear to take it,
while in the mean time, the man by reason is resolved
to drink that bitter cup of medicine, because he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
hopeth to help his health thereby; so naturall
fear in Christ to taste of the cup of wrath, could very
well consist with strong faith and assurance to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
therefrom: for, it is very sutable that faith should
as far overcome the naturall apprehension of sense and
reason naturall, as reason doth overcome sense in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a loathsom and bitter cup of medicine.</p>
                     <p>And to clear this yet further, that extream fear to be
swallowed up of wrath, could well consist in Christ
with strong faith to overcome and bear out that terrible
wrath, Let it be considered, that as it was needfull
Christ should be subject to the infirmity of naturall
strength, that he might suffer death; so it was needfull,
that he should have strong faith to inable him to bear
out, in a holy way, that which he behoved to suffer:
for, if on the one hand, Christ had not been weakned,
and emptied of all humane strength in his flesh, he could
not have been humbled enough for us, he could not
have suffered so much, as Justice did exact for satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for us; and on the other hand, if he had not stood
firm in faith and love toward Gods glory and our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
he could not have satisfied Justice, nor been
still the innocent and spotlesse lamb of God, nor have
perfected the expiatory sacrifice for us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But was he not tempted to doubt by Satan?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> We grant that he was indeed tempted by Satan
to doubt, yea we shall not stand to grant that he was
tempted to desperation; But we altogether deny, that
he was tainted with sin by temptation in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
for, the Scripture saith, he was tempted in all
things like unto us, but yet without sin in him or yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any sort to any temptation. And seing by the
Evangelist, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. we understand, that he was
tempted in the wildernesse by the devil unto the most
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40880:27"/>
horrible sins that Satan could devise, and yet was not
stained or polluted in the least degree, with the least
measure of yielding to the sinfull temptations; we need
not stand to grant, that he might be tempted, or that he
was tempted unto doubting and desperation; for, this
was among the most notable and prime temptations,
whereby Satan, in his impudent boldnesse, sollicited
the Son of God, very God and man in one person, even
to doubt of that what Satan knew he was; <hi>If thou be the
Son of God,</hi> saith he. It is true indeed, that we who are
sinners by nature and corrupted in all the powers of our
soul, cannot be tempted, tossed, and troubled, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our sinfull nature in some measure may appear, and
be polluted: But the mater was not so with our holy
Lord, the God of glory, who was separat from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
for our impure nature is like to water in a pudle,
which being stirred, doth presently become muddy and
foul; but the holy humane nature of Christ, was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
pure, like unto clear and pure fountain water in
a glasse, which howsoever it be troubled and tossed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
most pure and free of all muddinesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But at least, was there not a conflict in our Lord
between his faith, and the temptation to doubting?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> We grant not only a conflict of Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
naturall strength, with the burden of affliction,
but also a conflict and wrestling of his faith against the
temptation to doubting; for, wrestling doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
argue the infirmity of the wrestler, for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
who is called God, <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. wrestles with <hi>Iacob,</hi>
and in God was no infirmity. Again, wrestling doth
not argue alwayes infirmity, but doth only evidence
the wrestlers power and the importunat obstinacy of an
adversary, who being repulsed and cast down, doth not
at first leave the field, but riseth up again, insists and
presseth on so long as it pleaseth the most powerfull
party to suffer the adversary to make opposition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But you must grant, that in the conflict of
Christs humane naturall strength, with the affliction
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40880:27"/>
and burden of the punishment laid upon him by the
Father, he was overcome, and succumbed and died.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes indeed: but we must put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the conflict of naturall strength with the burden
of affliction, and the conflict between faith and a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
unto sin; in the conflict of holy humane nature
in Christ with the punishment of our sins laid on Him,
it was not a sin to have his naturall strength overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered,
and to lye down under the burden and to lay
down his life and die; but it was a main part of His
obedience, it was the performance of His promise and
undertaking, to yield himself to Justice and to die for
us, that we might be delivered from death eternall.
But in the wrestling of His faith with the temptation
unto doubting, it had been a sin to have yielded in the
least degree, and that which could not consist with the
perfect holinesse of the Mediatour, Surety for sinners.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But, did not the perplexity of His thoughts and
the anxiety of His mind, diminish something of the
vigour and constancy of his faith?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> It did diminish nothing of the vigour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of His faith; for there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the troubling of the thoughts, and the hesitation
or weakening of faith, as there is also a great difference
between the perturbations of the mind and the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the conscience. For, as the mind may be
troubled, when in the consideration of some difficulty
it cannot at first perceive an outgate, mean-time the
conscience remaining sound and quiet; so may the work
of the mind's discoursing, be interrupted and at a stay
for a time, faith (mean time) remaining untouched,
wholly sound and quiet. For example, upon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
receiving of a wound, or upon an unexpected report
of some great losse, such as befell <hi>Iob,</hi> the wheels of
the reasoning faculty may be at a stand for a time, and
the conscience in the mean time be quiet; yea, and faith
in the mean time, remain strong, as we see in <hi>Iob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>
first exercise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:40880:28"/>
Now if this may be found in an holy imperfect man
in any measure, why shall we not consider rightly of the
exercise of the holy one of Israel suffering in His hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature the punishment of our sin?</p>
                     <p>Let us consider but one of the passages of our Lords
exercise, <hi>Ioh. 12. 27. 28. Now</hi> (saith He) <hi>My Soul is
troubled:</hi> wherein behold the perplexity of His mind,
smitten with the horrour of the curse due to us, coming
upon Him; then cometh forth, <hi>what shall I say?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
behold! reason standing mute and altogether silent,
only He lets forth the confession of His perplexity: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after this, He subjoyneth <hi>Father, save Me from this
hour;</hi> wherein behold! Holy nature, trembling and
shrinking to fall into the wrath of the Father, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the principles of holy nature, testifying the
simple abhorrency of His soul from such an evill as is
the <hi>wrath</hi> of God His Father, which had it not been
for love to save our souls. He could not have yielded his
humane nature to endure, or bear it: therefore He, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that we were but lost for ever, if He should not
suffer wrath for us, He repeats the sum of the Covenant
of Redemption agreed upon, <hi>But for this cause came I
unto this hour.</hi> And last of all, shuts up His speech and
exercise in the triumphing voice of victorious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
faith, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Name;</hi> and here He
resteth: wherewith the Father is so well pleased, as
that from heaven He speaketh to the hearing of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
standing by, <hi>I have both glorified it, and will glorifie
it again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. Among the deepest degrees of the suffering of
Christ in His soul, we reckon that desertion whereof
Christ on the crosse giveth an account, crying out, <hi>My
God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?</hi> By which
speech He doth not mean, that then the personall union
of the natures was in him dissolved, nor yet that God
had withdrawn His sustaining strength and help from
the humane nature, nor that the love of the Father was
taken off him, nor that any point of the perfection of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40880:28"/>
holinesse was taken from him; but his true intent is, to
shew, that God for a time had taken away sensible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
and felt joy from His humane Soul, that so ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
might in His sufferings be the more fully satisfied:
And this is the <hi>forsakeing</hi> of Him here given to us to
understand. In which desertion Christ is not to be
looked upon simply as He is in His own person, the Son
of the Father, in whom He is alwayes well pleased,
but as He standeth in the room of sinners, <hi>Surety</hi> and
<hi>Cautioner,</hi> paying their debt: In which respect He beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be dealt with as standing in our name; <hi>guilty</hi> and
paying the debt of being forsaken of God, which we
were bound to suffer fully and for ever, if He had not
interposed for us.</p>
                     <p>11. The last degree of Christs sufferings (wherein
He may be said to have <hi>descended into hell</hi> so far as
Scripture in the old Testament or the hystory of Christs
passion in the new, will suffer us to expound that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
is that curse wherein the full wrath of God, and
the dregs of that horrible cup was poured forth upon
His holy humane nature, while heaven and earth and
hell, seemed to conspire to take vengeance on Him, and
fully to punish our sins in the person of Him our Surety
by that cursed death of the crosse, which was the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
foretold of the malediction of God lying on Him,
in so far as was necessary to compleet the punishment of
losse and feeling both in soul and body. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not without ground have Orthodox divines taken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Christs suffering in His soul, and the detaining of
His body in the grave (put in as the close and last part
of Christs sufferings) as the true meaning of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<hi>He descended into hell:</hi> not only because these
pains which Christ suffered both in body and soul, were
due to us in full measure; but also because that which
Christ suffered in the point of torment and vexation,
was, in some respect, of the same kind with the torment
of the damned: for, in the punishment of the damned,
we must necessarily distinguish these three things, 1. the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40880:29"/>
perverse disposition of the mind of the damned in their
sufferings; 2. the duration and perpetuity of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
and, 3. the punishment it self, tormenting
soul and body. The first two are not of the essence of
punishment, albeit by accident they are turned into a
punishment, for the wickednesse, vilenesse and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
of the damned, who neither will nor can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves to the punishment (and put the case
they should submit, are utterly unable to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for ever) do make them in a desperat, dolefull
condition for ever, though obstinat sinners do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
nor believe this, but go on in treasuring up
wrath against themselves, pleasing themselves in their
own dreams, to their own endlesse perdition. Of these
three, the first two could have no place in Christ: Not
the first, because He willingly offered Himself a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for our sins; and upon agreement, payed the ransom
fully: Not the second, because He could no longer be
holden in the sorrows of death then He had satisfied
Justice, and finished what was imposed on Him; and
His infinit excellency made His short suffering to be of
infinit worth, and equivalent to our everlasting suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                     <p>The third then remaineth, which is the reall and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
tormenting of soul and body in being made a curse
for us, and to feel it so in His reall experience. And
what need we question hellish pain, where pain and
torment, and the curse with felt wrath from God fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
on, and lyeth still, till Justice be satisfied? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, it is as certain, that Christ was seased
upon by the dolours of death, as it is certain in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that He could not be holden of the sorrows of
death, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> But what interest had Christ God-head in
His humane sufferings, to make them both so short and
so precious and satisfactory to Justice for so many sins
of so many sinners, especially when we consider that
God cannot suffer?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:40880:29"/>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Albeit this passion of the humane nature, could
not so far reach the God-head of Christ, that it should
in a <hi>physicall</hi> sense suffer (which indeed is impossible)
yet these sufferings did so affect the person, that it may
truly be said, that God suffered, and by His blood
bought His people to Himself, <hi>Acts,</hi> 20. 28. for, albeit
the proper and formall subject of physicall suffering be
only the humane nature; yet, the principall subject of
sufferings, both in a physicall and morall sense, is Christs
person, God and man, from the dignity whereof, the
worth and excellency of all sort of sufferings, the merit
and the satisfactory sufficiency of the price, did flow.</p>
                     <p>And let it be considered also, that albeit Christ, as
God, in His God-head could not suffer in a physicall
sense; yet, in a morall sense He might suffer, and did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer:
for, in as much as He, being in the form of God,
and without robbery equall to God, did demit His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to assume humane nature, and empty Himself so far
as to hide His glory and take on the shape of a servant,
and expose Himself willingly to all the contradiction of
sinners which He was to meet with, and to all railings,
revilings, contempt, despisings and calumnies, shall it
seem nothing, and not enter in the count of our Lords
payment for our debt?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But, how could so low a downthrowing of the
Son of man, or of the humane nature assumed by
Christ, consist with the Majesty of the person of the Son
of God?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> We must distinguish in Christ these things,
which are proper to either of the two natures, from
these things which are ascribed to His person, in respect
of either of the natures or both the natures; for, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
physicall suffering, or mortality, are proper to the
humane nature. The glory of power and grace and
mercy, and superexcellent Majesty and such like, are
proper to the Deity; but the sufferings of the humane
nature, are so far from diminishing the glory of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature, that they do manifest the same and make it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40880:30"/>
appear more clearly: for, by how much the humane
nature was <hi>weakned,</hi> depressed, and despised, for our
sake, by so much the love of Christ, God and man in
one person, toward man, and His mercy and power
and grace to man, do shine in the eyes of those that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously
look upon Him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But seing Christs satisfaction for sinners, doth
not stand in any one part of His doings and sufferings,
but in the whole and intire precious pearl, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleet
price of His whole obedience from His incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
even to the death of His crosse, how cometh it to
passe, that in Scripture the whole expiation of our sins,
is ascribed so oft to His passion, and particularly to His
blood?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This cometh to passe, 1. Because the certainty
and verity of His assumed humane nature, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of His reall suffering, and the fulfilling of all the
leviticall sacrifices, did most evidently appear unto sense
in the effusion of His blood. 2. Because the expression
of His sufferings, both in soul and body, appeared in
the effusion of His blood: for, in the garden, while His
body was not as yet touched, or hurt by man, from the
meer pains of His soul, drops of blood fell down out of
all His body to the earth. 3. Because His blood-shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and death, was the last act of compleeting the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ransom to the Father for us, which pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
began in His humble incarnation and went on
through all His life, and was compleeted in His blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and death, whereof our Lord gave intimation on
the crosse, when He cryed as triumphantly victorious,
<hi>it is finished.</hi>

                     <p>WE have at some length spoken of the price of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and of Christs defraying the debt by
His passion. 1. That hereby the merit of our sins, may

                     <p>For in the price of Redemption payed, as in a mirror
we may see, how greatly the Lord hateth sin,; how
great His love is to the world in sending his Son Christ
amongst us; how heavy the wrath of God shall lye
upon them that flee not to Christs satisfaction for their
delivery; how great the dignity and excellency of the
Lord our Redeemer is, for whose cause reconciliation
is granted to all that take hold of the offer of grace
through him; how great the obligation of believers is
to love God, and serve him; and how greatly the glory
of all the attributes of God, doth shine in the work of
Redemption.</p>
                     <p>2. By this doctrine, it appeareth how vain and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the devices of superstitious men are, who, for pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods wrath, have appointed pennances, and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages,
and self-scourgings, and soul-masses, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
and such like other abominations, whereof the
word of God hath not spoken, but forbidden all the
inventions of men, as unworthy conceits, to bring about
mens salvation: which inventions tend only to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
from the dignity of the price of Christs ransom, and
to cry down the fulnesse and perfection of the price pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ, and to set up
other Saviours in his room.</p>
                     <p>3. Hence also it is manifest, how fit a high Priest is
appointed over us, who is touched with our infirmities
and temptations; by whom we may have so solid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
in all the pangs of our tormented consciences,
and in whom we have a solid foundation laid down to
all that flee to him, for setling our faith and hope in the

                  </p>
                  <p>2. The benefits which are appointed for the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are so conveyed and brought unto them, that first,
they are Christs riches which he hath purchased unto
the elect, and being resolved to die, that the purchase
might be made fast to his people, he hath made his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Will and Testament once and again, and left in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
to all that believe in him, all things which belong
to righteousnesse and salvation; and these benefits, in an
acceptable time, he effectually applieth and puts them
in possession thereof. Of which gifts, we shall name
chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fly three: the first is regeneration, or turning of the
man toward himself; the second is the gift of saving
faith; the third is perseverance. In which three gifts,
the patrons and magnifiers of the power of mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
do what in them lieth to obscure the glory of Gods
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40880:31"/>
free grace, by glorying that without the speciall grace
of God they can convert themselves or not, as they
please, so that when God intends their conversion, and
useth all means for their conversion, they are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
all his gracious operation, and make void his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and endeavour. But this covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
past between the Father and the Son, Mediatour
and Redeemer, doth decide the question and give them
the lie: for, <hi>only they whom God did foreknow, did he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinat
to be conform to the image of His Son—and whom
he did predestinat, them he also called; and whom he called,
them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also
glorified,</hi> Rom. 8. 28.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Concerning these three gifts.</head>
                     <p>IT is agreed between God and Christ, that the elect
shall be converted invincibly and infallibly, and that
saving faith shall be bestowed on them, and that they
shall persevere in the obedience of faith so, as they shall
not totally and finally fall away from Gods grace.</p>
                     <p>It is promised to Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. that <hi>in the day
of His power, His people shall be willing;</hi> for, albeit the
native corruption of their will, opposeth it self and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
the holy Spirit, when he is using the means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them. yet in an acceptable time, the invincible
power of Gods free grace toward them, so taketh away
all actuall resistance, that the man, unwilling of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is made most freely and heartily willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to God: for, God can both preserve the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
liberty of the will, and take from it that crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and frowardnesse that is in it; he can infuse and
creat in the man a right spirit, and new habits of grace,
and can bring forth these habits unto exercise, making
the redeemed man not only able to will, but also actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>to will</hi> and <hi>to do</hi> what is pleasant to him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13.
and, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8. we are taught, that <hi>faith is not of our
selves, it is the gift of God; not of works, least any man should
boast.</hi> And this gift of saving faith, is bestowed only
on the elect; and therefore it is called the faith of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40880:32"/>
elect, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. and only they believe in Jesus Christ,
<hi>that are ordained unto eternall life, Acts</hi> 13. 48. yea, every
one cometh to Christ, who is given to him of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 37. and no man cometh to Christ, save he
whom the Father draweth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 44. but they that
are not redeemed, do not come to Christ for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and life, <hi>Ioh. 10. 26. ye believe not,</hi> saith Christ to
some Jews, <hi>because ye are not of my sheep, My sheep hear
My voice and I know them, and they follow Me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As for</hi> perseverance, <hi>the Father promiseth to the Son,
that the work of grace shall be firm in all the redeemed
ones, or in his elect seed,</hi> Isa. 59. 21. as for Me <hi>(saith
the Lord to Christ)</hi> this is my covenant with them, my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth
of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, saith the
Lord, from henceforth and for ever. <hi>And, Jer.</hi> 32. 40.
I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not
turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear
in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</p>
                     <p>And a speciall command is given unto Christ, for
preserving all unto eternall life who come unto him,
<hi>Ioh. 6. 39. this is the Fathers will, which hath sent me, that
of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but
should raise it up at the last day:</hi> which Christ undertakes,
that he will faithfully perform, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 28. while he
saith, <hi>I give unto them eternall life, and they shall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand,</hi> &amp;c.
But, that we insist not too long in this argument
(whereof the Orthodox divines have written abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
in their disputations against the foresaid errour)
because the adversaries take their pretended arguments
from the instability of mens will, in the mater of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
and from the freedom and power of mans
changeable will in the mater of conversion and saving
faith, and from the maner of Gods speaking to the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
multitude of both called and not chosen, and to them
that are both called and chosen, we shall content our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40880:32"/>
selves for clearing this covenant betwixt the Father and
the Son, Mediatour and Redeemer, to make the mater
fast concerning the elect, founding their conversion,
faith, repentance, perseverance, and salvation, upon the
unchangeable covenant of Redemption, fixed upon the
setled agreement between God, and God the Son Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour
and Redeemer, as shall be proven from five places
of Scripture.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="1" type="proof">
                     <head>The first proof, is from vers. 13. of Isa. 52. to the end of
Chap. 53.</head>
                     <p>THe first place is <hi>Isa. 52. vers.</hi> 13. and forward to the
end of chapter 53. where we have, first, the two
parties contracters, God the Father, and Christ; for,
the Father brings forth his confederat Son to be incarnat
by covenant, his servant, whom he imployes in the
whole work of Redemption, as the meritorious cause
and accomplisher of it; <hi>behold My servant,</hi> saith God
the Father by his Spirit, speaking by the Prophet, <hi>Chap.</hi>
52. 13. <hi>Next,</hi> both parties are sure of the event of the
paction, and of the accomplishing of the whole work
gloriously, <hi>behold,</hi> (saith he) <hi>My servant shall deal pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and prosperously, He shall be exalted and extolled and
be very high,</hi> vers. 13. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he tells the proper price,
which Christ the Son shall pay for the Redemption of
his people, agreed upon by paction, to wit, the exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and humbling of the Son incarnat unto the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious
death of the crosse, <hi>that His visage shall be
marred more then any man, and His form more then the sons
of men, vers.</hi> 14. and more particularly, <hi>Chap.</hi> 53. 2.
<hi>He hath no form nor comelinesse, and when we shall see Him,
there is no beauty that we should desire Him, He is despised,
and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with
grief,</hi> &amp;c. vers. 2. 3. <hi>He was wounded for our transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
vers. 5. <hi>He shall make his Soul an offering for sin,</hi>
vers. 10.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Christ the Son of God incarnat, is assured
and confirmed of the sweet fruit of his passion in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40880:33"/>
conversion of many nations, whom he should sprinkle
with the blood of the covenant and sanctifie by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of His holy Spirit, Chap. 52. 15. <hi>He shall sprinkle
many nations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God and Christ are agreed and well pleased
in the conversion of so many as are elected, and given
to Christ, to have in Him the right of adoption, <hi>Chap.</hi>
53. 10. <hi>He shall see his seed,</hi> that is, He shall regenerat
the elect, and make them His children, and see them so,
to His satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> no meritorious nor impulsive cause is found
in the persons redeemed, for which the punishment due
to them should be transferred upon the Mediatour
Christ our Redeemer; for, they should be found in
themselves but despisers of Christ, because of His suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Chap. 53. 4. <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
God and afflicted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> no sin nor meritorious cause of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is found in Christ the Redeemer, for which He
should be smitten, Chap. 53. 5. 9. <hi>He was wounded for
our transgressions—he had done no violence, neither was
any deceit in his mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eigthly,</hi> peace and reconciliation and healing of
our sinfull and miserable sicknesses, and deliverance
from wrath, are purchased by the price of His blood,
Chap. 53. 5. <hi>the chastisment of our peace, was upon him, and
with his stripes we are healed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ninthly, <hi>these sufferings Christ did not endure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly,
or unwillingly, but by consent, by covenant
deliberatly, Chap.</hi> 53. 7. He was oppressed, and he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb
to the slaughter, and as a sheep before his shearers is dumb, so
he opened not his mouth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tenthly,</hi> the cause of this covenant, whereby the price
is called for an yielded unto, and payed, is the only free
grace of God and His good pleasure, Chap. 53. 10. <hi>It
pleased the Lord to bruise him, He hath put him to grief.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:40880:33"/>
                        <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> It is agreed between the Father and the
Son, that our sins should be imputed unto Him, and His
righteousnesse imputed unto us, and that the redeemed
should believe in him and so be justified, Chap. 53. 11.
<hi>he shall see of the travell of his Soul, and shall be satisfied, by
his knowledge,</hi> or faith in Him, <hi>shall My righteous servant
justifie many: for he shall bear their iniquities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> It is agreed between the parties, that for
whom Christ should lay down His life, He should stand
intercessour also, for bringing unto them all the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
graces and blessings, Chap. 53. 11. <hi>he bare the sins
of many, and made intercession for the transgressours:</hi> the
rest of the world beside the elect, He interceeded not for,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 9. 10.</p>
                     <p>Hence it followeth, that God and Christ did not
bargain for the Redemption of all and every man; no
not for the Redemption, conversion and salvation of all
and every man to whom the Gospel was to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
for, many were to be called, who were not chosen,
to whom the gift of saving faith was not to be given,
nor the power of God to salvation was never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;
and this is the observation which the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
makes upon the 1. of <hi>Isa. 53. Ioh.</hi> 12. 37. &amp;c. <hi>But
though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
not on him, that the saying of the prophet Isaiah might
be fulfilled which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?
and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could not believe, because</hi> Isaiah <hi>said again, (Isa. 6.
9. 10.) he hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their
hearts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it followeth hence, that election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
were not for the foreseen faith or works of the
elect redeemed, but of the meer grace and goodwill of
God, and all done for them and in them, contrair to
their deservings: for, it is said, <hi>Isa. 53. 6. all we, like
sheep have gone astray, and the Lord hath laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of us all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it followeth hence, that it was agreed upon,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40880:34"/>
that saving grace and conversion and sanctification
should infallibly and invincibly come to passe and be
given to the redeemed, <hi>Isa. 52. 13. Behold, My servant
shall deal prudently and prosperously;</hi> and, <hi>vers. 15. be shall
sprinkle many nations;</hi> and, <hi>Isa. 53. 11. by his knowledge
shall my righteous servant justifie many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, hence it followeth, that the agreement is
past for their finall perseverance and full salvation: for,
<hi>Isa. 53. 5. with his stripes we are healed:</hi> now our heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is our full salvation from our sin and misery, or our
deadly sicknesses. And, <hi>Isa. 53. 10. the pleasure of the
Lord shall prosper in his hand:</hi> the pleasure of the Lord
is partly our sanctification, 1 <hi>Thes. 4. 3. partly, our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and glorification,</hi> Joh. 6. 39. <hi>this is the Fathers will
which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me,
I should lose nothing; but should raise it up again at the last
day.</hi> And to this purpose powerfully doth his interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
serve, from which the Apostle concludes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
shall be perfectly saved, <hi>Heb. 7. 25. wherefore he
is able also to save to the uttermost, them that come to God by
him, seing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="proof">
                     <head>The second proof is from Isa. 59. 20. 21.</head>
                     <p>THe second place is from <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 20. 21. where, first,
we have the parties agreeing pointed at: the Lord
Jehovah saith and of the <hi>Redeemer</hi> He saith, that He
shall come to Zion as <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Next, we have the
kind of agreement between the parties, God on the one
hand, and the <hi>Redeemer</hi> with the redeemed, for whom
and in whose name he makes the agreement; <hi>this is my
Covenant with them,</hi> but first with Christ, as the words
following do shew. Thirdly, we have the party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
<hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> that turn from transgression,
which is the mark of true believers in Christ and of the
elect, for whom this grace is appointed, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7.
<hi>Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for, but the
election have obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</hi> And,
<hi>Rom. 11. 26. all this Israel shall be saved,</hi> as it is written.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40880:34"/>
Fourthly, we have the sort of their delivery, which
shall be not only by price paying, but also by powerfull
and <hi>effectuall working,</hi> as the originall imports, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
26, and, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 20. Fifthly, the benefits bestowed
upon the elect, are comprehended under the designation
of the <hi>redeemed;</hi> they are to be turned from their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
by effectuall conversion, by granting them faith
in Christ, repentance and reconciliation. Sixthly, it is
shewed how these graces shall be brought to passe, to
wit, by application thereof by the word and Spirit of
Christ; from which, sanctification, salvation, and the
perpetuation of all graces unto salvation, do flow and
follow on them; <hi>My Spirit that is in thee,</hi> saith the Lord
to the Redeemer incarnat, <hi>and My word which I have put
in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the
mouth of thy seed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>These articles of the covenant of Redemption make
expresly, first, against universall Redemption of all and
every man: because Christ, as is shewed before, makes
his bargain for the elect, and leaves the rest in blindness,
and is a Redeemer of none but of these to whom He is a
deliverer <hi>actually,</hi> from whom He turneth away iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and ungodlinesse; which benefits befall none, but
the elect and the redeemed.</p>
                     <p>Next, they make against election <hi>for faith and foreseen
works,</hi> because when Christ cometh to call-in the Jews.
He findes nothing commendable in them but impiety
and transgression and defection, and whatsoever might
provoke Him to reject them; <hi>they are turned from trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they make against a <hi>meer possible</hi> and <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
conversion:</hi> for, invincible grace is promised here;
for, the word and the Spirit of Christ shall take up a
dwelling in them, and not depart from them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they make against the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slasie
of the saints, and uncertainty of their perseverance,
because here it is promised to Christ, that from the heart
and mouth of His seed, the word and Spirit of Christ
shall never depart.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="proof">
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:40880:35"/>
                     <head>The third proof is from, Joh. 6. 37. &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THe third place is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. from, <hi>v.</hi> 37. to 45. where,
first, is set down the party contracters in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of redemption; for, the Elect are given over into
the hand of Christ by the Father; <hi>All that the Father
giveth to me, cometh to me.</hi> v. 37.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, upon the Fathers giving of the Elect unto
Christ followeth, in due time, the conversion and saving
faith of the redeemed; <hi>All that the Father giveth me,
cometh to me,</hi> saith Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly the redeemed are committed unto Christ, as
to their leading on, preservation and perfecting of their
salvation;</hi> This is the Fathers will which hath sent me, that
of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should
raise it up again at the last day.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it is agreed by what means the faith of the
redeemed shall be formed in them, which are, the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sight of Christ the Son of God in the Word; the
powerfull drawing of the illuminat soul unto Christ,
which powerfull draught overcometh all opposition
and resistence, because it is omnipotent and invincible:
for, <hi>no man cometh to Christ, but he whom the Father
draweth,</hi> v. 44. and that by making them savingly, and
in a lively maner see the Son and believe on him. <hi>v.</hi> 40.</p>
                     <p>Hence followeth, 1. that it is false Doctrine to teach,
that there is an universal redemption unto life of all
and every man; because not all, but only some are
given, and made to come to Christ; the rest that are
not given, come not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it followeth, that Election is of meer free
grace; because men come not unto Christ that they
may be given, but they are given unto Christ, that they
may be brought and come unto him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by this agreement, the powerfull conversion
of the redeemed and their powerfull preservation unto
eternal life, is as certain as the power, and constancy,
and obedience of Christ unto the Father, is firm and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40880:35"/>
certain; <hi>This is the will of him that sent me, that of what
he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but raise it up at the
last day,</hi> ver. 39.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="4" type="proof">
                     <head>The fourth proof is, Joh. 10. 14.</head>
                     <p>THe fourth place is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. from <hi>v.</hi> 14. to <hi>v.</hi> 30.
where we see, that the Lord Jesus, the true Pastor
of <hi>Israel,</hi> before he was incarnat, <hi>Ps.</hi> 23. continueth in
that same office now, being incarnat, and gives his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to understand this, when he saith, <hi>I am the good sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, the care and custody of all the redeemed,
both converted and unconverted, was put upon Christ,</hi>
v. 14. 16. I know my sheep, and am known of mine; and
other sheep I have, which are not of this fold, them also I
must bring in, and they shall hear my voice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, the price of their redemption is clearly
agreed upon,</hi> v. 15. As the Father knows me, even so know I
the Father; and I lay down my life for my sheep.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly, the Father accepts the price, and is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and well pleased with it,</hi> v. 17. 18. Therefore doth
my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may
take it up again. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly, all the redeemed are infallibly converted, but
they that are not redeemed are not converted,</hi> v. 27,
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow
me; <hi>and,</hi> v. 26. but ye believe not, because ye are not of
my sheep.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, albeit the redeemed and converted shall not
want enemies, who shall go about to mar their perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
and salvation, yet shall they not prevail, <hi>v. 28.
I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither
shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence followeth, first, that the doctrine of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
redemption of all and every man unto life is false;
because only the redemption of the elect sheep is agreed
upon, for whom he layeth down his life, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and the
rest are not redeemed nor ordained to life, for these he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40880:36"/>
speaks to, <hi>v.</hi> 26. they were not of his sheep, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
unbelievers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it followeth, that the election of men is not
for faith or works fore-seen, but on the contrary, faith
is ordained to be given unto the redeemed, because they
are elected and given over unto Christ to convert and
save them, <hi>v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. other sheep I have, and them I must bring
in, and they shall hear my voice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it followeth, that the conversion of the Elect
doth not depend on their will, but upon Christs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
to make them believe and upon His omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<hi>vers. 16. other sheep I have, and them I must bring in
and they shall hear my voice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it followeth, that albeit the redeemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
be in themselves wirlesse as sheep, and weak, and
ready to be destroyed, and compassed about with many
enemies as sheep among wolves, yet because of the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
of the Father and of the Son, that have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the care and custody of them, they shall persevere,
and it is impossible they should perish or not persevere,
<hi>Ioh. 10. 28. 29. I give them eternall life; and they shall
never perish, and none can take them out of My Fathers band.</hi>

10. 5. 6. 7. where, first, the Spirit of God expounds
the covenant whereof we are, speaking, and brings

the terms thereof. The price of Redemption is first
spoken of, for expiation of sin, not to be forgiven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

beasts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, all satisfactions by men, and whatsoever

                     <p>Thirdly, nothing except only the incarnation of the
Son the Mediatour, His obedience and suffering to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40880:36"/>
death, could satisfie divine Justice; <hi>But a body hast thou
prepared Me,</hi> vers. 5.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Mediatour Christ, offers Himself pledge
and Surety of His own accord, and takes the condition;
<hi>then said I, lo, I come,</hi> to wit, as <hi>Surety</hi> to pay the ransom
and <hi>to do thy will,</hi> Heb. 10. 7.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Christ the Surety; not only condescends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the price, but also upon the persons to be redeemed,
and their sanctification; <hi>by which will we are sanctified,
by the offering of the body of Christ once for all:</hi> and this
price is now actually payed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly, the price being payed, the Mediatour goeth
about the application of the purchased benefits, by His
intercession,</hi> Heb. 10. 12. 13. this man after he had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one sacrifice for sin for ever, sat down on the right hand of
God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his
footstool.</p>
                     <p>Hence followeth, first, that there is no universall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of all and every man unto life, <hi>because by one
offering he hath perfected for ever, them that are sanctified,</hi>
Heb. 10. 14. therefore they were never redeemed, who
are never sanctified; and only they are perfected, who
are redeemed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it followeth, that not for any thing in man,
neither fore-seen faith or works, are men elected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
because all is rejected that meer man can do,
that the meer grace of God may appear in Christs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking

and of their perseverance unto perfection. <hi>By one

The use of this article is, first, that all these who hear
the Gospel, and have in any sort embraced it, should in
the acknowledgement of their naturall corruption and
perverse wickednesse, humble themselves before God,
and pray for, and expect grace according to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
offered in the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that they who are already sensible of their
sins and ill deservings, may not run away or be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,

relief from sin and misery is promised to such.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that they who have fixed their eye on the
Son, resolving to cleave unto him, should acknowledge
the powerfull draught of Gods almighty hand, who
hath caused them to come to Christ, and should upon
the begun work of grace, conceive lively hope of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and study to purifie their souls in this hope.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that they who find the instability and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy

                        </gap>r heed to their wayes, should not cast away their
confidence in Christ because of their own infirmity,
but that they should lean lesse to their own strength, and
lay hold on Christs power, fidelity and constancy so
much the more, for to help the weak at such a dead lift.
The Apostle, looking to Christs engagement in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
for those who in any measure of sincerity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
unto him, hath said, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 8. 9. Christ shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm

our Lord Iesus Christ. God is faithfull, by whom ye are

but let so many as are fled to Christ, give him the

and to his obedience in any measure, and know that

we find his hand withdrawing, and our heart inclining

                  <head>The fourth article.</head>
                  <p>AS to the fourth article of the covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it concerneth the means and maner how the
elect shall be called forth from the perishing world, and
be effectually called and turned unto God, so as the
world among whom the elect do live, shall not have
cause of stumbling justly: for, he hath taken a most
wise course so to execute the decree of election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
as he shall be sure to bring in his own to
himself, and not open up his counsell in particular to
the discouraging of any, as is told by the father, <hi>Isa.</hi>
52. 13. <hi>My servant shall deal prudently and prosper.</hi> The
chief mean appointed, is the preaching of the Gospel to
all nations, commanding all men, where the Gospel is
by Gods providence preached, to repent and believe
in the Name of Jesus Christ, and to love one another
as he hath commanded them, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. and, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi>
3. 23. and they who refuse to obey are without excuse.</p>
                  <p>Another mean is, the bringing of so many as professe
their acceptation of the offer of grace by Christ Jesus,
them and their children into the bond of an expresse so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
covenant, that they shall submit themselves to the
doctrine and government of Christ, and teach their
children so to do, as <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of believers did,
<hi>Gen. 18. 19. Matth. 28. 19. 20. make disciples of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
or, <hi>make all nations disciples to Me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A third mean is, the sealing of the covenant by the
Sacrament of baptism,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. 20. make all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
disciples to Me, baptizing them in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>A fourth mean is, the gathering them into all lawfull
and possible communion with others his disciples, that
by their Church-fellowship one with another, they may
be edified under their officers, appointed in Christs Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40880:38"/>
to feed, govern and lead them on in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of all the commands which Christ hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his people in his Testament: by which means he
goeth about his work, and doth call effectually, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and save, his own redeemed ones, leaving all others
without excuse.</p>
                  <p>Concerning all these and other means and maner also
of executing his decree, it is agreed upon between the
Father and His Son Christ, as His holy Spirit hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
it to us in Scripture. All which may be taken
up in two heads; the one is the agreement about the
doctrine, and directions given to His Church; the
other is about actions, operations, and all effects to be
brought about for making his word good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning his doctrine, Christ saith,</hi> Ioh. 12. 49. 50.
I have not spoken of my self, but the Father who hath sent
me, he gave me a commandment what I should say, and what I
should speak, and I know, that his commandment is life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
whatsoever I speak therefore, eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

unto me, so I speak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning actions and operations, and the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou
of the decrees, it is agreed also between the Father
and the Son,</hi> Ioh. 8. 16. If I judge, my judgement is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<hi>and Joh.</hi> 6. 38. I came down from heaven, not to do my own

him that sent me.</p>
                  <p>In a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the consent and agreement of the Father

               <head type="sub">Of the Covenant of works.</head>
               <p>WE have spoken of the first divine covenant,
wherein God, and God incarnat are the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
it followeth to speak of the next divine
covenant, to wit, the covenant of works between God
and man, <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity, made in mans inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.
In which covenant, God is only the one party
of the covenant, and man created with all naturall
perfections, is the other party. In this covenant, mans
continuing in a happy life, is promised, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of perfect personall obedience, to be done by him
out of his own naturall strength bestowed upon him, as
the Apostle teacheth us, Gal. 3. 12. <hi>the Law is not of
faith, but the man who shall do these things shall live by them.</hi>
And unto this law or covenant of works, is added a
threatning of death in case man should transgresse: the
sense whereof is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old by the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 3. 10. cursed

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The difference between the law, and the Covenant of works.</head>
                  <p>THe word <hi>Law,</hi> is sometime taken for the mater
or substance of the law of nature, written in
the hearts of our first Parents by creation; the work of
which law, is to be found in the hearts of their posterity
unto this day. And in this sense the word <hi>Law,</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 2. 15. the Gentiles</hi> (saith he)
<hi>shew the wrok of the Law written in their hearts, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40880:39"/>
also bearing witnesse,</hi> &amp;c. Sometime the
word, is taken for the formall covenant of works, as
<hi>Gal. 3. 10. as many as are of the works of the Law,</hi> that is,
under the covenant of works, <hi>are under the curse;</hi> for, it
is written, <hi>cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
that are written,</hi> in the book of the law, <hi>to do them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The law as it is taken for the covenant of works,
differeth from the law of nature, written by creation in
the hearts of our first Parents; first, because the law of
nature, written in the heart of man, in order both of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and time, went before the covenant made for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that law; because the covenant for keeping that
law, was not made till after mans creation, and after
his bringing into the garden to dresse it and to keep it,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16. 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God by vertue of the law written in man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
heart, did not obliedge Himself to perpetuat mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
life: for, albeit man had keeped that law most acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly,
God was free to dispose of Him as he saw fit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he made the covenant with him; But so soon as he
made the covenant, he oblieged himself to preserve him
in a happy life, so long as he should go on in obedience
to his law and commands, according to the tennor of
the covenant, <hi>do this and live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, death was the naturall wages and merit of
sin, albeit there had no covenant been made at all: for,
sin against God, deserveth, of its own nature, death of
soul and body, by the rule of simple justice, whether the
sinner had consented to the punishment or not. But
man by entering in the covenant actually gave a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
voluntary consent, that death should sease upon
him, if he should sin, as <hi>Evah</hi> beareth witnesse in her
conference with the serpent, while she doth repeat the
condition put upon the breaking of the particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
given by God, and accepted by man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when the covenant of works is abolished
so far, as it can neither justifie, nor condemn the man
that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>led to Christ, and entered in another posterior
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40880:39"/>
covenant of grace, the naturall obligation of the man
slandeth still, for taking direction from, and giving obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to, the law; for, it remaineth still the rule of a
mans walking, and it is impossible that a meer man
should be exeemed from the authority of God over him,
and from subjection due by nature to his Creatour: for
upon this account, that man is a reasonable creature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Gods will about his behaviour toward
God, he is alwayes bound for ever to love God with all
his mind, heart and strength, and his neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Neither can the naturall merit of sin be taken
away, nor death deserved be eshewed but by forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of it for Christs merits.</p>
                  <p>The covenant then was superadded unto the law in
the deep wisdom of God: for, this way of dealing
with man by a Covenant, was, of its own nature, a
most fit mean unto mans felicity, and unto the glory of
God.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>How the Covenant of God with man was a mean
to mans felicity.</head>
                  <p>THe Covenanting of God with man, tended of its
own nature to mans good and happiness.</p>
                  <p>First, because a singular respect and honour was put
upon man, when he was made a confederat friend of
God: for, if it be an honour to a mean and poor man
to be joyned with a King or Prince in a formal bond of
mutual friendship, how much greater honour is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
man, to be joyned in a bond of mutual love and
friendship with God?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, before the making of the Covenant man
had no promise made to him by God, but so soon as
the Covenant was made, the Lord did freely obliege
himself to give, and made to man a right to ask, and
to expect of God, with a ground of certainty, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of him such things, as without promise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> he
could not ask, or at least, he could not certainly expect
to have granted unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40880:40"/>
Thirdly, before the making of the Covenant, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hindred the Lord, if he had pleased, to command
man to return to dust whereof he was; but after the
Covenant, it pleased God, by his own free promise, to
obliege himself to perpetuat mans happiness wherein
he was made, so long as he should go on in obedience.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by the making of the Covenant, a door
was opened, and a fair entry to a higher degree of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
then he possessed by his creation: for, when a
natural life and earthly felicity was given to <hi>Adam</hi> to
enjoy upon the earth, God, by the Covenant, made
paction with him upon condition of perfect obedience,
to give him a life and felicity super-natural, opposite
unto death bodily and spiritual, which was threatned
unto him if he should transgress the command.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Adam,</hi> by the Covenant, had a sort of help
to make him keep the Law written in his heart more
carefully and cautiously, and a prop to make him stand
more fixed: for, on the one hand, he was advertised and
forewarned of the danger of sinning, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
to offend God; and on the other hand, he was
encouraged and allowed to serve God more chearfully,
and to perform due obedience to God the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently:
for, in the Covenant, the greatest reward that
could be thought upon was set before him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
unto him; to wit, eternal life upon his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and the greatest punishment threatned if he should
dis-obey; both which served greatly to move him to
be constant in his obedience.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>How Gods covenanting with man served for
Gods glory.</head>
                  <p>IN Gods covenanting with man, his glory did notably
shine and shew forth it self to man. First, the goodness
and bounty of God, did manifest it self therein: for, in
making a Covenant with man, the Lord demitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and in a maner humbled himself to deal with man
for the standing of mutual friendship between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40880:40"/>
and man for ever: and when we consider this, as
the Psalmist saith, <hi>Ps. 8. 4. What is man that thou are
mindfull of him? and the Son of man that thou visitest
him?</hi> So may we say, what is man? or the Son of man
that thou shouldest enter in covenant with him?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by covenanting with man, God did show
his wonderfull moderation: for, God is soveraign
Monarch and absolute Emperour over his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to make of it what he pleaseth; yet, in covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with man, he did sweetly temper his supreamacy,
seeking, as it were, to reign with mans consent. And
when because of his soveraign Authority and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Right and Interest, he might have put upon man
harder commands and conditions of the Covenant,
and these also altogether righteous and just, he choosed
to use such moderation, that he would require nothing
of man, except that which man should, and behoved
in reason judge both a just and an easie yoke, and in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the condition of the Covenant, acknowledge
it to be such.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lord declared his wisdom in covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with man, because when he had made man a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
creature, he choosed to draw forth a free and
voluntary service, most suteable to his reasonable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that in a most sweet way; to wit, not only by
giving unto man a most equitable Law, but also by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
before the man, by way of paction, the highest
reward that he could be capable of, even life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in covenanting with man, God did most
wisely and holily have a respect to the glory of his
own, both soveraignty and holiness; because after he
had made man by nature good and holy (albeit mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and subject to change, if the man pleased to essay
another way) he took course to help the mutability of
his free will, not only by setting a reward of obedience
before him, but also by a threatniug of punishment, if
he should transgress, and so on the one hand and the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40880:41"/>
other to hedge him in, and guard him against all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
unto sin, that neither he should be forced by any
external power to sin, nor by any counsel or suggestion
or moral swasion (whereunto only man was exposed
in the tryal of his obedience) should have so strong
motives to draw him to disobedience, as the promise of
God and the threatning should have force in all reason,
to keep him fast to his due and loyal obedience. Thus
was <hi>Adam</hi> fore-warned and fore-armed against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
without himself, might assault him: for, what
reward for disobedience could be offered unto him, so
great as the favour of God and everlasting life in the
fellowship of God promised to him, if he continued fast
in obedience? and what terror could be so great to
afright and skar him from sin, as the threatning of death
bodily and spiritual, if he transgressed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But the profane curiosity of man dareth to
ask a reason, why God did not make man both good
by nature and immutably good also?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is indeed proud curiosity to enquire for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of God's holy will, which hath its own most suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
reason in its self, and may satisfie all his subjects,
who will not devilishly prefer their own wisdom and
counsel to his: But we shall content our selves soberly
to answer the question thus; To be both <hi>originally,</hi> or
by nature good, and <hi>unchangeably</hi> good also, beseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God himself only, as his property and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which it became his Majesty to reserve to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as the fountain of all goodness, and not to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat
this glory either to Man or Angel in their creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the due distance between God and the natural
perfections of the creature, should not only be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, but made manifest to the creature also. It's
true, Christs humane nature, was so sanctified in his
conception, that there was no possibility that sin should
be in it; but let us consider, that Christs person which
did assume the humane nature into personal union with
his God-head, is not a creature; and to assume the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40880:41"/>
humane nature into a personal union with his divine
nature, is the proper priviledge of God over all, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for ever. And what the humane nature of Christ
hath of holiness, it hath it not of it self, but of grace
from the second person of the God-head, who did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
it. And the Angels that stood when the mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of angelical nature was manifested in the fall
of many of them, did stand by the grace of free confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of them in their station.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God in covenanting with man, made way
for the demonstration of his most holy Justice in the
execution of punishment, which was not only the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wages and deserved reward of sin, but also by
paction and covenant appointed by mutual consent of
parties, if man, so much obliged to God, should
break so equitable and easie a command, as was given
to try him by, being fore-warned of his danger.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, this way of covenanting with man, was a
most holy and fit mean to manifest the vanity and insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the most perfect creature, except in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of all its abilities and habits, it do acknowledge
God, and in every thing less and more, constantly
imploy him, and depend upon him.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, this was a most holy mean to bring forth
to light the grace and mercy of God in Christ, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a remedy for fallen man before he fell, and to open
up the decree and covenant of Redemption in due time
to be brought about by Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the glory of God in
Christ, by whom, and <hi>for whom all things were made,</hi>
Col. 1. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Had this Covenant of works no Mediatour,
no Surety ingaged for <hi>Adam</hi> and all his posterity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> No Mediatour was in this Covenant; for, the
party on the one hand, was God, and on the other
hand was <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> our common parents, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the ground of their natural abilities, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
and comprehending all their natural off-spring;
and according to the condition of the Covenant in their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40880:42"/>
own name and name of their posterity, promising obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and receiving the condition of life if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and of death in case they failed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.
In whose sin we all have sinned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
                  <p>Now, the necessity of a Mediatour, did not appear
in this Covenant so long as it stood, that afterward in
the making of another Covenant it might more timou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
appear. First, because man, being created holy
according to the image of God, was the friend of God
while he had not sinned; and again his service, while
he stood in obedience, was very pleasant and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God, because so long freely and sincerely he
served God according to the command and rule writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in his heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> After that his Covenant was broken, was
it not abolished altogether, seing it could not now be
any longer perfectly obeyed, nor save us who are
sinners?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Albeit this Covenant, being broken on mans
part, did become weak and utterly unable to produce
Justification by works, or eternal life to us, by our
inherent righteousnesse; yet, on Gods part, the bond
of this Covenant, doth stand firm and strong against
all men by nature for their condemnation, who are
not reconciled to God: Wherefore all that are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
and made friends with God by another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of faith in God incarnat (the seed of the woman,
who destroyeth the work of the devil) do lye bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the bond of this Covenant of works, as Christ
testifies, <hi>Ioh. 3. 18. He that believeth on me, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
but he that believeth not, is condemned already;</hi>
to wit, by the force of the Covenant of works violated
by them, and are nor delivered from the curse by Christ
the Son of God, till they fly to him: And this doth the
Apostle confess, speaking of himself and other elect
Jews before their regeneration, <hi>Ephes. 2. 3. We also
were children of wrath. even as others:</hi> for, whosoever
is not reconciled to God by Christ, against him doth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40880:42"/>
the sentence of the Law, and curse for violation of the
Covenant, stand in force; for, sinning against the
Covenant, doth not loose the man from the Covenant,
neither from the obligation to obey it, nor from the
punishment of breaking it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But seing a man is utterly unable to obey the
Law, or to keep that Covenant, doth not his utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
excuse him and dissolve the bond?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> No wayes: Because that inability is the fruit
of our sin, and is drawn on by our selves; nor doth
God lose his right to crave the debt due to him, because
the Bankrupt is not able to pay what he oweth: For,
even among men, such as have mis-spent their patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
are not absolved of their debt because they are
not able to pay the debt; yea, even the children of the
mis-spender of his goods, do stand debtors so long as the
debt is neither payed nor forgiven.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant of works therefore being broken, the
obligation standeth, to make us give obedience so much
the more in time to come, and because of the curse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
for the breaking of the Covenant in time past,
the obligation to under-lye the punishment for by-gone
sins doth stand; and so both the obligation to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
the punishment, and the obligation to give obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
do stand together, while a man is not absolved
from the Covenant of works, by entring in a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
whereby the debt is payed and the sinner ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever then conceive, that they may be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from by-gone sins by their own obedience in time
to come, either by way of doing or of suffering, they
but deceive themselves, dreaming they can do impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities;
for, the punishment to be suffered for sin by the
sinner, is the curse-everlasting of soul and body, seing
a meer creature cannot for ever satisfie for his rebellion,
how long soever we presuppose his duration under suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
And for obedience by way of doing perfectly
what the Law doth crave, it is utterly impossible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40880:43"/>
we are carnal, sold under sin, and cannot satisfie
the Law; and because we cannot satisfie the Law, the
Law becometh weak and unable to justifie and save us,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>How the Covenant of works may be called the Covenant of
nature.</head>
                  <p>ALbeit the Law written by nature in mens heart,
differeth from the Covenant for performance of the
Law, as hath been shown before; yet, the Covenant
of works made with <hi>Adam</hi> before he fell, tying him to
keep that Law, may be called the <hi>Covenant of nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, because the Covenant of works is grounded
upon the Law of nature, and doth exact nothing of
man, save that which God might require of him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because when the Covenant of works
was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> it was made with all his natural
posterity, which was to spring of him by natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and so the obligation thereof did pass upon all
his natural posterity, by the Law of nature, which
maketh the child begotten to bear the image of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getters.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Covenant of works may justly be
called the Covenant of nature, appeareth by the force
of the conscience being wakened from its sleepy securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for, it challengeth for sin according to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and pronounceth the sentence of God's wrath
against the sinner: For, the conscience doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Judgment of God, <hi>that they which commit such
things, are worthy of death,</hi> Rom. 1. 32.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because the conscience naturally inclineth
a man to seek justification by his own works, if it can
any way find pretence for it, as we may see in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,
who in his speech to God, doth judge himself
a holy man, because he is not amongst the worst of
men, and hath many good works above others to
reckon forth and lay before God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:40880:43"/>
Fifthly, the inclination of mans heart, to expect a
reward of every good work he doth, whether it be in
some part reall, or only apparently such, testifieth so
much, <hi>Iudg. 17. 13. Micah</hi> so reasoneth, <hi>Now know I
the Lord will do me good, seing I have a Levit to my Priest.</hi>
And how miserably the conscience may be deluded in
this case, when men do dote upon their own well-deserving,
appeareth in <hi>Leah:</hi> for, Gen. 30. 18. <hi>Leah</hi>
saith, <hi>God hath given me my hire, because I have given my
maiden to my husband.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, this point is also made manifest by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ignorance of righteousness by faith, and affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be justified by works, which the Apostle finds
fault-with in the Israelits, Rom. 9. 31. <hi>They sought
righteousness not by faith, but as it were by works:</hi> And,
Rom. 10. 3. <hi>being ignorant of the righteousness of God,
and going about to establish their own righteousness</hi> (to wit,
righteousness by works, according to the tenour of the
Covenant of works) <hi>they did not submit themselves to the
righteousness of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the same course followed by Papists and
other erroneous teachers, testifieth the natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men to seek righteousness by works according to
the tenour of the Covenant of works, and not by faith
in Christ Jesus, that righteousness may come by grace
only: And so are some mens hearts glued to this error,
that they do transform justification by faith in justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by one work in stead of all, as if the work of
faith were the mans righteousness, and not Christ him-himself
laid hold on by faith: Not considering, that to
the man that renounceth all confidence in any work of
his own, and flieth to Christ by faith, <hi>Christ is made of
God unto that man wisdom and righteousness,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, this natural inclination, even of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat,
to seek righteousness by works, doth prove
the Covenant of works to be naturally ingraft in all
mens hearts, as appeareth in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who being
instructed in the doctrine of justification by faith in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40880:44"/>
Christ without the works of the Law, did easily upon
a tentation offered, look back, with likeing, to the
way of Justification by works, for which the Apostle
reproveth them, Gal. 4. 21. <hi>Tell me</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye that
desire to be under the Law,</hi> or Covenant of works; and
ver. 9. <hi>But now after ye have known God, or rather are
known of God, how turn ye again to weak and beggarly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But, the <hi>Galatians</hi> as it seemeth, did not reject
Justification by faith, but, did joyn with it Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the works of the Law, thinking that the safest
way was to joyn both together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The inconsistency of these two wayes
of Justification, the Apostle sheweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.
For, Justification by grace, is no more by works, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
grace is no more of grace, and what Justification is
by works, is no more of grace, otherwise work is no
more works. And therefore, the Apostle makes the
joyning of these two wayes of Justification to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a plain seeking of Justification by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, which cutteth a man off from any
benefit by Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. and whosoever seeketh to
be justified by the Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> or Covenant of works, is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>For further clearing this matter, we may distinguish
two sorts of the Covenant of works: The one is true,
genuine, and of God's institution, which God made
with all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> for perfect obedience unto God's
Law, out of mans own natural abilities. There is another
counterfeit, bastard covenant of works, of mans own
devising, which a sinner, lying in his sins (unable to
do what the Law commands, or to suffer what the
Law being broken binds upon him) of his own head
devileth, upon other conditions then God hath set,
and will have God to take his devised covenant in
stead of perfect obedience to the Law, that so he may
be justified. Such was the covenant, which the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Israelits made with God in the wilderness, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40880:44"/>
which their posterity did follow, turning the Covenant
of grace, whereunto God was calling them, into a
covenant of works of their own framing: For, the
grace which was offered to them in Christ under the
vail of levitical types, figures and ceremonies, they
turned into an external service of performance only of
bare and dead ceremonies, and into a ministry of the
letter and death; for they did not take up Christ to be
the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that
believes in him, but did think, that both the moral
and ceremonial Law was given unto them of God, to
the intent that they should do the external works of the
moral Law, so far as they could; and when they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
the moral Law, they should fly to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law, and make amends for their faults by satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their sin by the external sacrifice of some clean
beast offered to God, or by the washing of their body,
and their cloaths. Such also is the covenant, which now
adayes many make with God, cutting short, with the
old Pharisees, the sense of the precepts of the Law, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it no further then they may keep the same, that
so they may make their own inherent righteousness the
longer, &amp; conform unto their own clipped rule of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
and this they do by denying themselves to be
guilty of original sin after baptism, and by extenuating
and diminishing many faults, as but light and venial as
they call them, and by devising satisfactions for expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the sins of the living, by penances and pilgrimages,
and of the dead by their sufferings in their imaginary
purgatory, that so they may be justified by their works
and sufferings. Such also is their covenant, who seek
justification by deceased Saints merits, hoping they may
so have absolution from sin, and obtain life eternal. And
all these sorts of covenants of mens framing, we call
bastard-covenants of works, because God will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any other Covenant of works then that which
requireth perfect personal obedience. And therefore
so many as seek to be justified by works, do stand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40880:45"/>
the obligation of perfect personal obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pain of death, and will be found not only utterly
unable to do any good work, but also to be without
Christ, and to be fallen from grace, as the Apostle
(<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3, 4.) doth teach us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Seing God doth abhor these bastard-covenants
of works, and doth well know, that men are so far
from performance of the due obedience of the Law, that
they are utterly unable before they be reconciled
through faith in Christ, to do so much as one accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
work, as the Psalmist teacheth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3.
Why doth the Lord exact perfect obedience unto the
Law from sinners? why doth he press so instantly the
slaves of sin to perform the duties required in the true
Covenant of works?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Lord justly doth abhor and reject these
bastard-covenants, because they evacuat and make
void both the Covenant of works and the Covenant of
grace which is by faith in Christ; and he doth press all
men to perform perfect obedience to all the commands
whereunto they are naturally obliged, to the end that
proud men, conceity of their own natural abilities,
may find by experience, that they are unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the condition of the Covenant of works, and may
acknowledge the same, and so dispair of righteousness
by their works, and be forced to flye to Christ, and
to the Covenant of grace through him, that they may
be fred from that covenant; and being justified by
faith in Christ, may be enabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This was the end of the promulgation of the Law in
mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that a stiff-necked people trusting in their
own abilities, might be made sensible of their
imperfection, by the repetition of the Law. And to
this also God super-added the external yoke of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law, which neither they nor their posterity
were able to bear, <hi>Acts,</hi> 15. 10. that the people per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
their manifold pollutions and guiltiness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were daily involved by breaking of God's Law:
might in the sense of the burden lying on them, and of
their damnable estate under it, flye to Christ the lamb
of God that takes away the sins of the world, as he
was, represented and offered to their sight in the sacrifices
and burnt offerings.</p>
                  <p>Of this end of pressing the Law upon proud men, we
have an example, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
In the conference of Christ with the young conceity
rich man, who in the opinion of his own inherent
righteousness, and of his abilities, was hudgly swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as if he had already for time by-gone satisfied the
the whole Law, and that he was able and ready to do
any good work which could be prescribed unto him,
for obtaining of eternal life; whose proud conceit that
Christ might humble and bring down, he craveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that he would keep the commands: And
when the young man denyed that he had broken the
Law, he proveth him guilty of gross and vile Idolatry,
from this, that he put a higher estimation on his riches
than on remission of sin, and did love them more then
heaven and fellowship with God in eternal life.</p>
                  <p>In all this let it be considered, that albeit mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in their works, doth displease God; yet good
works do not displease him, but they are so far plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
unto him, that there is no morall motive which
may serve to stir up in his people, an endeavour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after good works, which the Lord doth not make
use of; partly, by setting before them the reward if
they obey; partly, by setting punishments before thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

eyes if they obey not: yea, and the very observation
of externall morall duties and obedience, such as may
be discharged by the unregenerat man (albeit God
in relation to Justification do esteem it polluted and
vile) yet he doth sometimes reward their externall
works by giving them externall and temporall benefits
for their encouragement: for, even <hi>Ahabs</hi> temporary
humiliation the Lord so far accepted, that there-upon
He took occasion to delay to take vengeance upon
him, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 21. 27, 28, 29. Likewise the Lord
useth to recompence the civil justice of Pagans with a
temporal reward, yea and to reward the outward dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of every man in every lawfull occupation, with
some answerable outward reward.</p>
                  <p>The very Pharisees, who for the raising to themselves
a fame and higher estimation for holinesse, did take a
great deal of pains, in prayers in the streets, and Mercat-places,

their reward,</hi> Matth. 6. 2.</p>
                  <p>And this course the Lord doth keep, that he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and foster the civil society of men among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that His people looking on this bounty of
God, may be stirred up the more to bring forth the

because the creature neither hath nor can have, that

which is given for works, is not given of grace,</hi> Rom. 11. 16.
and in this sense, we take <hi>Grace</hi> as it is opposed to the
covenant of works: for, the condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works, is the giving perfect obedience to the
law; But the condition of the covenant of grace, is the
receiving of Christ by faith unto righteousnesse and life,
offered in the Gospel, without the works of the law;
which covenant, may thus be described. The covenant
of grace is a contract between God and men, procured
by Christ upon these tearms, that whosoever in the sense
of their own sinfulnesse shall receive Christ Jesus offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Gospel, for righteousnesse and life, shall have
Him and all the benefits purchased by Him, according
to the covenant of Redemption; and that God will be
his God, and the God of his children. This covenant
of grace is founded upon the covenant of <hi>Redemption,</hi>
past between God and Christ, wherein it was agreed,
that all the elect given unto Christ, shall be reconciled
in due time to God, and that to this end, this grace
should be preached to bring about the reconciliation;
and therefore Christ is called the <hi>Mediatour of the new
covenant,</hi> Heb. 12. 22.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The same which they had since the first expresse
and formall making thereof with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom
God promised to be his God, and the God of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
whose children all are, who are in Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
27, 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>For, of the <hi>redeemed</hi> some come to age, whom God,
having called by the preaching of the Gospel, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and effectually move to embrace solemnly the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
fellowship with God and his saints in Christ, and
to consecrat themselves and their children unto the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

in their infancy, before they come to the use of reason,
to whose salvation God hath expresse respect in making
his covenant with their parents, that he will not have
them excluded from the blessing, when he calls their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to him, but in the common offer of grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
by Christ, he makes the promise jointly to
the parents and the children; for, in one sentence, and,
as it were, with one breath, He saith, <hi>I will be thy God
and thy seeds after thee,</hi> Gen. 15. 17. whereof the Apostle
maketh good use, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. declaring the promise to
be made to the Jews and their children, and to the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Gentiles and their children. And upon this ground
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> timeously did offer consolation to the Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
trembling and anxious what way he should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31. saying, <hi>Believe in Christ Iesus, and thou
shall be saved, thou and thy house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the maner how the Lord dealeth with the souls
of infants in converting them, the Scripture doth not
speak, for this lieth among the secrets of God, which
doth not concern us to search after, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. It
should be sufficient to us, that God in covenanting with
the parents, promiseth to be the God of their children.
And according to this covenant the Lord complains of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40880:47"/>
their staying and offering their children unto idols, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them His own sons and daughters, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20.
and upon this ground, in the second command, the Lord
promiseth to shew mercy to the thousand generation of
believing parents; and, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. the Apostle doth
call the children of one of the parents believing, <hi>holy</hi>
children, because of their consecration unto God by the
believing confederat parent, and in regard of Gods
right and interest in them as the children of His own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
by covenant.</p>
                  <p>And Christ our Lord upon this ground, doth call the
children of confederat parents, burgesses of heaven; of
such is the kingdom of heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 13, 14. and
because infants are dedicat to Christ, to be taught and
governed by Him in His own way and order, they are
called disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. as the disputers for the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
of Christians children, as well as of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
after the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> do make it manifest: and
in the institution of baptism, our Lord gives the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the covenant unto every <hi>nation,</hi> no lesse then to
the <hi>Iews,</hi> that by covenant whole nations might be
drawn in and given up as disciples to His doctrine,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 29. make all nations disciples by your doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,

                  <p>OF these means we have spoken in the fourth article
of the covenant of Redemption, and need not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
more about them then to name them.</p>
                  <p>The first mean to draw men into this blessed cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and to keep them in it, is the externall revelation
of the will of God, for teaching men how great their
sin and misery is, and how they may be reconciled and
delivered by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
how they may testifie their thankfulnesse (being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled)
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40880:48"/>
for such a mercy; which grounds of saving
knowledge, are fully and faithfully set down in holy
Scripture, and committed to His servants in the minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who should in preaching of the Gospel, inform and
perswade men to repent and imbrace the grace of
Christ, and put on His sweet yoke of obedience upon
them.</p>
                  <p>The second mean is, after application of the Lords
word to the hearers for convincing them of sin in them,
and righteousnesse in Christ, and judgement to follow,
to wit, of absolution of the believer, and of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such as believe not, To receive into the bond
of this covenant of grace, all that appear seriously to
consecrat themselves and their children to the faith and
obedience of the doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ,
without determining whether they be regenerat for the
present or not.</p>
                  <p>The third mean, is the solemn sealing of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
for righteousnesse of faith and salvation through
Christ, by baptizing both the parents that accept the
covenant, and their children also; and by exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
promises and comminations, and all other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which may more and more convince them of
their need of Christ, and duty of following Him, to
fix and strengthen their hearty purpose to cleave unto
the Lord. Such as are, the Lords command to believe
in Christ and love one another, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. and His
threatening, if they believe not, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18. and,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 10. 11.</p>
                  <p>The fourth mean, is the gathering of these that have
imbraced this covenant, into all lawfull and possible
Church-communion with other His disciples, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in their severall congregations, that they may
be edified under their Officers, appointed by Christ in
His Testament in their most holy faith, and obedience
of all His ordinances. And for further clearing the
way of Gods bringing the visible Church of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this covenant with Himself, let it be considered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:40880:48"/>
1. Albeit of those that are come to the use of reason,
with whom God doth formally and solemnly make
this covenant of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>reconciliation,</hi> many are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
only called, and few in comparison chosen,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 21. yet, it is not the will of God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
then by doctrine to separat the elect from the rest
of them that are externally called, or to make the elects
name known to the world: for, the kirk knoweth not,
but God only knoweth who are His, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.
And therefore He hath ordained means common to the
elect and reprobat, to bring both unto the externall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of His covenant, and continuing externally
therein, and He doth bestow gifts both to the one sort
and to the other, and He worketh in both the one sort
and the other according to His own will; But as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and effectuall calling, or speciall saving graces
which do accompany salvation, and the speciall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the holy Spirit, He reserveth to the <hi>elect</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi>
only, to whom in a time acceptable, He reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Himself, and sealeth them for His own service.</p>
                  <p>2. By this wise and holy dealing with the hearers of
the Gospel, whereby the Lord so makes good the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Redemption, and bringeth His decrees to passe,
as none shall have just reason to stumble; no wonder,
that many be compassed within the draught-net of the
Gospel, and be moved to enter into this holy and blessed
covenant, of whom there may be elect, not as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
whereup on by Gods appointment, followeth a
solemn covenanting of all that consent to the condition
of the covenant, and professe their faith in Christ: all
whom (with their children) Christ translates from
the Pagan world, into His visible kingdom and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of His Church militant and grants unto them right
to the common priviledges of Citizens, in the order ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in His word, that keeping all lawfull and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
communion with the Catholick visible Church of
Christ, they may be edified in their particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and governed with others by Ecclesiasticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciplin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:40880:49"/>
3. Together with these externall means, serving for
drawing on the covenant and going on in it, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
operations of God do concur; common to all the
called, both elect and reprobat, and gifts common to
both, are bestowed, such as illumination, morall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
historycall, dogmaticall and temporary faith,
morall change of affections, and some sort of externall
amendment of their outward conversation, <hi>saving grace</hi>
being the speciall gift of God to His own.</p>
                  <p>4. Of this maner of covenanting and taking into
Church-fellowship, all the called that consent in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
way to the condition of the covenant, regenerat and
unregenerat, we have a patern in the Lords covenanting
with all <hi>Israel, Exod.</hi> 19. the covenant is offered to all
the Israelites, without exception; all are invited to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in covenant without exception, arguments, motives
and morall inducements are made use of, from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the Lords goodnesse and gifts given to them
before; most ample promises of spirituall benefits, are
made unto them, conditionally to be bestowed on them
both in this life, and in the life to come, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. 5. 6. the
people embrace the condition of the covenant, <hi>V.</hi> 7. 8.
the people are sanctified, and prepared to receive the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commands and will of God, in the rest of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
then, in the 20. chapter and in the rest of the book,
the duties of the covenanters are propounded, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the acknowledgement of sin and deserved death;
and these also which concern obtaining of justification
and sanctification by Christ, and which concern their
shewing forth their thankfulnesse, all the dayes of their
life.</p>
                  <p>The same covenant, after fourty years, is repeated
and renewed by <hi>Moses,</hi> a little before his death in the
land of Moab, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. the Lord commands <hi>Moses</hi> to
renew the covenant with all the people, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. all the
people of Israel, are gathered together, regenerat and
unregenerat, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. the sum of arguments and motives
to enter in covenant of new, is shortly set down, <hi>vers.</hi> 3.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40880:49"/>
the greatest part of the people to be joyned to God in
covenant, are openly declared by <hi>Moses</hi> to be unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,
<hi>vers.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>After that, arguments are used to move them, in all
time coming, to trust in the Lord and to obey him, to
<hi>vers.</hi> 9. the covenant is made with the heads of the
tribes, and elders of the people, and their governours,
and with all the men of Israel, with their little ones,

any exception made, or exclusion of any that consented
to the covenant, whether unregenerat Israelites or stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but all are admitted within this covenant.</p>
                  <p>The same way of covenanting did <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
admitting to his baptism the seal of this covenant,
all those that came from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and out of all <hi>Iudea,</hi>
and from the borders of <hi>Iordan,</hi> without exception;
whosoever confessed their sins, or that they were sinners,
and professed they did receive the offer of grace, made
in the Name of Christ Jesus, the true lamb of God,
that takes away the sins of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 5, 6.
and so far was <hi>Iohn</hi> from waiting for evidences of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grace and regeneration, before he admitted them
that came to his baptism, into the fellowship of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
covenant of grace and reconciliation, that on the
contrair, he made publick profession, that the fan
whereby the chaff is separated from the wheat, and the
hypocrit discerned from the sincere Christian, was not
in his hand, or in any other man or mens hands, but
in the hand of Christ Jesus Himself only. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(which is worthy to be observed) after he had
publickly testified his suspicion of the hypocrisie and
old poysonabled is position, in the Pharisees and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es
that came to his baptism, and offered to receive the
covenant of grace and the seal thereof, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40880:50"/>
without inquiring into their regeneration and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of heart, he baptized them among the rest, <hi>v.</hi> 11.
and left them to be examined thereafter by Christ Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whether they were upright in heart or not.</p>
                  <p>The same way of gathering members of the visible
Christian Churches out of the world, did Christs own
Apostles follow in His own company, Christ himself
being present bodily, beholding and approving their
baptizing of multitudes, who after hearing of Christs
sermons offered to receive baptism, and went down to
the water <hi>Arnon,</hi> where Christs Apostles did make and
baptize moe disciples then John, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. that is, they
admitted multitudes into the holy covenant, and sealed
the same with baptism, taking no stricter course of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of them then John did, but admitting all that
craved the benefit of the covenant and the seal of it,
though they had no certain evidence of their regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being satisfied, that Christ did not forbid to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
them, when he saw them go down to the water to
be baptized, after hearing His sermon. Now, there is
no question He knew their hearts, all of them, and that
many of them would afterward shortly make defection
from Him, and depart from him, and from his disciples
fellowship, as is plain, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 6, 66, 70.</p>
                  <p>This way of receiving into externall covenant, all
these who receive the offer and the condition of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
without inquiring into their election or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
their regeneration or unregeneration for the
time, (which may be called a covenanting outwardly
and in the letter) in the deep and wise counsell of God,
is appointed for the gathering and constitution of the
visible kirk: for, by this mean, first, God so executeth
and perfecteth the decree of election, that in the mean
time he hindereth none, of all the hearers of the Gospel
from receiving the grace of Christ offered therein. He
excludeth no man from embraceing the covenant; but,
on the contrair, he opens the door to all that are called,
to enter into (as it were) the outer court of his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40880:50"/>
house, that they may so draw more near to him;
and so he doth not <hi>particularly</hi> manifest any mans repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by this means also he hideth the election
of the elect from others, and from themselves till they
repent their sins and flee to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bring forth some
evidences of their election, in their obedience of faith
and begun sanctification.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lord makes use of this outward and
common covenanting with all receivers of the offer, as
a mean to draw the confederat in the letter, to be confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat
in the spirit; for, the faith which he requires as
the condition of the covenant, he worketh in the elect,
if not before, or with the externall covenanting, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
after, in a time acceptable, and that by the
ordinary means, the use whereof is granted to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federat
externally: and so as common illumination is a
mean to that speciall, spirituall and saving illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and dogmaticall or historicall faith, is a mean un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
saving faith; and externall calling, is a mean of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
calling, So externall covenanting in the letter,
is a mean most fit, and accommodat to make a man a
covenanter in the spirit.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this externall covenanting, wherein God
promiseth to be the believers God, and the God of their
children, is a mean not only to beget and foster faith in
the covenanting parents, for their own salvation, but
also a mean to comfort them about the salvation of their
infants, dying in their infancy, whether before or after
their baptism; and a mean to give them good hope of
those childrens blessed resurrection, by vertue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
because in covenanting, the Lord doth promise to
be the believers God, and the God of his children, and
doth not exact the condition of actuall faith from their
dying infants.</p>
                  <p>From these grounds, it followeth, first, that some are
taken externally and conditionally into the covenant,
upon their ingagement unto the righteousnesse of faith,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40880:51"/>
and their baptism is a seal of their ingagement unto it,
who albeit they be not as yet regenerat, yet they are to
be esteemed members of the Church, and Christians out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
Christians by calling, and in the letter, whose
praise is of men, as they were also in the Church before
Christs coming, Jews outwardly and in the letter,
whose praise was of men, commended indeed for so
much: but if they came not up to lay hold upon, and
follow after, righteousnesse by faith, were not Jews in
Gods account, and unto them circumcision was but in
the letter, and the sealing of the <hi>engagement</hi> only, and
not of the good things covenanted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it followeth, that there are some covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
outwardly and inwardly also, in the flesh and in
the spirit also, whose praise is not of men only, but of
God also, to wit, such as not only have engaged to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the condition of living in the faith, and following
after the righteousnesse of faith, but are performers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of their engagement, and unto those their baptism,
is not only outward and in the flesh, but inward also,
in the spirit also, approven of God also. Such as were
in the visible Church of old, Jews inwardly, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of their ingagement to live by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith, Jews in the
spirit and not in the letter only, whose praise was of
God, and not of men only, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it followeth, that some are in the covenant
absolutely, or without condition required of them for
their part, whom God taketh in his own hand absolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
such as are elect infants, dying in their infancy, for
whom, that they might be delivered from originall sin
and deserved wrath, Christ hath ingaged and laid down
his life, and promised in the covenant to be their God;
whom therefore ere they die, he doth immediatly quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and sanctifie, and translateth to heaven after death;
<hi>of such</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>is the Kingdom of heaven,
Mark,</hi> 10. 14.</p>

                  <head>How the externall dispensation of the Covenant of old, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from that which now is under the Gospel.</head>
                  <p>ALbeit the covenant of grace in it self, be one and the
same, from the first preaching of it in Paradise, unto
the end of the world, because Christ the Saviour of his
people, is one and the same, yesterday and to day and
for ever, and because the faith of the elect is of one
kind, and was and shall be to the worlds end; yet, the
external outletting and dispensation of the covenant dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth,
as it was propounded before Christs incarnation
and after it: for, in Paradise this covenant was set forth
by way of promise, (according to the articles of the
covenant of Redemption) that Christ should assume
the seed of the woman, and should suffer in the flesh,
or humane nature, and by his power destroy the works
of the devil, in favours of his own chosen people,
which should militat against the devil under his banner.</p>
                  <p>2. And least any man should fancy, that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace, founded upon this promise, was made
with all the posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the covenant of
works was made with <hi>Adam</hi> and all his posterity the
Lord, in the uttering of the promise, did not direct his
speech unto <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> but to the devil by way of
threatning, and cursing him and his seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat,
in the audience of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> that our first
parents over-hearing the curse of the serpent and his
seed, and the promise of Christs incarnation, in laying
hold upon the promiser by faith, might be justified and
saved as privat persons, after the same way as other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
after them should be justified and saved. This
their faith in Christ, the Lord did foster and augment
by his doctrine taught unto them, and by the prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
typicall sacrifices to be offered in faith to God for
remission of sins: And the Lord did admit their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
into the externall fellowship of this covenant,
without putting difference between one and another
outwardly, as we see in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel:</hi> of which two,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40880:52"/>
the one, to wit, <hi>Cain,</hi> was a covenanter in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sh out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and in the letter only; for he was destitute and
void of saving faith; the other, to wit, <hi>Abel,</hi> was both
outwardly and inwardly a covenanter, not in the letter
only, but in the spirit also, indued with lively, justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and saving faith in Christ to be incarnat, and to die
for his own people, as the Apostle testifieth, reckoning
him up among believers justified by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
                  <p>3. After the flood, God did not make the covenant
with every man, nor with any family by way of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
and formall paction, except <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family
only, of whom the Messiah, God the Mediatour, was
to come according to the flesh; and with him the Lord
confirmed the covenant, by adding unto it the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of circumcision, as the seal of righteousnesse and
justification by faith.</p>
                  <p>4. In the wildernesse at mount Sinai, that the Lord
might make evident the necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y of justification by
faith in Christ to come, he did repeat the law to works;
and to them that did acknowledge their si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> he did set

                     </gap>l of sacrifices
and leviticall types, and the very same is the covenant
now, whereunto Christ and his ministers, laying aside
the vail of the ceremonies, did openly invite their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that acknowledging their sins, and renouncing
confidence in their own power and worth, they should
cast themselves into the arms of Christ the Saviour,
that through him they might obtain justification and
life eternall. We see here indeed a diverse maner of
dispensing, and outward managing the making of the
covenant with men, but the covenant was still the same,
clothed and set forth in a diverse maner, and did no
other wayes differ then and now, but as one and the
self same man differeth from himself, cloathed sutably
one way in his minority, and another way in his riper
age.</p>
                  <p>5. If the covenanters therefore be compared among
themselves in respect of diverse dispensations, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40880:52"/>
in spirit after Christs incarnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
condition, then the believers before Christs coming;
for, the believers before Christ incarnat under the peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogie
of the law, did lye under a servitude and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
as to the outward man, for then the sons and heirs
not come to age, did differ nothing from servants,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1. and in regard of the inward man, they saw
the mystery of salvation, albeit savingly, yet more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely,
for, through the vail they saw the mystery of
salvation to be had by Christ; but after Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Lord dealt more liberally with believers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by their freedom from the leviticall ceremonies,
taking away the vail, they may behold with open face
the glory of the Lord, as in a mirror, and be transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by
the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>6. But as for what concerns the covenanters in the
letter and outwardly only; they are in worse condition
after the coming of Christ, then the literall covenanters
before his incarnation: for, the unregenerat under the
Gospel, are in danger of more heavy judgement, then
the uncircumcised in heart were before Christ came, in
regard it is a greater sin to neglect and despise Christ
speaking from heaven, in the more clear manifestation
of himself in the Gospel, then it was before Christ
came to contemn the darker doctrine of <hi>Moses, Heb.</hi> 2. 3.

                  <head>Concerning the condition of the Covenant.</head>
                  <p>IN receiving or admission of persons, who are come to
the use of reason into the covenant, these three things
are to be observed, and distinguished one from another;
first, the condition of the person, desireing to be in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, for reconciliation and grace through
Christ; 2. The condition upon which he is entered in
covenant; 3. The condition required of him, for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing
of his sincere covenanting.</p>
                  <p>The first condition required of the man who desireth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40880:53"/>
to enter in the covenant of reconciliation, is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of his sins; for, except a man confesse
himself a sinner, and unable to help himself, Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth
him, and will have nothing to do with him, for
Christ hath said, <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to repentance,</hi> Matth. 9. 13.</p>
                  <p>As for the next, the condition of the covenant upon
which the man is received, and whereby the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
a confederat, it is his consent to receive the grace
offered, even Christ with his benefits, as he is holden
forth in the Gospel; or, the condition of the covenant
is faith, receiving Christ for righteousnesse and eternall
life.</p>
                  <p>As for the third, the condition required of the man
now entered in the covenant, for evidenceing the truth
and sincerity of the faith which the covenanter profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it is the taking on him the yoke of Christ, which
he layeth on his confederat people; or, this condition,
is the covenanters up-giving of himself to Christs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and obedience of his commands: and all
these three, are expressed by Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. 29.</p>
                  <p>First, they that labour, and are heavy laden, are they
whom Christ calleth unto a covenant and fellowship of
his grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he propounds the condition of the covenant,
to wit, that they believe in Christ, or <hi>come unto Him,</hi>
that in him they may find full relief from sin and misery,
and in him full righteousnesse and felicity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he requires of them who do embrace him
by faith, and so have accepted the condition of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
that they give evidence of their faith in him,
by taking on of his yoke on them; <hi>take my yoke upon you,</hi>

                  <p>All these three, a covenanter in the letter externally,
will professe to have, and to purpose to follow; but the
true covenanters in spirit, have indeed all the three: for,
true faith in Christ, or the receiving of Christ offered in
the Evangell for justification and salvation, which is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40880:53"/>
the condition of the covenant, presupposeth the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the man who is called to imbrace Christ, and
draweth after it the condition required of the man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting:
for, he that receiveth Christ for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and eternall life, of necessity must acknowledge
himself a man in himself unrighteous, and a lost man,
and that he cometh to Christ to be justified, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and saved by him, and so to persevere in this course
unto life eternall.</p>

                  <head>Of the tearms whereupon this Covenant is offered and

                  <p>
                     <hi>THe terms of the covenant, are diversly propounded in
Scripture,</hi> Exod. 19. 5. <hi>the Lord propounds it thus,</hi>
if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye

                  </p>
                  <p>In these words, the condition required of those that
are already entered in covenant is most eminent; for,
this people was in covenant from the time of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
covenanting, and was admitted to the Sacraments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their coming forth of Egypt; and therefore the
conditions previous to their entering in covenant, and
required for closing the bargain, are not so much insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and give answer to God by Moses, <hi>vers. 8. all that
the Lord hath spoken we will do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another form and expression, is used, <hi>Acts 16. 31.
Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> say to the Jailour, now anxious how to be

and all thy house.</hi> The Jailour accepts of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <p>The condition of his person taking with guiltinesse,

the condition of the covenant therefore is propounded in

                  <p>Likewise the way of making this covenant, is set
forth by Christ, offering himself a Saviour on the one
part, and the believers receiving Christ on the other
part, <hi>Ioh. 1. 11, 12. as many as received him, to them he
gave power to become the sons of God, even to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

                  <p>Last of all, the making of the covenant, is sometime
pressed to be received and followed under the form of a

condition of the making of covenant is propounded,
which is to believe in Jesu, Christ. In the third room,

as he hath commanded us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This offered and commanded condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace, some by the grace of God do accept, and
engage to perform, and do perform sincerely, albeit
weakly; other some, trusting in their own strength,
engage unto the obedience of faith, and with their
mouth professe they are sinners, and do believe in Christ,
and that they will submit themselves to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
drawing near to him with their lips, when their
hearts are far from him; and such mens faith, changeth
not their old disposition and way of living, but it suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them to serve their belly, or mammon, or vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and such other idols; yet because the Church are
not judges of the secrets of the heart, they must receive
into Church-fellowship, all who confesse themselves to
be sinners, and professe they do accept the offer of
Christs grace, and promise subjection to his ordinances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But how can the Church receive men in
Church-fellowship, who are destitute of lively faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Church is not judge of the heart, or of the
secrets thereof, because it cannot see faith in it self, but
must look to the profession of faith, and to the fruits
thereof in the own order and time; the Church is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to their engagement, but not judges of their since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>2. The covenant of grace doth not exclude the most
vile sinners, if they acknowledge their sinfulnesse, and
do solemnly consent unto the condition of the covenant:
because, according to this covenant nothing is bestowed
on the covenanter, of merit, but of grace only, which
the Church knoweth God can give, and sometimes doth
give unto counterfit confederats, making them sincere
in his own time, and that by the means of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40880:55"/>
made use of in the visible Church.</p>
                  <p>3. It is one thing to be a confederat Christian in the
letter, externally in the sight of men; another thing to
be a covenanter in the spirit, inwardly in respect of the
heart and inward man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. and albeit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
covenant doth not bring on righteousnesse and
life, except a man be also a covenanter inwardly in his
heart, in the sense of sin and imperfection, making dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of Christ: yet it is certain, that outward cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting,
is an ordinary and blessed mean unto many,
to beget and foster faith, and help forth the fruits thereof.</p>
                  <p>4. It may and should suffice us, that God, in the
first framing of a nationall Church, did admit, and
commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to admit all the Israelites in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
of whom very few were converted, or reconciled
to God in their spirit; and this was not hid from <hi>Moses,</hi>
or from the truly godly in the camp of Israel, as is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shewen to us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 29. where God bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
against the people, that their heart was not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their profession and engagement: and <hi>Moses</hi>
speaketh out this truth in all the peoples audience, while
he is renewing the covenant with them, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were unregenerat, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But some will insist and tell us, that the visible
Church is a society of Saints or regenerat persons, and
that they who live in the visible Church, must be visible
Saints, whole li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and such as by the judgement of charity we
must esteem regenerat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Christs visible Church, is the company of them
that are called out of the world unto him; the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them that are consecrat to God, and engaged by
solemn covenant to follow the course of holinesse: By
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lling they are Saints, albeit many of them may be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound polluted in their maners: thus doth God Himself
reach us to judge, <hi>Psal. 50. 5. Gather unto me my saints,</hi>
saith He, and who are these? <hi>These who have made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>nant
with me by sacrifice.</hi> Now, of these, many did
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40880:55"/>
not worship God in spirit, but placed all their religion
in ceremonies, and went about by their outward sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to pacifie God, and to expiat their sins, as is plain,
<hi>vers.</hi> 7. 8. others of these <hi>called saints,</hi> consecrat unto
God, and joyned with him in a visible covenant, were
very wicked, who no wayes behaved themselves as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
covenanters with God; and who therefore were
to be excluded from the benefit of the covenant, except
they repented: for, they hated true holinesse, and did
cast the commands behind their back, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. were
thieves and adulterers, slanderers and calumniatours of
their brethren, <hi>vers.</hi> 18, 19. and yet for all this, the
Lord doth not exclude them out of the visible Church,
but doth in a fatherly maner reprove them, that they
might repent and not perish.</p>
                  <p>2. There is no question, whether all in the visible
Church ought to be both in open conversation, and in
heart holy, and that they shall certainly be damned and
perish, that are not such? but the question is here, about
the duty of the Governours of the Church, and of the
godly in it, whether they should exclude from Church-membership
all who are not regenerat, at least so to be
esteemed in the judgement of charity? or, whether all
are to be holden for Church-members, and keeped
within the Church, who are in covenant with God,
and sealed with the seal thereof, to the intent that by
doctrine and censures of the Church (so far as may be
by means) they may be regenerat, and being regenerat,
be helped on in the way of holinesse?</p>
                  <p>3. There is a difference to be put betwixt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
concerning the personall sanctification of every
man in himself, and the precepts given for the governing
of others, and keeping holy society with the <hi>called saints,</hi>
renewed or unrenewed in the visible Church, so far as
Gods word giveth light and order: for, it is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me and thee, that we pursue peace and holiness,
without which none shall see the face of God; but it
is not commanded to me or thee, that we should keep
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40880:56"/>
no Church-fellowship in God's ordinances, except
with the regenerat. It is not commanded to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Church, that they must examine every
person concerning their regeneration; neither are they
forbidden to ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t any into the society of the Church,
save these whom they esteem regenerat: But they are
commanded to bring in to the Church, all that oblige
themselves to be Christs disciples, with their children,
and by the means appointed of God, in doctrine and
censures of the Church, to promove their sanctification
and salvation; for, so many doth Christs commission
to the Pastors of the Church import, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>4. Regeneration is not the just measure, whereby
to square the dimensions and extent of the visible
Church; but, <hi>confederation</hi> and obsignation of the
Covenant by baptisme: For, the Church is Christs
visible kingdom, whose visible subjects are all they
who solemnly are ingaged to subject themselves to his
doctrine and government; and therefore the Church
visible, is not to be defined, the company of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat,
but the company of the confederat with God,
and called unto holiness; among whom, Christ tells
us, there are few elect, and so fewer regenerat; and
therefore the Church of Christ, is compared to a barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floor,
whereinto is gathered both the chaff and the
wheat, both they that have faith and they that profess
faith, out of whom Christ doth gather his own Elect
and redeemed ones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But at least in gathering of a Church out of the
world, respect must be had, that the consenting of the
covenanter be serious; and how can the consent be
serious, where the heart is not sincere, where the
person is not regenerat? Such a mans consent to the
covenant, as is without saving faith, is but fained,
counterfeit, hypocritical, and such a consent as may
hinder the mans regeneration, and do nothing but
provoke Gods wrath against the man and the receivers
or admitters of him also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40880:56"/>
                     <hi>Ans. Serious</hi> is sometime opposed to sport or play,
and so a mater may be serious which is in earnest gone
about, and is not openly histrionical. And sometime,
<hi>serious</hi> is opposed to the intention of fraud and deceit;
and so that may be called <hi>serious,</hi> which is done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a purpose to deceive or beguile the party. But
when the consenter to ingage in covenant, speaketh as
he thinketh, albeit possibly his own heart deceive him,
his consent to the condition of the covenant may justly
be called <hi>serious,</hi> because he intends to deal in earnest,
as in a weighty business. And such was the consent
of the people of <hi>Israel</hi> unto the covenant made with
God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, <hi>counterfeit</hi> and <hi>hypocritical,</hi> is sometime
called so, in opposition to that which is reall, true and
spiritual: And so all consent to the covenant of Grace,
which doth not proceed from the spirit of Regeneration
is but fained faith, and indeed is not saving faith; yet,
it may be <hi>serious</hi> and morally honest, like Israels, <hi>Exod.
14.</hi> 20. and so sufficient to make a covenant, and to
tye an obligation on the man to such duties as may lead
to salvation.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>fained,</hi> connterfeit, hypocritical, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that which a man purposely doth fain, making
shew of that which he knows not to be, being consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to his own wickedness; and such a fained consent,
we grant, doth provoke God against such a person;
but the Church is not judge of this, so long as they
know not of this gross hypocrisie.</p>
                  <p>We hold then, that there may be, and usually fall
forth, such a morall consent unto the covenant of
Grace without saving faith, which may be called a
<hi>serious,</hi> really honest consent, as to the agreement of
the mind and mouth of the covenanter, such as is
found in ordinary civil contracts, between one man
and another, and must be acknowledged to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Church-covenanting with God, and with the
rest of the members of the Church: and so the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40880:57"/>
in respect to the making a covenant, is not fained,
neither is it displeasing unto God in the own kind, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it be not sufficient or acceptable to God unto the
persons salvation: For, so much doth God himself
testifie <hi>(Deut. 5.)</hi> speaking of the Israelits (who were
ignorant of the deceitfulness of their own heart, and
of their inability to perform what they promised) he
saith, (<hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29.) <hi>They have well said, all that they have
spoken.</hi> Therefore unto the tying a man in this bond
of the covenant, this morall honesty, is sufficient,
albeit to salvation it is not sufficient, but in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a mean of God's appointment.</p>
                  <p>Now, that there is such a thing as we call morall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
or honesty, which differeth from the true
Christians spiritual honesty, or sincerity, it is plain
from these places of Scripture, which speak of
this integrity of heart in such persons as were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
because they intended no other thing then they
pretended. Thus <hi>Abimelech</hi> excuseth himself to God
when he took away <hi>Sarah, Abrahams</hi> wife from him,
thinking <hi>Sarah</hi> had been his sister and not his wife, <hi>Gen,</hi>
20. 6. <hi>In the integrity of my heart and innocency of my

to be true, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. So also the captains
that came with their companies to <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Ziklag,</hi> are
said to have a perfect heart, because they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
honest, and resolved, as they professed, upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make <hi>David</hi> King, and to help him in the war,
and not betray him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 33. 38.</p>

                  <head>Of the sundry wayes of mens framing of the covenant

                  <p>AS we told there was a covenant of works, one tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so called of Gods institution; and another false
sort of covenant of works, of mans framing: So it is
also in the mater of the covenant of Grace, there is
one truly so called, and another sort false and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
of mans framing. That which is of Gods fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40880:57"/>
is the covenant, that God makes with the
Church, for giving righteousness and life by faith in
Jesus Christ: that which we call a counterfeit cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
is the covenant, which men frame unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon any other condition then faith: Such was
the counterfeit covenant of the false apostles, who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Gospel-covenant among the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
whereof the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6, 7.
challenging them, that they had forsaken God, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them to the grace of Christ, and were turned over
to another Gospel, that is, to another covenant of grace,
then the true one, which is only one, and not various,
but by the troublers of the Church was changed into
another frame; for, the true covenant, was perverted
and corrupted by these who went about to joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Justification by works, and Justification by grace
through faith in Christ: which two sorts of covenant,
are inconsistent, and do mutually overthrow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
So also did the Pharisee (<hi>Luke,</hi> 18. 11, 12.) cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and pervert both the covenant of works and the
covenant of grace; he corrupted and perverted the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, because he put up to God some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
good works for the perfect obedience of the law;
and he perverted the covenant of grace, because albeit
he did acknowledge the grace of God, and gave him
thanks for giving him ability and power to do good
works, and for infusing habits of piety and justice in
him; yet, he exalted himself, and took the thanks
and praise to himself who had made good use of these

am not like other men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. Like unto this fault, is the errour of many, of
whom some makes the <hi>act of faith</hi> brought forth by
the power of <hi>natural free-will,</hi> to be the condition of
the covenant, contrary to the doctrine of the Gospel,
which makes saith infused, to be the gift of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
its own righteousness and the merit of all
works also, and resting on Christ, to be the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40880:58"/>
For, the sentence of the Apostle, standeth firm
and unmovable, <hi>Rom. 11. 16. If it be by grace, it is no
more of works,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Other some make this the condition of the covenant,
that Christ should pay for mortal sins by his own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
sufferings, and so take away everlasting punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but will have the sinner himself to pay for veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sins by temporal sufferings, partly in this life and
partly in purgatory.</p>
                  <p>Other some dream of framing the covenant of grace
thus, if a man do all the good he is able, and hath a
will to serve God better then before, they conceive,
that God must take the will for the perfect dead, and
so for good payment.</p>
                  <p>Which counterfeit conditions, and other such like
inventions of self-pleasing conceits, are all of them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the adulterating both of the covenant of
works, and of the covenant of grace appointed of God,
by which inventions men deceive themselves to their
own perdition.</p>
                  <p>Now, that such perverting of the covenant of works
and of grace, are rife &amp; frequent among men, experience
may prove: For, before Christs coming, this was the
way of carnal Israelits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30.
For <hi>they being ignorant of the righteousness of God, went
about to establish their own inherent righteousness, and
would not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.</hi>
And of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> it is said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:40880:58"/>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> No: for, albeit by so doing they prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be corrupters and falsifiers of their covenant,
to their own perdition, if they repent not; yet they
stand obliged still before God to their covenant sealed
in baptism: For, the covenant of God with man,
cannot be dissolved by mens treachery, and without
Gods consent, not only because the covenant of God,
with men, in regard of the perpetual equity thereof,
hath in it a perpetual obligation, but also because
the soveraign dominion of God, hath the force of a
law to oblige them whom God hath taken in among
his people, that being once his confederat subjects,
they should remain still his subjects: For, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
was a seal of covenanted righteousness by faith,
So baptism is a seal of the same covenanted righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by faith, whether the covenanters remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
unto their covenant or not, as we see in the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits,
who albeit they were polluted with idolatry in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and albeit they proved rebellious in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and in the land of promise were found often guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of breach of covenant; yet, still in the Scripture
they are called God's people, and the Lords interest
and right in them, stood fast, and their right also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the external priviledges of the citizens of God's
kingdom, remained fast also, untill the time that for
their open and obstinat rejecting of Christ, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the kingdom were cast out and were broken off
the true olive tree: So also, the obligation of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
who turn the true covenant of grace in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>her
of their own framing, doth still stand, tying them to
perform the condition of the true covenant: and their
right to the external priviledges of the confederat, doth
remain still in some sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even when they are inter-dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the honourable possession thereof by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:

(albeit not as to their present ecclesiastick condition)
citizens and members of the Church, and subject
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40880:59"/>
to Jurisdiction ecclesiastick, and to Christs discipline;
because when they are judged, and are under censure,
they are said to be within the Kirk, and not without it,
1 <hi>Cor. 5. 12. What have I to do to judge also them that are
without? do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> And these
that were delivered unto Sathan, as to their present
external condition, remained notwithstanding, as to
their external state, the domesticks of God, under the
discipline of God's house, and were pressed by the
censure laid on them, to learn to cease from their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
course, and specially from these faults for which
they were censured and corrected by their excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Alexander
<hi>were given over to Sathan, that they might learn not to
blaspheme;</hi> that is, that being humbled and brought
to repentance they might return to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the truth and to a reverent speaking of holy
things, and so the right to be counted brethren and
members of the Church (albeit under censure, restraint
and dis-respect till they repented) was not taken alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

yet were the private duties of charity, due to brethren
in that fearfull condition, to be altogether denied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, even when the possession of the former ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of blamelesse brethren, was taken from them;
for, the Apostle will have them, albeit excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,
to be esteemed still censured brethren, and not
looked upon as enemies, <hi>

and this is so much the more carefully to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the constitution of the visible Church of such

from Church-society, and so despair of returning to the
full possession of their priviledges, but might know,
that the right of citizens of the city of God, was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unto them, and was to be restored by way of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
after their repentance, and that they were not cut
off from the Christian charity of the brethren, no not
when they were lying under the sentence, that they
might so much the sooner return to repentance and to
the possession of their Ecclesiastick honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But here there ariseth a greater doubt and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
how, and upon what reason God doth require
the condition of faith, which men cannot perform, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be given of God, as the Apostle testifieth, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
2. 8. <hi>you are saved of grace by faith, and that not of your
selves, it is the gift of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The equity of the duty required, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon mens present power or strength, of whom
the condition is required, but upon this ground, that
ability was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to his posterity in him:
for, all injoyned service, and so the duty of believing in
Christ, is founded upon mans naturall obligation to
obey the morall law; for, by vertue of the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Adam</hi> was bound, and we in him, not only to
believe the word of God already revealed unto him,
but to believe also every word of God to be revealed,
and he was bound to give unto God the glory of all his
attributes, not only of these which already did shew
forth themselves in his works, but also of these attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
which as yet did not put forth themselves in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
exercise: for as it cannot be denied, that man was
bound to give God the glory of his avenging justice,
upon his threatning to inflict the punishment of death
in case man should sin, albeit he could not see the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it before he fell; So also it is manifest, he was
bound to give God the glory of his goodnesse and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
albeit no object of shewing mercy was yet to be
found: and that partly, because it was his duty to give
the glory of all perfections unto God, whereof <hi>mercy</hi> is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40880:60"/>
one; and partly, upon the experience he had of Gods
manifested goodnesse in his creation, and Gods making
a covenant with him about eternall life, upon so easie
and equitable tearms: upon the same ground, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fall, <hi>Adam</hi> was bound not to despair, nor flye,
nor hide himself from God, from whom it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
he could escape.</p>
                  <p>It cannot then be reasonably denied, but man by the
law of nature, is bound to give credit to God when he
speaketh, and bound to trust in God when He offereth
himself as a friend and a father to him, and when God
bids him seek his face, he is bound to obey him, and
seek his face, and to follow after more and more near
communion with him.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity, could
not formally and actually believe in God as a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
partly, because this mystery was not yet revealed;
partly, because he, not having yet sinned, had not need
of a Redeemer or of remission of sin; but yet, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and ability of believing in God, according as God
should let forth his will, and the power to adhere unto
God, and rest on his goodnesse and good-will, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to man in his creation: for, this perfection was a
part of the image of God, wherein man was created,
even as the habit of shewing mercy on the miserable
(though such an object was not to be found, while
man continued in the state of innocency) was a part of
that original holinesse in him; and if this ground hold
not, sinners by their sinning once, should make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
free to sin for ever after, and exempt themselves
from all the duties of the morall law, upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that they were unable to give obedience to it,
which is most unreasonable. And, 2. Because the
hearers of the Gospel esteem themselves able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the condition of the covenant of grace offered,
and to believe in Christ, yea and to give credit, or not,
to what is preached unto them, as they see reason; is it
not equitable then to put all men to it, who judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40880:60"/>
able to perform what is required; to the end that
after experience, and tryall taken of themselves, they
should either acknowledge their naturall inability to
believe in Christ, and so go seek of God the gift of faith,
or else be destitute of all excuse, if they shall not do
what they conceive and professe themselves able to do?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is equitable to crave faith from them who
are able to promise morally the obedience of faith, and
are able to use the externall means leading unto true
faith; for, the Lord Himself followed this way in his
covenanting with the Israelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. where the
Lord propounds the condition of the covenant, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
to be their God, if they should hearken to His
voice, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. 6. the people did accept the condition,
and undertook to perform it, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. 8. and upon these
tearms the covenant was made with them morally, in
an externall way, which did bind the obligation fast
upon them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by preaching of the covenant of grace,
God doth ordinarly bestow grace, and grace for grace,
on the redeemed in a time acceptable; and in craving
the condition, the Lord giveth grace to accept the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and to perform it; and this course is very su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to Gods soveraignty or supremacy, sutable to His
wisdom and his justice, and sutable to the freedom of
his grace: for, it becometh the absolute supremacy of
God, and the liberty of His most holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will, to send the
Gospel only to whom He will; it becometh his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where ever He doth send the Gospel, to make of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of grace indifferently to all the hearers, whether elect
or reprobat, that all may be tryed, whether they please
to receive the offer or not; It becometh his justice to
withhold grace from such as refuse the offer of it; and
it becometh his wisdom, mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grace, truth and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
both to exact from the elect, for whom Christ did
satisfie, the performance of the condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and in the mean time, by the offer of grace, to
make them sayingly to believe, using the command of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40880:61"/>
believing in Christ for a fit mean to beget faith: hence
it is, that saving faith is given only to the elect; which
faith therefore, is called the <hi>faith of the elect, Tit.</hi> 1. 1.
Hence it is, that the elect are called <hi>heirs of the promises,
Gal.</hi> 3. 29. and <hi>children of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>omise,</hi> Heb. 6. 17. part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because they are the children promised to be brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10. partly, because by the promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
they are regenerat to a new life, and by believing in
Christ, they obtain righteousnesse and eternall life: for,
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. they are called <hi>begotten again, not of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
seed, but of the incorruptible seed of the word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> If it be asked, since faith is so necessary, what
is the object of faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> We answer, the truth of God revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or God speaking in Scripture, and promising eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life upon conditions holden forth in these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
among these promises, some pertain to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works, such as, <hi>Gal. 3. 12. do this and live:</hi> and,
Matth. 19. 17. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi>
and sundry other particular promises of
blessings, both spirituall and temporall annexed unto
the promulgation of the Law; which promises do
serve to encourage them to make good their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
if they be able, as they conceive they are, and to
humble them when they shall find by experience, that
neither threatning nor promises can make them to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
that law. Beside the promises annexed to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, there are other promises, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the covenant of reconciliation, and tend to the
making men embrace the covenant of grace, and to
continue therein, such as these which are propounded
in the Gospel, for giving unto the believer all the sure
mercies of <hi>David,</hi> and the benefits purchased by Christ.
And of this sort, some are more generall, some more
speciall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some of them belong to this life, some of them
to the life to come: for, true godlynesse comprehending
faith and the fruits of it, hath the promises both of this
life, and of the life to come: of all these promises, the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40880:61"/>
foundation and fountain is the covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(whereof we have spoken, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.) wherein Christ
promiseth to the Father to do his will, and the Father
promiseth to Christ as Mediatour and head of the
Church, in favours of the redeemed, that he shall see
his seed and be satisfied, and the pleasure of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Lord shall prosper in his hand: upon this covenant of
Redemption, all the promises, made to the Church,
do depend, whether they be absolute promises, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conditional promises, whether qualified promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which are like unto conditionall. Absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
we call (for example) such as do promise abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
the taking away the heart of stone and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the Elect, and their perseverance and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Ier. 31. 31, 32. &amp;c.</hi> and 32. <hi>ver.</hi> 40. Such are
the promises of gathering, edifying propagating and
perpetuating of the Christian Church to the worlds
end, as <hi>Math. 16. 18. Upon this rock I will build my
Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</hi>
Which sort of promises, do serve to move men to come
and embrace Christ; and after men have fled to
Christ, in whom all the promises are Yea and Amen,
the believer may make application and comfortable use
of all the precious promises of righteousness and eternal
life, set forth in the Gospel. Conditionall promises
are such, as make offer of Christ and reconciliation to
the hearers of the Gospel, upon this condition, that
in the sense of sin and fear of wrath, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lye to Christ
as the only and sufficient remedy of sin and misery.
Qualified promises like unto conditionall, are these
that have in them some qualification of the person who
is already a believer, and do seem to make that qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
or designation of the believer to be a condition
of the blessing promised therein: which promises, if
they be well considered do pre-suppone the qualified
person, to whom the promise is made, to be both a
believer and also to be evidently endued with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
quality; as for example, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. Blessed are
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40880:62"/>
the mercifull, the peace-maker, the meek, the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
the poor, the sufferer of persecution for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
or for Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which vertues, if the person be
not a believer in Christ, do as yet signifie nothing in
him, nor do not intitle the man to this Gospel-blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and being the designations of believers, they
give the persons endued therewith, encouragment to
go on and encrease in that grace and all other graces,
that they may thereby more and more give evidence of
their being reall believers: Such also are the promises
which are made to the confident waiters on God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycers
in God, lovers and fearers of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In
which promises, grace for grace to be derived out of
the fulness of Christ, is promised to the believer. Some
promises design fit persons to enter in covenant, and do
invite them to come to Christ, Such as are, <hi>come unto
me all ye that are weary and heavy loaden,</hi> Math. 11. 28.
And <hi>Ho! every one that thirsts, come to these waters,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 55.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And besides these promises which contain the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the covenant, made to them who embrace the
condition, and do already believe, such as is,</hi> they that
believe in me, shall not perish, but shall inherit eternall life;
<hi>there are also promises</hi> conditional, <hi>serving to make men
who profess faith in Christ to be reall and stedfast in
the covenant wherein they are at least outwardly, and
solemnly entered, such as,</hi> Ioh. 15. 7, 10. If ye abide
in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will,
and it shall be done unto you, and if ye keep my commands, ye
shall abide in my love, <hi>&amp;c. And,</hi> Ioh. 12. 26. If any
man serve me, him will my father honour; <hi>and,</hi> Ioh. 14.
21. he that loveth me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall be loved of my father; and I
will love him and manifest my self unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Seing it is certain, that the condition of the
covenant of grace, is not the doing of one or moe
works, but faith receiving Christ offered, without
respect to our works, as any part of the condition; and
seing the condition of the covenant, is not the having,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40880:62"/>
or exercising of such and such vertues, but the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Christ through faith unto righteousness and
eternal life, by the man who hath renounced all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in his own works; how <hi>cometh</hi> it to pass, that
such conditionall promises are made to them that are
indued with, and do exercise, such vertues?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Albeit the endeavour to work good works, or
the exercise of such and such vertues prescribed by
Christ, cannot be the condition of the covenant (for
then no man could close covenant with Christ till first
he shall find these vertues in himself, and have given
proof of his constant exercise thereof) yet such conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
promises are made use of after a man hath closed
covenant with Christ by faith, as conditions required
in a true believer, to evidence the sincerity of his faith.
And that because many make pretense of their faith in
Christ, and yet do turn the grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and do no wayes set themselves to new obedience
unto God law, and are no wayes careful to bring
forth fruits suitable to professed repentance, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
to their vitious and fleshly lusts, and in effect
do renounce all endeavour to exercise good works in
stead of renouncing a carnall confidence in good
works: Therefore God doth put the endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
Christian vertues on all professed believers, as a
condition distinguishing a sincere believer from an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrit,
least any man should please himself, because
he is externally in the covenant of Grace, while, it
may be, as yet his faith is but a dead faith, not work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by love: Against which sort of pretended belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Iames (chap.</hi> 2.) disputeth. Such conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are directed toward them that are outwardly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in covenant, and do serve for these severall
uses.</p>
                  <p>First, that such as both profess faith in Christ and
are endeavouring the duties required in such conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
promises, may acknowledge, that they have
obtained of the Lord grace for grace, grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40880:63"/>
and grace to bring forth the fruits of faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the honest hearted may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
te set upon these duties, and may hope to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for them, out of the rich fountain of Christs
grace, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they serve to make such as believe in Christ,
when they feel the in-lake of any such commanded du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or the bitter root of any vice in themselves, to
humble themselves in the sense thereof, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to flye
more earnestly to Christ the Redeemer, that first they
may be covered with his righteousness, and then from
him receive the power of the holy Ghost, to bring
forth good fruits, as he hath promised, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 5.
<hi>If ye abide in me, ye shall bring forth much fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they serve to make believers in Christ sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
themselves to the order of the operation of the holy
Ghost who giveth grace for grace, and worketh one
grace before another in his own order, as the foresaid
promises do import</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they serve to stir up believers in Christ, to
the love and exercise of such and such vertues, in the hope
of the promised reward.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, they serve to move believers to joyn one
vertue to another, for certifying themselves of their
own calling and election by their growth therein,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. 12.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, they serve to make these who are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
and void of such qualifications, and are careless to
have them, manifest to themselves and others, that they
<hi>are blind, and cannot see a far off: and that they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
that they were in baptism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ecclesiastically purged form
their old sins,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> How can this offer of grace to all the hearers of
the Gospel, and the solemn making of a covenant with
all that profess they do accept of the offer, stand with
the doctrine of election of some, and reprobation of
others, or, with the doctrine of Christs redeeming of
the El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct only, and not of all and every man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:40880:63"/>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The election of some and reprobation of others,
was made clear of old by Gods making offer of grace
unto, and covenanting with, one nation only, and
not with any other. <hi>Psa. 147. 19, 20. He shewed his
word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his statutes and his judgments unto</hi> Israel;
<hi>he hath not dealt so with any nation, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> as for his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they have not known them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. And the offer of grace to all hearers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and covenanting with all that profess to accept the
offer, do consist with the election of some only, as
well now as of old when God made a covenant exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and conditional with all <hi>Israel,</hi> of whom the
great part were not elected to life, and of whom it is
said, <hi>albeit they were in number as the sand of the sea, yet
a remnant of them only were to be saved</hi> Isa. 10. 22. For,
by this course, God was not frustrat of his purpose and
fruit of his covenanting with the mixed multitude of
Israelits; for, the Elect by faith obtained righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and life, <hi>but the rest were blinded,</hi> Rom. 11. 7.</p>
                  <p>3. This common offer of grace to all the hearers of
the Gospel and the making of a morall covenant with
all that do profess that they accept the offer, may stand
with the doctrine of Christs redeeming the Elect only,
no less now, then of old, when Christ did make offer
of grace to them that were not his sheep, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 26.
and did receive sundry in among his disciples in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
covenant, who did afterward forsake him, <hi>Ioh.
6.</hi> 66. but yet he did save, and doth save all his Elect
sheep whom <hi>the father hath given unto him,</hi> Joh. 10. 65.</p>
                  <p>And however this doctrine soundeth harsh in the
ears of many, when they hear of any reprobat or not
elected, or when they hear that Christ did not lay
down his life for all and every man, but for the Elect
only, and proud men cannot submit themselves to
the truth; yet this doctrine, is found to be most true:
for, Christ the Redeemer, teacheth us, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 14.
<hi>that many are called and few are chosen.</hi> And the Apostle
teacheth us the same, for (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 15.) he citeth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40880:64"/>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> to prove the point; <hi>I will have mercy on whom I
will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will
have compassion;</hi> and, <hi>ver. 18. God hath mercy on whom

the Evangelist (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 37, 38, 39, 40.) teacheth us,
that there is a number, to whom God hath decreed not
to give grace to believe in Christ, albeit they shall
hear him preached unto them, from <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. but
to the Elect only, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. And, <hi>chap.</hi> 53. 1. he
teacheth, that few shall believe in Christ, yea, none
save the Elect, to whom the arm of the Lord shall be
revealed. And our Lord Jesus teacheth the same, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
6. 37, 44. that all the Elect shall come to him, and
that no moe then the father shall powerfully draw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, can come unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But there is another forged way of propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this covenant which sundry learned men hold
forth, who have made many disciples and followers of
their opinion, because of the seeming plausibleness of
their doctrine: wherein they teach, that Christ Jesus
hath died not only for all sorts of men, but also for all
and every man, as well for them that perish as for
them that are saved; and that albeit he hath not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
righteousness and life eternal determinatly to
any man, yet he hath purchased by this universal
redemption, power to every mans free-will, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ and persevere in his obedience, without
any speciall operation of the holy Spirit in one more
then another. And this power of mans free-will,
wherewith every child of <hi>Adam</hi> they say is born, they
call by the name of <hi>universall grace,</hi> albeit in effect it is
nothing but <hi>universall unrenewed nature,</hi> common to
every man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> We answer, how learned soever the teachers
of such doctrine seem to be, yet in this doctrine they
are not taught of God: Over such mens learning and
wisdom, Christ doth glory (<hi>Math.</hi> 11. 25.) saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>I thank thee, O father, Lord of heaven and earth, because
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40880:64"/>
thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them to babes: even so Father, for so it seemed
good in thy sight.</hi> Therefore of such doctrine we say,
that it is false, and contrair unto Scripture, how plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
so ever it seem to proud sinners, yea it is a mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ, and an hinderance of mens repentance
and conversion unto God.</p>
                  <p>1. Their doctrine is contrair to Scripture, because
contrair to the covenant of Redemption wherein the
Father and the Son Mediatour, are agreed upon the
persons to be redeemed, to wit, the elect only, given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Son to be redeemed; and agreed upon the price
of their Redemption, to wit, the obedience of Christ,
even to the death of the crosse; and agreed upon the
graces and gifts to be given to the elect, to wit, all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
graces, as faith, repentance, perseverance, and
whatsoever belongs to righteousnesse and eternall life;
and agreed upon the means and way of gathering in the
redeemed, out of all tongues and kindreds and nations,
prudently and prosperously, as is proven from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 4. and shall be more confirmed in the next
following chapter.</p>
                  <p>2. Their doctrine it mocketh Christ, because it char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
Christ with folly in His making covenant so, as
neither Gods justice nor mans common wisdom, would
allow, to lay down the price of his blood, and not be
sure who should be saved by his blood, to pay as much
for <hi>Iudas</hi> as for <hi>Peter,</hi> to redeem all and every man, and
yet put the disposing of the benefit of Redemption, and
fruit of his death out of his own hand, into the hand
of mens free-will, to make of it something or nothing
as they pleased; to buy a possibility unto men to save
themselves actually, without the speciall grace of the
holy Ghost, and to cut himself off from having the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the actuall conversion of sinners, as far as he is
from the blame of mens remaining in sin and infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for, they say he hath purchased alike power to all
and every mans free-will, to beleeve or remain in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40880:65"/>
as they please; if they use it ill, bear they the
blame; if they use it well, they have the praise. They
make him to lay down his life for all and every man,
and to purchase unto all and every one, power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him, and yet never to purpose to make offer of
the Gospel to the thousand part of men. These and
many moe blemishes they cast by their doctrine upon
the wisdom and power, and grace of our Lord Jesus,
who is infinitely wise and holy in all his doings.</p>
                  <p>3. This doctrine is a great hinderance of mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and conversion unto God, and to the exercise
of all holy duties; for, whosoever believeth this their
doctrine, he cannot renounce nor deny his own wit,
worth, and ability, that he may come humbly unto
Christ and follow him, but he must stand to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of himself, which this doctrine teacheth him: yea,
such a man cannot say to God in humble and hearty
prayer, <hi>open mine eyes, that I may behold the wonders of thy
Law, and teach me thy statutes;</hi> he cannot in earnest say
with <hi>David, incline my heart to thy testimonies, and not unto
covetousnesse:</hi> for, he hath (in his conceit) this power
of free-will in himself, by common gift to every man,
he cannot heartily thank God (if he seem to himself
to do any good) for giving him both to will and to
do of his good pleasure; for, this he hath in his own
hand, as this deceitfull doctrine perswadeth him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But some there are who maintain the decree of
Redemption, and covenant between God and Christ
(which in substance, is one with the decree) to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
concerning the powerfull and invincible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
perseverance and salvation of the elect; but
concerning the rest of the world, they tell us of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall
decree of saving every one who shall believe
in Christ Jesus, which doth make some difference
from what is said before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> There is indeed an offer to be made to all the
hearers of the Gospel, to whom God in his providence
doth send his messengers, who are appointed to make
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40880:65"/>
offer of peace and reconciliation through Christ, upon
condition of hearty receiving it, even to such as the
Lord knoweth will reject the offer altogether; against
whom, his sent messengers, are to shake off the dust of
their feet, for a witnesse against them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 13.
14. 15. which accordingly was done by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,
Acts,</hi> 13. 46. 51. and our Lord made offer of
himself to his covenanted people the Jews, who did not
receive him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 11, 12. and this is to be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to one of the articles of the covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
concerning the prudent way and maner of
Christs singling forth his own elect, from the rest of
the world; But this doth no wayes import, or infer,
an universall conditionall Redemption or any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
decree of God: for, there is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a <hi>conditionall decree</hi> of God, and a <hi>decree</hi> for
bringing about Gods purpose, by offering peace unto
men <hi>upon a condition.</hi> A conditionall decree presuppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that God is not resolved what to do about them to
whom he shall make offer of peace upon condition, but
that he doth suspend the determination of his own
will, till the offer be made, and the man hath refused
or accepted of the condition propounded unto him;
which sort of decree cannot be in God, to whom are
known all his own works, and all mens works from
the beginning, <hi>Acts,</hi> 15. 18. and <hi>who doth all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the determinat counsell of his own will, Ephes.
1.</hi> 11. But a decree to offer peace, upon condition of
believing in Christ, is a wise mean both of hiding and
executing his own secret decree, and puting the persons
to whom he makes the offer unto tryall; that after the
drawing forth of the naturall enimity and backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which is in all men to come unto Christ, till they
be drawn by God, He may have mercy on whom He
will, and take the refuse at the hands of others for the
glory of His justice and grace, according as He hath
determined in Himself. The one way determineth
man, as God willeth; the other way determineth God,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40880:66"/>
as man willeth. Moreover such a conditionall decree
concerning all the rest of mankind, beside the elect, is
inconsistent with the Scripture, and the way of Gods
dispensation toward the most part of mankind: for,
it was not Gods purpose to make the offer of grace, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition of believing in Christ, to all and every
man, <hi>Psal. 147. 19. 20. He sheweth his word unto Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
His statutes and His judgments unto Israel, He hath not
done so with any nation. And as for His judgments they
have not known them.</hi> This same doth <hi>Moses</hi> insinuat,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 7, 8. and for his dispensation, experience in all
ages sheweth, that the grace of the Gospel, is not offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all and every one, and so they cannot be said to
refuse the condition, who never have the offer of grace
upon condition; for, our Lord giveth us ground so to
reason, speaking of them who should refuse the offer of
the Gospel, <hi>Iob. 15. 22. if I had not come and spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, they had not had sin,</hi> (to wit, the guiltinesse of
rejecting the offer made in the Gospel) <hi>but now they
have no cloak for their sin.</hi> Wherein also he giveth a
reason wherefore the offer is made to them, whom he
knew would refuse the offer, to wit, that they may be
rendered inexcusable, and be without the cloak or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of this alleageance, that if they had gotten the
offer, then would they have believed and repented: for,
this is the pride of <hi>Adams</hi> posterity, they conceive they
can believe and obey God, if he shall be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
His will to them. And this is sutable to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Redemption; which, because it was not
made for the saving of all and every man, therefore it
was not Gods purpose to reveal his Gospel, and make
offer of his grace to all and every one, but out of all
sorts of men to call effectually the elect, sending the
Gospel where they live, or bringing them to the place
where the Gospel is preached, that the predestinat
might be of purpose effectually called, and justified and
sanctified and saved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 30. and because the
elect and predestinat were to live in the civil society of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40880:66"/>
the rest of the world, it was agreed and decreed, that
the offer of the Gospel, should be made to all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
where God should send his messengers, because
God had determined to bring about the salvation of
the elect, so wisely and holily, as none of the hearers of
the Gospel should be stumbled, or hindered from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
the offer made to all the hearers indifferently,
without letting any man know of his election, till he
have received Christ offered to him and other self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
sinners, or declaring any man reprobat in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
to whom he maketh offer of grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But except we grant an universal redemption
and the universal grace (as they call it) of the power
of free-will to all and every man, how shall we satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our selves about Gods dispensation toward them,
who live without the Church, strangers and aliens
from the commonwealth of <hi>Israel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> As for the elect among them, either they shall
be brought to the hearing of the Gospel where it is
preached, or the Gospel shall be sent unto them where
they do live; and for the rest, the Lord dealeth with
them on the terms of the covenant of works, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of keeping whereof, albeit they have lost in <hi>Adam,</hi>
yet they are not loosed from the obligation and penalty
of violating thereof, and even they have not laid aside
the proud opinion of their ability to follow vertue, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shew vice as they please. And the course which
God followeth concerning them, the Apostle sheweth
us, <hi>Rom. 2. 12, 13, 14, 15. As many as have sinned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the written law</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall perish without the law,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>for, when the gentiles which have not the law</hi> (to wit,
the written law given to the Church) <hi>do by nature the
things of the law; these having not the law, are a law to
themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But if the doctrine of redemption of the elect
only unto life, be maintained, and power of free-will
to believe and obey the Gospel, be not given to
every man, specially of these that have the offer of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40880:67"/>
Gospel, and that without any speciall operation of the
holy Ghost, how can it be said, that God dealeth just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in earnest and fairly, with miserable sinners, when
he exhorts, requests and obtests all that hear the Gospel,
to come to Christ, and persevere in obedience of the
faith, when he knoweth that none of them have power
to believe or obey, and that to many of them he hath
no purpose ever to give grace to repent and believe that
they may be saved?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, what can the patrons of the power of
mens free-wil, speak against the justice and goodnesse
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they hear his complaint against Israel,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 8, 9, 10. &amp;c. <hi>Hear O my people, and I will testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
unto thee O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me, there
shall be no strange God in thee, neither shalt thou worship
any strange god; I am the Lord thy God, which brought
thee out of the land of Egypt; open thy mouth wide, and
I will fill it; but my people would not hearken to my voice,
and Israel would none of me, So I gave them up to their own
hearts lust, and they walked in their own counsels.</hi> What
can they say against Gods justice and fair dealing,
when he, having drawn forth to light, by his long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
preaching of his word, the obstinat enimity of
the reprobat multitude against him, opened up his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
against all that sort in the sad message committed
to Isaiah, <hi>Chap. 6. 9, 10. Go and tell this people, hear ye
indeed, and understand not; see ye indeed, but perceive not:
make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
and shut their eyes, least they see with their eyes, and hear
with their ears, and understand with their heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
and be healed,</hi> vers. 13. <hi>yet there shall be a tenth part,
the holy seed,</hi> (to wit, the elect) <hi>shall be the substance
thereof?</hi> And of this prophesie use is made, when the
multitude of misbelievers was like to obscure the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christ, <hi>Iob. 12. 37, 38. to</hi> 42. they heard the
offer of grace preached by Christ himself, and saw his
manifold wonders, yet they believed not, neither could
they believe, because God had rejected them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40880:67"/>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> doth prove from the prophesie of <hi>Isaiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Is it not fair dealing, when the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
that his word shall be preached, and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
manifested (for the elects cause, albeit they were
but as a tenth part) to a cursed and reprobat multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
who should hear and see without his blessing, and
in his dispensation, doth in effect as he hath professed?
As it is a reasonable answer of a husband man and
Gardener to his child, asking him, why he beats the
whole sheaf and watereth all the Garden, seing the
sheaf is most part straw and chaff, and the garden full
of weeds, to say to his child, that he beats the sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>af,
that he may sever the corn from the straw and chaff,
and that he watereth the ground, where herbs and
weeds do grow together, that he may make both to
come up above ground, and after that, may pull out
the weeds, and foster the herbs for the masters use?
So it is a reasonable answer to such as cavil against the
preaching of the Gospel, to a mixed multitude of elect
and reprobat, to say that the Gospel is preached to
both, for the conversion of the elect, and bringing to
light the hatred of the reprobat against God, and the
offer of his grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we grant the Lord knoweth mens wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and inability to obey his commands, and their
naturall enimity against him; but he knoweth also,
that all men by nature are proud and puffed up with
the conceit of their own wisdom and righteousnesse,
and ability, so as they will not acknowledge their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
nor be sensible of their misery and danger of
perdition, but do entertain a high esteem and opinion
of themselves, and in speciall this, that they love God
above all things, and that they can do any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
at least in such a measure as may reasonably
satisfie God, as is to be seen in the example of the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elits
undertaking, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. therefore, God, in His wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
before he convert any man, doth pull down this
false conceit, by putting his ability to proof by the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40880:68"/>
preaching of the law, to the intent, that as the Lord
knoweth what is in man, so man may know it also
both in his own and other mens experience: and this
is brought to light yet more clearly by the preaching
of the Gospel, wherein albeit God make the precious
offer of life and salvation to every hearer of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
if he will acknowledge his sin, and betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Christ; yet no man of himself will either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
or receive the offer, but will go on in his own
counsell and wayes, till God by his grace convert him.
This sicknesse is common both to the elect and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat,
but when the naturall perversnesse of both is
manifested, God cometh and maketh the difference of
the one from the other, out of his meer grace, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the elect powerfully to Christ and letting the rest
go on to their own perdition in his righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And our Lord doth so expound the mater, <hi>Ioh.
8. 47. He that is of God, heareth Gods words; ye therefore
hear them not, because ye are not of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Lord professeth plainly, that in the
dispensation of his word and works of providence,
he intendeth the tryall of men, and the discovery of
their hearts to themselves and to others; and what
fairer dealing can there be then this? for, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 4.
He tells them, that he will rain down Manna upon
them, to prove them, whither they will walk in his
law or not: and, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 20. He tells them, he will
give them his law and preaching of his word, to prove
them, that his fear might be before them: and, <hi>Deut.
8.</hi> 2. that the dispensation of his providence toward
them, all the fourty years in the wildernesse, was to
humble them, and to prove them, to know what was
in their heart, whether they would keep his commands
or not: and, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. that he would suffer
false prophets to arise among them, to prove them, and
to try whether they would love the Lord their God
with all their heart. And to this same intent, we are
advertised, that Christ should be not only a tryed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40880:68"/>
stone, but also a stone for tryall, set for the ruine of
some, and raising up of other some, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 16, 17.
and, 8. 14. compared with <hi>Luke,</hi> 2. 34, 35. for, by this
maner of dispensation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord maketh manifest, that
both the elect and reprobat are concluded under sin and
unbelief of themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that no man can come to
Christ, except the Father draw him, that he may have
mercy on whom he will have mercy. And this maner
of probation of men by a common offer of grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all, is a part of that prudence, whereby Christ, by
his conditionall promises and exhortations, and the
preaching of the Gospel to all hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers, maketh all these
that are outwardly called, to be without excuse, and
fisheth forth the elect out of the sea of sin and misery,
and out of the society of those that perish: of which
prudence, Isaiah speaketh, <hi>chap. 52. 13. Behold, my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
shall deal prudently and prosper, and be extolled, and be
very high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore this wisdom of God in converting the
elect, without giving cause of stumbling unto any of
the rest, is rather to be admired and praised, then to be
disputed against, as we are taught, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33, 34,
35, 36. <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments, and
his wayes past finding out?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But for all this, the carnall wisdom of proud
men is such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as neither is it subject to God, nor indeed
can be, but standeth in hostile enimity against him, and
will not be quiet, but when it heareth what is said,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. that God <hi>will have mercy on whom he will
have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> will say, as it
is, <hi>vers. 19. why doth God yet find fault?</hi> for, <hi>who hath
resisted his will?</hi> this doctrine, say they, doth hinder
mens repentance altogether.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> We answer with the Apostle, <hi>vers. 20. Nay
but O man, who art thou that replyeth against God?</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dost thou compear procuratour for the reprobat
and for Satan the enemy of God, to quarrell and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40880:69"/>
with God anent his righteous decrees? If thou
wilt avow this, we leave thee and all such proud and
presumptuous misbelievers of plain doctrine to reckon
with your Judge. But if thou speak only for thy self,
we shall let thee see, that this doctrine shall not hinder
thee from repentance. If then thou shalt say, I will
not dispute against God, but do desire earnestly to be
satisfied about my self, for I believe, that many are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat
and few are chosen; and my fear is, that I be
found of the worst sort, and do not know how to rid
my self of my doubts and fears. For answer, we shall
deal with thee in a friendly maner; and, first, we put
thee in remembrance, that God hath served an inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on all men, not to medle with the secret counsell
of God, <hi>Deut. 29. 29. The secret things belong to the
Lord our God, but these things that are revealed belong unto
us and our children for ever.</hi> Therefore do not hearken
to this suggestion, but go about thy duty. We ask
then, first, art thou convinced of thy sin and ill deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?
If thou say, I am a sinner, and cannot answer
for one of a thousand of my by gone sins, for which
God may justly, and I fear he shall in effect reject me,
we answer unto thee, it is to good purpose that thou
are so far convinced of sin, as to judge thy self worthy
of death, and utter exterminion from his mercy: mean
time be comforted thus far, that thou art not of the
number of those who confide in their own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
nor of the number of them who trust in their
own strength, or power of their free-will.</p>
                  <p>We ask again, doth thy by gone life displease thee?
and wouldst thou have thy sins forgiven, and thy self
reconciled with God? doth Christ, offering himself
in the Gospel, please thy soul, when thou hearest from
his word, that he craveth nothing of thee, save that
thou welcome his offer, and consecrat thy self to him,
that so in him thou mayest have righteousnesse and
sanctification and salvation? If thou answer, that the
searcher of hearts knoweth thy hearty desire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40880:69"/>
to God in Christ, to live before him hereafter
as a reconciled child, there is good hope of salvation
for such a one as thou art.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we say, seing thou hast heard the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
thee of sin, and hast believed Gods word so
far, why dost thou not believe him also, when in the
Gospel thou hearest his offer and call unto all self-condemned
sinners, to come unto Christ, and rest their
weary souls upon him? who hath excepted thee from
the embracing of mercy offered in Jesus Christ? look
therefore what his word saith to all sinners flying for
refuge unto Christ, who is the hope set before sinners,
and leave him not, whatsoever be thy fears; for, he
that hungereth and thirsteth for righteousnesse through
Christ, shall be satisfied.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">For a further clearing and confirmation of the doctrine
about the three Covenants, from Jer. 31. and Heb. 8.</head>
               <p>THe prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> giveth us a short com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
of the former doctrine anent these three
covenants, <hi>chap. 31. vers.</hi> 31. &amp;c. whereof the
Apostle giveth a clear commentary, <hi>Heb. 8. vers.</hi>
6, 7. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As to the covenant of Redemption, it is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supponed
to be past, as the Apostle, expounding this
place of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> giveth us to understand, while he
sheweth us, that the covenant of grace was no other
wayes purchased, then by the Mediation of our Lord
Jesus, transacting about the covenant of Redemption
with the Father. And that he may give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this,</p>
               <p>1. Christ is called the <hi>Mediatour of a better covenant,
Heb.</hi> 8. to wit, of the covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>2. The covenant of Grace is designed by the name
of a <hi>Testament,</hi> which giveth us to understand, that
Christ the Mediatour, did not obtain the making of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40880:70"/>
this covenant on a lesse price then the laying down of
his life, that all the benefits contained in these better
promises, might first be his <hi>goods,</hi> to dispone upon, as
he pleased; and that he being resolved to die, did make
his <hi>Testament,</hi> and leave them all in legacy to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
his heirs and assigneys, designed from eternity.</p>
               <p>3. The Mediatour making his Testament, is called
<hi>Iehovah,</hi> not a meer man, but God to be incarnat,
making an unchangeable Latter-will or Testament,
which of necessity required the death of the Testatour,
that it might be ratified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16. and the death
of a Testatour not a meer man, but the Son of God to
be incarnat and to die, who had life in himself, that he
might lay down his life, and take it up again.</p>
               <p>4. The goods which he purchased according to the
covenant of Redemption, and left in legacy to his
heirs, are all and every blessing which do belong to
godlinesse and life eternall, as <hi>remission</hi> of sin, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the law in their hearts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. The redeemed, and designed heirs, are not all
and every man, but the elect only, these that were to be
saved only, and who were to be effectually called, and
indued with the saving knowledge of God, who from
the least to the greatest, <hi>were all of them to know the Lord:</hi>
not such as were the reprobat fathers, nor their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
children, but the chosen society of the Israel of
God and of Christs family, <hi>the house of Iudah,</hi> which
is the tribe of Christ; for, the Apostle doth extend
these promises unto the covenant between God and the
elect, to be gathered under the Evangel unto Christ, out
of Jews and Gentiles.</p>
               <p>As to the covenant of works, it is certain, first,
that God made a covenant of grace in substance, and
upon the mater with the fathers that were brought out
of Egypt, as we may gather from the consideration of
the parties and articles of that covenant: for, albeit
God repeated the covenant of works, and declared the
force of the law, for binding the curse upon all trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40880:70"/>
thereof; yet he did presse the law on them in
order unto their reconciliation, by the sacrifice of the
Lamb of God, to be in due time offered up, and did
teach them, that Christ was the end of the law, for
righteousnesse to every one that believed.</p>
               <p>2. It is certain, that in the framing of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace, between God and the visible Church of
the fathers, God did make the promises of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and eternall life and spirituall blessings, under the
vail of temporall types, upon conditions more hard
and difficile in appearance, then the new covenant doth
require: for, this the Apostle sheweth to us plainly,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
               <p>3. It is certain, that the un-believing Fathers did
not take up, nor understand the covenant of Grace, but
turned it over in a covenant of Works, which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by comparing the words of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
thereupon by the Apostle: For, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> saith,
that they did transgress the Covenant, albeit God did
shew <hi>himself a husband unto these</hi> un-believing Fathers;
that is, they changed the covenant of Grace in a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works of their own framing, and transgressed
that Covenant also. And the Apostle saith, they <hi>did
not continue in that covenant,</hi> because they changed it to
themselves in a covenant of Works, according to which
Covenant God did deal with them: for, in stead of
being a husband to them, he exacted of them the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of the broken covenant of Works, and <hi>Lorded</hi>
it over them, and <hi>did not regard them.</hi> Heb. 8. 6. For,
they sought after the righteousness of works, and not
to have righteousness by faith; and therefore did he
despise them, and dealt with them after the tenor of the
covenant of Works. And it is observable, that the
words of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> do comprehend the Apostles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for, the words may bear both, that God was a
<hi>husband</hi> unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, in making a covenant of
Grace with them; and that he dealt with them as <hi>a
Lord over</hi> them, by exacting of them the penalty of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40880:71"/>
broken covenant of Works, and of the rejected cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace.</p>
               <p>As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the covenant of Grace, the Apostle speaketh
of it in express termes, first, by Gods promising that he
would make a <hi>new Covenant</hi> with the house of <hi>Israel</hi>
and <hi>Iudah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly by his setting better promises before them
then these were which were made to the Fathers in
the wilderness.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by his giving no other cause of bestowing
so great blessings on them, but his own good-will and
pleasure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by his requiring no other condition of
them but saith, that they who feel in themselves, the
want and need of the promised blessings, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of their own unworthiness, might give credit
unto God that maketh the promise, and so embrace the
promises, and apply them to their own use.</p>
               <p>As to the external dispensation of the Covenant, it is
certain, first, that it was common to all that were exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
called, to all the members of the visible Church:
for, the covenant made in the wilderness with the elect
Fathers and reprobat, with the believers and un-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
with those that rejected the covenant of Grace
and the offer of Righteousness by faith, and with those
who looked through the vail afar off to Christ coming,
and were saved, was one and the same.</p>
               <p>2. It is certain, that the external form of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, was more obscure and vailed over by
the types and figures of the levitical ceremonies before
Christ came; but after his coming, it was propounded
in clearer and better promises.</p>
               <p>3. A day is set, to wit, the fulness of time, when these
shadows and typical figures should be abolished, and
the grace of God should be set before his people, to be
looked upon with open face.</p>
               <p>4. And yet, the grace of God was not so hid and
obscurely propounded to the Church before Christs
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40880:71"/>
coming, as it could not be taken up by the children of
God; for in the midst of the shadows and dark typs
the star-light of gracious promises did shine, and the
doctrine of the new Covenant, was in substance hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
forth by the Prophets; and one instance thereof
doth appear in this place of <hi>Ieremiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the internal covenant of Grace, first, these
things which are promised in that Covenant, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
in what state God doth find men whom he doth
convert and draw into covenant with himself; for,
when the Lord taketh in hand, that he will write his
law in their heart, that he will teach them himself to
know him, by the teaching of his Word and Spirit;
and that he will forgive their sins, he pre-supposeth,
that lawless rebellion did reign in them, with blindness
of mind and hardness of heart; and that the Elect,
by nature, are without law, without God, without faith,
before he reform them according to the Articles, or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the covenant of Redemption.</p>
               <p>2. Albeit, by nature, the law be written in mens
hearts, as to the knowledge of sundry moral duties, and
so far as is sufficient to make them inexcusable for their
contraveening these sparks of light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0. and,
2, 14. 15. Yet, the writing of the law, here promised
is spiritual and super-natural, inlightning their minds
by the light of Gods Spirit, and renewing their heart;
and, in effect, the thing promised is actual conversion of
them.</p>
               <p>3. And seing conversion is here promised by Christ
the Testator absolutely, he hath taken in hand abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to effectuat it: for, it is not said, I will put my
law in their heart <hi>if they please to suffer</hi> me, but deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatly,
<hi>I will put my law, I will write my law in their
heart and inward parts,</hi> that is, I will make them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
who were averse, and obedient to my law who
were rebellious.</p>
               <p>4. Christ, the Testator, doth in all this, not satisfie
himself by promising the illumination of the mind and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40880:72"/>
the inclining of the heart, for a time; but promiseth
also to make a solid and permanent work of it, by
making them persevere, which is imported in the words
<hi>I will put,</hi> and <hi>I will write it;</hi> for, to write it, is as much
as to fix and ingrave it, that it may remain.</p>
               <p>5. The chief head of the Covenant, and which in
substance doth contain all blessings, is set down in these
words, <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my people:</hi>
for, by this promise, right is granted unto the true heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convert
and confederat, first, unto God himself, then
unto all his benefits, whereof he hath need, in order to
righteousness and eternal life: for, they whose God the
Lord is, they do live, and shall live for ever, as Christ
saith, <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi>
Matth. 22. 32. And all particular promises, what are
they else but explications of this great and first promise,
and applications thereof to his childrens cases in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular?</p>
               <p>Gifts of the Spirit are promised here, and indue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereof disciples have need, whereof pilgrims
going home to that heavenly city have need: yea, the
Spirit himself is promised to them, who is to remain
with them to the end of their life, as a directer and
leader, <hi>They shall all know me, saith the Lord,</hi> that is, as
Christ doth interpret it, <hi>They shall be all taught of God,</hi>
Joh. 6. 45.</p>
               <p>7. The Lord sheweth here, that he will deal with
men, in their regeneration and reconciliation, as with
reasonable creatures, by preserving and not destroying
them in their simple naturals, by maintaining and not
over-turning the liberty of their free-will; <hi>I will make
a Covenant,</hi> saith he, <hi>with the house of</hi> Judah. Now a
Covenant is a free and voluntar Contract.</p>
               <p>8. He sheweth, that he is Lord and Over-ruler of
mans will, who can turn it about as he pleaseth, and
that he is not hindred nor impeded to execute and bring
to passe, whatsoever he hath purposed to do, by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
contingency or differency of mans will, but can
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40880:72"/>
work <hi>upon</hi> the will of man, and <hi>by</hi> the will of man,
what pleaseth him; and by second causes, whether
working freely and contingently, or by a naturall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
can wisely, holily and powerfully bring about
his own purpose in his set time; <hi>the dayes come,</hi> saith he,
<hi>wherein I will make a covenant with the house of Israel.</hi>
Wherein he taketh upon him the effectuall work of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting,
promising not only for his own part, but
also for the elect of Israel and Judahs part; for, his
promise is, that it shall <hi>come to passe,</hi> that by inclining
their will unto reconciliation, they shall willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto a covenanting with God: for, he saith, <hi>I will
make a covenant with them;</hi> he saith not, <hi>if they will,</hi> but
absolutely, I will make them close a covenant with Me
heartily.</p>
               <p>9. The party to be converted and to enter in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
is not all men, nor every society, but the <hi>Church,</hi>
Gods own family; not every nation, but Gods people,
chosen out of all nations on the whole earth, <hi>I will make
a covenant with the house of Israel:</hi> as it is also cleared,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</p>
               <p>10. The Church of Christ under the Gospel, as the
Apostle looketh on this place, is comprehended under
the name of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah;</hi> partly, because Israel
hath the priority of all other people in Gods covenant;
and partly, because all the Christian Church of the
Jews and Gentiles, is comprehended under the name
of the house of <hi>Iudah,</hi> which is Christs tribe, whereof
he came, who is the prince and head of all believers
and confederat persons, reconciled to God; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because the Israelits or Jews, have this prerogative
above all other people and nations on the earth, that
of that race of people, the posterity of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi>
and <hi>Iacob,</hi> there shall be in all ages some elected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
till the great bulk of the now scattered people turn
Christians, and till the end of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 5.</p>
               <p>11. No age, old nor young, no sex, man nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
nor any externall difference of men that can be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40880:73"/>
put between one and another in this life, doth exclude
any man from the benefit of this covenant, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
a man to God that his person should be respected
of God, but all and every one whom God shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
call, may safely accept the offer of grace, and
joyn themselves to Jesus Christ; for, the grace of
God here, is extended unto all degrees and sorts of
men, from <hi>the least to the greatest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. In the mean time God knoweth his own, man
be man, both great and small, and with the same love,
doth embrace them all; for, the promise is, that all
those elect who are known to God, shall know him
from the <hi>greatest</hi> even to the <hi>least.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. The great obstacle which may be supposed to
exclude any from coming in to God through Christ, is
here removed; to wit, the greatness and multitude of
by-gone sins, cast up against the in-coming of some
when they are called: The mercy and grace of Christ
the Testator, taketh this doubt out of the way, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and their sins I will no
more remember,</hi> Jer. 31. 34.</p>
               <p>14. This promised remission, the Lord will not
have limited nor abridged, neither by the number of
sins, nor grievousness thereof, nor kinds of sins, but
he purposeth and promiseth to take away all iniquity
by forgiveness, and to forget their by-gone sins, <hi>ver.</hi>
34. And confirmeth this by repeating the promise
of not casting them off who shall acknowledge him,
<hi>ver.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>15. From this promise the Apostle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.) draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this consequence, that under the Gospel, or new
covenant, there is but one offering for sin; which
offering cannot be repeated, in regard that full remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
thereby is purchased: For, (<hi>ver.</hi> 14.) he saith, <hi>by
one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
and this he proveth from the words of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 17. whence he concludes, <hi>ver. Now,
where remission of these are, there is no more offering for
sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:40880:73"/>
16. If any shall ask for the cause of so rich mercy
and grace covenanted, he shall find none in man at
all. The only cause is set down here, to wit, the will
and good pleasure of God, <hi>I will forgive their iniquity,</hi>
saith the Lord, <hi>and their sins will I remember no more,</hi>
that is, I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy.</p>
               <p>17. Because the Lord our God and Mediatour, is
here making his Testament, wherein also he taketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to be executor of his own latter will, and to
perform all that is promised, therefore in confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he subscribeth and sets down his name, <hi>Ier. 31.
35. Thus saith the Lord;</hi> and that his subscription may
be of weight with all men, he designs himself by
his stately stiles or titles, taken from his creation and
government of the creatures, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, which
giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the
moon and of the starrs for a light by night, which divideth
the Sea when the waves thereof roar; the Lord of hosts
is his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he saith, least the faith of his people should be
shaken by their looking to impediments and difficulties,
and that they may gather strength and courage to go on
in the Lords way constantly, when they consider the
power of God in the workmanship and government of
the world.</p>
               <p>18. Unto his subscription, he addeth, both wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and pledges of his promises, <hi>ver. 36. If those ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed
of</hi> Israel (which comprehendeth the seed of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
faith) <hi>shall cease from being a nation before me forever,</hi>
ver. 36.</p>
               <p>19. Last of all, least any man, in the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the grievousness of his sin, or of the apparent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of performing these promises, should doubt,
of remission of sins to be granted to the confederat, or
of the perseverance of the true believer, or of the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of the Church, the Lord bids his people that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40880:74"/>
come in to him, be confident and quiet, <hi>ver.</hi> 37. say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations
of the earth searched out beneath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will also cast off all the
seed of</hi> Israel <hi>for all that they have done, saith the Lord,</hi>
Now, both these are impossible, that we can measure
the heavens, or search the bottom of the earth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is impossible, that this covenant and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
made therein, should fail.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The maner of dispensing the new covenant outwardly and
inwardly.</head>
                  <p>AS to the dispensation of this covenant, both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and inwardly, first, this promise of a new
covenant, is a challenge against the mis believing
fathers, who slighted the offer of grace and followed
after the covenant of works, seeking righteousness by
works; which covenant of works, they were not able
to perform and it served unto them only for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
This the Apostle doth collect from this
place of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Heb. 8. 8. <hi>He found fault with the
fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Apostle observeth the wonderfull
mercy of God, that while he is finding fault with the
incredulity of the fathers, who lived under this old
covenant, he will avenge this their incredulity, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
foolishness and ingratitude, by telling them,
that he will make a new covenant and give them that
were then living a taste of it, for recovering them,
finding fault with them, he saith, <hi>the dayes come, that
I will make a new covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this covenant of grace m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de with the
Church, is procured by Christ, to this end, that the
covenant of <hi>Redemption</hi> might be brought unto a reall
accomplishment by the covenant of <hi>Grace.</hi> This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
is grounded upon this, that Christ is called
the <hi>Mediatour</hi> of this better covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. For,
he will draw up a clear covenant of grace with his
people, that the blessings purchased unto them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40880:74"/>
to the covenant of Redemption, may be applyed
unto them by this covenant of grace and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the preaching of the promise of this new
covenant, is a most fit mean to draw on and close this
covenant of grace between God and his people, who
are the called according to his purpose: This observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is gathered from <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> preaching and <hi>Pauls</hi>
preaching of this unto the hearers of the Gospel, to this
very intent and purpose.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in the promising and preaching of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace, God will have all mens opinions,
thoughts and conceptions about this mystery, limited
unto, and depending upon, his mouth alone, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same in his Word: This observation is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Lords invitation of all men to take heed
what he is to say, and what he is to let forth in this
mater, <hi>Behold the dayes come, saith the Lord,</hi> wherein
I will do such and such things, which now I fore-tell
I will do.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, both the making and way of making a
covenant with man, dependeth absolutely on God
either to make a covenant or not, to make what cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
he pleaseth to make, upon what conditions he
pleaseth, and with what persons he pleaseth to make
his covenant. No man ever preveened God, desiring
him to make a covenant, but God did preveen all
men, he preveened <hi>Adam</hi> once before his fall, and
again by preaching the Gospel in his audience after the
fall, he preveened the fathers in the wilderness, he
preveened his posterity, that have lived or shall live in
the latter dayes, promising to make a covenant with
those who were not come into the world, but were to
come long after the promise.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the Lord will have all men to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the end of his covenanting with men, both
in that old dark form, and in the new clear form, is
his own glory: For, he hath made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40880:75"/>
even the wicked for the day of evil. This obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is gathered, partly, from this, that the Lord
bringeth forth his soveraignty for a reason of his reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the misbelieving fathers in the wildernesse, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
them, I regarded them not; I Lorded it over them,</hi> as
the originall may bear. And partly, from this, that
he bringeth forth his own will and pleasure, for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his shewing grace to their posterity, <hi>I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
their sins,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>8. He sheweth also, that in his works he doth not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon man,</hi> but that all his works are known unto
him from the beginning, and that it is determined by
himself, what, and how, and by what means, he will
do every thing. This may appear from this, that he
doth fore-tell what he is to do about the saving of his
elect, Jews and Gentiles, being no lesse certain to do
what he promised about the posterity to come, then he
was certain of what was past already about their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous
fathers.</p>
                  <p>9. The Lord will have us to know, that laying aside
the consideration of his decrees, it is simply in the
power of God to punish sin, in whom he will and to
pardon sin through a Mediatour, to whom he will,
that is, to have mercy on whom he will have mercy,
and to pardon whom he will pardon. This is collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from this, that the fathers do sin in the wildernesse
and justly perish and the posterity do sin and are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
pardoned.</p>
                  <p>10. In all this proceeding, no violence is used upon
the will of men, whether of them that perish, or of
them that are saved. The saved do walk freely and
willingly in the way of salvation, as their hearty
choise; and these that perish, walk willingly in the
way of perdition. God proceeds with both by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ary
covenant, as this place doth shew.</p>
                  <p>11. In them that perish the meritorious and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
cause of their perdition is in themselves; but in
them that are saved, no cause is found at all, but the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40880:75"/>
cause is found in Gods grace alanerly. This is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from this, that the Lord giveth the reason of the
perdition of the misbelieving fathers, from their sins
and transgression of covenant, <hi>they transgressed my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and I despised them;</hi> and of the salvation of their
posterity, no other cause but this, <hi>their sins I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. The Lords justice is cleared in the perdition of
them that perish, because he gave precepts and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and other morall motives, to hinder them from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and to move them to keep his wayes, albeit he
did not effectually impede their running on to sin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their inclination, and pronenesse to follow
their own way. This is collected from this, that the
Lord saith, he made a covenant with their fathers, and
they did break it.</p>
                  <p>13. It pleaseth God, not only to give his precepts
unto men, concerning their duty, but also to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
so far unto them as to open up in a part his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and deep designs about mens salvation, that they,
being admitted somewhat near to the treasures of His
wisdom, goodnesse, justice and mercy, might be
so much the more wise, and the more stirred up to
discharge their duty, and make use of his dispensation.
This we collect from his revealing of the decree of
election of the posterity of <hi>Israel,</hi> and drawing them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
into a covenant of grace with himself.</p>
                  <p>14. The Lord doth reveal to the world the doctrine
of election unto life, only in the general, and doth not
descend to the nomination of them in particular. This
is collected from this, that he doth promise to convert
and draw into a new covenant of grace, the posterity of
<hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> without nameing particularly these
that were designed for that salvation.</p>
                  <p>15. Albeit the Lord keepeth up the names of the
elect (except of some few) before their conversion,
yet, he giveth forth marks and evidences, whereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their conversion, they may be known both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40880:76"/>
and others. This we collect from this, that He
sets down infallible marks of the elect, who are to be
Gods covenanted people or worshipers of God, that
they do know God, and have his law written in their
hearts and inward parts.</p>
                  <p>16. As for the reprobation of any man, the Lord
hath given no certain mark as long as they live, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that malicious and wilfull rejecting and opposing
of known Christ Jesus) to the intent that none should
dare to exclude, either themselves or others from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and hope of mercy, so long as the day of Gods
long-suffering and patience doth last. This is collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from this, that God doth not make mention of the
reprobation of these misbelieving fathers, while they
are living, but now long after they are dead; and this
mention making of them, is in general only, and not
by nameing them particularly.</p>
                  <p>17. Albeit in the dispensation of the covenant of
grace, for application of saving mercies, the mater be
so wisely carryed by God, that both the decree and
covenant of Redemption is keeped closs, as to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
names, and yet it is effectually made out in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of grace to individuall persons, as the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made between God and Christ Mediatour;
yet, the covenant of Redemption, is made this far clear,
that it did not passe for the conversion and salvation of
all and every man, by this evidence, that not so much
as the offer of the covenant of grace, and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall be made to all and every nation, far l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sse to all
and every singular person: but that the people and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> is chosen out of all people and
nations in the world, comprehending such others as
should be called unto their society, and the fellowship
of the olive tree among them, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20.
holdeth forth. And in this place the whole elect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel, are taken up under the name of this one
nation.</p>
                  <p>18. That the decree of election of some, may both
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40880:76"/>
be keeped up as to particular nomination, and yet have
certain execution and be performed, the Lord taketh
up all his confederats whether in the letter or spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
under the same common name. This is gathered
from this, that the misbelieving Israelits that perished
in the desart, with whom God made a covenant and
they did break it, are designed under the common name
of <hi>fathers,</hi> and are taken up in that covenant under the
name of <hi>spouse, Ier.</hi> 31. 32. and the elect posterity are
taken up under the common name of the house of <hi>Israel</hi>
and <hi>Iudah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. Such as the covenanters are, in regard of their
inward estate, such is the covenant wherein they really
are, or such is the covenant in relation to their persons.
Unto the reprobat who do change for their part, the
covenant of grace into the covenant of works, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace becometh in effect the covenant of
works, and is rendered void to them, as the Apostle
doth threaten the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 5. 4. and as did befall
the pharisaicall fathers, who are here declared as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
but the covenant of grace unto the elect and
true believers, remains still the covenant of grace, from
which they do not fall, nor can altogether fall, as the
comparison here between the fathers in the wildernesse
and their elect posterity maketh evident.</p>
                  <p>20. The Lord hath wisely joyned life with the
means and way to life and death with the way to death,
and will not have that separated which he hath joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This is collected from this, that the fathers by not
continuing in the covenant, are despised and rejected of
God, and so perished; but their elect posterity, having
the law of God in their hearts, and cleaving constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto the Lord, are saved.</p>
                  <p>21. The Lord will have this doctrine taught where
His word is preached, concerning the election of some,
and reprobation of other some; of Gods covenanting
with some people and persons, and not offering a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to other some; of covenanting with some in the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40880:77"/>
letter, and with other some in the spirit also, to this
end and intent, that men, leaving the searching in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of that which God hath keeped secret in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
may follow commanded duties, repent their
sins and flee to Christ offered unto them, and take up his
yoke upon them, and beware that they neither despair,
nor yet presume, or turn the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse.
This we gather from this, that God sendeth
forth <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to preach these things, not only to the
visible Church of the Jews going into exile and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
but also to all who shall hear this doctrine from
him to the end of the world. And the Apostle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
this doctrine for the use of the Christian
Church of Jews and Gentiles, doth confirm this.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the prudent application of divine covenants in general.</head>
               <p>HAving spoken of these three divine covenants
concerning mens salvation, it follows now to
speak of the application thereof, first, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and then more specially.</p>
               <p>In the mater of application, we must, first, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Gods effectuall applying and working in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of these covenants, such effects as he hath intended
by these covenants to bring to passe: Next, we must
look upon the means whereby he ordinarly doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
and work his intended works in men. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we must look upon the prudent way of use making
of these means, both by Pastors and people for peoples
good.</p>
               <p>2. As to the first, the Lords effectuall application,
is a reall and actuall bestowing the good of these cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
upon his own, by way of powerfull working on
their spirits. Such as are, 1. the giving the grace of
understanding of the Scripture; And, 2. the belief
of what is understood; And, 3. the application of
the doctrine of the law, concerning mens sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
to their own conscience; And, 4. the making
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40880:77"/>
them judge themselves according to the law; And,
5. the raising of sorrow in their hearts and fear of
wrath; And, 6. the setting of their eye upon Christ
for delivery from sin and death; And, 7. the make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them perceive a possibility and probability that
they may be saved: And, 8. to have an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
after reconciliation with God in Christ; And,
9. the making of his own to cast themselves over on
Christ and to believe on him; And, 10. the making
them to consecrat themselves to God in Christ, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
the world of meer grace to himself, not imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
transgression to the reconciled through Christ;
And, 11. the making them to wonder at the riches
of the free grace of God, who in a self-condemned sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
desirous to be reconciled with him, requireth no
personall dignity, no good work, which may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him to God, but only that he would receive and
welcome Christ offered in the Gospel, as the only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and sufficient remedy against all sin and misery,
requiring no other condition, but that he flee from the
curse of the law, and the wrath to come, unto Christ
the Redeemer, who offereth himself unto lost sinners in
the preaching of the Gospel, that through him the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver
may be justified and sanctified, and saved for
ever; And, 12. after wondering raised in the hearts of
his children, the making them cleave closly to Christ,
and to strive against all temptations, which might
weaken their faith, and to rejoyce in believing, and to
be zealous for the Lords glory, and carefull to bring
forth more and more fruits of faith and love, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such other gracious works of his Spirit in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as may more and more mortifie sin in them, and
perfect the image of God in his new creature. This
divine, magisteriall and effectuall application of reall
blessings, belongeth to God only, and is the end of all
ministeriall application, which is of the externall
means appointed of God, to be made use of by men,
the blessing whereof must be left to God to bestow, on
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40880:78"/>
whom, how, and in what measure, and in what time
it pleaseth him, as the Apostle doth shew unto us,
1 <hi>Cor. 3. 6. I have planted, and Apollos hath watered, but
God giveth the increase.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The externall means, which do serve unto the
foresaid divine operations, are, 1. The doctrine of
life and salvation, set down in the Scripture, to be heard
and read by all men, and meditat upon with prayer for
a blessing; And, 2. sent ministers, to whom God
hath committed the word of reconciliation, by whose
ministery disciples may be made unto Christ out of all
nations; And, 3. the administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby they with their children are baptized,
and gathered together in severall Churches, and put
under the government of such Church-officers, as his
Testament hath appointed; And, 4. these Churches
joyned together in the most edifying way of mutuall
communion, and strengthening one another in true
doctrine, pure worship and discipline, which Gods
providence doth make way for, that the Kingdom of
our Lord Jesus may continue and grow in the world,
and all his ordinances may be exercised publickly and
privatly to the best advantage of the Church, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Saints, for the work of the ministery,
and for the edifying of the body of Christ, as the
Apostle requireth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>4. In the use of these external means, and specially
in the application of these three covenants, prudence
is required, both in P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stors and people, to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and purpose these following considerations may
serve.</p>
               <p>1. The remedy of every sic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ness of the conscience,
must be grounded on the doctrine of salvation set down
in Scripture; which doctrine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be known

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> a prudent
application of wholsom and saving doctrine may be
made, of necessity the party diseased must be acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40880:78"/>
with the doctrine to be applyed unto him, before he
can make use thereof to his advantage: for, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
teacheth us, how hardly gross ignorants can be
convinced of sin, add how hardly such can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
when their conscience is wakened with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of God, because they neither know from the
Word of God, the cause of the terrour and anxiety
wherein they are, nor can they be capable of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of their evill, except they, first, be catechised in
the heads of saving doctrine, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld forth in the Law and
Gospel, which instruction can hardly be given or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in a short time; and howsoever, a prudent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
must make use of time as it is offered, yet when
death is near to the party to be instructed, how little
is it that can be expected to be done?</p>
               <p>2. The order of applying saving doctrine, doth not
begin at the application either of the covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
or at the covenant of Grace, but he that
will follow a right order, must begin at the law and
covenant of works, under the yoke whereof we are all
born by nature, children of wrath. And if a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that covenant and law to his heart, and subscribe
his own dittey and deserved condemnation, then may
he turn up his soul to Christ Jesus the Redeemer, and
flye to him for refuge, and accept the offer which he
makes in his Gospel of a new covenant of grace for
pardoning of sin and reconciling unto God in himself
the person who is fled unto him, and for sanctifying
and saving of him; which covenant, when a chased
soul doth consent unto, and layeth hold on Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for relief from sin, wrath, death and hell, then
may he ascend by faith unto the covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and apply to himself with Gods allowance
all the saving graces purchased by Christ, by that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
to all that flye unto him and believe in him.</p>
               <p>3. This order of making use of these three covenants,
many do not follow, but they begin at the covenant of
Redemption, and will either be satisfied about this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40880:79"/>
they be elected or not, given to Christ to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
or not, (which is a secret and not to be inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into, save in Gods order as we have shown) or else
they will not enter upon the use-making of these means
which God hath appointed to bring a man to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and faith in Christ. This is a tentation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
which if they yield unto, it shall lead them
either to resolute profanity with <hi>Cain,</hi> or to anxious
desperation with <hi>Iudas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. There are some also, who make leap-year of the
covenant of works, and do take no notice of their own
naturall sinfulness or wrath due to them, and lying on
them by nature; but neglecting this order, do start a
race, and run to a presumptuous avouching of their
faith in Christ, and will thrust in themselves in the
number of the elect, given before the world was, unto
Christ to be redeemed and saved, pretending their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of the Gospel, when they have not believed
the doctrine of the law, and so do turn the grace of
God into lasciviousness and wantonness, and go about
the satisfying and fulfilling of their own lusts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is necessary, that every man who seeketh to be
saved, and hath resolved to follow Gods way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto salvation, do begin first, at the covenant
of works, and examine himself according to the rule
of the morall law, how he hath behaved himself in
obedience unto the first and second table, and having
sound a dittey great enough, that he judge himself and
passe sentence on himself as guilty and worthy of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
wrath for his sins. Secondly, when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of sin and deserved wrath, and of his own utter
impotency to deliver himself, then let him flee to Christ
and lay hold on the grace offered in the Gospel, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same to his burthened conscience, according to
the tennor of the covenant of grace, fully revealed in
the Gospel. And, thirdly, when he hath in earnest
consented unto the covenant of grace and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and hath laid hold on Christ, with unfaigned faith,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40880:79"/>
seeking in him remission of sin, and renovation of life,
being resolved by the grace of Christ, to use the means
appointed of him for that end; Now it is time and not
till now, to look up unto the covenant of <hi>Redemption,</hi>
and there to read his own name, as it were, written in
the book of life, and to acknowledge that the measure
of repentance and faith in Christ bestowed on himself
now in experience, hath flowed from that fountain of
Gods love and free grace through Christ.</p>
               <p>Except this order be keeped, a man cannot warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
and with confidence and comfort, make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of these covenants. Hence it followeth, that it
is a preposterous and perilous course which some do
follow, and presse others to follow, that presently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hearing of the Gospel, every man should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that Christ hath died for him: for, Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
no man, warrandeth no man to come to him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he, first, do acknowledge his sins, and himself to
be worthy of wrath, condemnation and hell for his
sins, and to be utterly unable to save himself by any
mean, save by Christ: for, (<hi>Luke,</hi> 5. 32.) Christ
saith, <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
Neither doth Christ require of any man, to
believe himself to be of the number of Christs sheep for
whom he laid down his life, except he come by faith as
a lost sinner to him, and submit himself to his doctrine
and discipline, and pastorall care over him: for, (<hi>Ioh.</hi>
17. 9.) Christ saith, <hi>I pray not for the world, but for
these thou hast given me out of the world:</hi> and no man
shall know, that himself is given of the Father to
Christ, till first he come in the order foresaid unto
Christ, and when he is come to Christ, resolveth to
abide with him, then may he say, the Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me to Christ, and drawn me to Christ: for, this
is the mark which Christ giveth, <hi>Ioh. 6. 37. All that
the Father hath given unto me, shall come to me.</hi> And
again, vers. 44. <hi>No man cometh unto me, except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draw him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:40880:80"/>
3. There is an order al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o to be observed in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the graces offered in the Gospel; for, in the
Evangel, first, Christ himself is offered, as the only and
sufficient remedy against sin and misery; and next, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the person that receiveth Christ heartily, all Christs
benefits are promised to come to him by Christ, and
are to be found in and through Christ, such as are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
Adoption, the indwelling of the holy Ghost,
love, joy, peace, gentlenesse, bounty, fidelity, meekness,
temperance and other Christian graces, <hi>Gal</hi> 5. 22. for,
no man hath right unto Christs benefits, before he be a
believer in Christ. But so soon as a man, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
order, is fled unto Christ, and hath laid hold on
him by faith, straight way a door and entresse is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him unto the rich treasure of grace, and right
is given to him unto all the benefits of Christ; for, all
the promises are yea and amen, not before a man come
to Christ, not to a man without Christ, but they are all
yea and a men in Christ.</p>
               <p>4. Therefore they wrong both God and their own
selves, who when they come unto the throne of grace,
do prescribe unto God another order of working, then
he hath set down in his word, craving, in the first place,
consolation and sensible peace in their conscience, felt
in their hearts; and that God would work some such
saving graces in their heart, which the reprobat cannot
counterfit: which directions, if God will take off
their hand, and bestow his graces on them sensibly as
they prescribe unto him, then they will stand oblieged
to continue in the faith of Christ; but if they find not
their directions obeyed, and their petitions in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
granted, then with grief of heart they begin to
complain, and to pretend that they dare not approach
unto God or Christ, so long as these petitions are not
first granted and felt to be granted.</p>
               <p>This temptation doth invert and overturn the order
of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s calling: for, Christ doth not call unto him
well-doers, or these that do found their faith upon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40880:80"/>
their own good behaviour, and lean to their own
works, which they desire to find in themselves, before
they fasten faith on Christ; but Christ doth call sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in their own sense and acknowledgment, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all confidence in their own works, past, present
or to come; He calleth such as are lost in their own
sense, and do feel themselves utterly unable so much as
to think a good thought of themselves, that they may be
cloathed with the imputed righteousnesse of Christ,
and indued with the spirit of sanctification by him;
and Christs will is, that they who believe in him, abide
in him, and suck by faith out of him (as the branches
do suck sap out of the tree) grace to bring forth fruits
more and more abundantly: for, this is the order
which Christ doth prescribe unto his disciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
15. 5. <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth much fruit: for, without me ye can do nothing.</hi>
Whosoever therefore will not believe in Christ or do
think it is not lawfull to approach unto him, till first
they find in themselves amendment of life and evident
fruits of saving faith, they do in effect change the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the covenant of grace, and do suspend their
faith in Christ till they find works to build upon,
when it were their duty, the more they feel their barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
so much the more straitly to lay hold on Christ
and hold him fast, and ply him with earnest supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to make good his promise to them who do abide
in him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 5.</p>
               <p>5. It is necessary to presse every man, who doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his justification by faith, that he be carefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the morall law, or ten commands, as the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and unchangeable rule of good works prescribed of
God: for, <hi>Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill
it, Matth.</hi> 5. 17. He hath indeed unto believers in
him, dissolved the <hi>covenant</hi> of the law, not only by his
doctrine, teaching them, that by the works of the law
no flesh shall be justified in the sight of God, because
by the law, is the knowledge of sin gotten, but no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40880:81"/>
from sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. But also by <hi>absolving</hi>
every believer in him, that walketh not after the flesh,
but after the spirit, from all condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Mean while he hath not broken the yoke of <hi>obedience</hi>
of the law from off the believer, as he hath broken off
the yoke of the <hi>covenant</hi> of works; but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair,
he prescribes to them who come unto him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sin, that they take on his yoke upon them,
and bring forth works of new obedience, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29.
and this is the order which the Apostle doth prescribe,
<hi>Tit. 3. 8. This is a faithfull saying, and these things I will
thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God,
might be carefull to maintain good works: these things are
good and profitable unto men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The moral precepts of the law are so to be pressed,
that the hearers, whether un-converted or converted,
may, by them, whether in some measure obeyed or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed,
be driven to Christ, that the law may ever, in
some sort, be a pedagogue unto Christ: for, before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
sin must be made manifest by the law, and the
merit of sin committed, must be shown forth, that the
man to be converted may see himself in a lost condition,
and that he must certainly perish, except he flee for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to Christ the Redeemer, that by him he may have
remission of sin.</p>
               <p>And after a mans conversion, the believer must, by
the precepts of the law, be convinced of his duty and
inability to perform obedience, except, by grace, power
be communicated unto him from Christ both to will
and to do. And when he hath gotten grace to give
obedience in some measure, yet must he examine his
best works by the rule of the commands, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the imperfection of his service, that he may be
more and more humbled in himself, and glory only in
the imputed righteousness of Christ, and withall give
unto Christ the glory of any good thing which he hath
in any measure done well.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:40880:81"/>
7. The threatnings also all of them, must so be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in general, as both converted and un-converted
may be forced to run to Christ, who only can deliver
the un-converted from guiltiness and wrath, and death
eternal deserved by sin; and who only can deliver those
who are converted from the deserved punishment of
their sins, and from the execution of the sentence which
the law pronounceth; and who only can make them
eshew and hold off the way which God hath cursed.</p>
               <p>And it is easie to judge how much cause of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
the godly shall have, by daily comparing their
actings with the law, and how dear and precious Christ
must be to them, who giveth unto them, as many delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
from death, as they commit sins, and do fail of
their oblieged obedience to God.</p>
               <p>8. A sinner already convicted of sin and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
and hardness of his own heart, and who is grieved
for the same, must not be skarred nor deterred from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto Christ, till first he attain such a prescribed mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of contrition as he conceiveth his sins do call for;
which measure, un-skilfull Physicians do rigidly exact
of sinners, who are desirous of repentance, pretending
for their rigidity, their fear, lest if such sinners should
be so easily admitted unto Christ, the work of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
should be marred in them, and presumption should
have way and be fostered in them: this fear is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
because it belongs to Christ alone to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and he came to call sinners (convicted of sin and
destitute of repentance in their own estimation and
sense) unto repentance, that he may give them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
We grant that there is a danger, lest a sinner,
lightly touched with the sting of the conscience, do not
well weigh the weight of his sin and the merit of it,
and that he go to Christ with his lips only when his
heart is far from him; but, on the other hand, there is
no less hazard, left he who is destitute of repentance in
his own sense, and not permitted to go to Christ to have
it, may either be driven to dispair, or conceive, that by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40880:82"/>
his own pains on his own heart, repentance must be
wrought before he go to Christ, <hi>whom God hath exalted
with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give
repentance unto Israel and remission of sins,</hi> Act. 5. 31.</p>
               <p>We must be wary therefore, lest a burdened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in any measure, being excluded from going to
Christ till he be in such and such a measure humbled,
set himself so upon bodily exercise of ordinances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
daring to go to Christ, as that he put some merit in
effect, upon his bodily exercise which he useth, to bring
himself unto contrition, or else turn desperatly careless,
and leave off all using of means.</p>
               <p>We need not fear, that instantly upon a sinners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Christ, he shall find too soon consolation, and
so not be humbled as need were: for, Christ is only
wise, and can prudently deal with the sinner coming
unto him; he hath eye-salve to give his proud merchant,
to let him see his blindness, poverty and misery, as well
as gold and garments to the poor and naked: but if
any be proud and rich in their own conceit, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
toward him without sense of sin, he can suspend
them from comfort, till first he rebuke and chasten them,
and keep them off from felt access a while, till they be
truly humbled, and thirst in earnest after pardon and
imputed righteousness.</p>
               <p>9. As the narrow way to the kingdom of heaven
must not be made straiter then God hath made it, So
neither must the way be made broader then God hath
made it, and reignies loosed to mens lusts, as if believers
sins were either none, or but light ones: for, God is not
a favourer of sin, and whosoever do turn the grace of
God into wantonness, undoubtedly they are ignorant
both of the Law and of the Gospel. Wherefore the
Law and the Gospel must be so tempered, that on the
one hand, none who would be at Christ, and through
him at mortification of their sinfull nature, be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged;
and on the other hand, that no man, boasting of
his profession of faith, be strengthened in his iniquity:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40880:82"/>
for, this is the true sense and intent of God, both in his
threatnings and promises, that none despair, hearing
threatnings, but repent and live; and that none presume
to sin, upon hearing his gracious promises, but walk in
fear before him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 10, 11, 12. to <hi>v.</hi> 20. and
Christ doth blot out from the number of the saved, all
them who break off and make void any of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and do teach men so to do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
               <p>10. Because God doth make use of the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in his Word, both for moral swasion and for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
operation of saving faith, and bringing forth
fruits of new obedience; therefore the force of God's
arguments and inducements (as occasion is offered)
must so be opened up, and sharpned and pressed, that
the hearers, being soundly convinced of the holiness,
equity verity and necessity of the Lords commands, may
at least be morally perswaded to yield unto them. And
to this end, that hearers must be exhorted, that they call
to mind and weigh such and such arguments unto du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that by reasoning with themselves, they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
by Gods bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ssing to believe the Word of God;
So did <hi>Paul,</hi> directing his speech to the governour <hi>Felix,</hi>
brash the castle of his conscience with this engine, that
he near by took it in, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. and so did he deal
with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whom he near-by perswaded to become
a Christian, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 28. and this was his endeavour to
perswade all his hearers to believe the truth he taught,
2 Cor. 5. 11. <hi>Knowing therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>the terror of
the Lord, we perswade men.</hi> And the same Apostle hath
taught all Christs disciples to exercise the faculty of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
in the mater of strengthening their faith and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of obedience, that having set before them the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which the Word of God doth furnish they may
sum up the truth in conclusions drawn there-from, and
by holy reasoning, tye themselves to believe and obey
the Word of God, <hi>Rom. 6. 11. Likewayes</hi> (saith he) by
reasoning, <hi>reckon ye your selves to be deal unto sin, but alive
unto God through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> And giveth an
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40880:83"/>
example of this reasoning, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. 15. The love of
God constraineth us, because we thus judge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>11. Because the Lord divers wayes, according to his
own wisdom, exerciseth men, that sometime by his long-suffering
patience he leads them unto repentance, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
also by his word and rods, he doth drive them
thereunto; therefore let the use of all exercises, all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and afflictions, and the use of all benefits and
divine dispensations of providence, be carefully made
use of, that men may so look upon Gods bounty and
long-suffering on the one hand, and upon their own
sins and ill deservings on the other hand, as they may
be led and constrained in love to seek after so gracious
a God, and to flee for refuge unto Christ, mourning for
their provoking of justice so oft against themselves;
and in whatsoever condition, of prosperity or adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
to submit themselves to God, however he shall be
pleased to dispose of them.</p>
               <p>12. The doctrine of reprobation must not be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatly
applyed to any particular person, how wicked
soever he shall for the present appear; neither must
the suspicion which any man may have of his own
reprobation be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ostered, because particular reprobation
of this or that person, is among the secrets of the Lord,
not to be medled with, whereof a man may not give
out sentence before the Lord hath revealed his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.
But on the contrair, all the hearers must be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and pressed to be wary to entertain any hostile
thought of God, or to foster suspicions of him, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable,
but rather think of him as their faithfull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
just indeed, yet mercifull, long-suffering and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
both to the kind and the un-kind, as they shall
find, if they will seek him: for, Sathan will press this
temptation hard enough, and foster the suspicion which
he hath suggested against God, in the minds of them
whom God hath afflicted, albeit he get no assistance by
any imprudent and un-just application of the Lords
Word, unto this or that particular person to conclude
their reprobation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:40880:83"/>
13. The scope of all doctrine must be this, that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may be humbled in the sense of their unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
indigence, infirmity and unworthinesse; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humbled, may be led unto Christ, believe in him,
and be more and more glued unto him, and grow in
the love of him, and rest their souls upon him, as God,
one with the Father and holy Spirit, worshiping him
in spirit and truth, endeavouring according to their
vocation to advance his Kingdom in themselves and
others. And to this end, let neither on the one hand
his incarnation, nor humiliation in the dayes of his
flesh, wherein he was in paying the promised price of
our Redemption, derogat any thing to the estimation
of his person, who is one God with the Father and
holy Spirit, God over all blessed for ever; Nor on the
other hand, his Majesty make sinners stand off, or be
afraid to make their adresse to him; but, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair,
that the personall union of the divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature in him, and his cloathing himself with the
offices of Prophet, Priest and King, may allure all
sinners, who hear of him, to come to him as <hi>Media-tour,</hi>
who will not deal with them who come unto
him as a judge against them, but as an advocat,
Surety, and intercessor for them, <hi>and who will save to the
uttermost every one that come unto God through him,</hi>
Heb. 7. 25.</p>
               <p>14. For tryall of a mans regeneration and coming
rightly to Christ, and growing in grace, the exercise of
these three duties are necessarily required, to wit,
1. The exercise of repentance, or the entertaining in
himself of the sense of his naturall sinfulnesse and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to do good, and of the power of inherent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
whereby he may be made more and more to
renounce all confidence in himself, and walk humbly
before God.</p>
               <p>2. The exercise of faith, or the daily renewed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
of Christ for grace, and actuall help in all
things, as his case requireth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:40880:84"/>
3. The exercise of love, or the endeavour of new
obedience, flowing from love to God and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
through Christ.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the more speciall application of divine covenants, for
removing the impediments of regeneration.</head>
               <p>VVE have spoken of the prudent application of
divine covenants in generall, it followeth that
we speak of the curing of the sicknesses of the conscience
concerning regeneration more specially. Some of these
sicknesses, do tend to hinder regeneration, that it be
not wrought at all, whereof we shall speak God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the rest of this first book. Other sicknesses, do
tend to obscure the work of regeneration begun, and
to foster questions in the regenerat man and make him
doubt whether he be regenerat or not? or whether he
be in the state of grace or not? and of these we shall
speak somewhat in the second book. And last of all,
some cases and sicknesses of the conscience, do tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the deceiving of the regenerat man about his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition, wherein he is, without calling his
state in question at the first, and of these we shall speak
in the third book.</p>
               <p>2. As for the first sort, these cases which impede
and altogether marr regeneration, cannot easily be
numbered, because of the multitude of deceits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the unregenerat are deluded; but it shall suffice for
our purpose, to name some of them only for examples
cause; in handling whereof the way of curing other
like cases may be observed.</p>
               <p>In handling of these cases, it is not to be expected
we should follow any exact method, or accurat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of one case from another; partly, because many
faults may be variously interwoven one with another;
partly, because in all these cases, the same faults are
found after divers wayes to put forth their poyson. We
therefore, that we may follow the easiest course, shal
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40880:84"/>
divide all unregenerat men, impeding their own rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
in three ranks. The first rank shall be of those
who eshew so far as they can all examination of their
own conscience, least it should pronounce sentence of
their state and disquiet them. The second rank shall
be of those who do judge themselves indeed according
to the law of God, but after examination do despair of
any remedy. The third rank shall be of those, who
make a slight examination of themselves, and upon
some slight pretence give our sentence of absolution of
themselves which God will not allow.</p>
               <p>3. As to the first rank, to wit, of those that eshew
all examination of their own conscience, we shall name
only seven sicknesses, or impediments hindering their
self-examination and passing sentence on themselves.
The first is <hi>gross ignorance</hi> of their naturall sin and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and of deliverance to be had through Christ, and
of the duty required of them that are delivered by
Christ. The second is <hi>a false religion,</hi> or damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in judgment about the maters of salvation, and
Gods worship: In which errour, so long as a sinner
doth lye, he cannot be humbled for the damnable
course he is in, or put question about his way. The
third is <hi>dissembled unbelief</hi> and atheism, covered over
with gross hypocrisie, which under hand doth reject
the rule of examination. The fourth is <hi>the brutish stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the cauterized conscience. The fifth is <hi>a vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
of fear</hi> to examine themselves, least it drive them to
desperation. The sixth is <hi>a lazy delaying</hi> of examination
from day to day. The seventh is <hi>immoderat care</hi> for things
of this life.</p>
               <p>4. Concerning all these impediments hindering self-examination,
these three things are observable in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
1. albeit all or some of these evils may fall upon
the reprobat, yet are they not their proper maladies;
for, some of the elect before their regeneration, may
lye for a time under one or moe of these evils. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Pastor, hoping the best of all, because he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40880:85"/>
knoweth not the marks of reprobation, must deal with
all his hearers to guard them against all these evils; that
the elect, whom God will bless with the faith and
obedience of his commands, may be saved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must distinguish between a voluntary
examination of the conscience, whereunto the godly
do in their best condition set themselves daily, and a
forced examination and wakning up of the conscience
whether the sinner will or not. This sort of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may come either by preaching of the Word, an
example whereof we have in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elix</hi> the Governour, who
at the hearing <hi>Pauls</hi> discourse of vertues and vices, fell
a trembling, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. Or this wakening of the
conscience may come by affliction, whereof we have
an example of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s brethren, whose consciences
did lye sleeping securely under the guilt of distressing
their brother <hi>Ioseph,</hi> but by affliction at length were
wakened, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. The Pastors part here is, not
only to exhort men to a voluntair examination of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but also by the sword of the spirit, must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to open the apostums of proud sinners, discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto them, as occasion serveth, their wickedness,
and denouncing the wrath of God against them, if
possibly the Lord shall give them repentance, as he did
to the hearers of <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2. 37.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let not a Preacher be too sollicit and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
about the success of his labours, when he hath to
do with obstinat sinners, whose consciences cannot be
wakened, neither by challenges nor threatnings, nor
exhortations: But after he hath used means publickly
and privately, let him commit the mater unto God,
who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,
and whom he will he hardeneth. It may suffice him,
that all Christs sheep will at length hear his voice.
Only let not the Pastor despair utterly of any man, but
even toward those that are excommunicat, let him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
such a course as may reduce them unto repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as the Apostle giveth direction, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3, 14, 15.</p>

                  <head>For removing of the first impediment of self-examination.</head>
                  <p>BUt that we may speak more particularly of the cure
of these seven evil diseases, for removing of the first
impediment, to wit, <hi>gross ignorance;</hi> it is not needfull to
say much of catechetick instruction: seing in all
Churches, it is presupposed there is some form of a
Catechise, wherein the rudiments of saving knowledge
are set down, by way of question and answer, for the
use of children, and of the ruder sort come to years.
Only, we offer to those that intend the holy ministery,
this overture, for disposing and preparing people, for
a more easie up-taking of some formed Catechise: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
most part of formed Catechises, are somewhat
larger then they can be read at one time, or being read
can be explicat any other way then by parcels, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
questions and answers at one time, and so many at
another time, which how hardly it can be all explicat
to the whole congregation, in a long time, experience
may bear witness; therefore it may serve to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
if so many of the ruder and ignorant sort, as may
well be gathered together into one place at one time, the
Pastor should profess before them all, that he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to hold forth unto them a short sum of saving
doctrine in six or seven heads of doctrine, so that in
the space of an hour or thereby, before they dissolve
their meeting, they may, if they be attentive and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to learn, have some measure of found light and
understanding of the grounds of true religion.</p>
                  <p>After which preface used, let him so shortly or
plainly as he is able, speak something, first, of the
creation of the world by God the Father, God the Son,
and God the holy Ghost, the only one true God in
three persons; and something also of the creation of
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> our first parents, according to Gods
Image, in wisdom, holiness and happiness; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the covenant of works made between God and
them, including their posterity, the summe of which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40880:86"/>
covenant is this, Do this and live, but if thou sin, thou
shalt die.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let him speak somewhat of the breach
of the covenant of works by our first parents, in whose
loynes we are all made guilty of death according to the
tenor of that covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let him speak of the remedy provided in
the counsell of God, before time, but revealed timously
after the fall of our first parents, to wit, the covenant of
Redemption, between God and God the Son designed
Mediatour, Christ Jesus our Lord, the sum whereof is,
<hi>Gen. 3. 15. the seed of the woman shall tread down the head
of the serpent,</hi> &amp;c. That is to say, it is agreed in the
counsell of God, that the second person shall be born
of a woman, and suffer for the sins of the elect, and
destroy sin and death, the works of the devil.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let him speak of the covenant of grace and
reconciliation between God and believers in Christ, the
summe whereof is this, whosoever do acknowledge
their sin and flye to Jesus Christ for relief from sin and
wrath, shall not perish, but have eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, let him speak of the two seals of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to wit, Baptisme and the Lords Supper, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the covenant, with the benefits held out therein to
all believers, is sealed.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, let him speak of the necessity of amendment
of life and bringing forth of good works for glorifying
God, and probation of the sincerity of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, let him speak of the day of Judgment
when Christ shall come in the clouds, and perfect to
all his elect and believers in him, all his promises of
righteousness and eternal life, and cast all the wicked
and unreconciled into the fire of hell. The same course
may be taken with ruder ignorants in private, whose
conscience is wakened with terrour. After that about
the space of an hour the Pastor hath spoken to all these
heads shortly, and repeated again, and inculcat at
some other few meetings, till the people have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40880:86"/>
understood the business, then he may draw forth
these seven heads in some few questions, taking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of the people in their own words as they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the purpose.</p>
                  <p>These grounds being laid, the Pastor shall find by
Gods blessing some desire and appetite raised in the
people after more knowledge of these grounds, and
hope put in them to overtake a formed Catechise, and
to have it by heart as may be: To which end, the
people must be encouraged by promises on the one
hand, and stirred up by threatenings on the other hand,
such as are, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. and, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7, 8. and other
like places.</p>
                  <p>Now when the people or any ignorant before, is
begun to understand these seven grounds, they must be
pressed to make use thereof; and that, 1. they should
acknowledge their sins and deserved judgment, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the covenant of works, which curseth every
sinner for every sin. 2. That they should flye for refuge
to Christ according to the covenant of grace. And,
3. that every one who is fled to Christ for grace and
mercy, must take on his yoke and endeavour new
obedience of his holy commands, by his grace and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>For removing of the second impediment.</head>
                  <p>THe second impediment of self-examination, which is
an unrenewed mans infection with some deadly
errour in religion, and this is not easily removed: for,
the conscience that is deceived by errour, absolveth the
sinner from the crime, whereof the errour maketh him
guilty, how grievous soever it be, and therefore so
long as he lyeth in the errour, he securely contemneth all
accu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ations and threatenings for his errour and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
practice, till he be convinced of his errour. And
usually four causes do concur to obdure him in his
errour. The first is the cunningness and malice of the
devil, who when he cannot altogether obscure and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40880:87"/>
suppress all the articles of saving doctrine, nor banish
the Scripture out of the world, he useth by his emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
(of old destinat to this damnation) to spread
doctrines of devils in the visible Church, whereby so
far as he can he may detain men in their sins.</p>
                  <p>The second cause is, the wisdom of the flesh, which
is enimity to God, and therefore very bent to defend
every lust whereunto men are inclined, and to sight
against the truth of God contrair to their lusts.</p>
                  <p>The third cause is, the multitude of these who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with the perverted conscience, and avouch the
same errour.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, the righteous judgment of God, who
upon such as receive not the truth in love, sendeth
powerfull delusions, and efficacy of errour, that they
may beleeve a lye, and so be damned, who have not
received the truth in love, but have pleasure in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</p>
                  <p>2. But because the Pastor cannot know any mans
reprobation in particular, and therefore must take the
best course he can for every mans salvation, who is
under his charge, if the erroneous person cannot be
content to fall upon Christian conference, in private
with the Pastor, it seemeth not expedient to fall flat at
the first upon the errour wherewith he is infected, but
to hold upon agreed unto principles, and from these
grounds, lay open the merit of these sins, whereof the
erroneous party will grant himself no lesse guilty, then
other men will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound to be, and labour to convince
him that for these common sins, no ransom can satisfie
Gods justice save the perfect obedience which Christ
gave to the Father, even to the death of the crosse, in
name of all that flee unto him for the benefit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
If the erroneous party can condescend to
cast himself wholly on Christs mercy, offered in the
Gospel for pardon of acknowledged sin, then at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time the conference may be further followed, and
the danger of the errour may be laid out before the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40880:87"/>
and he no more urged for the time, but that
he would consider what hath been told him, and that
he would by prayer for Christs cause, beg light from
God in the point questioned; And so go on with him
in all meeknesse and evidence of love to his soul, as the
Lord openeth a door for using of all means that may
reclaim the party erroneous.</p>
                  <p>3. But if the errour be likely to infect the flock, let
the Pastor openly refute the errour or heresie, and that
not only by hinting at some arguments against it, but
of set purpose once at least, solidly shewing how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair
it is to the word of God, and what are the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
consequences thereof, that it may become in the
sight of the judicious, no lesse vile and odious then
gross transgressions against the second table of the law;
which sort of sins is more hated of naturall reasonable
men, then sins against the first table: for, natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s light
is sharper sighted in the mutual duties of man to man,
then in the maters of God and Religion, wherein a
man hath no light at all in speciall, save that which is
by revelation of Scripture. The true intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, if a man be ignorant of it, or shall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
it, the conscience runneth headlong (without the
least secret check) after the errour and darkness which
men naturally love more then truth and light.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>For removing the third impediment.</head>
                  <p>THe third impediment of self-examination, to wit,
infidelity, dissembled and covered with grosse hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
whereof the man himself is conscious, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieth
to hide, and delighteth himself in his cheating of
others, of all evils is most hardly cured: Of this sort
of hypocrits are they, who think they can give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of all their wayes to any man. And because they
respect the laws of the kingdom, wherein they live,
more then the Scripture, therefore they cover over all
their avarice and cruelty with practice of law, that
beholders, think what they please, can say nothing
against their following of the civil law: for, such men
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40880:88"/>
fear not God, and are not afraid for his judgment.
And albeit they largely commend the piety of holy
men, before some auditors to whom they conceive
their speach will be plausible, yet under hand, and
among such as themselves are, they do but laugh and
scorn all such piety, as puts men in hazard of any
worldly inconvenience: for, in those mens eyes the
simplicity of the godly is fool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shnesse, and their faith
in God, in their estimation, is madnesse, especially if
for defence of the truth of Religion they suffer perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
These hypocrits the Psalmist calleth <hi>unwise</hi>
and <hi>foolish,</hi> Psal. 14. 1. <hi>The fool hath said in his heart,
there is no God;</hi> and, vers. 6. <hi>You have shamed the counsell
of the poor, because the Lord is his refuge.</hi> Such men as
these, albeit they faign themselves to be holy, yet in
heart they are haters of all true saints, in whom the
sparks of grace and solid Religion doth appear: for,
so saith the Lord of them, <hi>Psal. 14. 4. They eat up my
people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord.</hi> They
have a form of godlinesse, but in their deeds they deny
the power of it; for, they beleeve never a word of
what is preached of things spirituall, revealed in the
word of God: No wonder therefore that they will
not examine themselves, nor receive any accusation
from their own consciences for any sin of this sort,
which concerneth godlinesse.</p>
                  <p>2. The causes of such mens hardening of their heart,
may be four; the first is, the measure of worldly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
granted to them and others like themselves, above
common people, with the conceit whereof they are so
puffed up, that they care for nothing save this present
world, they acknowledge no other holinesse, but civil
observance of humane laws, as if Scripture and all
Religious exercises were to be referred to this only end,
that men, living according to the laws and customes
received, into the Societies they live into, should study
to make the best they can of this present world. And
this worldly and carnall wisdom, is called, <hi>Psal. 1. the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40880:88"/>
counsell of the ungodly,</hi> because all ungodly persons do
think it shall be more safe to walk in the wayes of their
wisdom, then to be hemmed in by the laws of God.</p>
                  <p>The second cause of their obduration, is carnall
confidence in their worldly prosperity, which they
hope alwayes to enjoy, and that by the principles of
their own wisdom, <hi>Psal. 10. 6. he hath said in his heart,
I shall never be moved, I shall never be in adversity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third cause, is the stumbling block of the cross
and affliction, wherewith they perceive the godly usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to be exercised. Upon which offence they stumble
the more readily because they judge, that the greatest
part of the affliction of the godly proceeds from their
own imprudency, and do ascribe their own prosperity
to their own wisdom, wherein they are so lifted up in
their own estimation, that they despise all men in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of themselves, <hi>Psal. 10. 5. As for his enemies, he
puffeth at them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth cause is, the not observing, the slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and despising of Gods Judgments, concerning
which they do not give credit unto God when he
speaketh, and therefore do not make use of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his hands, <hi>Psal. 10. 5. Thy judgments are far
above out of his sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Albeit there be very small hope of the conversion
of any such, because they cannot abide free dealing
from any man in private, for to give them any admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
is to them a reproach, and they cannot endure
it, and nothing can cut them at the heart more then
that any man should suspect them of hypocrisie and
atheism; yet because no Pastor may despair of any man
or judge him a reprobat, so long as the long-suffering
patience of God inviteth him to repentance, therefore
the Pastor must deal with such men in the general in his
sermons, that from the Scripture he may convince them
of their ignorance of Gods wayes and of their atheism.</p>
                  <p>To which end and purpose, first, he must point
such men forth in their colours as the Scripture doth
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40880:89"/>
describe them, yet so as he hold himself in generall in
dealing with all such persons without particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of any man by particular circumstances,
whereby such a man one or moe of the auditors may
appear to be picked out and shot at.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he must denounce gravely and with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
the heavy Judgments of God against them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he must pull the mask of civil honesty off
their face, and let them know the righteousness of
Christ imputed to humble sinners flying to him, to be
the only garment to hide nakedness, if possibly the
hearer may conceive hope he may be forgiven his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
hypocrisie, and be allured unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, let him often against such persons make
use of the Apostles admonition,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 18, 19. Let no
man deceive himself, if any man among you seemeth to be
wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be
wise, for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God:
for, it is written, he taketh the wise in their own crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, let the Pastor observe the occasion, if at
any time it shall please God to lay calamity on such a
man; and then let him wisely labour with all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and tenderness to awaken up his conscience to take
notice of the sparks of wrath, least he perish in Gods
displeasure, if he do not humble himself before God
and draw in to Christ; upon which condition let him
make the fairest offers of grace and mercy that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
can yield to him, if possibly the Lord may give him
repentance and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

                  <head>For removing the fourth impediment.</head>
                  <p>THe fourth impediment of self-examination, is the
stupidity and senslesness of the conscience, past feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as it were, burnt with a hot iron. This disease
may be seen in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>otted Epicures, given to their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish

themselves then beasts, and such monsters of men by
frequent sinning have extinguished all sense of sin; for,
albeit by nature there is some remainder of light in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len

written in their heart, as far as to make them inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,

                     </gap>t in the natural man some natural power of the

their fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sh, that they will not hear any admonition or
check of the conscience which might make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse,
but do run madly after all sort of uncleannesse,
corrupting themselves as brute beasts.</p>
                  <p>The like disposition may be seen in openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
persons, who not only in their deeds have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the power of godliness, but also renounce the
profession of all form of godlinesse, and shamelesly foam
forth their ungodlinesse, as an open rotten grave casts
forth the stink thereof. Of this sort are these, who
when they do blaspheme, will not be reproved. <hi>Psal.</hi>
12. 4. <hi>Our tongues are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> and
who as dogs do trample under-foot all holy things
and rent them who reprove them, and who insult over

<hi>where is the promise of his coming.</hi> Such as these are
practically atheists, and in some sort also in their
minds; for, albeit they have some natural principles
of a Godhead imprinted on them, yet they smother all
knowledge of God and belch out their own shame
against God and religion and all the godly.</p>
                  <p>2. Of mens falling unto such a fearfull abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
four causes may be rendered. The first is, the
mans violence used against his conscience frequently
in committing of grievous sins wittingly, and from the
slighting of the admonitions of the conscience arising
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40880:90"/>
up to the contempt of all accusations which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
can lay in against him, and at last boldly rising
up against the conscience, as it were, to be avenged of
it, for rebukeing him, by committing these same sins
most frequently, for which he hath been oftnest reproved
by his conscience. The second cause may we reckon
the devil, who thinketh it too little to allure men to sin,
and harden their heart in it, and spoil them of all sense
of their sin, except he also draw them to renounce God
and bark against him, and become like the devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so far as he can drive them. The third cause we
make the holy justice of God, giving over the man who
contemneth the light and checks of his conscience, unto
a reprobat sense, that being deprived of common use
of reason and judgment, he may run mad in his sin like
the devil: for, if God did punish the heathen so for
this sort of sinning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. what wonder he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
seven times more, them, who thus rebell against the
light of holy Scripture? yea, these that do not come to
this hight are punished, by giving them over to strong
delusions, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11. The last, but sinless, cause, is
the deep wisdom of God, who suffering such wretches
to fill up such a measure of sin, doth make manifest to
all beholders, the power and poyson of in-born sin in
man, and draweth forth to light the natural enimity of
man against God, the seeds whereof is in all men, and
could hardly be believed to be incident to men, except
it were by experience seen and found in some men.</p>
                  <p>For remedy of this evil, it is too little that such a
monster should be driven from all Church-society, and
given over to Sathan; it is the part of the Magistrate
to bind beasts and mad devils, and punish them as it
becometh the bearer of the sword to do for avenging
of evil-doers. But, if the Magistrate do not his part,
yet, let the Pastor do what in him lyeth; for, albeit the
Scripture giveth small hope of the recovery of such
vile monsters because of the stupidity of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that cannot be wrought upon by man, yet seing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40880:90"/>
such evils have been found, even in some elect, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi>
and some of the Corinthians before their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. and because experience
hath often found, that some of this sort going to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
execution by the Magistrate, have been converted
and saved by faith in Jesus Christ; a Pastor should
not altogether despair of such vile men, but essay what
may be done by conference, especially when God sends
calamity on them, or the Magistrate executs justice on
them for any crime, if possibly such miscreants, being
convinced of their perverseness, may repent and flye to
Christ, the Redeemer of such as flye unto him.</p>

                  <head>For removing the fifth impediment.</head>
                  <p>1. THe fifth impediment of self-examination, is a false
fear of no small danger to their souls, if they
should ripe up their conscience for by-gones; for, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they feel themselves quiet, they think it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
and dangerous to trouble their own peace.
Such persons will tell you, that their faith is surely set
on God, and that they never had any doubt or suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of Gods love to them, and therefore dare not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themselves with self-examination, first, because all
Sermons bid them firmly trust in God. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they know, if they should trouble themselves with
self-examination, they might soon weaken their faith, as
they conceive. Thirdly, because they know the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of Sathan, as they say, to whom if a door were
op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned by search of their old wayes, they fear he should
over-charge them with accusations, and drive them to
desperation, as (say they) it hath befallen sundry, who
after wakening their consciences, never rested till they
put hand in themselves, not being able to bear the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their conscience.</p>
                  <p>There are other some, who, nill they will they, are
drawn before the tribunal of Gods Judgment, and
their conscience beginneth to stir against them, which
so soon as they do perceive, incontinent they interrupt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40880:91"/>
the process. Such a one was the heathen Governour
<hi>Felix,</hi> Act. 24, 25. who after hearing, for a little, <hi>Pauls</hi>
discourse of righteousness, temperance and judgment
to come, did tremble, and therefore desired <hi>Paul</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
for the time. Of this sort also are they who do
with-draw themselves from Church-meetings, and
hearing of publick Sermons, lest they should be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the serious speeches of a faithfull Pastor.
Some are also of this sort, who take the course that
King <hi>Saul</hi> did take, and call for a minstrel, or for merry
company to suppress the voice of their barking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or do by some such way divert their conscience
from entering in judgment with them.</p>
                  <p>2. The causes of this evil in the un-regenerat man,
may be found these four, (besides others more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar)
First, ignorance of the duty of self-examination
prescribed of God, <hi>Ps.</hi> 4. 4. or a voluntar mis-kenning
that such a duty is required of all. The second cause
is a fixed purpose to go on securely in their old wayes.
The third cause is, the sense of the sweetness they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they do find, and have found of a long time in the
carnal rest and sleep of their conscience. The fourth
cause is a perswasion, that they could not rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of the grips of their conscience, nor endure
the blind blowes, which conscience, set down on the
tribunal, should inflict on them; which sorrow and
vexation they conceive they cannot otherwayes eshew,
but by throwing down their conscience from the bench
that he enter in no processe against them.</p>
                  <p>3. When the Pastor hath to do with such a man, his
first care must be, that this blind fear may be drawn
forth to the light, by shewing him, that this his fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the light and hiding himself in darkness, is
to no purpose, and that there is no place for him to flye
unto and hide himself from God. Secondly, let him
presse the decree of God, that all men must once die, and
then come to judgment: wherein he cannot misse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
condemnation and endless torment from an
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40880:91"/>
angry Judge; except he now judge and condemn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and flye to Christ the Mediator while it is to day,
while Christ is exercising his Mediatory-office, and
is inviting all sinners to repent, and calling all weary
and heavy loaden to come unto him. Thirdly, let the
Pastor shew to those fearfull persons, that this their tear
is groundlesse; for, if they minde to draw in to God,
they need not fear to confesse all their sins and flye to
his grace, which if they do not, the sleep which they
love to lye into is deadly, because God hath said, <hi>There
is no peace to the wicked,</hi> Isa. 48. 21. Fourthly, let him
presse the precepts for self-examination and judging
our selves, <hi>Ps.</hi> 4. 4. and trying whether we be in the
faith or not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. except they would chuse to
be judged of God without mercy. But seing here we
speak to Pastors, or to such as aim at the holy Ministry,
we need not insist, but with the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17.

                  <head>For removing the sixth impediment.</head>
                  <p>THe sixth impediment is, a lazy and sluggish putting
off of the duty of self-examination from time to
time. And many are guilty of this sinfull solly, who
will grant, that it is a duty lying on them to set their
conscience on work for tryal of their state or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but like ill debtors, who, promising to pay as oft
as they meet with their creditors, do notwithstanding
put off time and delay the work from day to day; Such
mens disposition in spiritual things is well resembled
in the description of the sluggard, <hi>Prov. 6. 10. How
long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out
of thy sleep? Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the hands to sleep. So shall thy poverty come as one
that travaileth, and thy want as an armed man.</hi> And,
<hi>Prov. 26. 14, 15, 16. As the door turneth upon his hinges,
so doth the slothfull man upon his bed. The slothfull hideth
his hand in his bosom, it grieveth him to bring it again to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40880:92"/>
his mouth. The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, then
seven men that can render a reason.</hi> Such are our lazy
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>layers of examination, of whom we speak, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure to be at pains to search their wayes or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
with their heart: But, so long as God suffereth
their conscience to sleep, so long they put off the duty
of searching themselves and lye still in security, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it a torture to have their sluggish sleeping any way
interrupted by any person.</p>
                  <p>2. Of this evil disease, five causes may be given; The
first is, the abhorring of all pains in spiritual duties,
how profitable so ever diligence might prove. The
second cause is, the bewitching sense of sweetness they
conceive they feel in this their idle carriage. The third
is, the deceit of the sluggards heart, still promising to
follow his purpose of amendment of life from day to
day, and yet, albeit deceived a thousand times, he doth
give credit to his own false heart. The fourth is, a false
opinion which the sluggard entertains of his own spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
abilities, as if he were sure he could repent at any
time; and that if any sickness or appearance of death
should befall him, he would then undoubtedly make
his reckening with God and crave pardon, and so be
saved, and in such pleasant dreams he counteth himself
a much wiser man then many who do put themselves
to daily toiling and vexation, by keeping their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
on the rack-stock, when with less misery they
might follow his sluggish way of it. The fifth, but
sinlesse, cause, is the Lords lengthening of prosperity to
the sluggard, which although it should lead him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
yet he becomes hereby more and more drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ulleth himself over in a deeper sleep.</p>
                  <p>3. This sickness is not easily cured, except the Lord
take up a rod and rouse the sluggard out of his sleep.
But, as for the Pastors part, he shall do well in private
if the sluggard confesse his fault, and howsoever, to set
an edge on the law in publick, that all such sluggards
may apprehend the real danger their soul is into by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40880:92"/>
their repentance, because the indurance of this
brittle and frail life is most uncertain; for, the fool
knoweth not whether the very next following night
after admonition is given to him, his soul shall be taken
from him. Secondly, he must know, that the longer he
delay, the number of his sins and the hardnesse of his
heart, and the wrath of God against him, do daily grow
to a higher measure. Let the sluggard then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of his madnesse, if he shall delay for an hour,
by acknowledgment of his sin and flying to Christ, to
vomit up the deadly poyson of his sweetest sins, and
to have the hot burning wrath of God against him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.
Thirdly, let the deceits wherewith he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guileth
himself be laid open and refuted, and an offer
be made unto him, whether he will chuse, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be tormented for ever in the society of unclean
devils, after a short while sleep in sin in this life, rather
then while he hath time, while Christ offereth himself
Mediator in his Gospel, while he may have the sweet
fellowship of the Saints, he will chuse to put his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to it, and acknowledge his sins and flye to Christ,
that he may have peace with God and so be saved for
ever.</p>

                  <head>For removing the seventh impediment.</head>
                  <p>THe seventh impediment of self-examination, is the
too earnest care for earthly things, and the mans
involving himself in the affairs of this life: for, there
are many who do not refuse the duty of trying their
own spiritual state and condition, who notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this conviction of their duty, do spend all their
time in the businesses of this world, wherein they are so
involved and carried head-long, that they passe perfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriously
all exercises of religion, and do neither wait
for the direction of Gods Word, or of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
about what they have to do, nor call themselves
to account for what is past, done or not done. Of this
sort ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> these, of whom Christ doth speak, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18.
who being invited to a free supper, answered, some of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40880:93"/>
them, <hi>I have bought land,</hi> another, <hi>I have married a
wife,</hi> another, <hi>I have bought a yoke of oxen,</hi> &amp;c. and so
sought to be excused, for their not coming to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
all pretending their earthly affairs, as a just
reason of their slipping of the invitation given them.
Of this sort of men speaketh Christ, <hi>Math. 13. 22. He
that received seed among the thornes, is he that heareth the
Word, and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of
riches chock the word, and he becometh unfruitfull.</hi> This
sort of men are complained of, <hi>Ier. 8. 6. I hearkened
and beard, but they spoke not aright, no man repented him
of his wickedness, saying, what have I done? Every one
turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Of this evil, four causes among others may be
given, first, inordinat concupiscence of earthly things,
which eateth up all the time and travell, which the
love of things spiritual doth call for, and, as it were,
spurreth the man to the immoderat pursuing of things
temporal. The second cause is, the beguiling of the
conscience under the pretense of seeking what is lawfull
and necessary for a mans well-being in this life, as if a
mans spending of his care and pains, and time in
earthly business, in it self lawfull, were sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for neglecting things spiritual and heavenly; or,
as if it were not required of all men that hear the Word
of God pointing out the way of mens salvation, to
prefer that one thing necessary before all commodities
of this earth; for, <hi>what can it avail a man to gain the
whole earth, if he lose his own soul?</hi> The third cause is,
the deceitfulnesse of riches, which every man naturally
is inclined to pursue too eagerly, and which many
pragmatick busie men do attain: for, God useth to
recompence every mans diligence in a lawfull occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with a sort of external reward of the same kind
with his work: This success and rewarding of mens
industry and pains, by increasing busie mens riches,
earthly-minded men, do interpret to be the speciall
blessing of God, and an approbation of their immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40880:93"/>
pursuing after things earthly, wherein they are
much mistaken; for God never ordained any mans
civil calling to be a hinderance of the spiritual welfare
of his soul, and if any man neglect his soul and pursue
worldly riches, if he obtain them, what can be said?
but <hi>verily he hath his reward,</hi> and cannot look after the
fruit of pains taking in spiritual matters which he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
The fourth cause is, a light estimation of the
Word of God, and of maters concerning salvation
which by reason they fall not under sense and present
possession, but are offered to us in promises, and are not
bestowed for the present, therefore many are lesse care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for things promised after this life, and do follow
the more eagerly after such things whereof they can
take hold in this life.</p>
                  <p>3. The way to cure this malady, so far as pertaineth
to a Pastor, is, that both in publick sermons and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
conferences, he give unto things lawfull and to the
following of a mans civil calling the own room and
time, and wisely let men know the subordination of all
civill affairs unto the welfare of their souls, and so to
lay open the perill of mens souls, when they are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
too too eagerly their civill vocation, as in the
mean time he do not condemn mens diligence in their
callings, but that he give directions for such a wise mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of every mans care about things of this world,
that the precious excellency of the soul, and the infinit
worth of eternal life be first and above all earthly
things provided for, and that in the using or conquesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of riches no prejudice do come to his own salvation,
which is not possible a man shall do, if he do not daily
examine his own conscience carefully, and keep it in a
tender disposition, resorting to Christ upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for pardon of daily sin and keeping him, that if
riches increase, he may not set his heart thereon, but
may be forth-coming to the duties of charity towards
others as his power shall be, and opportunities shall be
offered.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning them that are like to despair.</head>
               <p>VVE have spoken of the first sort of them who do
hinder their own regeneration by abhorring,
declining, delaying and shifting off of the examination
of their consciences. The second sort or rank of those
who hinder their own conversion, is of such as after
the wakening of their own consciences, whether vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
or by compulsion, do despair of all remedy
offered unto them in the Gospel of grace in Christ, and
renouncing the counsell of God, do follow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of Sathan and their own heart.</p>
               <p>2. We distinguish a volountary examination of the
conscience from a compelled and inforced examination
thereof, as was hinted at in the former Section; for,
it is one thing to say of a man, he hath voluntarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
himself and found out his dittey and deserved
judgment, and to say of him, he is forced to examine
himself and in himself to receive sentence according as
his wayes have been: for, there are many who will
not judge themselves, yet after are forced unto it against
their will: These are said to judge themselves volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
who, by a free act of their will, do enter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be judged of their own conscience, and do go
about the work either slightly and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and strict and joyned with the chastisement of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
for neglecting or slighting or delaying of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Psal,</hi> 50. 21. This distinction is holden forth to
as by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 31, 32. If we would judge
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> selves, we should not be judged: But when we are
judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be
condemned with the world.</hi> Both these sorts of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have a blessing following upon them when Christ
is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> unto after examination: but if Christ be not fled
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40880:94"/>
unto, then desperation may follow upon both slight
and serious examination, both upon voluntary and
enforced examination.</p>
               <p>3. We do not take <hi>desperation</hi> here for every dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Gods performing of promises, or of Gods
making good of his gracious offers, but for diffidence
to obtain reconciliation with God, or to find mercy
through Christ the Mediatour. Neither do we call by
the name of <hi>desperation</hi> every diffidence to obtain mercy
and reconciliation, cast in mans mind by the tempter
Sathan, and yielded unto for a time under the sense of
Gods wrath; for, at some sits, the diffidence will
be found in renewed Saints, as in <hi>Ionab,</hi> chap. 2. 4.
<hi>Heman</hi> the Ezrait. <hi>Psal. 88. 16. David,</hi> Psal. 116. 11.
who seemed to themselves for the time to be cast off, but
but did swim out of this deep by faith. Neither do we
take <hi>desperation</hi> for every short or long ecclipse of hope,
wherein a distressed soul seems to its self to despair, yea,
and may possibly utter and profess they do despair, and
in the mean time will not renounce the use of the
means, whereby they do get, or recover hope: Such
was the condition of <hi>Heman</hi> the Ezraite, <hi>Psal. 88. 14,
15, 16. Lord why casts thou off my soul? why hidest thou
thy face from me? I am afflicted and ready to die from my
youth up, while I suffer thy terrors, I am distracted.</hi> He
thought he was cast off, yet for all that he went on
daily praying for the sense of mercy and found it,
and was directed by God to acquaint the Church unto
all generations with his long and sad exercise. But
we take <hi>desperation</hi> for a prevalent impression made by
Sathan upon the spirit of a man, that God will not
shew him mercy, and so fixed in him, as the man resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not to deal with God any more for mercy.</p>
               <p>4. Of this properly called <hi>desperation,</hi> there are two
sorts, one which we may call carelesse and secute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration,
another which we may call anxious and
tormenting desperation. <hi>Cains</hi> desperation in his last
resolution, was of the first sort, and <hi>Iudas</hi> desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40880:95"/>
was of the other sort. We call that a carelesse secure
desperation, when a sinner, being convinced of his
grosse and many sins, either believeth not Gods Word
or conceiveth God implacable and irreconciliable, and
to have destinate him to destruction according to the
sentence of the law, pronounced against such sinners
as he knoweth himself to be, and so doth harden and
obdure himself against all threatenings, and goeth on
in his own wayes, resolved to take ease and pleasure
in the world, so long as he liveth, and not to make
himself miserable before the time; Such was the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of carnall Israelits, <hi>Isa,</hi> 22. 13. who, hearing
the threatenings of the Prophets concerning the just
Judgments of God to come upon them, when they
should have humbled themselves in prayer and fasting,
in sackcloth and ashes, and sought mercy from God,
they did set themselves to make good cheer, and to feast
one another, saying, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
we shall die.</hi> Of this sort were also these in <hi>Ezekiels</hi>
time, <hi>chap. 33. 10. Thus ye speak,</hi> saying, <hi>If our sins
and transgressions be upon us, and we pine away in them,
how shall we then live?</hi> They do not deny that they are
loadened with iniquity, they doubt nothing of the
righteousnesse of the threatned Judgment; but, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the justice of Gods Judgment with their sins,
and laying aside all thought of a remedy from Gods
mercy, they flatly despair, as if there had been no
remedy provided in the Word of God for them, or as
if the threatenings had been pronounced, as sentences
pronounced absolutely, without exception of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>5. The causes of this evil, are specially these three;
the first, is grosse misbelief of Gods Word, contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all threatenings, as but the words of an angry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phee
stirred up to vent his passions against people. The
second, is the perversenesse of corrupt nature, so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
with the custom of sinning, that the conscience
not being terrified with Gods threatenings, is nothing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40880:95"/>
moved with inward accusations, which they know to
be just; whereupon they resolve neither to seek for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
nor care for reconciliation with God, not to shed
with their carnal pleasures and sinfull lusts, but will
go on in their own wayes, and take their hazard. The
third, is a false perswasion, that it is impossible they
can be reconciled to God, arising partly, from the
vileness of their former life and grosseness of their sins,
partly, from the ignorance of the Gospel, and
of the rich grace of God offered to the worst of sinners,
who shall forsake their former wayes and flye unto
Christ; and partly, arising from the ignorance of the
scope and end of the law, which is appointed to be a
pedagogue to lead and draw men unto Christ, after their
conviction of sin by the law, how grievous soever their
sins have been.</p>
               <p>6. The remedy of this sort of secure desperation is
very hard, and in some incurable, namely these, who
do not believe the threatenings and go on still in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
or, do believe the threatenings, but are so wedded
to their lusts, that they will not change their course
and maner of sinfull carriage, come what may come,
but resolve to eat and drink and be merry while they
live: Concerning whom the Prophet <hi>Isaias</hi> sayeth,
<hi>chap. 22. 14. It was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of
hostes, surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you, till
ye die, saith the Lord of hostes.</hi> The best ground of
hope is of such, who, through ignorance of the end of
the law and offer of the Gospel, have taken up a false
perswasion of their desperat estate. Now because the
Pastor hath no warrand to read the decree of any mans
reprobation in particular, his care must be in private
and publick, to waken epicures, and all besotted in
their sins, out of their deadly sleep; laying before
them, from Scripture, the unextinguishable fire of
hell, and the torments of the damned to be endured for
ever by the impenitent and unbelieving sinner on the
one hand; and on the other hand, making offer of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40880:96"/>
remission of sin and reconciliation to all who shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their former vitions wayes, and be content to
embrace Christ Jesus for their righteousnesse, sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and salvation. And to this end, let him certifie
all his hearers, that threatenings are not intended of
God to drive any man to desperation, but to lead all
to repentance, that they may be saved, and that the
exception of repentance and faith in the Redeemer,
is to be understood in every threatening, for so the
Lord hath made a plain commentary upon all his
threatenings and all his promises also, that he be not
for ever mistaken, which is this in summe, that by his
threatenings he doth not intend to make any man to
despair, but to repent and turn to God; and that by his
promises he doth not intend, that any man should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to sin, or turn his grace into wantonnesse, as is
at large set down, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33, from <hi>ver.</hi> 10. to <hi>ver.</hi> 21.
and, <hi>chap.</hi> 18. from <hi>ver.</hi> 21. to the end.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of anxious tormenting desperation.</head>
                  <p>ANxious and tormenting desperation is when a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
from the apprehension of his guiltinesse of
irremissible sins, and fear of inextricable wofull mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
wherein he hath thrown himself, doth cast away
all hope of relief to be had, and so is tortured and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within himself without rest. In this sort of despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the miserable man having wrestled a while, doth
either turn himself to a carnal temporary consolation in
this world, and maketh choyce of a carelesse and secure
desparation, that he may be rid of present anxiety, or
else he resolveth to dispatch himself by some sort of
self-murder, counting it more easie to die by his own
hand, than to live and endure the tormenting vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his own mind.</p>
                  <p>2. As for that sort of anxious desperation, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the sore byteing of the conscience once wakned, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
back again in carnal security, it is most perilous,
and giveth very small hope to the Pastor, or faithfull
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40880:96"/>
friends who perceive the man after fearfull wakening of
his conscience, to have fallen back to his old wayes,
and turned carelesse of the means of salvation: for, such
a man, is of set purpose and resolvedly wicked. Such
was the desperation of <hi>Cain,</hi> who, after a whiles
lamentation and houling for the curse pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by God, plucked up his heart, departed from
the society of the Church, where God giveth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and goeth into the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> or voluntary
banishment, and giveth himself over to building of
Cities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13, 14. Such also was the desperation
of <hi>Esau,</hi> who, when he saw he was excluded from the
spiritual blessing of the birthright, laments a little, and
then turned himself toward the earthly blessing, and
sought all his consolation in it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 34, 38. yet
such men must be dealt with, if God possibly may
bless the means.</p>
                  <p>3. As for the other sort of anxious desperation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be cured by Gods blessing of the means used, it
draweth on voluntary and deliberat self-murther. We
put a difference between <hi>brute self-murther,</hi> and <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
or <hi>deliberat</hi> self-murther: for this beastly brute self-murther,
may befall mad persons, furious, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholious,
distracted persons, or such as are beset by
some evil spirit, in whom the faculty of reasoning is so
impeded, that without the use of reason, or common
sense, they are carried to destroy themselves some way.
Such persons can hardly be called <hi>voluntary</hi> and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
self-murtherers, because they are neither able to
observe and discern their own condition, nor their
danger, wherein they are, nor any circumstances
which might hinder them from the mischief; and
therefore it cannot properly in this case be called despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
because the miserable person is not so much
capable of reason as to consider the grounds and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of hope or despair.</p>
                  <p>But voluntary self-murther, proceedeth from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called <hi>desperation,</hi> because the wretch, after
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40880:97"/>
deliberation, how to escape from misery lying on and
coming on, when all reason of hope seemeth to fail
him, he casts away any further inquisition after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
and out of apprehension, that he can be in no
worse case after his death, then he presently feeleth, and
that he can no other way be rid of his present torment
then by death, wittingly and willingly putteth hand in
himself: In this voluntary self-murther, sometime the
sense of wrath for sin committed, doth predomine, as in
<hi>Iudas</hi> the traitour, his desperation and self-murther:
sometime the apprehension of more worldly misery,
more bitter then death, doth predomine, as in King <hi>Saul,</hi>
who choosed rather to fall on his own sword, then fall
alive into the hands of the Philistines, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 4. and
in <hi>Achitophels</hi> hanging himself, when he foresaw what
misery should come upon himself, when his counsel was
not imbraced by <hi>Absalom, 2 Sam.</hi> 17. 23.</p>
                  <p>4. To speak of self-murther in general, requireth a
Treatise larger then our purpose doth permit; it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
us to speak a little to it, as the temptation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and desperation of finding Gods mercy is a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
of regeneration. To this end, where any fear
or suspicion of any intention toward this fearfull sin,
doth appear, all meeknesse should be used by all that
have interest in the person suspected, that may serve to
save the vexed party from such a mischief; God must
be in-called and requested for relief unto the patient:
Physicians should be called, and moe Pastors then one,
if they can be had, the soul in danger must by friends,
be watched and waited on, in a prudent maner night
and day, that he never be alone. If the person be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of reason, he must be dealt with freely to confesse
his temptation and purpose toward this sin, the causes
moving him must be inquired after; and if they be other
then sense of sin and fear, or feeling of Gods wrath,
then course must be taken to make the party sensible
of sin and to fear Gods wrath, and to consider, that if
they give way to that sin they are tempted unto, they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40880:97"/>
do no lesse, in effect, then cast themselves in hell, where
the justice and wrath of God shall lye upon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope of ease or ending of their everlasting torment,
from which fearfull destruction, they may be preserved
both in soul and body, if they shall acknowledge their
sin, and flye to God in Christ offering grace and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of sin and delivery from hell, and right unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
promised to all and every one who shall imbrace
Jesus Christ for their redemption. And for these, whose
vexation is mainly from the conscience of heinous sins,
and felt wrath of God pursuing them, the grace offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Gospel must be cleared unto them and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated;
if they can be moved to give reasons of their
fear and to propone their doubts, who knoweth what
blessing may follow on their free dealing, and from
faithfull answers from Scripture returned unto them?
Conferences of experimented Christians may with
profit be made use of in the patients audience, whereby
the party may receive both increase of knowledge and
some beginnings of comfort. Among other means,
godly persons, who have in their own exercise had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of such temptations, and have gotten victory
by flying unto Christ, may serve much by their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to encourage them. In some of those tempted
souls, tokens of good hope will shortly appear; in others,
it may be, none can conjecture what shall be the event,
till the time declare it, whether justice or mercy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
of God; for, both in the elect, who are cured
of this disease, and in the reprobat who perish in their
sin, the same symptoms may appear; if the anxiety and
expressions of the one and the other be compared.
Therefore, care must be had of every one under such
temptations, whatsoever the event may be and the
Lords blessing waited for in the use of the means. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sheweth us how hard exercises Gods dear children
have been under. Beside many other Saints, we shall
only name two witnesses, the one is <hi>Heman</hi> the Ezrait,
that precious soul, not much inferiour to <hi>Solomon</hi> in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40880:98"/>
1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 31. of whom no man could say he was
a weak brain and hypochondriack or melancholious
person, whose sad exercise stands registrated (<hi>Ps.</hi> 88.)
for many mans comfort. The other witnesse shall be
<hi>Iob.</hi> whose perplexities we read in his dispute with his
friends, and how he tasted of this bitter temptation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
Job 7. 13, 14, 15. <hi>When I say my bed shall comfort
me, my couch shall ease my complaint, then thou skarest me
with dreams and terrifies me with visions, so that my soul
chooseth strangling.</hi> Behold there is a very sad exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of the most holy and righteous man on earth;
there is a sore temptation even unto self-murther, but
how is this temptation over-come? first, he doth not
hide his temptation, but openeth it up in the worst
shape: this giveth the temptation vent, he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it, nor be Sathans secretar in this; and this is one
mean to weaken the temptation. Then he presenteth
it before God, and poureth out his complaint unto the
Lord, and this giveth him the victory. So let all souls
tempted unto desperation do, and cleave to God in
Christ, and they shall be victorious also.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning them that absolve themselves without
warrand.</head>
               <p>THe third rank of those that impede their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
remaineth to be spoken of. Of this
kind are all they, who, after they have slightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
themselves, and are convinced of sin and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
death, if they were dealt with in rigour of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
do unwarrantably absolve themselves, deceiving
their own conscience by a fallacy, false sylogisme or
captious reasoning, and from the conscience, as from a
blinded or seduced Judge, do draw forth a sentence of
absolution to themselves which God doth not allow.
All such persons do either lay down some false prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or ground for absolution of sinners; or, if they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40880:98"/>
lay down a true ground, they make wrong application
of that ground to themselves, and so beguile themselves
miserably.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The first sort.</head>
                  <p>SOme do grant themselves to be sinners, but do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves, that God is so mercifull as he will
not destroy any man for sin: which principle being
once laid down, no wonder such men go on in their own
way and sing a <hi>requiem</hi> to their own souls. Of this
sort of men the Lord doth speak, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 18, 19. shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he makes his covenant with his people, <hi>lest
there should be among you,</hi> saith he, <hi>a root that beareth gall
and wormwood. And it come to pass, when he heareth the
words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying,
I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my
own heart, to add drunkenness to thirst.</hi> It is possible, few
shall be found so impudent, as that they dar, in expresse
termes, professe this their mis-belief of Gods justice;
yet, they are not a few who foster this error in their
heart, who having, as it were, made a Covenant with
death and hell, are far from fearing to perish in their
sins. In this sort are all they to be ranked, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that all the threatnings in the Scripture are given
forth, to the intent, that men, being bridled by terrors,
might compose themselves to a more humane and social
life among others; who, lest they should seem Atheists
in word, do cry up Gods mercy, bounty and love to
man, so as they make small reckoning of the Lords truth
and justice, even as if the justice of God in punishing
rebels, could not consist with his mercy to the penitent,
or as if the end of creating man, could not be obtained,
if obstinat sinners be destroyed.</p>
                  <p>2. The main cause of such error, is an obstinat pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to walk after the counsel and imagination of their
own heart; and because they cannot quiet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in following their own wayes, except in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to themselves impunity in their sinning, they
presume confidently to go on in their own wayes against
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40880:99"/>
all threatenings, and so do blow their consciences
blind. Such profane presumption, although it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
to be beaten with a rod, rather then to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with, yet let the Pastor deal with the presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
as he ought to do with other desperat like sinners;
and in the first place, let him propose for remedy of
this evil, what the Lord doth speak against such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>Deut. 29. 20. The Lord will not spare him, but
then the anger of the Lord and his jealousie shall smoak
against that man, and all the curses that are written in this
book shall lye upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his
name from under heaven.</hi> And as he findeth this work
upon him, So let him deal with him.</p>
                  <p>2. Some are near of kindred to such persons, who
do not reject all threatenings, yet do think in their
heart that none are in danger except grosse flagitious
and notorious sinners; but as to themselves, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
because they are not the worst of men, they are
without the reach of divine justice, especially if their
conversation be according to humane laws so regulated
as they have the reputation of honest neighbours.
With such men Christ dealeth (<hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 5.) when
word came concerning the <hi>Galileans</hi> whose blood <hi>Pila<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
mixed with their sacrifices, Christ saith to them, <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
ye that these Galileans were sinners above all Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
because they suffered these things? I tell you, nay,
but except ye repent you shall all likewise perish.</hi> This is
the remedy prescribed by Christ to such men.</p>
                  <p>3. Some there are who hope to be absolved before
God, and do absolve themselves in their own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
by their good works and obedience done to the
law: Of this sort was <hi>Paul</hi> before his conversion, who,
till the time that the spiritual light of the law brake in
upon his mind and killed the conceit of his own inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
righteousnesse, was no mean man in his own
eyes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. Such was the rich young man in the
Gospel, who said to Christ, that he had keeped all
the commands from his youth up, till Christ did prove
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40880:99"/>
him a covetous Idolater, who put a higher price on his
riches then upon Christ and the kingdom of heaven:
Such were the Pharisees, who, by their obedience to
the law (such as it was) doubted nothing to absolve
themselves, and that God should absolve them also.
But that the met-yaird should be no longer then their
cloath, or the law of further extent then their imagined
possible practice, they admitted no metonymie or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
speech in the law, whereby under one branch
of a duty commanded, all duties of that kind are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
and all faults contrary to the duty are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
As for example, they counted not the sixth
command to be violat, except the man did take away
his neighbours life, nor the seventh command broken,
except by grosse adultery and violation of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-bed;
nor the eighth command transgressed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
another mans goods were openly or privately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, whose mistake Christ doth correct, <hi>Matth.
chap.</hi> 5. and 6.</p>
                  <p>2. Such men as those are far from repentance, far
from humbling themselves before God and seeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sin through Christ; for, they are ignorant
of the righteousnesse of the Gospel by faith in Jesus
Christ, and of the way of coming to ability for doing
any acceptable work by faith in Christ, and therefore
they <hi>go about to establish their own righteousnesse,</hi> Rom.
10. 3. and 9. 31. 32. The false ground which they do
lay for their own absolution, is this, they think to be
justified by their works, against which ground, the
Apostle hath pronounced condemnatory sentence, <hi>Rom.
3. 20. By the deeds of the law, shall no flesh be justified in
Gods sight; for, by the law is the knowledge of sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. With this sort we may joyn these, who not only
come short of the obedience due to the law, but also
are in conscience convicted of many transgressions of
the Lords law; yet, they conceive that God will not
exact of them, or of any man who is about to obey
his law, more then the man can in the common infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40880:100"/>
of flesh overtake, and do perswade themselves,
that God will be satisfied with all them, in whom is a
willingnesse to obey the law: their false ground which
they lay, is this, that God will accept a mans will
for the deed: And to this purpose they do abuse the
Scriptures, <hi>Isa. 1. 19, If you be willing and obedient, you
shall eat the good things of the land,</hi> And, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 12. If
there be first a willing mind, it is accepted, according to that
a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. But here is their error, whereupon they purchase
from their conscience mis-informed an unwarrantable
absolution; first, they lay down for a ground that
they must be justified by works. 2. Because they know
they do come, and shall come short in obedience, they
turn the condition of the covenant of works, into
other terms then God hath appointed, and make the
will of a man to obey the law so far as he is able, to
be the condition of the covenant, which God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth.
3. They deceive themselves in this, that
what is spoken to converted believers in Jesus Christ,
already justified by faith, aiming at new obedience,
they do apply to themselves, lying under the curse and
covenant of works: for, it is true indeed, when God
is dealing with those that are already justified by faith
in Jesus, and have renounced all confidence in their
own works, and fled unto Christ, and have taken on
his yoke, the Lord doth take in good part the first
fruits of the new creature, and doth much esteem the
tender fruits of the spirit, as the places cited (<hi>Isa.</hi> 1. and
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.) do shew. But when the Lord hath to do
with the proud natural man, the unrenewed man, the
man that is not humbled for violation of the covenant
of works, he dealeth with him according to the rigour
of the law, according to the condition of the covenant
of works, pronouncing his curse against that man, for
every sin, till the sinner be humbled and slye to
Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:40880:100"/>
5. With the former we may joyn all these, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they may wash away their sins, partly by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such afflictions as are laid on them by God in this
life; partly, by their tears, prayers, fastings, pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
penances and scourging of themselves; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by their almes-deeds and other good works, do
believe they shall make amends for all their misdeeds;
and what they cannot perfect in this life for the
mater of good works, they will take assignation to the
supererogation and superfluity of the merits of Saints,
made over unto them by the Pope; And what for the
mater of suffering is not endured in this life, they will
take upon them to endure in an imaginary purgatory
and place of hell after this life, and so (poor souls) they
think they may absolve themselves at least from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of everlasting condemnation by such poor shifts as
those. But the truth is, so long as they rely upon their own
sufferings and satisfactions they deny both the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the worth of Christs sufferings; and so long as
they have confidence in their own works, or works of
other men, they reject and disclaim the covenant of
grace, and yet, behold how proud they prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 3. when they plead with God,
saying, <hi>wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest not?
wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no
knowledge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Last of all, unto the former sort we joyn these
who please themselves in the composition of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by works and righteousnesse by faith, thinking to
save themselves under the shelter of the one righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or of the other, however God shall deal with
them. Such were the Seducers and seduced amongst
the <hi>Galatians:</hi> for refuting of whole errour, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
(as it were) travelled in birth till he brought them
to take up the right frame of Christs way of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
                  <p>7. The cause of all such mens deceiving of themselves
in a false absolution of their conscience, is their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40880:101"/>
both of the righteousnesse of the law and of the
righteousness by faith: for, such as think their sins are
so few and light, or their lives so innocent, or their
good works they have done so weighty, and their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to do yet moe good works, to be so holy, or
their pains taken in religion so considerable, or their
sufferings resolved upon, so great, and thereupon do
absolve themselves, consider not that the law, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, doth require perfect, personal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all Gods law, under the pain of Gods curse,
growing in <hi>Items</hi> as the law is oftener transgressed, till
they flye in to the perfect ransom of Christs obedience.
And as for the righteousnesse of faith in Jesus, they
consider not, that his righteousnesse will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon any who do not renounce all confidence in
their own or others works, and betake themselves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to the only grace of Christ; they consider not,
that if the worth of any work be relyed upon, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
of free grace is spoiled, and clear marred; for, <hi>if
it he by works, it is no more of grace; and if it be of grace,
it is no more of works;</hi> for, these two are so opposit one
to another in the mater of mans election and justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they can no more consist together as causes

these Epistles unto the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> Revel.
chap. 2. and 3. Of this danger of mistaking the true
Christ, and embracing a false in his room, he himself
doth carefully fore-warn his Disciples, <hi>Math. 24. 4,
5, 24, 25, 26, Take heed that no man deceive you: for
many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and
shall deceive many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The proper remedy of this evil, is this,</hi> let every one
that hath an ear, hear what the spirit speaketh to the
Churches, <hi>not only in these seven Epistles, but also in
all the rest of the holy Scriptures, which are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the holy Spirit; but,</hi> if any man receive not
the truth in love, <hi>set down by the Lords Spirit in the
Scripture, his punishment is set down by the Apostle,</hi>
2 Thess, 2. 11. <hi>and</hi> for this cause, <hi>to wit,</hi> because they
received not the love of the truth that they might be saved,
God shall send them strong delusion, that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a lye, that they all might be damned who believed not
the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>1. The fourth sort of absolvers of themselves without
Gods warrand, are these who pretend unto true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and deny the power of it; of whom some are
couvinced of their duty to repent their sins and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their lusts, and to endeavour a reformation of
their life; and this they do promise to themselves, and
purpose seriously to do (as they think) only they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
presently, and at once, break off the course they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40880:102"/>
are upon, but do hope by little and little to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and at length that they shall wholly give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to religious exercises, and a holy life; mean
time they conceive, they may come in among the true
converts and young beginners, albeit they come not up
the length which they intend, but are unde the power
of some beloved lusts, which they cannot rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of, but do hope they shall betime overcome them.
Such men do miserably mistake the mater, first, in
that they think their purpose of repentance and a new
life bred in them by conviction of their duty, to be the
very grace of regeneration and begun sanctification.
Secondly, they conceive that the lusts which do reign in
themselves are common to them and all other regenerat
persons, of whom few or none (think they) want their
own grosse faults. Thirdly, they conceive they can
repent more seriously when they please, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
after a whiles following of their beloved lusts, as
if repentance were not a saving grace of the holy Spirit,
whom they do daily provoke by their vilenesse, but a
work in the power of every mans free-will, being
once convinced of his sin. Fourthly, they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that by the delay of repenting and turning from
all sin unto God, their heart is daily more and more in
Gods Judgment, hardened, and God provoked to
punish their voluntary impenitence with judicial hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of heart, that they shall never repent. Such men
our Lord compareth to the disobedient Son, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to his Father he would go work in his vineyard,
and went not, <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 30. Such men are they, who
know the well of the Lord, but do it not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
worthy of double punishment, <hi>Math</hi> 12. 47. The
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>medy of this evil Christ giveth. <hi>Luk. 13. 24, 25, 26.

                     </gap>n know

psal. 95. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:40880:102"/>
2. Other some are, who being of a civil life, professe
and do perswade themselves, that they indeed do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and believe in Christ, and by faith in him do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
expect salvation freely of his grace. If you pose
any such men, whether they do indeed believe in Christ,
they shall presently answer, that they firmly do believe
in him, and that they never doubted but he is their
sweet Saviour who died for them. If you press them
to speak in earnest from their heart, they shall presently
be ill pleased with the question, and ask, what cause of
suspecting the sincerity of their faith and repentance can
be justly alledged? or, what cause hath any man to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
them, or doubt of Gods favour toward them in
Christ? In whom should we believe (say they) if not
in Christ? Is there any other Saviour of sinners beside
him? If a man please to try the truth of their faith by
their repentance, they shall forthwith affirm, that they
repent day and night, and have just cause so to do; for,
in many things we sin all, and why then should we not
alwayes repent? If they be asked of their love to
God and their neighbour, they shall answer after the
same maner. Such men are these, of whom Christ
speaketh, that they will confidently come to him and
call him Lord, Lord, and yet be found no wayes care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to do the Lords will, but servants to their own lusts.</p>
                  <p>3. Such men do deceive themselves, first, by framing
to themselves such carnal notions of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and of the love of God and of saving hope, and
other spiritual graces, as in their phantasie they conceive
they do practise, which conceptions are not grounded
upon the Word of God. Secondly, they esteem the
assent of their mind unto the truth, commending these
duties unto men, as good as the performance of them:
and they do take the sentence of their conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the equity of such duties, for the sentence of their
conscience bearing witnesse of their practice and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of these duties; and while their conscience saith
<hi>why should not I do so?</hi> they take that for as good, as if
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40880:103"/>
it had said <hi>I do so:</hi> but saving graces go deeper then ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
carriage, and to commend the duties of repentance
and faith in Christ is not enough, except they be put in
practice also, in daily sorrow for sin and hatred of it,
and flying to Christ daily to be washen and more and
more sanctified.</p>
                  <p>4. Some there are, who, when they have heard that
a man is justified by faith in Christ only, without the
works of the law, do imagine a faith, which needeth not
to bring forth any good works at all; and so they take
off the justified man from all necessity of following good
works, as far as they take off good works from being
the cause of justification, and do open a door to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to live after their own will in the lusts of their
flesh, conceiving, that they who believe in Christ are
fred, not only from the covenant of the law, but also
from the command of the law, against whom our Lord
doth speak, and doth cut off such libertines and turners
of the grace of God into wantonnesse, from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19. And the Apostle,
to guard against this self-deceit, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14.) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
to <hi>follow holiness, without which no man shall see
the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Some there are, who pretending to esteem well of
the offer of the Gospel, and of the duty of following
the means of making them partaker of the marriage-supper,
do yet think themselves excusable, when they
have much ado in their worldly callings, albeit they
prefer the care of their family and provision for their
things out-ward, unto the main work of their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
communion with God; yea, they conceive,
that God will allow them in so doing, as Christ doth
insinuat in the parable of the ghuests invited to the feast,
answering the invitation with <hi>I pray have me excused,</hi>
Luke 14. 18, 19. This is a rise evil in great personages,
rich persons and such as are much imploved in earthly
affairs; such men deceive themselves, first, in laying
down this ground with themselves, that their earthly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40880:103"/>
affairs, the necessity whereof doth, first, and most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
appear, must in the first room be cared-for, and
that the one thing necessar may be followed after, as
their civil and earthly affairs may permit. Secondly,
they reckon gain to be godliness, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. for, they
cannot be perswaded when gain may be had, that God
requireth of any man to slip the occasion, or to put his
worldly goods in hazard, by defending or following ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of religion. Thirdly, they think themselves so wise,
as they can well enough serve two Masters, God and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse,
albeit when it cometh to the proof, they will
be found to serve, not God, but their own lusts. This
error our Lord refuteth and giveth warning to beware
of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24. And, <hi>Luke 21. 34. Take heed to your
selves, lest at any time your hearts be over-charged with sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting
and drunkenness and cares of this life.</hi> No wonder
then, that such men profit not by the Word of God,
but remain fruitlesse, because they are by our Lord
compared to the ground that receiveth the seed among
thorns, <hi>Mat. 13. 22. He heareth the word, but the cares of
this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choaks the word, and
he remaineth unfruitfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Some there are, who, having received a sufficient
measure of gifts, whereby they may promove the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ, and be profitable to the society they
live in by making use of their gifts, do pack up all their
duties in a sequestration of themselves from all busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
conceiving this way to be fittest both for God's
service and their own salvation. Whereupon, they
betake themselves to a private life in some obscure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
choosing rather to live as Monks and Eremits, then
to appear in publick and make use of their gifts, with
the hazard of toyling themselves and tossing of their
estimation among beholders of them. And this their
resolution is backed with a pretended purpose, to spend
their time in reading and prayers, without provoking
any man to hatred or emulation against them; thus
they conceive they shall provide best for their own ease
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40880:104"/>
and safety: and if withall, they apprehend that they
are not fitted with gifts, which may be profitable to
others, and do think, what they have bestowed upon
them by God, to be scarce sufficient for the carrying of
themselves on in the course that tendeth to happinesse,
then they conceive they are well excused, if they
let all publick works alone, without putting forth their
finger to help what they see amisse. We do not deny,
but sundry godly persons, in the heat of persecution,
have been forced to lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k in a wildernesse among wild
beasts during the time of the danger, of whose fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the world was not worthy; neither do we deny,
that age and infirmity of body may make men unfit
for all publick imployment; But, the fault we tax is of
such men, as being able, in Church or State, to do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to God and the society they live in, do, for the love
of their own ease, hide their talent, and not make use
thereof for the benefit of others; for, if a narrow search
be made of such mens resolution, the fear of outward
trouble in the world, a declining to fight the fight of
faith, impatience to be at any pains, and a desire to keep
the estimation of their parts from the hazard of mens
censure, and love of their own fleshly ease, will be found
the fountain of their resolution. But, here we deal
with none but such as the Apostle and Christ doth
speak against, to wit, such as in some honest imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the common utility, refuse to be at pains and
work, and therefore are not worthy of their bread,
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 10. And let us hearken to Christs judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such men, whom the world admireth for most
holy Moncks in the parable of the talents, he taketh up
the lazy lubbart, of whom we speak, under the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avish servant, who because he had but one
talent (which amounteth to no small sum) went away
and hid it in the earth, <hi>Mat. 25. 26. Thou wicked and
slothfull servant,</hi> saith he <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, <hi>ver. 30. cast the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
servant into outer darkness, there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:40880:104"/>
The remedy is, that men of parts and abilities do not
yield unto their lazy humor nor to their discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which may foster their temptations to idlenesse,
but study rather to live in the sense of their obligations
to God, and to improve all that they have received from
him, for his honour and the well-fare of his people:
and to this end, it is fit they should hearken to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of judicious friends, rather then lean to their own
judgment over-swayed with temptations, lest the Lord
deci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her them, and lead them forth with the workers of
iniquity, <hi>Ps.</hi> 125. 5.</p>
                  <p>7. Some are very like, in all externals, to the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
so far as can be observed by beholders: for, they
professe the true religion with others, they seem to have
consecrat themselves unto Christ, they associat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto, and haunt the company of these who are
in best esteem, and joyn themselves alwayes with the
reputed godly, they seem ready prepared to bear Christs
crosse, and to go forth out of the city after him bearing
his reproach, and to be waiters upon his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet inwardly they were never renewed, they are
not troubled with the sense of sin and sinfullnesse, they
do not in earnest, or seriously, seek after Christs
righteousnesse and remission of sin through him, nor
worship God in their spirit. These are described to
us in the parable of the foolish and wise Virgins.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 25. the foolish were in company and outward
fellowship of religion with the wise, their outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
was without scandal, as was the behaviour of
the wise; they had lamps of profession as the wise, and
were not suspected by themselves or others to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,
they went forth in profession waiting for the
coming of the Lord, as the wise did; and last of all, no
other infirmities were found in them, then such as the
wise Virgins were subject unto also, they all fell asleep
now and then, nothing could be outwardly found to
difference them from the wise Virgins; which exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
likenesse, as it deceived the beholders of these foolish
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40880:105"/>
Virgins, So also it deceived themselves; neither shall this
personal difference be openly manifested, till the Judge,
the searcher of hearts, shall come and separat the goats
from the sheep, and the hypocrits from the unfeigued
believers. The remedy is, that every one who pretend
unto holinesse externally, search their own hearts, and
inward sinfulnesse, daily, and flye to Christ in earnest,
that their nakednesse may be covered and their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made spiritual, seeking after things above, and that
by faith in Christ they may be filled with the unction
of the holy spirit, for bringing forth true fruits of faith.</p>
                  <p>8. Unto the former, we may joyn such, as for their
eminent gifts above the common sort of pious people,
and their abilities to conset, discourse and dispute of
maters of religion, seem to themselves and to beholders
also, eminent Saints, especially if they appear sharp cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers
of others, and z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alous against every least degree
of sin in others, but most of all, if they, for their endue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
be fitted, and called to pray in publick and preach
the Gospel to others, and withall do live without scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
they doubt nothing but they are high in Gods esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
as they are set up in reputation among the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the visible Church. Now that such gifted men
may deceive themselves, and passe sentence in their own
favours for their own absolution from any challenge,
which may condemn them, our Lord doth fore-warn
us, <hi>Matth</hi> 7. 21. 22. telling us, that not only many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
professors of the christian Religion, and seeming
zealous worshipers, crying <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> may deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and misse heaven, but also Preachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
yea and Prophets, yea and men indued with the
gift of doing miracles and casting out of devils in
Christs name, not a few shall be disclaimed by Christ
and condemned by him in the day of judgment. If it
be asked, what can be their mistake, and the cause of
Christs rejecting of them? we answer, Such men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves, 1. because both they and beholders
also think them holier, then they who are inferiour in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40880:105"/>
place and gifts unto them. 2. They compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with those they live among and not with the law
of God. 3. They put not due difference between com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
gifts and saving graces. 4. They consider not,
that to whom much is given, much will be required of
them; and therefore, after tryal they will be found pust
up with the estimation of gifts, induements, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and successe which they have had, as if these were
the undoubted evidences of their regeneration, and of
Gods special love towards them; they will be found
men void of repentance and far from humble walking.
in the sense of their natural, habitual and actual sins;
they will be found void of all fear of wrath, which might
drive them, in the acknowledgment of their blindnesse,
poverty and misery, unto Christ the Redeemer and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifier
of sinners; and they will be found void of all
care of, and endeavour after, new obedience, conceiving,
that the exercise of their gifts and successe in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
are sufficient holinesse and evidence of the
holy Ghosts dwelling in them and working by them;
for, otherwayes, Christ will never disclaim them who
have fled to him in the sense of their sin, and haunted
him as their refuge, in the fear of deserved wrath, and
studied by faith in him to be furnished to bring forth
the fruits of the Spirit, which he hath promised to them
that abide in him.</p>
                  <p>It is one thing to be justified before God, another
thing to be reputed righteous by men, and esteemed so
by a mans own self; it is one thing to be indued with
the knowledge of divine mysteries, another thing save<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to believe them and have them written in their
heart; it is one thing to teach others the way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
whereby the hearers may be saved, another thing
to apply saving doctrine to themselves and make right
use of it; it is one thing to cleanse the outer side of the
plater, and reform the mans outward carriage, another
thing to be inwardly renewed; it is one thing to teach
repentance and mortification of lusts, another thing by
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40880:106"/>
he Spirit of Christ ro mortifie in-bred pride, and the
love of the world, vain glory and other carnal lusts.
The course which <hi>Paul</hi> followed, is the only safe way,
though he was a man most laborious in the work of
the Lord, yet he lived most sensible of his natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and the body of death; he did not trust in his
holy life but in Jesus Christ <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, 25. he so made
use of faith in Christ, as he did not neglect the means
of mortification of his sinfull nature, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 27. I
keep under my body, and bring it under subjection, lest that
by any means, when I have preached to others, I my self should
be a cast-away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifth and last sort of self-deceivers, by absolving
of themselves without the Lords allowance or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
are temporizers, who, for their temporary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
temporary repenting, temporary motions of
their affections, and temporary amendment of their
maners, do seem to themselves and others also, true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
This sort, however it be in sundry cases co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident
with one or moe of the former four self-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvers,
yet, because our Lord, in the parable of the sower
of seed, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 13. 21. and, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 17) doth put a
difference between the stony ground and the other sorts
of ground, we shall give it a room by it self, specially
because it may have the own proper considerations.</p>
                  <p>Temporizers then, we call such, as upon temporary
motives, from temporary principles for temporary ends,
do imbrace the Word of the Lord readily, but slightly,
and do as readily and lightly passe from it upon tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
motives, in special, when persecution arileth for
the Word, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 16. when they have heard the Word
<hi>immediatly,</hi> they receive it <hi>with gladness,</hi> and afterward,
when affliction or persecution arises for the Words sake,
immediatly they are offended. Lightly they take up
truth delivered, and lightly do they passe from it again;
they have no root in themselves or solid believing of the
truth, for the truths cause; but what pleaseth others,
pleaseth them, and what displeaseth others, doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40880:106"/>
them, in the maters of religion; the way of
God set down in Scripture, when they hear it, they
can say nothing against it, yea, they think it good to
hear the Gospel, and the largenesse of Gods grace, and
because it sheweth unto them, a possibility of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
they receive it with a sort of natural gladnesse,
which sort of believing doth endure for a time, to wit,
so long as the way of others among whom they live,
and the laws of the country, and prosperity and good
estimation with others goeth along with the profession
of the truth received; but when the wind of another
doctrine bloweth, and doth carry with it power to
trouble and persecute them who will not receive it, by
and by they are offended, and renounce the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted,
because it draweth trouble with the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it: for, such persons suppose, that gain, ease
and applause are very godlinesse. It is true, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the true believer may be surprised with a sudain
tentation to renounce the profession of truth in some
point, for fear of death, as <hi>Peters</hi> example doth shew
us; but true faith recovereth strength, and ariseth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a fall, and endureth persecution for that truth, as
temporary belief doth not, but faileth altogether: And
the temporizers repentance failleth also, because it
ariseth from natural principles, and is for natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and ends. Such was the repentance of <hi>Saul</hi> in
weeping and justifying <hi>David</hi> for sparing his life, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
27. 21. Such was the repentance of the carnal Israelits
<hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 36. and the humiliation of <hi>Ahab;</hi> and such is,
their amendment of life, all nothing but temporary,
and which doth not continue, as <hi>Hosea (chap.</hi> 6. 4.)
sheweth, <hi>O</hi> Ephraim! <hi>what shall I do unto thee? O</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah!
<hi>what shall I do unto thee? for thy goodnesse is like the
morning cloud and like the early dew that passeth soon
away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is it any wonder, that unrenewed men may
attain to something like unto faith and repentance and
outward amendment of maners, if we consider that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40880:107"/>
humane writings find so much credit with men as not
to be called in question, but believed to be true; for
experience testifieth, that their affections are moved
sometime with delight, and sometime with indignation
and pity, not only when they read Histories, but also
when they read very Fables and fained Romances
which they know to be such, and yet they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
their affections in reading of them: May not then
an unrenewed man give as much credit to holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and be affected with the holy history thereof,
without any change made of his perverse nature, the
wisdom whereof is enmity against God, and cannot
subject it self either to his law or Gospel? Secondly,
if we consider what the power of a natural conscience
can work upon the affections, by just accusations, or
excusations, for raising grief and joy therein, whereof
not only Scripture, but also heathen writers do bear
witnesse, we need not doubt, but the natural consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may have the same power in a temporary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.
Thirdly, if we consider what the precepts of
morall Philosophy hath wrought upon the Schollers of
<hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other heathen Masters, for
the outward framing of them unto seeming vertues, we
need not doubt what the precepts of the morall law
may work upon a temporary believer, for putting a
luster on his life as was to be found in sundry Pharisees
without conversion and renovation of the inner man
toward God. Fourthly, if we consider what delight is
found by Schollers in the contemplation of these things
which Philosophy doth treat of, we may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
our selves, that more delight may be had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of what holy Scripture doth hold forth,
without making the man a new creature. But when
unto the natural mans foresaid seeming perfections,
knowledge of the mysteries of religion and the gifts of
preaching and prophecying are superadded, which are
but movable gifts, common to renewed and unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, and far from being saving graces, what wonder
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40880:107"/>
the natural man and temporary believer be puffed
up with a high estimation of his own worth and hope
of being received by Christ the Judge, and yet be
found at last to have deceived himself, and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
absolved himself by his own deluded conscience,
as Christ giveth warning, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But, what? can a temporary believer want
coming up all the length that is now spoken of and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be indued with so many seeming good things,
whereunto many saved Saints do not attain?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Every saved Saint is beaten out of self-estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for any thing in himself, beaten out of confidence
in any thing he doth or can do, and is humbled in his
heart by the law, the spiritual perfection whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
understood, killeth his natural pride, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
                  <p>2. Every saved Saint is chased for refuge to flye to
Christ, to his righteousnesse and the riches of grace
holden forth in him, and every saved Saint is a new
creature aiming more and more to follow the course of
new obedience and drawing vertue from Christ by faith
to please God and worship him in spirit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3.
So that his purpose and endeavour in some measure, is
like unto that of <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 71. 10, 15, 16. saying,
<hi>I will hope continually, and I will praise thee more and
more, my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousnesse and thy
salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof, I
will walk in the strength of the Lord God, I will make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thy righteousnesse, even of thine only.</hi> But the
temporary believer, reckoneth not for his debt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings
with the law, he is not humbled in the sense
of his sins and sinfulnesse, and inability to satisfie the
law by himself, he hath not the root of repentance in
him; for immediatly upon the hearing of the Gospel,
he receiveth the Word with joy, without godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for his sins, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 13. The temporary believer,
is ignorant of the righteousnesse of God by faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and goeth about to establish his own
righteousnesse, upon the bottom of his own blamelesse
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40880:108"/>
conversation, priviledges of the visible Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
gifts of the Spirit, and successe with prosperity:
all which, because he is not justified by faith in Christ,
do not advance him above the state of the workers of
iniquity, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 21, 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>The symptoms and ordinary signs of this malady of
unwarrantable self-absolution, are these, 1. all of
this sort, are well pleased with their own wayes, they
are not daily humbled in the sense of short-coming in
duties, and chased to Christs righteousnesse, which
may hide their nakednesse. 2. They are all secure and
fear no wrath, but put the evil day far from them. 3.
They cannot be induced to any accurat examination of
their own life, wayes, condition or estate. If any
man insinuate any suspicion of hypocrisie in them, or
if their own conscience begin to question their sincerity,
they cannot endure it. 4. Albeit they say unto Christ
<hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> yet they make little use of his office of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,
of his power and vertue for illumination,
humiliation, healing and helping on to salvation. 5.
They look more to the seeming good things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for strengthening their carnal confidence, then
they take notice of the evil of a body of death in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to drive them to Christ, the only deliverer from it.
6. Yea, they all serve some Idol, lurking in their
heart, they yield obedience to some reigning lust which
they will not forsake, for which cause Christ foretells,
that he will declare them to be but workers of iniquity,
<hi>Math.</hi> 7. 23.</p>
                  <p>The causes of this evil, are, 1. the ignorance of the
law and the utter inability, yea, aversenesse of nature
to be subject to it; the knowledge whereof might make
men live all their dayes in a loathing of themselves and
cut off all hope of obtaining righteousnesse by the law.
2. The ignorance of that dear-bought righteousnesse of
Christ, and of the riches of his grace, offering to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
his satisfaction to every self-condemned sinner
who shall flye to him and accept his offer. 3, The ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40880:108"/>
of the necessity of the bringing forth the fruits
of faith, in love, and study of new obedience and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
by the furniture of Christ, without which
no man shall see God. 4. The taking of a presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dead faith, in stead of that true justifying faith
which layeth hold on Christ and worketh by love. The
taking of a vain groundlesse hope for that lively hope,
which purifieth both the heart and external conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
also. 5. The comparing of themselves either with
the worst sort of vile sinners, or with such as are like
to themselves, or with the Saints in their grosse fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
not judging themselves according to the law.</p>
                  <p>The use to be made of this doctrine is, first, to stir
us up to take notice of that power of the soul called <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
which God hath put in every man to observe
all the mans words, deeds and intentions, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them with the law and will of God, so far as it is
informed and to accuse or excuse, condemn or absolve,
smite or comfort the man as it findeth cause, that we
suffer not our own conscience to sleep, but set it on
work whilst it is time, that we may know how all
maters do stand between God and us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we inform the conscience well from
the Scripture, not only concerning the law and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works, whereby we may know how guilty
we are of manifold sins, and how impossible it is for
us to be justified by our works, or to escape condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but also concerning the Gospel and covenant
of gracious reconciliation by faith in Jesus Christ and
concerning the covenant of redemption, whereupon
the covenant of grace offered in Christ is grounded</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that we make due and orderly applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these covenants, that the conscience may alwayes
be furnished with mater of humiliation, and held
on in the exercise of repentance, and not only keeped
from desperation, but also may be furnished with
grounds of good hope to be saved, through the grace
of our Lord Jesus who hath purchased remission
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40880:109"/>
of sins and imputation of his righteousnesse to every
humbled sinner flying to him for grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that being ingrasted in Christ by faith, we,
by way of thankfulnesse, study in the furniture of his
Spirit, to live holily, justly and soberly; and that
whatsoever measure of sanctification we attain unto,
we beware to fall back to that deadly error of seeking
justification before God by our works, whereunto we
are naturally inclined: for, upon this rock the flour
and most shining professors in <hi>Israel</hi> after the flesh,
made shipwrack of their salvation, <hi>Rom, 9. 32.
Israel which followed after the law of righteousnesse, hath
not attained unto the law of righteousnesse, wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works
of the law.</hi> And, <hi>Rom. 10. 3. for they being ignorant of
Gods righteousnesse, and going about to establish their
own righteousnesse, have not submitted themselves to the
righteousnesse of God.</hi> Unto this error of seeking righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
by our works, after entering in the way of
justification by grace, we are all naturally inclined;
for, the covenant of works is so ingraven in all <hi>Adams</hi>
children, <hi>do this and live,</hi> that hardly can we renounce
this way of justification, and howsoever it be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to attain righteousnesse this way, yet hardly can
we submit our selves to the righteousnesse by faith in
Christ, which not only the experience of <hi>Israel</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flesh maketh manifest, but also the experience
of the <hi>Galatians</hi> lets us see; for, they having once out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
renounced justification by works, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the covenant of gracious reconciliation by faith
in Jesus, did turn about for a time, to seek justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the works of the law, and were on the way of
falling from grace and communion with Christ. And
the experience of Papists doth shew the same; for,
whatsoever they professe concerning faith in Christ,
yet they abhor justification by Christs imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and do blaspheme that way as a meer conceit
of men and a putatitious or only imaginary righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40880:109"/>
and do seek to establish their own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and to be justified, not only before men, but also
before God, by the merits of their own and other mens
works and sufferings; the imputation whereof they
can tell for money, in the midst of their blaspheming
the imputation of Christs righteousnesse. What can
be said for a thief, condemned to die for his faults, and
redeemed by a potent man, upon condition that he
should be the domestick servant of the redeemer, to
work his work all his life-time, and live upon
his allowance, and so never be necessitated to steal any
more? if the ransomed thief should after steal his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
goods, and make himself a stock-purse whereupon
he thought he might live, and loose himself from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers
grace and live upon his own finding, were he
not worthy, upon the finding out of his thifts and other
faults, to be left in the hands of justice, to die according
to his deservings? And what could be said for a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
labouring a parcel of ground of his Lands-lord,
for a yearly farm-duty, by his own miscarriage falling
to beggary, if he should be taken in to the free table of
his Lands-lord, and trusted with the same parcel of
ground to be laboured for his Masters use, if he should
intervert the fruits of that ground, and being weary of
his Masters bounty and grace, should seek to be fired of
his Masters service, and to labour the ground for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for payment of rent? if upon the finding out of
his thift, and not paiment of his rent, he should be cast
in prison, did he not deserve to be dealt with according
to <hi>justice,</hi> who would not live by <hi>grace?</hi> So may be
said of the man, who shall turn from justification by
free grace, to seek justification by his works.</p>
                  <p>The fifth and last use of this doctrine is, that to the
intent we may not absolve our selves without Gods
allowance, we study to make our calling and election
sure, by endeavouring to walk in the sense of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse
and ill-deserving, and renouncing all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in any thing without Christ, to rely on him for
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40880:110"/>
righteousnesse and life-eternal, and by faith in him draw
spirit and life from him, for furnishing us unto new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
for, he is the justified man, approven of God,
<hi>who hath no confidence in the flesh, and rejoiceth in Iesus
Christ, and worshipeth God in the spirit,</hi> Philip. 3. 3.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto the sicknesses of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the un-regenerat man
are spoken to, and this was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to the end, that we might
shew how Regeneration is either
altogether kept off, or hindred
from growing where it is begun.
And because many of these sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
which destroy many of the sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> cleave
to the regenerat man, and though they do not reign, nor
altogether prevail over him, yet do molest and vex him,
and hinder his comfortable walking toward his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
blessednesse: Now we come to speak, first, in
this Book, of these cases of the conscience of the man
regenerat, which do brangle, and bring in question his
state in grace, and make him doubt whether he be a man
translated out of the state of nature, out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Sathan, or not. And next, of these cases that
concern his condition in the state of grace in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Book.</p>
               <p>As to the first sort of cases, which concern the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat
mans state, some considerations must be premised,
for making particulars afterwards more clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:40880:111"/>
1. In the question of this, or that mans regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or his being in the state of grace, it is all one to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether he be born again, or be effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
or indued with saving faith, or be a justified man,
or be reconciled to God, or be an adopted child?
And in the answer of this question, let it be proven,
that he is any of these, and it is proven also, that he is
all these: for, albeit these denominations, in their
formal conceptions in the abstract, may be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet upon the mater in the conceit they fall upon the
same individual person altogether, because it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to prove a man to be regenerat, but he must be
proven also a true believer in Christ, a man recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to God, a man justified and an adopted child</p>
               <p>2. It is necessary therefore, for proving a man to be
regenerat, to know the right description of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
man which is given by the Apostle, <hi>Phil. 3. 3. We
are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
rejoyce in Iesus Christ, and have no confidence in the flesh.</hi>
Wherein the Apostle holdeth forth the truly regenerat
circumcised in heart. 1. He is not sinlesse, but so
sensible of his sinfulnesse, as he hath no confidence in
himself, nor any thing else in himself. 2. He is not
free of accusations or tentations and doubts, but he
flyeth to Christ for righteousnesse. 3. He is not an idle
and unfruitfull branch, but a worshiper of God in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and truth. 1. He is burdened with sin. 2. He
cometh to Christ for relief. 3. He puts on Christs
yoke, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 28, 29. If a man have these three
properties joyntly in him, he is a regenerae man, and
may defend his interest (in the state of grace) and right
to righteousnesse and eternall life through Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>3. Divine operations and saving graces which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
salvation, such as are faith, repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
life, hope, Christian love to God and men for
Gods cause, effectual vocation, justification, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
adoption, go together in time by Gods gift,
but one of them goeth before another in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40880:111"/>
for, effectual calling goeth before faith, and
faith goeth before hope, and before charity or love.
Again, these graces which are given to the redeemed
child of God joyntly, in respect of time, do not shew
themselves in their evidence alike soon in time, nor do
they equally manifest themselves when they do appear
in time. And so the evidences of repentance may be
discerned in not a few converts, before faith in Christ
do shew it self in them clearly. So also love to God
and his Saints oft-times may be discerned in a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
man, before he himself dare affirm any thing of his
faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>4. Albeit there be many regenerat persons, who for
the present time cannot perceive in themselves any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
signs of their conversion; yet it is certain also,
that there be many, who, to their own unspeakable
comfort, are assured of their regeneration, and that
they are translated from death to life, and that they
have received the spirit of adoption and earnest of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life, as is pointed out in the experience of the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,
<hi>chap.</hi> 1. 14. And this is certain also, that all
who are fled to Christ for refuge, should by all means
labour to make their calling and election clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to themselves, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. And to this purpose
we are commanded to examine our selves, and try
whether we be in the faith or not, whether Christ by
his Spirit be in us or not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. for otherwise,
except a convert know certainly the blessednesse of his
own state, and that he standeth in grace and favour
with God, it is not possible for him to give hearty
thanks to God for the change of his state, from being
an enemy, to be made a reconciled subject and child of
God. It is not possible for him to rejoyce in the Lord, or
set chearfully himself to serve God, or comfortably call
on God, as a father to him in Christ: Wherefore, all
who in the sense of their sins and fear of deserved wrath
are fled for refuge unto Christ, should deal by prayer
earnestly with God, that he would graciously grant
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40880:112"/>
unto them his Spirit, by whose operation in them, they
may know the saving graces which he hath freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon them, of which gift of the holy Spirit the
Apostle doth speak, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>5. The knowledge of a mans own regeneration, hath
many degrees of clearnesse and assurance, by reason of
the variety of conditions wherein a man truly convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
may be: For, many doubts may arise in the man
regenerat, which may darken his sight, and hinder
the assurance of saving grace granted unto him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
sundry causes may be found, and in special these
four among others. 1. In a man illuminat and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the holy Spirit, there remains a great deal of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
much doubting mixed with faith, by reason of
unskilfulnesse of the convert to examine and discern this
blessed change made in him, where through that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to passe in many young converts, which will be
seen in infants, who have a soul indeed, but do not
know or perceive that they have a soul till they come
to some years of discretion; yea, many sound Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
are oft-times at a stand about their regeneration,
and know not what to make of their faith or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
especially when they feel the power of the body
of death, the strength of natural corruption in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and great indisposition for any spiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise;
they are forced with the Apostle to cry, <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
man that I am, who shall deliver me?</hi> Rom. 7. 24.
mean time for weaknesse of their faith, they are not
able at the first to wrestle against discouragment, and
to come up unto the Apostles thanking God through
Christ. 2. By the tentation of Sathan oft-times the
perswasion of holy men is darkened, so as they cannot
see the evidences of their own regeneration clearly: for,
Sathan sets himself to vex the Saints who are delivered
from his kingdom and bonds, whom albeit he know
that he cannot destroy them, yet he will not cease to
trouble them, that at least he may make them some way
unfit for Gods service and marr their cheerfulness in his
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40880:112"/>
service; and because he feareth harm from them unto
his kingdom, by their dealing with the unconverted
to repent their sins, and to turn unto God, therefore
he finds them work at home in their own bosome, and
puts them to defend themselves and to forbear to invade
his subjects, till they be setled themselves. 3. Oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Lord is offended by the sins of the regenerat,
and specially by their grosse transgressions, for which
his Spirit being grieved, doth for a time cease from
comforting them, and doth not bear witnesse with
their spirits, that they are the children of God, as he
hath formerly used to do. 4. Oft-times the Lord by
suffering doubts to arise in their hearts, useth to try and
exercise the faith of his children, and thereby to stir
them up to the pursuing of the duties of piety and
righteousnesse more vigorously and sincerely, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
victory obtained over these tentations, they may be
more confirmed in their faith, and more diligent in his
obedience.</p>
               <p>6. It may come to passe, that while the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
doth most doubt of his own regeneration, that
the work of Gods special grace may be observed in
him and clearly seen by others more experienced in the
wayes of God, and indued with the spirit of discretion.
The reason whereof is, because howsoever the weak
convert, and child of light, walking in darknesse of
tentation and desertion, cannot discern his own blessed
state, yet there may appear, and be perceived in him,
such signes and undoubted evidences of saving grace,
that the prudent beholder of him under his sad exercise,
may in the judgment of discretion and charity, declare
his righteousnes, and him for his state to be in grace and
favour with God. In these two disciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi>
Luk. 24. saving faith was not extinguished, albeit they
were driven to suspect themselves to have been mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
when they once believed that Christ was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
Saviour; for, in that same time, there appeared
in them evident tokens of their unfained love to Christ:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40880:113"/>
for, while they are troubled with suspition of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mistaken about Christ, they are very sad and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,
and were regrating the sufferings of Christ,
and were gathering what arguments they could for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
their faith, whereby their dying faith might be
supported by conference about this mater, laying forth
their doubts and tentations one to another.</p>
               <p>7. The precise time of begun regeneration, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
observed nor known, either by the regenerat man
himself, or by beholders of his way, as experience mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teh
evident in many, who from their infancy are brought
up in the exercises of true religion, in whose conversion
no notable change can be observed. In those the words of
Christ in part are verified, <hi>the kingdom of heaven cometh
not with observation.</hi> Such persons when they begin to
examine themselves, whether they be regenerat, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be in Christ, and at what time they were
converted, they can neither determinatly condescend
upon the time of their conversion, nor can they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
speak of their conversion, till after sundry try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
and experiences they can gather proofs of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
from such signs, effects and marks of the work
of saving grace in them, as may prove that Christ hath
dwelt in them of before.</p>
               <p>8. Albeit regeneration be of the same kind, spece
and definition, in all the regenerat, yet it doth admit
sundry accidental differences, when the conversion of
such and such persons is compared: for, some do not
stay long in the straits of regeneration, or new birth,
but within a short space of time they are both wounded
and healed, are both casten down and raised up again,
are both slain by the Law and quickened by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
Of this sort we have a past proof in some thousand
converts, <hi>Act,</hi> 2. who by one sermon or two were
converted to the faith of Christ and fellowship with
the Church. On the other hand, experience of many
doth shew, they have been under the spirit of bondage a
long time, before they could receive the consolations
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40880:113"/>
of the Gospel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. Some in the beginning of
their conversion are handled very tenderly, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
fall in hard exercises of mind, as we may see in
<hi>David,</hi> who in his youth, while he was keeping his
fathers sheep, did passe the time in holy songs, and
playing on his harp, but afterward he was more sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercised, and much afflicted from time to time with
the sense of divine wrath. Some in sorrow and much
weeping do follow Christ, and study to promove his
kingdom: such a one was <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
exhorteth to admit a larger measure of consolation
allowed unto him by the Lord, that he might be the
more cheerfull and couragious in the warfare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he was called, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4. Another of this sort
was <hi>Heman</hi> the Ezrahit, who (<hi>Psal.</hi> 88.) declareth,
that from his youth up he was so keeped under terror,
as he was ready to die under discouragment: And in
the experience of this holy man, we have a proof of
what was holden forth in the preceeding consideration,
to wit, that regeneration may be begun in a man, and
well promoved before either himself or others can well
discern it: for, of them who are keeped under the law
and spirit of bondage, it is hard determinatly to
judge, before faith in Christ begin to appear in them,
whether their exercise be the special work of the holy
spirit of regeneration, or not: for as it may come to
passe, that the spirit of fear and bondage may for a
time work, and go no further then to convict a man,
and not go on to convert him, So also it may come to
passe, that there be some wrestling of faith lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-foot
in the midst of terrors, not perceived for a
while; of which wrestling none can well give out
sentence, that it is a wrestling of saving faith, before
faith get some victory over tentations, and break forth
in some evident effects. In which case it is very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
warily and circumspectly to apply the doctrine of
the Gospel, so as the afflicted soul may be supported
with hopes of a gracious out-gate; for, the work of the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40880:114"/>
law, humbling the sinner, is a fair call to come to
Christ, and a messenger sent by Christ to bring him
up, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
               <p>9. Albeit the regenerat man, in respect of the state
of his person, by standing in grace and favour with
God, fixed and unmovable as the Apostle doth shew
us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. partly, because the love of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
to the believer in Christ is unchangeable; and
partly, because the covenant of grace through Christ
is an everlasting covenant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 3. and partly, because
the saving gifts and calling of God are such, as God
will never repent him to have bestowed them, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 29. yet in respect of his condition the regenerat
man, is subject to many changes in his life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
in the disposition of his mind and affections, and
in the exercise of his gracious habits, and in the sense
and observation of the grace of God in him and favour
of God toward him: for, it may come to passe, yea,
and oft-times doth come to passe, that men who are
regenerat, and in the state of grace, which is a notable
good state, may be in a very evil condition, in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
and deplorable disposition of heart, as befell
the Church of <hi>Ephesus, Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea.</hi> And it
may be also, that regenerat persons, after their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are wakened, and they do perceive the miserable
and sinfull condition of their affections and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that no small doubts arise in their hearts whether
their state in grace be reall or not, which doubts will
evanish, when after the renewing of their repentance,
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r condition is changed to the better: for, Christ
pre-occupieth this tentation, speaking, to the Church
of <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> counselling them to strengthen
the thing that remaineth, which was ready to dye,
and not to doubt of his love toward them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.
and 3.</p>
               <p>10. These tentations whereby the regenerat man is
troubled, and tempted to doubt whether he be in the
state of grace, should be distinguished and discerned
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40880:114"/>
from actual doubting; for, there may be a temptation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
doubting, without a yielding unto the temptation, as
we see in Christ our Lord, whom the devil durst tempt
to doubt, whether he was the Son of God, but his holy
heart could not admit such a temptation. And the
Apostle (<hi>Eph. 6. 11, 12. &amp;c.</hi>) doth warn the Saints,
that our adversary Sathan useth to throw firy darts at
all the children of God; which firy and poysonable
darts, the regenerat man should not meddle with nor
finger them, but by the shield of faith, with all speed,
quench and extinguish them. But when a probable
reason is joyned with the temptation, and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth appear to be very reasonable, and when there
is a fear, that the tentation shall be yielded unto, except
the scruple be removed, then let the temptation be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and brought to the form of a reason or sylogism,
that the strength of it being tryed to be null, it may be
rejected; or let the temptation be communicated to a
prudent friend or Pastor, who may discover the sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the temptation; for, if the temptation shall be
slighted and not discussed, albeit it lye quiet for a time,
yet it will return again and raise more trouble and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
to the conscience, then it did before.</p>
               <p>11. In answering of doubts and temptations tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to weaken faith, it is needfull to observe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shew
an usual stratagem of Sathan, whereby he doth multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and heap together a number of doubts; and after
he hath suggested one doubt, presently doth suggest on
the back of that another, and after that another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he marreth the answering of the first doubt, which
from the Word of God, either immediatly, or by some
faithfull Friend or Minister, is offered for solution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
by this mean, Sathan endeavours that the mind of
the afflicted person may, at one time, both be turned off
from taking notice of the answer offered, and be taken
up wholly with the consideration of the new suggested
doubt, So that the answer to the new doubt hath no
place, because the afflicted party doth not take heed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40880:115"/>
thereto. In this case, both the party afflicted, and the
party offering consolation, must hold to the first doubt,
and not suffer any other new doubt to have place, till a
satisfactory answer be given to the first doubt, and after
that, let every objection, moved by the party afflicted,
be answered one after another in order.</p>
               <p>12. Seing every doubt, whereby the regenerat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is troubled, doth tend either to weaken faith in
Christ, or to hinder the bringing forth of the fruits of
faith, let no answer to any doubt of this kind be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sufficient, except it lead the afflicted person unto
<hi>Christ,</hi> teaching him to humble himself before God;
and being brought low in his own eyes, to lay hold by
faith on Jesus Christ, the only Redeemer, and relief from
sin and misery; and after laying hold on the Physician,
to request for the remedy of that evil which hath mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and given strength to the doubt: for, Christ is the
end, both of the Law and of every spiritual exercise:
for, the enjoining of such and such moral duties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
un-skillfull Physicians use to over-charge diseased
consciences, commanding the afflicted party in the first
place, to go about such and such duties, and the exercise
of such and such vertues, as may remove the evil which
gave ground to the doubt, can never avail the diseased
person, except he be led first unto Christ for remission
of sin and acceptation of his person, that in him, power
to do these duties may be obtained, and by his Spirit, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
precepts may be quickened; for, if these precepts be
pressed upon the diseased without Christ, they can do
no more but detain the afflicted in self confidence, and
make him hope in vain, that he may or can by his own
work over-come the evil felt in him, or that he can by
himself, attain to that good which he conceiveth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
for loosing of his doubt; but let him go to Christ
for remission of sin, and then for strength to go about
the duty.</p>
               <p>13. Because almost in all cases of conscience which
pertain to the state of the regenerat man, some grace or
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40880:115"/>
Christian vertue is pitched upon and called in question,
whether it be in him or not, heed must be taken that
evangelick graces, vertues or actions, be not weighed
in the ballance of the moral Law and covenant of
Works, wherein nothing hath weight which cometh
short of absolute perfection of personal obedience; for,
in the strict judgment of God and the conscience, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the law of Works, no meer man, nor any
action of man, can stand, <hi>Ps.</hi> 130. 3. for, there are so
many imperfections and blemishes in the Saints and
their best works, being compared with the perfect rule
of righteousnesse by the Law, that whatsoever lustre
or appearance of good may be in a work, it is blecked
and made to hide it's face before the Law: but, let the
tender buds of new obedience and fruits of faith, be
examined by the grace of the Gospel, which judgeth
of the begun obedience of the believer in Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the sincerity and uprightnesse of the man
aiming at conformity to the Law, how short soever he
come of his aim, and of the spiritual perfection of the
Law, and it will be taken for new obedience. It is true,
the Evangel requireth, that a man fled to Christ for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and reconciled to God by faith in Christ,
should set himself to work the works prescribed in the
moral Law, for the glory of God, and should aim at
the exact obedience of all the Commands; yet, the
Gospel doth not reject a good work for the defects, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
and blemishes thereof, but accepteth and
taketh in good part the first fruits and buds of new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and doth foster the tender and small beginnings,
that they may grow and encrease. And the reason is,
because the Gospel doth not teach us to seek the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of our persons before God by works, but by
faith in Christ, and then teacheth us to seek the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our faith before men in our own and others
conscience, by the sincere endeavour of new obedience.
And therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:40880:116"/>
14. While we are about the cure of the wounds of
the conscience and strengthening of faith, we must on
the one hand take heed, left we foster presumption, and
hinder either the exercise of repentance, or doing dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in following duties: for, Christian graces do not
impede, but help and strengthen one another, if they be
real and kindly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they must flow from the same
fountain of the spirit of sanctification, and do run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the same end, which is the glory of God: and
on the other hand, we must take heed lest we presse the
exercise of repentance, as it were out of our own
strength, or the practice of duties, so as we hinder the
exercise of faith in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is that exalted Prince
to give repentance, and is the author and finisher of
faith. Let us so cry up the imputed righteousnesse of
Christ, that we neglect not to presse the regenerat man
(freely justified by grace) to bring forth the fruits of
faith, and to follow hard after the growth of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without which, no man shall see the face of God;
and let us so extoll the covenant of Grace, and freedom
of the believer from the covenant of Works, that we
neglect not to keep up the authority of the moral Law
and the commands thereof, as the perpetual rule of new
obedience, the use whereof is very profitable, in the
whole course of a Christian life, to hold forth the duty
of believers in Christ, and to shew unto them, by their
short-coming in duties, the poyson and power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
remaining in the Saints, and to make them sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the necessity of flying daily to that imputed
righteousnesse by faith in Christ, and of drawing
strength from Christ to bring forth more aboundant
fruits, whereby Christ shall be more and more precious
in our eyes, and be acknowledged absolutely necessar
for our justification, sanctification and salvation.</p>
               <p>15. When question is made concerning Christian
vertues and operations of the holy Spirit in us, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Gods working held forth to us in Scripture, is
carefully to be marked by us: which is, that sense of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40880:116"/>
sin should go before faith in Christ; for, the Law is a
pedagogue to Christ, <hi>for, he came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance, Matth.</hi> 9. 13. And faith in
Christ goeth before the fruits of faith, and the fruits of
faith before the sensible approbation of them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the fruits by Scripture goeth before the
sensible fealing of the believer, and the quieting of the
conscience in its approbation of what the Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth;
for, after we have believed, we come to be
sealed, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. Now, for the not observing this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
many real Christians do make unto themselves a
very un-comfortable life, for, albeit they be convinced
of sin, and humbled in the sense of their own inability
to help themselves, and are fled to Christ for pardon
and help, and do lead a life blamelesse, yet do they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
suspend the acknowledging of the work of
faith bestowed upon them, and do disquiet themselves,
so as they cannot rest on Christ, but do quarrel the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their faith, till they shall feel and perceive, with
approbation of their conscience, such and such fruits
of faith in themselves, and that in such a measure as
they have fore-imagined to be the necessar evidences of
faith; yea, and they refuse to account themselves persons
justified, because they cannot perceive such mature fruits
in themselves, as they conceive must not only be, but be
acknowledged also to be, in the justified person, before he
can lay hold on justification. Such persons do, in effect,
invert the order which they should observe; for, when it
were their part to flye unto Christ the only Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they come short of new obedience, and because
they are loaden with sin, that in him they might have
God reconciled to them, and by his Spirit, pouring in of
his grace in their souls, to make them more holy, they
take another and contrary course, by suspending their
faith upon their works, and do exact of themselves
works before faith, and so do weaken their own faith, and
hinder it to bring forth such fruits as they do require. It is
reason indeed, to prove our faith by our works, and it is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40880:117"/>
just, that such a faith be accounted dead, which is not ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>companied
with the purpose and endeavour to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily,
justly and soberly. But it is against all reason and
equity to condemn weak faith, accompanied with the
purpose of a new life, as if it were no faith, because it
hath not as yet brought forth so fair and fully ripe fruits
as the weak believer would. It were their wisdom, when
they perceive such impotency to do what is good, and
such strength of the body of death in them, to flye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Redeemer so much the more, and in him to seek
remission of sin, and strength to bring forth good fruits,
and to be sucking juice and sap out of him, as the true
Vine: for, if we come to him and abide in him, we
shall bring forth much fruit, <hi>Iob.</hi> 15. 4, 5. For, faith
in Christ, in order of nature, goeth before good works;
for only they who come to Christ and abide in him,
do bring forth aboundant fruit, and not they, who upon
the apprehension of their want of fruits, do loose or
slacken their grip of faith, and upon discouragment,
are ready to depart from the living God.</p>
               <p>16. The like wisdom is required in dealing with the
consciences of men concerning the preparatory disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of such as may confidently come unto Christ to be
justified, sanctified and saved; for albeit it be true,
that all that come to Christ, ought to come in the sense
of their sin and acknowledgment of wrath and death
deserved for their sins, ought to come with contrition
of heart, with godly sorrow for their sins, and a
humble renunciation of all confidence in themselves;
yet must not such persons, as do not satisfie themselves
in the measure or sincerity of such preparatory dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in themselves, be keeped back, or debarred from
coming to Christ, because they not only want, as they
conceive, both the humiliation and sorrow of heart
for sin, and fear of wrath, required in such as have
accesse unto Christ, but also do perceive in themselves
such blindnesse of mind and vanity thereof, such stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
of conscience and stubbornesse of a proud heart,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40880:117"/>
as is not fit (as they conceive) to be received by Christ,
or fit to be comforted by him; such persons I say are
not to be forthwith debarred from coming to the throne
of grace; for, oft-times sincerity of conviction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction
and humiliation is to be found in such as are
displeased with their own short-coming in such prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
dispositions, more then in many others who
make a fairer shew and profession of their godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and humiliation, and are well pleased with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in that respect. We must be wary also while we
require sorrow and humiliation, and other like prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
dispositions in them who may come unto Christ,
least we secretly import and insinuat a sort of merit to
be in such dispositions, so as if he that doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
himself thus qualified, could expect no good at
Christs hands, except he have in his hand such prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
dispositions as if it were a price of purchasing
adresse to Christ. But let us hold this fast, that the
more poor and empty a man be in his own eyes, he
ought to draw the more near unto the riches of grace in
Christ, because in him only are to be found all the
treasures of every saving grace, and preparatory dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
for receiving thereof; he is that <hi>exalted Prince,
who giveth repentance unto Israel,</hi> Act. 5. 31. he is the
author and finisher of faith, unto whom all they,
who in the sense of their want of repentance and faith,
do sigh in themselves, ought, and safely may come,
that they may have from him a more ample measure of
faith and repentance. Neither need we in this case
be feared, least any such person go or be sent too soon
unto Christ, and that the teacher of this doctrine be
found to foster presumption, and to offer untimous
consolation; for, it is one thing to direct a man to go
to Christ, for supply of whatsoever good is wanting in
him, and another thing to warrand a secure sinner to
lay hold on the consolations of the Gospel, which
God hath reserved in his own hand, to be dispensed
in due time and order, to the truly humble penitent.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40880:118"/>
The Lord knoweth how to deal with such as come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; he can hold an unhumbled supplicant praying
and knocking at heavens door without giving him a
comfortable answer untill he be humbled, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
him by humiliation for consolation in due time.</p>
               <p>True it is, that many draw near to Christ with their
lips while their hearts are far away, and remain sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of their evil estate and condition, and are far from
the earnest desire of the remedy which is to be had in
Christ: and therefore it is, not without cause, that
Pastors in their sermons require the sight and sense of
sin, and hunger and thirst for righteousnesse in them
who come to Christ, and desire to profit by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him: for, albeit it be free to God, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
preparatory exercises, to fall in upon mans
heart suddainly, and at one sermon both convince him
of sin, and lead him in to Christ, as he hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
dealt with a multitude, when <hi>Peter</hi> was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. yet it is not free for men to neglect their
duties, when they are advertised that the order of Gods
working ordinarily, is, to take a time for informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their mind concerning their natural misery, and
his gracious way of delivery, and for a time to work
on their hearts by the law, before he give them the
felt fruits of the Gospel. Mean time this must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that no man, displeased with his disposition,
as not fitted for mercy, and who doth regrate that he
is a stupid sinner, and so hard-hearted that he cannot
repent: should be keeped off, and debarred from
going to Christ, till he discern in himself the contrition
and humiliation of heart which he would have: for,
this were as much as to say in effect, that before a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may go to Christ, he must seek, not from Christ,
but out of his own strength and abilities to work up
his own heart to the sense of sin and humiliation of
heart, and other such like dispositions, as ordinarily
go before the act and discerning of saving faith; for, if
even <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> discovered and found out to be in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40880:118"/>
the gall of bitternesse and bond of iniquity, was exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to pray that God would forgive his sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the perversenesse of his heart and save him from
deserved wrath, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 22. How much more are they
to be encouraged to go to Christ for relief from these
evils which they feel and fear, in whom not only this
gall of bitternesse doth not appear, but also some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
may be marked, by wise beholders, of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
work of grace in them, albeit the man himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perceive so much for the time?</p>
               <p>17. Seing it is certain, that God doth prevein by
grace every converted mans actions, before the man
do actually turn himself to God, and that the Lord
useth to open the eyes of the man whom he is convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to see such and such evils in himself before these
evils be taken away; and seing it is Gods usual way
by preventing, to give some measure of the good to be
prayed for, that the man may pray for more good up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the receit of some measure of that good already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed;
therefore all they who desire to approach to
Christ, must be taught to make, observe and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the least degree of good bestowed upon them, of
the smallest beginnings of illumination, of the meanest
degrees of conviction for sin, of the least measure of
estimation of Christ and his grace wrought already in
themselves, and to thank the Lord for so much eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve
as hath opened their eyes to discern their own
blindnesse and misery, and Christ to be the remedy of
all the evils they do see; and after they have marked
what is bestowed already on them, and have bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssed
God for the gift, they must be exhorted to request the
Lord to make out and perfect the begun mercy, that
they may be sure of their own real conversion; for so
doth the new convert pray, <hi>Ier. 31. 18. Convert me,
and I shall be converted;</hi> and the humble soul, <hi>Cant. 1.
4. draw me after thee, and we will run after thee.</hi> And
this we speak not, as if any unconverted man could in
the sense of his sin and misery sincerely and heartily seek
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40880:119"/>
after Christ, or for more grace from him. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some that are converted, do not perceive that they
are converted, we frame our speech to their estimation
of themselves, that they may be edified who are
brought unto Christ, by the draught of effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and have not as yet received the gift of the Spirit
to perceive these things which are freely bestowed upon
them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>18. As it useth to be in the sicknesse of the body, So
it falleth out in the sicknesses of the conscience, that as
there are some sicknesses simple, and other some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat,
when moe sicknesses concur together; So in the
conscience, there are some simple, some complicat ill
cases. Simple and single cases of conscience are these,
wherein the diseased soul is troubled with one doubt
only for the present: as for example, when the party
afflicted, is doubtfull only of the will of God toward
him, and not of his power: such was the case of the
Leper, <hi>Matth. 8. 2. Thou canst make me clean, if thou
wilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Complicat and involved cases, are, when many
evils concur together, and the conscience is troubled
with many doubts. In which case many questions
may offer themselves in a throng together, which the
afflicted party cannot well distinguish, and thereupon
is driven to darknesse and confusion of mind. In this
case the Pastor, or prudent christian friend, must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
some order, beginning with the most perilous
doubt, that it may be first solved: which doubt being
answered in the first place, let him fall upon the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
of the rest of the doubts in order. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
if the party be afflicted with tentations unto
desperation, let him be cleared and led by the hand to
see and acknowledge a possibility of salvation by
Christ, and then a <hi>probability</hi> and <hi>appearance</hi> that it shall
be, by an argument taken from his present exercise,
which putteth an earand in his hand, and so a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
to go to Christ; and so peece and peece let him
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40880:119"/>
be dealt with to accept the general offer of grace in
Christ and to believe in him. Now that such may be
the exercise of the child of God, appeareth, <hi>Psal. 42. 7.
Deep calleth unto deep, at the noise of thy water-spouts, all
thy waves and billows are gone over me.</hi> And <hi>Psal. 77. 7,
8. will the Lord cast off for ever, and will he be favourable no
more? Is his grace clean gone for ever? and will he be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
no more?</hi> &amp;c. At last he discovereth his duty
to believe in God, and concludeth against himself, that
his giving so far way to the tentation was his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>19. We must distinguish worldy sorrow, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack-passions
and perturbations of mind, from
cases of conscience, and spiritual exercise in the wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of faith, that for a natural disease and distemper
a pertinent remedy may be called for from the bodily
Physicians; and to such as are under a spiritual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
the doubts of their conscience may be prudently
loused. In such a case, when both the bodily distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and spiritual exercise are joyned, circumspection is
necessary, that proportionable remedies be used by
the Physician and the Pastor or prudent friend, that
bodily medicine and spiritual consolations may be each
in their own time and order wisely made use of: and
because it useth to fall out, that exercise of conscience
and distemper of bodily humours are oftentimes joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one with another, let it be sufficient, that a word
is casten in here for advertisement.</p>
               <p>20. In curing cases of conscience, it is not sufficient
to louse some one doubt or other, but after satisfaction
given to the parties afflicted concerning the present
case, which hath troubled them, they must learn to
observe other causes, which may trouble them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
wherewith for the present they possibly are not
troubled, and must be directed to acquaint themselves,
with Christ, that in him they may have relief from
every sin, and every sort of misery; and to that end
and purpose they must consecrat and devout themselves
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40880:120"/>
to him, to depend upon him in all things, and at all
times, whatsoever way he shall be pleased to exercise
them: for, whosoever do come unto Christ, must
come of set purpose to abide in him, and never depart
from him, but to live in him, and draw grace after
grace out of his fulnesse; grace to mortifie sin, grace
to renew the acts of faith and repentance daily, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they find new guiltinesse contracted, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in themselves to do commanded duties: for, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the do so, they shall easily slide back from their
begun sanctification, and furnish mater to Sathan for
raising of new doubts in their souls and new tentations
unto sins, wherein they have not fallen before: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must they keep the habits of faith and repentance
in actual exercise daily.</p>
               <p>21. In dealing with a troubled conscience, let not
the comforter, whether a Pastor or a prudent friend,
trust to his abilities, or arrogat to himself above what
is due to him, but let him keep his eye upon the Lord
and in his heart be praying to God to blesse the Word
in his mouth, giving glory to God expresly, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the afflicted party laying hold on Gods Word
delivered by him. And let him also teach the afflicted
to lift his eyes to the Lord, when the Word of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is dispensed to him by the Minister or prudent
friend, that God may have the glory in his consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and no more ascribed to the instrument then is due:
For, the Minister may sow the seed and plant, and
water, but God only can give the increase: men are
ready to fail in this point and mar the blessing, for
God is a jealous God, and will not give his glory to
another.</p>
               <p>22. In case the expected consolation be not found, or
the doubt propounded be not solved so soon as is desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
let the afflicted be exhorted, that he make not
hast in seeking comfort, but patiently submit himself
to Gods will in exercising him for a while, and humble
himself under his mighty hand, in meeknesse waiting
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40880:120"/>
for clearnesse and comfort in due time; for, affliction
is sent to work patience, and patience to work expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and experience to work hope, which shall not
make the patient man ashamed: and it is far better for
a soul to lye for a time in the bonds of affliction, till it
be daunted and subdued, then before patience hath had
the perfect work, to seek to have its foolish wishes
granted unto it: for if once a soul heartily submit it
self to God, or strive to submit, and patiently wait on,
consolation will be found not far off.</p>
               <p>23. In regard the work of the holy Ghost, working
the conversion of a man, may begin before it can be
marked, it is the part of him who medleth with the
afflicted conscience, to deal tenderly with the afflicted,
and so to temper his speech, as he may both further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and faith, pre-supposing the parties exercise
may prove a begun work of grace; for, it is better so
to judge in charity of Gods dispensation, then to foster
sinister suspicions of the party afflicted, which may
readily break forth in some unhappy expressions to the
hurting of the patient, and hindering his profiting by
what may be said beside.</p>
               <p>24. Because we have to do in this Book with the
weak believers, who, in the sense of sin and deserved
wrath, are fled or flying unto Christ, with a purpose of
amendment of life, but do fear they are not, or shall not
be admitted into that kingdom of our Lord Jesus, for
this and that pretended reason: therefore, it will be to
purpose in comforting them, to make use, as of other
Scriptures, so in special of these two passages; the one,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 30. the one serving to
convince them, that they are already in the state of
grace, and of the number of believers in Christ, how
strongly soever they are assaulted with fears, doubts and
suspicions, that it is otherwayes; for, in this passage,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. the Apostle summeth up the whole Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
in few words, holding forth, first, that the fulnesse of
God in three persons, was in the second person of the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40880:121"/>
God-head the Mediator Christ Jesus, and is, upon the
work of reconciling the world to himself, not imputing
their transgressions unto them, that receive the gracious
offer of reconciliation tendred through Christ in the
Gospel. Secondly, that God in Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath committed
unto his Ministers the word of reconciliation that
they, with authority, may offer reconciliation and
friendship with God unto the hearers of the Word of
the Gospel. Thirdly, that the Apostles and Ministers
of the Gospel, are sent forth and directed as Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
to exhort and request m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, in Gods name, and in
the name of Christ God Mediator manifested in the
flesh, to be reconciled unto God. Fourthly, that so
many as do consent unto and imbrace the gracious
offer of reconciliation, are reckoned to be believers, even
all they who do acknowledge their natural enimity
and sins against God, and do welcom the message of
reconciliation, (sent by the Ministers of the Gospel)
and do ingage themselves to hold fast this Covenant,
aiming to walk as reconciled children and servants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, uprightly laying forth their burdens and desires
before him daily: all these (I say) are believers in
Christ, and may assure themselves of reconciliation;
for there is no more in the Apostles and Ministers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
required, for entering of the humbled sinner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a covenant of friendship, save this, we request you
in Gods name, and in the name of God incarnat, Jesus
Christ the Mediatour, we beseech you be reconciled
to God, <hi>v.</hi> 20. Now we judge, that humbled sinners
fled to Christ, and purposing to amend their lives by
his grace, will not be found unwilling to accept this
offer of reconciliation, but will declare their hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to this offer; and so may be convinced, that a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is closed between God and them, and that God
hath given unto them saving faith, how weak soever
it seemeth unto them; for, the consenting unto, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of, this offer, is the condition required for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
in covenant, and the proper act of saving faith.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40880:121"/>
Fifthly, the Apostle holdeth forth the ground-right of
this covenant, and reason whereupon the sinner, fled to
Christ, may be assured of justification: because in the
covenant of Redemption, past between God in three
persons on the one hand, and the second person of the
God-head as M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and perfect Redeemer by price-paying
on the other hand, it is agreed, finally ended and
decreed, that Christs satisfaction, made for the imbracer
of this offered reconciliation, shall as certainly make
the believer judicially righteous and justifie him, as
Christ was judicially made sin or a sacrifice for the sins
of the redeemed: for, <hi>God,</hi> saith he, <hi>v. 21. hath made
Christ to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made
the righteousness of God in him.</hi> Therefore, as Christ
the only Mediator, by accepting the covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
had the sins of the redeemed imputed unto
him, (albeit there was no sin at all, nor could be in
him) and was punished for them unto the death of the
crosse; So, the humbled sinner, by flying unto Christ,
and accepting the offered covenant of reconciliation,
hath Christs satisfaction imputed unto him, (albeit he
can see nothing in himself but a masse of inherent sin)
and shall not enter into condemnation, but be brought
to life-eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Both
the covenant of Redemption made with Christ in the
Redeemers name, and the covenant of Reconciliation
made with us through Christ, are of Gods making, and
so must stand, and cannot be dis-annulled for ever.</p>
               <p>The other place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. holdeth forth the right
which God hath made to the believer, unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
riches of Christ, whereunto the weakest
believer, fled from sin and wrath unto Christ, as the
refuge and perfect remedy from both, may claim, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wisdom, righteousnesse, sanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by him: and that by covenant and decree regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat
in this and other places of Scripture, as judicially
declared and adjudged unto all and every believer in
him; So that they may and should make use of Christ,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40880:122"/>
as made unto them <hi>wisdom</hi> to direct them, <hi>justification</hi> to
justifie them, <hi>sanctification</hi> to perfect them peece and
peece in holinesse, and <hi>redemption</hi> to support them under,
and deliver them from, all bonds of misery.</p>
               <p>For the better understanding of this rich passage, we
shall take it up in four sentences pronounced from the
holy Spirit by the Apostle; in every one whereof, these
three things are insinuat and imported, first, our need
of Christ; 2. his ingaged help and supply; and, 3.
our duty to lay hold upon and make use of him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the right and interest in him, made unto every
believer.</p>
               <p>The first sentence is this, <hi>Christ is made unto us wisdom,</hi>
which importeth, first, that not only we are by nature
blind and ignorant of our sin and misery, blind and
ignorant of the way of salvation and right maner of
serving God, but also after that we are illuminat by
grace, and made in some measure to know our last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and to flye unto Christ for delivery, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
about with much darknesse and foggy mists of
doubts, errors and mistakes, and have need to be in
every step of our way directed and powerfully taught
by Christs Word and Spirit, to know what is that
good and acceptable will of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it importeth, that as Christ is the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of all wisdom and knowledge who hath revealed
in the Scriptures the whole counsell of God concerning
our salvation; So he is judicially made over unto us as
anointed Prophet to his Church, to make known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us the way of life by his Word and Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it imports our duty to receive him as the
great gift of God, and to give up our selves to his
teaching, to imploy him and depend upon him as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
appointed to us for direction by his Word, what
to believe and how to live before God. Whereupon
the weakest believer may trust in him for guiding them
in the use of the Scripture and exercise of the means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by him unto salvation; because he is made of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40880:122"/>
God unto us <hi>wisdom,</hi> and intimation thereof is made
by his Apostle.</p>
               <p>The second sentence is this, <hi>Christ is made of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us righteousnesse:</hi> which presupponeth, first, that
we are by nature destitute of righteousnesse, condem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as unrighteous by the law, and unable to deliver
our selves from condemnation, and when we are fled
to Christ and delivered from condemnation, that we
are not able to stand in that state, but by our daily sins
wherein we fall, do deserve to be condemned as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it imports, that Christ is not only righteous
in himself and able to satisfie divine justice for our sins,
but also hath undertaken to pay, and actually hath
payed the price of our redemption by his obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Father even to the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath of the Crosse, and hath
taken on him the office of high Priest to apply unto us
absolution from our sins, make us accepted and to be
dealt with as righteous, and to keep us in that blessed
estate by his intercession.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it imports our duty to lay hold on Christ
our Cautio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er, by vertue of our right and interest in
him, granted and intimat unto us, and so to rest on
him, that whatsoever Sathan, Conscience, or Law
violat by us, shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> say, we who are f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed from sin and
wrath to him, may oppose this sentence of our abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
registrat here, Christ is made unto us <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
judicially, by the decree and decreet of God.</p>
               <p>The third sentence is this, <hi>Christ is made unto us of
God sanctification,</hi> which presupponeth, that in the
justified believer there are remaining still the reliques of
sin inherent, from which we are not able of our selves
to deliver our selves, but have need of divine power to
mortifie sin in us, and to repair the image of God by
increasing holinesse in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it importeth, that Christ the Mediator,
the holy one of <hi>Israel,</hi> hath not only payed the price
of our redemption for removing of our guiltinesse and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40880:123"/>
saving us from condemnation, but also hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to the Father to write his law in our heart, and
at last to present us perfect without spot or blemish, for
which end, he hath taken by appointment the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
office of Prophet, Priest and King.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it imports, that it is our duty to lay hold
upon this rich gift and right intimat unto us judicially
from God, and whatsoever commanded duty we are
to go about, we do it in the name of Christ, sucking
by faith, sap and vertue from him to bring forth good
fruits holy and acceptable to God through him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ, the second person of the God-head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnat,
is made unto us, and judicially intimat from
God to us, our <hi>sanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth sentence is this, <hi>Christ is made of God unto
us redemption:</hi> which importeth, first, that we
who have fled from sin and wrath unto Christ, and are
justified by faith, and begun to be sanctified, are yok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a warfare with our sinfull flesh, the world and
Sathan, being subject to many miseries in this life, and
to death natural and the grave. In which warfare we
are not of our selves able to stand, nor to deliver our
selves from the miseries whereunto we are subject, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by divine power we be supported, brought thorow
and saved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it imports, that Christ not only hath
payed a satisfactory price for our redemption, and is
able to deliver us from all sin and misery against the
power of whatsoever adversary; but also, that he hath
undertaken the work, and hath by compact with the
Father, obliged himself to deliver us powerfully from
all sin and misery and to overcome to our behoove all
our enemies and tread them underfoot, and that he is
judicially established in his kingly office, and made
over to us for our assurance by decreet intimat to
us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it importeth our duty, that by vertue of
the right and gift of Christ God-man, made over
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40880:123"/>
unto us by Gods decreet now intimat, we should rely
by faith on him, as the pledge of perfecting our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
throughly, and fight out our battels, against
all adversar powers and all miseries, in his strength,
rejoycing in his victory over all our enemies; for,
God hath made him unto u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

and many regenerat persons have only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural
opinion that they are regenerat, who are not
come up as yet to an assurance and perswasion of their
blessed estate. And the number is not great of these
who alwaies, or any long time together, do injoy
that serenity and tranquility of conscience, that they
can confidently triumph, and glory with the Apostle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4. 5. because of desertions and tentations,
raising doubts in their conscience, concerning their
estate, oft-times holy persons are disquieted. With
such persons, while they are in that case, a Pastor or
a prudent friend must deal so, as he would deal with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40880:124"/>
the infirm, and with them who think themselves not
converted, because the same remedies will serve to
strengthen a weak believer and to draw a soul, sensible
of sin, and under the pangs of the new birth, unto
faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>2. But let us come more particularly to examine the
doubts of some that are regenerat, and their pretended
reasons for their doubting. Some are so sensible of
their own unworthinesse, that they question if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or any like unto themselves, can be in the state
of grace, mean time their carriage is such a, becometh
a Christian, blamelesse: I Feel in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> eyes to heaven: wherein is pointed out to us the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40880:124"/>
sense of his unworthinesse, hindering him to approach
confidently to the throne of grace.</p>
               <p>3. For removing of this doubt, five or six conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
may be represented to the party afflicted, with
this <hi>proviso,</hi> that the sense of his unworthinesse be not
discharged, or diminished, but wisely entertained in
him rather; for, it is not to be presupposed, that any
man can esteem himself so unworthy and far from
meriting any good at Gods hand, as he is indeed:
But yet his doubt, how he dare or may draw near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ because of his felt unworthinesse may be sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
1. If he consider the nature and offer made of the
covenant of grace, whereby these that are sensible of
their own unworthinesse, are so far from being debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the covenant of grace, that the covenant of
grace doth not admit any person to be received into it,
but such only who do renounce all confidence in their
own works and worthinesse, and do flye unto the offer
of the free grace of God in Christ: for, our Lord hath
said, <hi>Mat. 9. 13. I came not to call the righteous but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to repentance:</hi> And the promises of the Evangel,
are made to the poor in spirit, to the hungry, and
thristy for the righteousnesse of Christ, which only
can satisfie a hungry soul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3, 6. yea, the sense
of unworthinesse is in effect that self-loathing whereof
<hi>Ezek.</hi> speaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 36. 31. which sense of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse,
may be seen in <hi>Iob,</hi> as a special act and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his repentance, <hi>Iob.</hi> 42. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let him consider, that because by reason
of sin, no worthinesse can be found in us, therefore
God hath freely loved the world and provided grace in
Christ, that all that flye to him, may out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
receive grace for grace, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the three sold office of a Mediator, wherewith
Christ hath cloathed himself, doth obviat and meet the
doubts of the humbled soul under the sense of unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
for, albeit he be ignorant and slow to understand
and believe the revealed will of God, about mens sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40880:125"/>
and his prescribed service; yet, upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> flying
to Christ, he hath Christ offered and given to him for
his wisdom, a Prophet able to inform him, to open his
eyes, and perswade him to imbrace by lively faith all
saving doctrine. Albeit he be exceeding sinfull and
worthy of condemnation, yet he hath Christ a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Priest
made of God unto him <hi>righteousness</hi> and <hi>sanctification,</hi>
upon his flying to him for refute from sin and wrath,
undertaking also powerfully to sanctifie him, by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
his corruptions, and perfecting at last the Image
of God in him. And albeit he have the world and
his own flesh, and the power of all principalities and
spiritual wickednesse, with many miseries in this life to
wrestle with; yet, he hath Christ Jesus as King, made
of God unto him <hi>redemption,</hi> upon his flying to Christ
for refuge against all his enemies; So that he may be
sure to be found among them whom he hath redeemed
by price-paying, and for whom he hath undertaken
powerfully to sustain them in all this warfare, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
misery they may be in, and at last to bring them
out of all sin and misery to a perfect rest in everlasting
glory. And to what end hath our Lord taken on the
office of a Mediator and Redeemer, if not to open the
eyes of the blind that flye to him for eye-salve, to cover
the naked, flying unto him, with the precious garment
of his imputed righteousnesse, and to enrich the poor,
needy and unworthy out of the store house of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
riches of grace? <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let him consider the constant course of grace
and practical dispensation thereof in all ages toward
all the converted. Are not all they to whom the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
cometh, in the state of corrupt nature, when God
cometh to convert them? For, never was there any
person called unto the state of grace, but he was found
in his sins and in the state of lost sinners by nature:
none but children of wrath and enemies by nature are
reconciled; none but they, who, by the law, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
are justified; none but they, that in their own
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40880:125"/>
sense are lost, do obtain salvation; for, Christ doth
plainly tell us, <hi>I came to seek and to save them that are lost.</hi>
Did he ever reject any that fled unto him, because they
were unworthy? No; for it is said, <hi>Ps. 9. 10. They
that know thy name will trust in thee; for thou never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
them that sought thee.</hi> And, (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 37.) he saith,
<hi>These that come unto me, I will in no case cast out.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9.
<hi>Not according to our works, but according to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, hath he called us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, let him consider the worthinesse of Christs
person and merits, who, (because he being God and
man in one person, hath paid a price of infinit value
for redemption of sinners who flye unto him) is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
for whose cause, the unworthy sinner, flying to the
throne of grace, should be received in favour, and made
fit for eternal life by the sanctification of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, let him consider, that if he stand a-back from
Christ, and do not flye unto him, how unworthy soever
he think himself, he remains under wrath and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatory
sentence of the law, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 8. but, let him
rather remember, that he is warranted by a command
of God the Father, to flye to Christ, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 23. This
is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of
his Son, Iesus Christ, and love one another as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us.</hi> And therefore, let him say of his own soul
with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a man is regenerat, and made quiet in his conscience,
when through sad affliction and sore temptation, these
wounds of his conscience begin to bleed again, his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and peace is called in question. Of this exercise
there are three degrees: the first is, when sins against
the law are mustered, and led in an hoste against a
soul; which was the case of the afflicted Psalmist for
a time, till by faith he over-came the doubt, <hi>Ps. 40. 12.
Innumerable evils have compassed me about, mine iniquities
have taken hold on me, so that I am not able to look up:
they are more then the hairs of mine head; therefore my
heart faileth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second degree is, when beside the mans sins
against the Law his sins also against the Gospel, against
Christ and the means of salvation, do arise in battel
against him, and do drive him to cry out, with these
not yet converted sinners, <hi>(Act. 2. 37.) men and brethren,
what shall we do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third degree is, when the regenerat man, for some
grosse sins against the light of his conscience, is given up
for a time to be scourged with the temptations and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
of Sathan, as if he had sinned against the holy
Ghost, and no more mercy were reserved for him; and
this was the case of the Prophet <hi>Ionah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> when being
guilty and conscious to his late rebellion against God,
he is pursued and apprehended by God, and casten in

                  </gap>it of desperation till God gave
him victory by faith, <hi>Ion. 2. 4. Then I said, I am cast out
of thy sight; yet I will look again to thy holy Temple:</hi> which
was the trysting place of God with sinners in a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
This was also the case of <hi>David</hi> for a time, after
that his conscience is wakened by the message of God
sent unto him in the mouth of <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet,
when he found the spirit of consolation with-drawn
from him, and the wrath of God breaking his bones
and consuming the marrow thereof, <hi>Ps. 51. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which thou
hast broken may rejoice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

2. In answering this doubt, we must proceed sutably
to each degree severally. In curing this case in the
fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t degree, let the afflicted admit all the just aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his sins against the Law, which the conscience
doth presse: for, by extenuation of sin, neither is Gods
justice glorified, nor the conscience satisfied; and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or hope of remission of sin must not arise from
the few number o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> lightnesse of sins, but from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and largenesse of Gods mercy: and therefore,
we must not cut short the reckoning with the Lords
law, nor must we diminish the weight and estimation
of our evil deservings; but course must be taken, that
by the sense of guiltinesse, the judgment of the afflicted
person be not so confounded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd perplexed, as if his
case were desperat, and possibility of salvation were
passed; but rather let the afflicted humble himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the mighty hand of God, who alone can destroy
and make alive, and who usually bringeth down to
death and brink of hell, and bringeth back again, and
who alone doth work wonders.</p>
               <p>This doubt then arising from the multitude of sins,
may be loosed, first, by a fresh consideration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
excellency and worthinesse of Christ Jesus, God
manifested in the flesh, and of the incomprehensible va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the price of redemption, payed by him for all
who flye unto him: for, the Father hath declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
satisfied by him in behalf of the redeemed, for whom
he did offer himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. saying, <hi>This is my
well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</hi> And <hi>(Heb.

that come to God by him.</hi> Secondly, by consideration of
the infinit largenesse of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bounty, grace and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
wherein he hath set no bounds to himself in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and abolishing the sins of those that come unto
him, how grosse and grievous soever they have been,
<hi>Isa. 44. 22. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
and as a cloud thy sins, return unto me, for I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
thee.</hi> And, <hi>(Isa. 1. 18.) Come now and let us
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40880:127"/>
reason together,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>though your sins be as

as crimson, they shall be as wool.</hi> And <hi>(Matth. 11. 28.)
Come unto me</hi> saith Christ, <hi>all ye that labour and are heavy
loaden, and I will give you rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the consideration of the many examples
and experiences of the mercy of God manifested in the
pardon of hainous sinners, both in the old and new
Testament, set down in Scripture, of set purpose to
invite such as are troubled with the sense of their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
sins, to come unto Christ the Mediator, or to
God in Christ reconciling the world to himself, by
not imputing sins to them who embrace the offer of
grace and reconciliation tendered unto them in the
Gospel.</p>
               <p>As to the second degree wherein the doubt is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the addition of the sins against the Gospel,
unto the sins against the Law, by despiseing or slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the means of salvation offered in the Gospel; true it
is, that the despising or slighting of the offer of grace
in Christ, cannot be sufficiently aggreged, because the
sins of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

laid in the ballance with the contempt of the Gospel,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 14, 15. yet, notwithstanding, when God
is entered in reckoning with a sinner, and is begun to
challenge him for his sins against the Law and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
also, and hath by his terror humbled the man, there
is mercy insinuated unto that person in the bosome of
the threatening. Wherefore the soul born down with
the sense of ill-deserving by his sins against both Law
and Gospel, must be exhorted to humble himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and flye in unto Christ, who of set purpose
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he might answer this doubt, hath declared, that
whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it
shall be for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iven him, to wit, if he repent this injury
done to Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 32. and he standeth knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the door of luke-warm <hi>Laodicea,</hi> with an ofter
of coming in to them, and supping with them, that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40880:127"/>
shall open to him, notwithstanding they have slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him long in their senslessenesse of sin, nakednesse
and misery.</p>
               <p>As to the third degree, wherein the afflicted doth
suspect, that he hath sinned against the holy Ghost,
because he hath sinned against the light of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ement of the holy Spirit, let the afflicted
consider, that the sinning in actual grosse out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
against the light of the conscience, is indeed a high
provocation of God to his face, for which the offender
is to be humbled all the dayes of his life. Secondly,
let him learn to glorifie God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Justice, who hath made
a proud rebell to be scourged with scorpions, and sore
bitten with the remorse of a slighted and contemned
conscience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let those particular transgressions, object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be done against the light of the conscience, be
examined with their motives and circumstances: and
out of the bitter rod of Gods correcting the offender,
that he should not perish with the world, let the
afflicted take up the Lords love in judging him, that he
may not be condemned. As also let the Pastor, or the
prudent friend, who goeth about to comfort the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
carefully observe if the afflicted be grieved for
grieving of the holy Spirit, if he desire and long after
the consolation of God, whom he hath offended, if
he purpose to walk more circumspectly afterward, and
eshew the snare he hath taken into, or what other
evidences of repentance can be seen in him, whereof
use may be made to assure the afflicted, that he hath
not sinned unto death. Because the sin against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, as it is described unto us in holy Scripture,
is either a malicious refusing and opposing wittingly
and wilfully of Christ Jesus, after that the Spirit of
Christ hath convinced the person, that Christ is the
Redeemer; and this was the sin of some Pharisees, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat,
professed, and irreconciliable enemies to Christ,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 24. to 33. or, it is a totall apostasie from
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40880:128"/>
Christ after they have known him to be the Redeemer,
joyned with a malitious oppugning of the christian
Religion, as it is set forth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27. to 32. and
whosoever falleth in this sin, he neither repents him
of it, nor desires to repent or be reconciled with
God.</p>
               <p>And therefore, let the humbled and afflicted peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
longing to be reconciled unto God through
Christ, and to find the sense of his favour granted or
restored, not suspect himself any more guilty of this
sin, but let him make use of the offer of grace in the
Gospel and of the example of penitents mentioned in
Scripture. Who knoweth how soon the Lord may take
the penitent in his fatherly embracements and comfort
him abundantly? Mean time, till the sensible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
be given unto him, let him hold fast the promises
made to them that flye unto Christ.</p>

speciall, must seriously pray to God, that he would
blesse the means of information and consolation, which
he is about to use for the satisfying of the afflicted.</p>
               <p>To this end therefore, first, let all the reasons whereby
the afflicted pretendeth to make his reprobation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
be resumed and refuted as frivolous all of them.
And certainly, they cannot but be found frivolous,
because God hath not given any certain evidence or
sign of reprobation, so long as a man is alive, except
that sin unto death, the sin against the holy Ghost,
in a malicious refusing, rejecting and hostile opposing
of Jesus Christ wittingly and willingly: for, as to
finall unbelief and impenitency, no man can passe
sentence upon any person, that hath heard any thing
of the Gospel, so long as breath is in him; for, God
can convert a soul to himself in the pangs of imminent
death, as he did the thief on the crosse.</p>
               <p>All the evil which the afflicted can say of himself,
cannot prove him a reprobat, the hight which his
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40880:129"/>
reckoning can rise unto to fortifie his own suspicion of
himself, is only to give appearance that he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat;
mean time we pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uppone the afflicted person
under this tentation, to labour under the sense of many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
sins (which do furnish strength unto the tentation)
and to be hungry and thirsty for righteousnesse, and
to be desirous to draw near to God in Christ, if he
could be delivered of his suspicion of Gods purpose and
affection towards him. And therefore his christian
friends are bound in charity to expound this his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for righteousnesse, and thristy desire of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
through Christ, to be a begun work of graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
regeneration, and so also a hopefull sign that he is
elected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after refutation of his pretended reasons
for his suspicion and fear, this suspicion must be set
before him as a strong tentation of Sathan, and a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murthering
lie, thrown as a fiery dart at him, (such as
the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. maketh mention of) of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to beat the shield of faith out of his hand: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he must be exhorted to resist the Tempter, and
that so much the more, as Sathan out of envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
doth slander God, and the begun work of grace
in the man, and all to vex the soul of him whom he
cannot keep in his snare.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the giving so much way to this wicked
suggestion, must be represented to the patient as an act
of ignorance and folly, yea an act of iniquity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
unto God, and to his own soul: for, what a
madnesse is it to pry in upon the secret counsell of God,
and to neglect his revealed will set down in Scripture?
what presumption to intrude our selves upon his secret
decrees, and to cast behind our back his open com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
given to us? To refuse obedience to Gods
ordinances given to us for our salvation, except he shall

To open our ears to the false suggestions of the devil a

ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ears from hearing the voice of God speaking to us
in Scripture? Wherefore, let the afflicted under this
temptations take heed to what is said, <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t. 29. 29. The
secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but these things
that are revealed belong u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>to us and our children for ever,
that we may do all the words of this Law.</hi> Let the Lords
Command be first obeyed, and then the decree of God
concerning the believer in him, shall be timeously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed:
for, his promises are agreeable with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
and his promises are offered to us, that thereby his
decrees may be brought on unto a just and gracious
execution.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let the afflicted call to minde, what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
the Lord hath bestowed upon him from his infancy,
and in special, that he hath offered, and doth continue
to offer, Christ Jesus unto him, if he will receive him
for wisdom, righteousnesse, sanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and upon this ground he is bound to give unto
God a good construction in every sort of dispensation
toward him, and look upon God as his friend and
father.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <head type="sub">Wherein the regenerat mans doubting of his regeneration,
because he findeth no power in himself to believe in Christ,
is answered.</head>
               <p>SOmetime it cometh to passe, that the renewed man,
after a long time standing in the stare of grace, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in doubt about the work of grace in himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when God doth change his dispensation toward
him, and bringeth him to tryal by trouble, wherein he
is found weaker then he expected, he beginneth to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
whether the former work of grace hath been found
or not, and his reason is, because he findeth by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
often repeated, that in straits and difficulties when
he would most exercise faith and believe in Christ, he
is found least able to do it; yea, he findeth it no lesse
impossible to observe the whole moral Law, then so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40880:130"/>
to believe in Christ: hence ariseth anxiety in the
soul of the afflicted, while he neither dar depart from
Christ, nor yet is able to approach unto him confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
In this case many new doubts and temptations do
arise, which weaken his faith yet more, and hinder
him in the exercise of religion and discharge of duties,
not a little.</p>
               <p>That this sometime may be the case of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
the experience of the Saints, set down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
maketh evident, <hi>Ps. 30. 7. Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David, by thy
favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong; thou
didst hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi> And in his prayer,
<hi>(Ps. 61. 2.)</hi> while his minde was overwhelmed in him
with perplexing thoughts, he findeth in himself no
strength or ability to deliver himself or put forth acts
of faith on the Mediator, as he would have done, but
prayeth, that while he is now exiled and driven far off
from the tabernacle and ark of the Covenant, he may
be raised up to believe in him who was signified by
these tipes, to wit, Christ the Rock of all Salvation:
which Rock of salvation, he perceiveth to be a higher
mystery then he can discover or ascend upon, without
the hand of divine power. And therefore saith, <hi>from
the end of the earth, will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is higher then I.</hi> Yea,
the godly afflicted Hebrews fell in this sicknesse, whom
the Apostle exhorteth to take courage unto them,
<hi>Heb. 12. 12, 13. Wherefore lift up your hands which hang
down, and the feeble knees, and make streight paths for your
feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For answering of this doubt, the afflicted person
must be convinced of his infirmity and sinfull dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
because being called of God to the exercise and
tryal of his faith in Christ by whatsoever sort of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he hath been discouraged and fainted, which did
not become a souldier of Christ, and that for no other
pretended reason but this, that he could not give such
a proof of his faith as he should have given and hoped
to give, before he was put to tryal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:40880:130"/>
Secondly, he must consider how far he is mistaken
in leaning to his own strength, in the exercise of his
faith; of which self-confidence, the more a man is
emptied, the more speedily he shall be furnished, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
emptied he flye to Christ for supply. This was
the experience of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. who was
made weak in himself, that the strength of Christ might
be made perfect in his weaknesse; and therefore he
resolved to make use of the strength of Christ in all
his felt infirmities, and that he did, with good successe.
For when I am weak, saith he, then am I strong. Whose
example we must resolve to follow.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, after search, it will be found, that the person
afflicted, under the notion and expression of <hi>I cannot
believe,</hi> hath, in effect, this meaning, I cannot find such a
full assurance of faith as I would be at; or, I cannot
find such a sense of the approbation of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aiah as
can satisfie me and perswade me that I do believe really
in Christ. And so it is another thing, and another gift
of the Spirit he is seeking, then what he pretendeth to
seek: for, the sense and feeling of approven faith, and
full assurance of faith, is not given to every believer, but
to him that sights the fight of faith, and in his tryals,
adhereth closely to Christ and to his truth, when he is
tempted to sin, as the clause in the close of the seven
Epistles to the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> doth teach us, <hi>Rev. 2. 3.
To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life,
to eat of that hid manna; I will give him that white stone,
and a new name written thereon, which no man knoweth, save
he that receiveth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the afflicted must be instructed or put in
minde to distinguish between believing in Christ, and
the knowing that he doth believe in Christ, as may be
learned from 1 <hi>Ioh. 5. 13. These things I writ to you, that
believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know,
that you have eternal life; and that ye may believe on the
name of the Son of God.</hi> He must distinguish between
true (though weak) saying faith and strong faith. True
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40880:131"/>
saving faith is in that person, who, being pursued by the
Law, doth flye for refuge to lay hold upon Christ the
hope set before us. The man that dwelleth in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Christ, and maketh use of Christ as the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
against sin and misery, as he is offered to us in the
Gospel, hath right unto that strong and well-grounded
consolation spoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18, 19. True and
saving faith is in that person, who acknowledging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a child of wrath, heartily receiveth the Lord Jesus
Christ, as he offereth himself to us in the Gospel; for,
such a person hath the right and priviledge of a child
of God, and may reckon himself among believers in
Christ, <hi>Ioh. 1. 12. As many as received Christ, to them
gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that
believe in his name.</hi> True and saving faith is in that
person, who, being convinced of his enimity against
God, doth answer the request of God in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the
mouth of his Ministers, with a hearty consent unto the
covenant of grace and reconciliation offered to all that
hear the Gospel, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19, 20. God was in Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliateon.
Now then, we are Embassadors, for Christ, as
though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead
be ye reconciled unto God: for he hath made him</hi> (that is,
Christ) <hi>to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be
made the righteousness of God in him.</hi> Therefore, let the
afflicted answer thus. I receive the offer, and do consent,
upon these termes, to be reconciled to God, Lord help
my unbelief; for, thou hast said, <hi>seek ye my face;</hi> and
my soul answereth <hi>Thy face, O Lord, will I seek, hide not
thy face from me,</hi> Ps. 27. 8, 9. He that upon these termes,
doth flye to Christ, and resolveth to adhere unto him,
needeth not doubt but he is received in the state of
grace: for confirmation whereof, let the fruits of faith
outward and inward, which may be observed by the
afflicted himself, or by his comforter, be called to mind,
and let him rest and go on in the course of obedience of
the Gospel.</p>

               <head type="sub">Wherein the doubt of the regenerat man, concerning his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the state of grace, arising from his apprehended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of humiliation and sorrow for sin, is answered.</head>
               <p>SOme regenerat persons will be found, who mourn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for their sin, and do acknowledge, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
death for their sins, do confesse they stand in need
of Christ, do thirst for his righteousnesse, do desire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to be united unto him by faith, do follow the
exercise of Religion, and do endeavour to keep their
consciences undefiled in all things; and yet for all this,
do not only doubt whether they be renewed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
do esteem it a presumptuous rashnesse in them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
unto Christ, or to cast themselves over on him
by faith, before they be more seriously humbled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they feel a more hearty sorrow and grief, before they
feel the pangs of the new birth more sharp, before they
be more pressed with the burthen of their sins, and do
feel in themselves the spirit of fear and trembling and
bondage in a higher measure.</p>
               <p>From whom, if you ask a reason of their doubt,
they shall answer, that they are not yet called to come
unto Christ, because these are only called to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ who are weary and loaden in the superlative
degree, and are so born down with the weight of sin,
as they cannot be more, and not despair; for so do
they interpret that saying of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28.
Christ is sent only to the contrite and broken in heart,
who sit in the dust, under the spirit of bondage, that
is to say, as they take it, to them who are under grief
unspeakable, as they expound, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3. So
in their opinion, Christ came to save only those who
in their own sense are lost, that is, who are on the
brink of desperation: wherefore, in respect they are
not gone down deep enough as they think into this
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40880:132"/>
gulf and hell of anguish and sorrow, they dare not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
or look toward Christ.</p>
               <p>Mean time they lye daily mourning and weeping,
and will not grant that their grief is worthy of the name
of grief; which sorrow they cannot dissemble or hide,
but do bewray it in their countenance, habite, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and frequent sighing, and will professe, that they
can hardly think they have right to eat or drink of Gods
creatures, and were it not for fear of adding yet more
sin to the former, they would not eat or drink at all: oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they chatter as swallows and sigh as the turtle
dove, and oft-times their bowels sound out as if their
parents or children or nearest relations were dead, and
yet for all this do not satisfie themselves in sorrow,
but do complain that they are stupid and senslesse of
their sinfull and miserable condition, wherein they
do lye bound: and though they do confesse, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they mourn, yet they alledge their mourning is
but like the early dew, or morning cloud, that goeth
soon away. All the while it is in vain to offer to the
afflicted consolation in Christ, because (saith he) I am
not one of the mourners in <hi>Sion</hi> whom he will comfort:
and in this their mistake, they do confirm themselves
by another error, saying, that the measure of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and sorrow should answer unto the measure of
sin; my sins, saith he, go far beyond the sins of
others.</p>
               <p>This and the like objections they cast in, whereby
they do obstruct their own way unto Christ and keep
themselves aback from him, till they be satisfied with
their own prescribed measure of sorrow; which case
indeed deserveth much compassion: for, who would
not commiserat their case, who, being in a very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
condition, dare not seek relief from their own
misery which they do feel, and all because they are not
yet more miserable? and when they are asked, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
determine what measure of affected humiliation
they would stand at as sufficient:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:40880:132"/>
2. In the cure of this case, as much must be yielded
to the afflicted, as reasonably can be: and first, it
must be confessed, that it is the duty of all who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
unto Christ, to come in the sense of sin, and
acknowledgment of their miserable condition, and
that the due deserving of their sin, is everlasting death.</p>
               <p>It must be confessed also, that the measure of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,
contrition and lamentation for sin, may
possibly be exceeding great, as we see in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>Heman</hi> the Ezrait, <hi>Psal, 88. 11. I am afflicted
and ready to die from my youth up; while I suffer thy terrors,
I am distracted.</hi> And <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 38.</p>
               <p>This also further must be yielded unto him, that the
operation of the spirit of conviction by the law, doth
ordinarily and of its own nature go before the spirit of
adoption or the operation of the spirit of the Gospel,
according to the covenant of grace, so that no man can
in earnest embrace Christ as a Physician, as Mediator
and Saviour of his soul, except he be sensible of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
acknowledge his natural enmity against God, and
his own lost condition, being by nature under the curse
of the Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when these things are agreed upon, the
afflicted person may be posed concerning the measure
of the sorrow for sin, whether it must be the same in
every convert, to wit, in that extremity and superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
degree, which he doth miss and desiderat in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and how long that sorrow in this eminent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
must continue? By this question he cannot choose
but be at a stand, and unable to answer with Scripture-warrand;
for, the Scripture doth indeed require serious
repentance, but the measure of sorrow and sadnesse, it
doth not prescribe: for, <hi>Matth. chap. 3. v.</hi> 2. 6. many
upon the hearing of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> preaching, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of their sins, and did confesse their sins in the
general, and forthwith were baptized by him. And,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. 41. three thousand souls at the hearing of
one sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> were convinced of their sin, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40880:133"/>
at the heart, repented, and fled to Christ for grace;
were converted, baptized and entered members of the
Christian Church, all in one day. Again, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
may be posed with another question, seing he
desiderats such a measure of sound hearty sorrow in
himself before he can make his addresse unto Christ, out
of what fountain mindeth he to draw this sorrow? of
himself he hath it not, and from Christ by his grounds
he cannot seek it: for he saith, for want of his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
measure of sorrow for sin, he dare not approach
unto Christ, because as he alledgeth none are called to
come unto Christ, except such only as are in a superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
degree weary and loaden, and so full of the spirit
of heavinesse, that he must be at the point of desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
near by. But the Scripture doth teach us, that
Christ is that exalted Prince to give repentance unto
<hi>Israel,</hi> in what measure of sorrow he pleaseth; and
that therefore, such as are convinced of and in any
measure sorrowfull for offending God, should run un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, that he may give them a better measure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the evils and danger which accompany
and follow upon this practical error, may be represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the afflicted; for, first, by this his error he
giveth way to Sathans tentation, who when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
the sense of sin begun in the afflicted by Gods
mercy, and that the afflicted cannot now be hindered
from repentance, nor be keeped in his former snare, doth
change himself as if he were an angel of light, and setteth
all at nought the measure of sorrow which the afflicted
hath already, and shews unto him, how unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
the proportion of his sorrow is unto the multitude
and hainousnesse of his sins, and so spurreth him on to
mourn more and more, that if it be possible he may
distemper and distract him, or make him pine away
and perish in his sorrow, without faith or consolation
in Christ: this is one evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:40880:133"/>
Another evil is this, the affectation of such a degree of
sorrow, smelleth of seeking some sort of expiation of sin,
and compensation of the pleasure taken in sin, by sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
sorrow for it: unto which practical error, we are
by nature too too prone: for as by nature we strive to
be justified by works according to the covenant of
works, written in the children of <hi>Adam;</hi> so when we
see our selves come short of the righteousnesse of works,
we go about (as is to be seen in Papists) to supply the
defect of works, by some one sort or other of our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and satisfactions for sin, in special, that by sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and tears in abundance, we may wash away the
guilt and pollution we have contracted by sin. And
in this course we run on naturally, after wakening of
the conscience, to exact pennance and punishment on
our selves, till the deluded heart say, it is enough. And
then, as if all were well, the deceived sinner resteth
himself: which deceit of the heart, the oftener it hath
place and prevaileth, without being observed, it is the
more dangerous.</p>
               <p>A third evil, following on this practical error, is,
by it the free grace of God and merits of Christ, are
greatly obscured, and both the mans consolation and
sanctification are marred: the loss that the afflicted
sustaineth on the one hand, and the drawing on of new
guiltinesse by such a course on the other hand, is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the vizard of humiliation.</p>
               <p>A fourth evil followeth this error, which is this, the
afflicted person, so long as he continueth in this mistake,
he giveth way to the tentation, and doth of set purpose
foster his own misbelief, that he may thereby foster and
augment his own sorrow, and afright himself with
dreadfull imaginations what shall become of him, that
he may augment his affected heavinesse of spirit, and
make the fountain of his tears run the more abundantly.</p>
               <p>A fifth evil is, the afflicted so long as he suspends his
going to Christ, because he hath not mourned suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
for sin, he fosters another fault unawars, to wit,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40880:134"/>
a purpose to lay down any more sorrowing for sin, if
once he had overtaken his imagined measure of sorrow,
and had his accesse so made unto Christ. This deceit
of the heart, is brought to light in the practice of some
Antinomians, who allow themselves once to mourn
for sin, that their mourning may make way for faith
in Christ; but after they apprehend they have once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
and casten their burthen on Christ, and do
number themselves among believers, they scorn to
mourn any more for sin, they harden themselves against
all remorse of conscience, and do reject secret challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as groundlesse, and make themselves merry with
their own fancy, and reckon all penitents to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the spirit of bondage: which evils, if the afflicted
person would perceive to follow upon his error, which
as a net is spred before his feet to keep him from going
to Christ, and following the course and exercise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
all the dayes of his life, he would take heed
better to his steps.</p>
               <p>4. The afflicted must be informed, or called to mind
concerning sorrow for sin, that it is not commended
from the quantity or measure of it, but from the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or sincerity of it. Now sincere sorrow for sin, is
best discerned by the hatred which the mourner hath
against sin, by the mourners humiliation of himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, by his abhorring himself both for his sin,
and for the hardnesse of his heart under sin, by his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to strive against all sin, by his flying in unto
Christ for relief from sin, by his entertaining and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of godly sorrow after he hath believed in
Christ according as he findeth the inherent roots of sin
to be springing up in him. This is indeed sincere and
godly sorrow, which causeth repentance never to be
repented of.</p>
               <p>5. Fifthly and last of all, the afflicted must be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not to linger any more but flye to Christ, and let
him be humbled so much the more as he is not so
humbled as he should and would be; let him call to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40880:134"/>
minde, that Christ came not only to comfort mourners
for sin, but also to call sinners <hi>unto repentance:</hi> for, Christ
hath not put such a measure of sorrow, whereof we
are speaking, to be the condition of the covenant of
Grace, he doth not fell his precious wares, nor his gifts
of grace, for the price of mens tears; but let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that whosoever is so destitute in his own sense of
all good, as he finds neither the sense of sin, nor repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
nor faith, nor any other good thing in himself,
which may commend him to God, but by the contrair,
much evil of all sorts, and yet cometh to Christ, is no
doubt the poor in spirit, whom Christ hath pronounced
blessed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3. and that the sense of his sin and
misery, in the measure which he hath of it, is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of eye-salve already bestowed upon him, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
him to buy of Christ all the riches which he
holdeth forth to the poor in spirit, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18.</p>

he findeth not his righteousness exceeding the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness

               <p>THere are some regenerat persons, who, in the sense
of their sins and acknowledgment of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse,
and inability to help themselves, are fled
unto Christ, and have given over themselves to him by
faith, and are endeavouring to bring forth fruits suteable
to repentance, who for all this, fall a doubting whether
they be renewed, whether their faith be true and sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith; and the reason which they give of their
doubting, is, because the reformation of their life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they have attained, appeareth unto them not to
exceed the righteousnesse which may be found in some
Pagans, or in Scribes and Pharisees, of whom Christ
hath said in the Evangel. <hi>Matth. 5. 20. I say unto you,
that except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:40880:135"/>
This doubt is followed with grief, anxiety of mind,
and fear least all vertues in them be found nothing but
counterfeit: and this case, except it be speedily cured,
cannot chuse but draw after it heavy and hard conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>For curing whereof, we must confesse, that many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and Infidels may be found in humane Histories,
who from the principles of nature and civil education,
have led a more innocent and blamelesse life, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who glory in their Christian profession, for whose
conviction and condemnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pagans and Infidels shall
arise in the day of judgment, and be brought forth for
a witnesse against many called Christians, and who
shall be beaten with fewer stripes, than many who are
counterfeit Christians, and do disgrace the profession
of Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>But we have here to do with these that are indeed
regenerat, and indued with saving faith, who endeavour
to be holy, and do lament their imperfections, and do
not give over the use of the means, whereby they may
profit in holinesse, albeit with grief and fear they go on
heavily, suspecting they meet at last with disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and be excluded from the kingdom of heaven, for
their coming short of Scribes and Pharisees in the point
of righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>2. In this case, first, the complaint of the afflicted,
concerning the imperfections of his life and fruits of
faith, in as far as it is true and just, must be admitted,
granted and confirmed, and the afflicted must be taught
upon this consideration to be seriously humbled in the
presence of God, that he may profit in self-denyal, and
more and more renounce all confidence in his own
works or inherent righteousnesse. To which purpose,
let him consider yet more the body of death and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin, not yet throughly mortified in him; let him
look upon and acknowledge, in his present case, the
bitter roots of infidelity, and inclination to depart away
from the living God, even then when he is most called,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40880:135"/>
and hath most need to draw near and adhere unto him:
upon the sight and consideration whereof, he shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a necessity daily to renew the acts of repentance
and faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let the necessity and timeous use-making
of the imputed righteousnesse of Christ, be shewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: which righteousnesse, if the Lord had not set
before us for a refuge, what should become of us in
the examination of our works, and felt imperfection of
our inherent righteousnesse? And here the afflicted
must be exhorted, in the sense of his own un-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to run alwayes toward Christ, to have his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
hid by the garment of Christs imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and exhorted to apply and imbrace more and
more straitly the righteousnesse of Christ our Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who is judicially by the Father adjudged to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
fled unto him, for righteousnesse, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30:
But of him are ye in Christ Iesus, who is made unto us wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</hi>
And here let the friend, comforter of the afflicted, insist,
that he may consider the value of the ransom paid for
us, and of the righteousnesse purchased unto us, for the
only garment able to hide our nakednesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let the afflicted person understand, that it is
righteousnesse with God to be displeased with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when they esteem little and make little use of the
dear bought righteousnesse which Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased,
and that in wisdom and righteousnesse, Christ
doth not increase the inherent righteousnesse of those
who slight him in the mater of his imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
for, we are not justified by the perfection of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
righteousnesse, which in this life is impossible,
but by the perfection of Christs righteousnesse imputed
unto the believer in him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when the Pastor or prudent friend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
the afflicted now convicted of his mistake and
error, and to be brought to acknowledge, that the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of a sinner doth come by the imputation of the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40880:136"/>
righteousnesse of Christ alone, without respect to the
works of the law; and that the justified man must set
himself to bring forth good fruits in the gracious fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
which Christ hath promised to the believer.
Now, I say, let him enter upon the comparison of the
righteousnesse of the penitent believer in Christ, with
the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees, and
then shall it be clear to the afflicted person, that the
righteousnesse of the weak Christian shall far exceed
the righteousnesse, not only of Pagans, but also of Scribes
and Pharisees of the highest pitch, and that for three
reasons; the first is this, the Pharisee cutteth short the
interpretation of the law, unto the measure of his own
external obedience, lest the law whereby he seeketh ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
should condemn him; but the Christian
acknowledgeth in all things the spirituality and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Law, and doth not reject any duty which
the Law doth command, but finds himself bound to obey
the Law in all things, and to aim to be perfect as his
heavenly Father is perfect. The second reason is, because
the works which the Pharisee or Scribe doth, are all
counterfeit and corrupt, in regard they arise from the
strength of the natural man, and are done for his own
glory and carnal ends, and not for the glory of God;
but the works of the Christian, exercising faith in Christ,
proceed from the power of the spirit of Christ in him,
and are done to the glory of God by him. The third
reason is, because the righteousnesse of works which
the Scribes and Pharisees did affectat, is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
and maketh void the grace of God: for, if
righteousnesse be by works, it is no more of grace, it
overturnes that heavenly way of justification by faith
in Christ: for, the righteousnesse of the Pharisee by
works, cannot consist with the righteousnesse which is
by faith of grace; but the righteousnesse and justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Christian by faith in Christ, is possible and
ready at hand, to every one who renounceth all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his own worthinesse, and slyeth unto Christ for
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40880:136"/>
grace: and this is a most perfect way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which dependeth upon the obedience and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Christ imputed to the believer in him. Which
righteousnesse only can stand in the judgment of God
as perfect, which only doth open the fountain where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the power of the holy Ghost runneth down upon
the man justified by faith in Christ, to enable him to
bring forth the acceptable fruits of new obedience.</p>
               <p>By this comparison, it doth easily appear, that the
righteousnesse of the weak believer in Christ, doth far
exceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees:
and thus may the afflicted be solved of his doubt, arising
from comparison of his righteousnesse with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of the Pharisees.</p>
               <p>3. If these grounds of satisfaction, laid before the
afflicted, do not satisfie, but his wounds do break up and
bleed afresh, let us examine his reasons. O! saith he,
what I have been aiming at in the way of new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
I suspect is not accepted of God, because I find
not these fruits of the Spirit, which the Apostle speaketh
of as evidences of a new creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. love, joy,
peace, long-suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and temperance; the defect and little feeling of
these fruits, doth argue, that God doth not approve
my works.</p>
               <p>For answering of this doubt, let us remember, that
it is pre-supposed and found by experience, that some
that are afflicted with this doubt and suspicion, do not
cease to follow duties howbeit heartlesly, do live blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
in an evil world, and so are not idle nor unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
only this doth trouble them, that they find not
the peace of conscience which they did expect, they
misse joy in God, consolation in their prayers, patience
in affections, chearfulness and alacrity in following their
calling; they do not find sensible approbation of their
work from God, as they did promise to themselves and
did expect. Hence flow their tears, lamentations and
complaints of themselves, and suspicions of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40880:137"/>
and sincerity of their faith, and all without just
cause: for, as in bodily sicknesses, sometime moe mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
then one are complicat, and to each of them respect
must be had for perfecting the cure; So in this case,
moe practical errors do concur, and each of them must
be deciphered and removed. We shall condescend
upon four; The first practicall error of the afflicted,
is the suspending of his faith upon a tacite condition,
that such and such effects be produced, and that Gods
sensible approbation of his diligence and works be felt,
as if there were no warrantable act of faith for laying
hold on Christ, except after a certain time and tryal
taken whether it shall produce such or such fruits or not.
And here three deceits do concur; The first is, a faith
with a secret reservation, <hi>if such fruits follow,</hi> is by sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
of the tempter, thrust in, in the place of absolute
believing without reservation, and in effect, is a trying
of God, in stead of trusting, in him; for through temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the afflicted tacitly craveth a condition to be
performed by God, that when God performeth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
condition, then the mans faith after that may
rest upon him, other wayes not: for when a sinner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to Christ, he should speak to this sense. <q>O Lord,
my God, seing it hath pleased thee to reveal thy self
to me, a blind impotent sinner, running toward hell,
and hast offered thy self to me for a Saviour, in whom
I may have wisdom, righteousnesse, sanctification and
redemption. Behold, O Lord, I heartily receive the
grace offered, I imbrace thy Word, and thy Self offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me in thy Word, and do give up my self wholly
to thy government, that thou may repair in me the
lost Image of God, and powerfully carry me on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
salvation.</q> Instead of saying thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and closing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
the bargain with God in Christ reconciling
the world to himself, the tempter would have the poor
afflicted man to speak, as it were, to this sense. <q>O
Lord, the condition whereupon thou dost offer to be
my God and Saviour, doth please me well, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40880:137"/>
I fear I may deceive my self in performing that
condition, I require another condition of thee, that
thou wouldst, first, let me see the fruits of faith in me,
which if I shall find within sometime hence, then will
I count my self a believer, and will rest on thee: but
if I find not such fruits as may evidence true faith in
me, I must pronounce my saith, either no faith or a
dead faith, which hath a name of faith, but neither
power nor life in it.</q> For, faith without works is dead,
as <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
               <p>Now, what is this else in effect, then to make a new
condition in the covenant of Grace, and to promise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this condition, to believe on Christ, if God shall do
as the sinner giveth him direction? that is, if God shall
make him bring forth the fruits of faith first, when it
became him absolutely to imbrace Christ, that he might
both be forgiven of sin, and enabled to bring forth
fruits of faith?</p>
               <p>Another fault is here also, which is this, the afflicted
person doth require mature fruits from a weak faith,
from a faith that is not setled and fixed, but suspended
on a condition, which is no lesse unreasonable, then if
a foolish Gardner should require fruits of a young
tree lately planted, yea before the roots of it were well
setled in the ground; yea, and would not let it stand
in his garden, except, it should first bring forth fruits,
whereby it might evidence it self worthy of pains tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on it.</p>
               <p>A third fault is this, that the afflicted, in this case, doth
pre-suppose, that true faith is posterior to the fruits of
true faith, both in nature and time: for, if he will not
believe in Christ, till after he perceive and feel in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the fruits of faith, upon this ground he can never
believe till he first find the fruits of faith in himself,
which is nothing else in effect, then to imagine, that the
effect must go before its cause.</p>
               <p>Unto this threefold self-deceit, we offer this one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
in general, that the afflicted person in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40880:138"/>
case, humble himself before God in the sense of his
barrennesse, and so much the more as he findeth small
or no fruits in himself, let him flye to Christ and fasten
himself the more on his imputed righteousnesse, and
cleave unto him by faith, without delay, that he may
draw vertue and furniture from him to bring forth good
fruits; for, this is the only way to make him bring
forth fruits in abundance, as Christ doth teach us, <hi>Ioh.
15. 5. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth much fruit: for without me, ye can do nothing.</hi>
He, and he only, can make a good tree of an evil imp,
and cause it bring forth fruits answerable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the true vine wherein it is ingrafted. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ in the Canticle, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 13. doth make no
small account of the green figs and tender grapes, let not
the afflicted despise the day of small things.</p>
               <p>4. The second practical error in the afflicteds foresaid
case, is this, the afflicted person hath imagined in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that such and such fruits would presently follow
upon his receiving the offer of Christ, as that he should
forthwith be skillfull in the knowledge of the mysteries
of salvation, able to pray eloquently, made chearfull in
singing songs of praise unto God, ready and expedit to
every good work, and that he should feel constantly an
un-interrupted peace in his conscience, and joy in the
holy Ghost; but after that by experience he hath
found, that he cannot so much as enter upon any good
work without a fight with Sathan and with his own
corrupt nature, and other impediments, and withall he
doth feel the peace of his conscience and the joy of the
holy Ghost with-drawn, hereupon he begins to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the whole work of Gods grace in himself, and that
he remaineth in the state of nature unrenewed.</p>
               <p>5. For removing of this error, let the afflicted know,
that the hopes which he hath conceived at the hearing
of the Gospel, shall not be disappointed (albeit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his childish fore-conception they come not to
passe) for in a time due and acceptable, God shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40880:138"/>
all his promises and bring the believer (fled unto
him) on upon his way, till he put him in full possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fredom from all sin and misery. But yet this feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
is brought about, not all at once, but peece and
peece, and not without conflict with the enemies of
our salvation, and not without use of the meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God. Wherefore let the afflicted be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to take courage unto him, as becometh a souldier
of Christ, and let him go on in the wayes of the Lord
in hope and patience, being assured that whatsoever
God hath promised, he will surely perform, in that
maner, measure, order and time, and by his own
appointed means as he hath set down in his holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>6. The third practical error of the afflicted in the
foresaid case, is, that he doth not judge rightly of his
own faith, nor of the fruits thereof: for of his own
faith he judgeth no otherwayes than of the faith of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, whileas there is a diverse way to judge of
my own faith then of another mans faith; for because
I cannot reach to the internal acts of the soul of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, therefore I must judge only by the outward
effects, according to the rule that <hi>Iames</hi> giveth, <hi>chap.
2. ver. 10. Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will
shew thee my faith by my works.</hi> Yet of my own faith
I may judge, not only by the external effects of it
(which in the first closing with Christ, are not yet
observable possibly) but also by the internal act of faith
which the holy Spirit who knows the heart doth reveal
unto me, by making me not only heartily to embrace
Christ offered in the Gospel, and love him, but also
can make me reflect and turn back mine eye upon his
own gift and grace in me, according to that of the
Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 12. we have received the Spirit of God,
that we might know the things freely given to us of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again the afflicted doth not judge rightly of his own
fruits of faith, according as the truth is, and as the
Lord in his Word doth judge; he should distinguish
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40880:139"/>
between the sincerity of the work and the perfection of
it (a work may be done uprightly, and yet be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect)
he should distinguish what is Gods part in the
work, from that which is wrong and corrupt, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the remainder of sin in him. These things he
doth confound, and doth so fix his eyes upon the defects
and imperfection of his work, that he seeth nothing
but what is wrong, when it is his duty both to observe
what is wrong, that he may be humbled, and cast
away all confidence in his work, and to observe also
what is good and right in his work, proceeding from
the grace of God in him, and so praise and thank God
for it in Christ, <hi>who will not quench the smoaking flax,</hi>
Isa. 42. 3.</p>
               <p>7. For remedy therefore of this error, let the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
first, look upon the acts of his faith both internal
and external, both on the elicit acts of faith and the
imperat acts (as they are called in the Schools) and let
him judge of both according to what is right and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
that whatsoever be the measure of new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it may be differenced from the mixture of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
defects, or corruption. And let him not judge
of his work according to the suggestions and calumnies
of Sathan, who alwayes condemneth so far as he can,
what is good in Gods children; or if he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it, doth labour to have it abused.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let the afflicted observe the due order both
in doing his duties and in judging thereof: for of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
he must, first, put forth an act of faith and love on
Christ, before he can passe judgment on it, and let
him first do the work commanded to the believer, and
then passe sentence, that he may be strengthened to do
moe duties, and so to present them to God to be wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
accepted and amended in his following service.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let him carefully look unto the end which
he should propose to himself in judging of his acts of
faith and obedience: for the end of judging our selves
and our works, should be to confirm our faith in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40880:139"/>
Christ, when we find any thing done according to the
rule, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lye to Christ for pardon and grace if
we conceive all is wrong after we have examined
maters.</p>
               <p>6. The fourth practical error, is, that the afflicted
first suffereth his faith to be wounded and weakened by
Sathans tentation, and then to be drawn forth to the
field to give a proof of the strength of his faith in some
difficile duty, before the wound of faith be bound up
or healed; for, it is a great disadvantage to enter the
lists with Sathan about the fruits of faith, whether they
be sincere or not, when faith is wounded, yea, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and is brought in question whether it be true faith
or not. Now this is a special stratageme and wile of
Sathan, by whatsoever mean he can to hurt the faith
of Gods children, that he may by that marr commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-keeping
with God, and cut off, if he can, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit
whereby the power of Christ is conveyed to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
for making him give acceptable obedience unto
God. And certainly, it is no lesse difficile, when
faith is wrested, and for a time out of joynt, to set about
acceptable service, then it is to make a man to set upon
his work when his armes are out of joynt.</p>
               <p>Therefore, for remedy of this error, let the afflicted,
so soon as he findeth his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith wounded, incontinent
set himself down before God humbly, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his foolishnesse, want of watching, unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and inability, either to know how he hath griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gods Spirit, and made open a door for the Tempter
to fall in upon him, or to repent the sins which he
knoweth might have provoked God so to exercise him;
and next, let him look unto God in Christ reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the world to himself, and lay hold on the hornes
of the altar, on the throne of grace for strengthening
his faith, that he may find help for the present need,
and thereafter also to walk more wisely: for, this is
the counsell which Christ doth give to the corrupt
Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Revel. 3. 2. <hi>Strengthen the thing
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40880:140"/>
which remaineth and is ready to die.</hi> Thus may the
afflicted recover strength of faith and ability to resist
Sathan, and furniture for bringing forth unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fruits of faith.</p>

               <head type="sub">Wherein the regenerat mans doubt, whether he be in the
state of grace, arising from his unquietnesse of spirit, is
answered.</head>
               <p>THis case is incident to many dear children of God,
and may befall Champions in time of sad afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as we see in the Prophet, <hi>Ps.</hi> 42. 11. and 43. 5.
<hi>why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
within me?</hi> But even in time of outward pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
or when no great affliction bodily lyeth on, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
who in the sense of their sinfulnesse have fled to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and have taken his yoke upon them, are
troubled with doubtings, whether they be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of true believers, whether they have rightly come
unto Christ, whether they have been well accepted of
him; and for their doubting they can give no other
reason, save this, I cannot be quiet, nor rest in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that I am in the state of grace; if they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogat,
what they think of the evident signs of their
regeneration which have been and are to be seen in their
conversation since they began in earnest to seek the face
of God in Christ? They will possibly not altogether
deny Gods work in them; but yet dare not lean weight
upon these signs, because they do find these signs also
brought in question, whether they have been or are
kindly and sincere; mean time they are about to do that
which is acceptable to God in the course of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
albeit with more heavinesse and lesse alacrity
then b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cometh persons reconciled to God in Christ.</p>
               <p>2. This disease will be found complicat and made
up of moe mistakes and errors then one: and therefore
is to be the more narrowly considered: because it is no
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40880:140"/>
small hinderance of a comfortable christian conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which God doth allow on his children; for in the
party troubled with unquietnesse, we presuppone, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
there is a serious sense of sin, and purpose to do better.
2. An unfained embracing of the covenant of grace and
reconciliation in Christ J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sus. And, 3. an honest,
though weak, endeavour to bring forth the fruits of
new obedience: and yet notwithstanding the person is
not quiet, but walketh heavily and is discouraged,
by reason of his uncertainty, whether he be in the state
of grace or not: yea, he is cast down and disquieted,
because he is disquieted, and cannot get a reasonable
answer from his conscience when he asketh of it, why
are thou cast down and disquieted within me?</p>
               <p>3. The mistakes and errors, whence this dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and unquietnesse doth flow are many; but we
shall condescend upon eight or nine only. The first
error, and cause of unquietnesse is, or may be this,
that the party afflicted, albeit he have the habits of
saving grace in him, and doth by Gods grace put forth
these habits in actual exercise, yet he doth not reflect
upon, nor turn his eye to observe, the operations of
Gods holy Spirit in himself, nor the acts of saving
grace, which the holy Spirit hath made him put forth,
of which if he take not notice, they are to him for the
time as if they were not; and so no wonder he be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
while he perceiveth not in himself that which
might make him quiet: For example, when the sense
of sin is raised up in a mans spirit by the holy Ghost, if
he do not observe that this is one of the operations of the
holy Spirit convincing the world of sin, or if he do not
turn back his eye on this operation, and upon his own
act, stirred up thereby, to subscribe the sentence of the
law against himself, no wonder that he doubt of his
conversion, till he see the foot-steps of God the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter
of him, from the love and approbation of sin,
unto the hatred of it; and when he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to Christ the
only Redeemer from sin and misery, and hath laid hold
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40880:141"/>
on him according to the covenant of grace offered in
him, if he do not look back on this operation of God
drawing him to Christ, and upon his own act of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto Christ, by the draught of Gods Spirit, what
wonder he do not reckon himself among believers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he be in Gods account one of that number? And
when the holy Spirit hath kindled in him not only a
purpose of new obedience, but also a begun endeavour
to live holily, justly and soberly, if he do not observe and
acknowledge these operations of Gods Spirit making
him to bring forth these acts, what wonder that this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
and inconsideration do open a door to disquietnesse
and doubting, whether he be in the state of grace or not?</p>
               <p>4. For removing this cause of disquietnesse, the
afflicted person must beware that he passe not sentence
of Gods dispensation towards him, according to the
tentations and suggestions of Sathan, nor yet according
to the opinion which his Pastor or friend may have of
him, judging somewhat uncharitably of him, upon
sinister suspicions: neither let him stand to the suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his own incredulous heart; but let him consider
what the Word of the Lord hath said of the person in
whom these three, grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> do concur, to wit, 1. the
sense of sin and inability to help our selves; 2. flying
unto Christ for relief from sin and misery; and, 3.
some measure of upright purpose and endeavour to serve
God in new obedience; for of such saith the Apostle,
<hi>Phil. 3. 3 We are the Circumcision or true Israelits, who
have no confidence in the flesh, but rejoyce in Iesus Christ,
and worship God in the spirit.</hi> Let him therefore esteem the
discovery of his sinfull and wretched estate in himself to
be the very fruit of the eye-salve and work of the Spirit
bestowed on him by Christ, and let him esteem his
hearty consent given to the covenant of grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
to be the undoubted act of saving faith.
For, hearty consent to the offer of grace in Jesus Christ,
presuppones, first, that the person sees no standing for
him by the law or covenant of works, but is beaten from
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40880:141"/>
all confidence in himself, and made to believe and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the righteous sentence of the law against himself
to the praise of Gods truth and justice. Secondly, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
the mans believing the testimony which God hath
given of Christ Jesus, to wit, that God hath made a
gift of life eternall to the soul that hungereth and thrist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for righteousnesse, and that this life is in his Son; yea
it imports the mans receiving and embracing of Christ
offered in the Gospel. Thirdly, it importeth, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter
to the covenant of grace as he hath renounced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in his own works, So he hath given up himself
to God, to live by the grace of Jesus Christ unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life. Now if the afflicted shall reflect upon these
two operations of the holy Ghost, making him humble
in the sense of sin, heartily to receive Christ Jesus for
his relief, and withall do observe an unfained purpose
and begun endeavour to live more holily and fruitfully
by the grace and furniture of Christ, howsoever he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
under many infirmities, not only is he undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
a new creature, but also by observing the foresaid
evidence thereof, may conclude, that God hath begun
a good work of grace in him, and so shall this first cause
of disquietnesse be removed.</p>
               <p>5. Another cause of disquietnesse is, or may be
this, if the afflicted, after examination of the work
of grace in himself, being convinced of his blessed
estate and confirmed by present sense of Gods love shed
abroad in his heart, do not hold fast his estimation of
Gods work in himself longer then the sensible comfort
thereof remaineth with him, but either doth retreat his
judgment of his blessed estate, or doth not defend his
right, doth not resist Sathan by being stedfast in the
faith, no wonder his disquietnesse and dejection of
courage return upon him.</p>
               <p>6. For removing of this cause of disquietnesse, let
the afflicted consider, that spiritual consolation, and
sensible feeling of Gods favour, is granted to
Gods children to make them stedfast in the faith of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40880:142"/>
Gods grace toward them, when sensible comfort is
with-drawn, and when they are put to the tryal and
exercise of their faith, under trouble and temptations.
And therefore, when the affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cted, once being made clear
of his interest in Christ, and of his keeping on him the
yoke of Christ, doth find a change in his condition, let
him presently humble himself before God, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the power of the body of sin in himself,
and of whatsoever evil fruit it hath brought forth,
whereby he hath procured the change of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
condition; and let him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the acts of his
repentance and of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Christ, striving against
all temptations for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> once given to him, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
for his right and interest unto Gods grace in
Christ, that he may with patience obtain the victory
over his temptation, and be able, not only with <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>

to charge his own soul to trust in God, <hi>the help and
health of his countenance,</hi> Ps. 42. and 43. but also to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with the Apostle, and to say, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 22. I know
whom I have believed, and I am perswaded, that he is able
to keep that which I have committed unto him against that
day.</hi> And so may the second cause of disquietnesse
be removed.</p>
               <p>7. A third cause of disquietnesse is, or may be, this,
if a sincere convert, finding himself come short both
of his purpose and hope of making progresse in the
course of new obedience and reformation of heart and
conversation, shall, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> of laying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so open a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> calling his own conversion
in question. In this case, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the true
convert is augmented, by reason of the conscience of
his sincerity in his couversion, wherein he renounced
the love and service of all sin, renounced all confidence
in his own worth or works, did flye unto the grace
offered in Christ, and received him heartily, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40880:142"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onestly to serve God thereafter in newnesse of
life, which maketh him say in himself, I can never put
repentance from dead works, and faith in Christ, and
purpose of new obedience more sincerely in exercise,
then I have done; and now, seing I come short of my
purpose and hope of profiting and can never more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
repent of sin or believe in Christ then I have done,
have I not just cause of doubting of my estate and of
discouragment and disquietnesse.</p>
               <p>8. For removing this cause of disquietnesse, let the
afflicted consider first, that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
purpose and practice. A holy and sincere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t times cometh short in practice; for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, <hi>Rom. 7 18. To will is present with me, but how
to perform that which is good, I find not.</hi> The inlake
here is of strength to perform, and not in the sincerity
of the will and purpose.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let him consider, that there is a difference
between the consent of a well-informed conscience to
the discharge of holy duties, and the practical coming
up of the not well-reformed heart, unto the actual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of those duties; for oft-times the heart is like
a deceitfull bow, that disappointeth the archer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let not the afflicted deny the sincerity of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but let him be humbled for the corruption of his
heart, which hath not answered his purpose and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let not the afflicted think, that he hath so
fully renounced all confidence in his own works as he
conceived: we may be clearly convinced not to lean
to our own righteousnesse, and so more easily in our
judgment renounce all confidence in our good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
but the dregs of the sin of misbelieving Jews
is not easily purged out of us, wherein they went about
to establish their own righteousnesse, and did not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves to the righteousnesse of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.
and, 10. 3. As he therefore, who denyeth, that he
leaneth his weight on his staff and yet falleth to the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40880:143"/>
ground when his staff doth slide, is found to have lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more weight on his staff then he pretended; So he
is found to have leaned too much weight upon his own
works, who is cast down, because his performances are
not answerable to his purpose and hopes. Humbled
indeed he ought to be, and to lament his misery under
the body of death, but not be so dejected and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
as to loose or s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cken his grips of the covenant
of Grace; especially when he doth consider, that the
Lord, by this experience of his own weaknesse, is teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him thereafter to have a more high estimation, and
make better use, of Christs imputed righteousnesse, and
to lean lesse to his own purposes, and promises, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
righteousnesse, that so he may draw more abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
from Christ by faith, to bring forth better fruits:
<hi>for without me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>you can do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. 5.</p>
               <p>Last of all, let him neither say nor think, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
put forth any act of repentance or saith, or purpose
of amendment of life, more sincerely then he hath done;
for, no man hath attained such a measure of sincerity
in the discharge of any act of saving grace, but there
is room for him to receive a greater measure both of
activity and sincerity in acting, then he hath attained
already: but rather let him examine more narrowly,
and find out the corrupt inclination of the heart to
lean to its own inherent righteousnesse, and difficulty
of subjecting it self wholly to the righteousnesse of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith, and sanctification through faith in Christ; for,
this doth the Apostle teach us to do, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14.
he did not think himself already perfect, but reached
himself forth to those things which were before him,
pressing toward the mark for the prize of the high
calling of God in Christ Jesus. And the end of the
pressing of the Law is, that sin may be the more clearly
discovered; that as sin hath reigned unto death, even
so might grace reign through Christ Jesus our Lord,
<hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m.</hi> 5. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:40880:143"/>
9. The fourth cause of disquietnesse is, or may be,
this, if the true conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt, being frequently convinced of
the manifold deceits of the heart, for this cause shall
begin to call in question all the work of grace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
which inconvenience doth flow from his not
putting difference between the true consent of the heart
unto the covenant of Grace and acts of holinesse, in so
far as the heart is renewed on the one hand, and the
doubting or hesitation of the heart, in as far as it is not
purged from the relicts of incredulity and backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
unto godlinesse on the other hand; or, because he
puts no difference between the effects of renewing grace,
and the effects of in-dwelling sin in himself, both of
them putting forth their power in the self same actions:
for, if this difference shall not be observed, and sentence
so given, as that which is in the renewed man be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
and commended, and that which flowes from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
sin be disallowed and condemned, without
prejudice to any good, which shall be found in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
man, it is impossible that the conscience can be
quiet, or that any good action of the Saints can be
approven, by reason of sin in us; for, the evil which we
would not, shall be found in us, as is clear in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
censure of himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. to 20.</p>
               <p>10. For removing this fourth cause of disquietnesse,
let the afflicted learn so to observe the inlakes and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
imperfections and pollutions of his best works, as
he observe also that which is good in his actions, that
of the good he may make thankfull confession unto
God, and pray for the increase thereof; and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lakes
and pollutions of his works, he may make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
also, and be humbled for them, and flye to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
righteousness of Christ, and to the founta in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in his house for sin and uncleannesse, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1.
This wisdom is taught us in the example of the father of
the child possessed with a dumb and deaf spirit, crying
out and saying with tears, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi>
Mark, 9. 24. he maintains the begun work of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40880:144"/>
faith in himself, and confesseth the evil he found in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and flyeth by prayer to Christ to help him.</p>
               <p>11. The fifth cause of disquie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nesse is, or may be
this, if the true convert suspen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the absolution of his
own faith and fruits thereof from being hypocritical
and counterfeit, untill he find himself freed from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse,
and do injoy peace and tranquillity of mind,
which he doth apprehend should alwayes accompany
sound, sincere and unfained faith, and on this ground
he esteemeth <hi>that faith</hi> only to be <hi>true faith,</hi> which hath
overcome all doubtings, and now being victorious,
bringeth peace and quietnesse with it; and <hi>that faith</hi>
which is tossed, or troubled with doubtings, he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
may justly be suspected of unsoundnesse, as if ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to doubting, were a sufficient reason to make a
question of the sincerity of believing: or as if it were a
sufficient reason for a man to call his faith in question,
whether it be true faith or not, because Sathan calleth
it in question: for if this were a sufficient reason to
question a work or act of grace in a man, no work
of grace, nor no point of true religion, should be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
for sound and true, because Sathan never ceaseth
to calum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iat and quarrel the truth, both of Gods Word
and working, for he was so malicious and impudent
as to question Christ, <hi>If thou be the Son of God,</hi> Mat. 4. 3.</p>
               <p>12. For removing of this cause of disquietnesse, let
the afflicted consider, first, that the assaults of the
enemy do neither diminish the worth, nor the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of faith; for, faith fighting, is no lesse solid and
sound in the time of battel, then it is after victory,
standing victorious. 2. Let him consider that we are
called to a warfare, not only against flesh and blood,
but also against principalities and powers and spiritual
wickednesses <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. and that we may not promise to
our selves, freedom or exemption from Sathans throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fiery darts at us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o long as we live, as the Apostle
doth warn us, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. Let him consider thirdly,
that objections and questions, moved against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40880:144"/>
faith, are rather a token of the sincerity thereof,
then a reason for bringing it in question: for, the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
Sathan can discern well enough between an empty
vessel and a ship loadened with precious wares, and
useth to set upon the rich ship, that he may spoil it, if
he can, of that most precious faith, and not trouble
himself to molest a secure presumptuous person, lest he
should waken him, by such means, out of his dream,
and chase him unto God. But as for a man that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
fled from him and turned to God by faith in
Christ, he will not fail to follow the chase, that if he
cannot bring him back, yet he may vex him and dog
him at the heels till his entry in heaven. Fourthly, let
him consider, that the Lord useth to suffer Sathan to
trouble the believer with suggestions to waken his faith,
of set purpose to teach the believer to fight his battels,
and by frequent exercises to be purified more and more,
like gold or silver put oft-times in the furnace, yea, and
that the wrestler may be made valiant in fight, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
34. whereupon the afflicted must be exhorted not only
to take courage and to despise the malice of the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but also to rejoyce when he doth meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
tentations (as we are charged, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 2.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the fruit following by Gods blessing on such
exercise. And to this end, let him put on the whole
armour of God, that when he hath resisted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one tentation, he may stand and resist another,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>13. The sixth cause of disquietnesse, is, or may be
this, if the true convert do not distinguish, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,
the peace he hath with God, and the peace he
hath in his conscience; if he do not distinguish but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
peace with God and rest from assaults of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; if he do not distinguish, but confound,
peace of mind, and peace of conscience; if he do not
distinguish and put a due difference between these sorts
of peace, he cannot choose but be disquieted, by sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ting
his peace, with God, because he hath not rest
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:40880:145"/>
nor peace from Sathans assaults; he cannot eshew dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse,
when he conceives that his peace with God
is dissolved, when trouble ariseth in his own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And no wonder he be disquieted when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
every perturbation of his mind to be a
breach of peace with God, or with his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>14. For removing of this cause of disquietnesse, the
afflicted must consider, first, that peace with God, doth
follow immediatly upon an humbled sinners flying
to Christ, and embracing the offer of reconciliation with
God in Christ, when, in the mean time, the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
possibly may be going on pursuing the convert
with challenges for all sort of sin and guiltinesse; for he
that is fled to Christ by faith, is justified, and being
justified by faith, he hath peace with God, granted,
decreed, pronounced in his favours, and registrat in
the Court-book of the Evangel, albeit possibly the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
convert, hath not drawn forth the extract of the
decreet, nor considered it, when he hath read it, nor
applied the same to himself according as the general
sentence giveth him warrand.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the humbled sinner, fled unto Christ,
and engaged heartily to his service, must not take heed
so much to what his sickly, and not clearly informed
conscience doth say, as to what God, who is greater
then the conscience, and giveth order and rule to the
conscience, doth say to such a poor soul fled unto
Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let him consider, that his peace is not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arred with God, by Sathans warring against him;
for, peace with God, standeth well with warr against
all spiritual enemies: and therefore the lesse rest he hath
from Sathans trouble and molestation, let him be the
more confident of his peace with God, whose battels
he is fighting against Sathan.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let him consider, that perturbation of
mind, doth neither hinder peace with God, nor peace
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40880:145"/>
of conscience: for the mind and thoughts of a man, for
many reasons may be troubled and disquieted, when
peace with God and peace of conscience are setled and
established: for, when the mind is troubled, and
tempted to anxiety, the Apostle sheweth how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the perturbation of the mind, and setle the peace
of conscience also, <hi>Phil. 4. 6, 7. Be carefull,</hi> saith he, or
anxious, <hi>for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanks giving, let your requests be made
manifest to God, and the peace of God which passes all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
Iesus.</hi> And in his own experience he lets us see the
difference of perturbation of mind, from peace with
God and the conscience also, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 5, 6. When we
were come into</hi> Macedonia, <hi>our flesh had no rest, but we
were troubled on every side, without were fightings, within
were fears; neverthelesse, God that comforteth these that
are cast down, comforted us in the coming of</hi> Titus: So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>15. The seventh cause of disquietnesse, is, or may
be this, if the true convert be either ignorant or forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of the way of obtaining, maintaining, repairing
and recovering the true peace of God in himself, and
of the change of Gods dispensation toward his children
which is common; through many tribulations God
doth bring his own to heaven. Sometime he shews
them his countenance in a comfortable providence,
sometime he hides his face, but doth not change his love
toward them, <hi>Psal. 30. 7. Thou hidest thy face,</hi> saith
<hi>David, and I was troubled,</hi> but here was his wisdom, he
went the straight way to recover his peace, <hi>I cryed to
thee, O Lord, and unto the Lord made I my supplication,</hi>
and his mourning was turned into dauncing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.
7, 8. to the end. But many weak converts are not so
wise, who by their inconfiderat courses do cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in fears, jealousies and suspicions, both of Gods
love to them and of their own interest in him: when
they misse felt consolations they fall to quarrel their
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40880:146"/>
right. And if they resolve to have their condition
helped, they prescribe their own time, way and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and nothing can satisfie them till they recover
possession of lost sense, with the Spouse, <hi>Cant. 2. 5. Stay
me with stagons, comfort me with aples</hi> (saith she) <hi>for I am
sick of love.</hi> It is true, sometime God doth coudescend to
their passionat put suit of comfort, but their not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in the mean time, and their hasting to have their
condition altered, before patience hath wrought the
perfect work, is not to be commended or approven.</p>
               <p>16. For removing this cause of disquietnesse, let the
afflicted consider, first, that the Lord neither sheweth
his loving countenance to the weak disciple, nor hideth
it from him, but out of love; he neither corrrecteth
nor comforte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h him, but out of love; <hi>I am the Lord
and change not</hi> saith he <hi>sensible 3. 6. Therefore you sons of</hi>
Jacob <hi>are not consu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi> If he give consolation sensibly,
it is to confirm their weak saith, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> experience
of the fruit of believing in him, and if he withdraw his
consolation, it is that he may excercise their faith, and
train them to bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ve his Word without a sensible

               <p>17. The eight cause of disquietnesse, is, or may be
this, if the true convert, daily lamenting his own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
and daily troubled with suspicion of his own

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>forters like <hi>Iob's</hi> friends, who in stead of healing
his wounds in his affliction, shall foster his suspicion of

complaint of himself; in this case, if the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Iob</hi> did, and his upright endeavour to please God, which
is manifest by his daily godly grief for his short coming

               <p>18. For removing of this cause, let the afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and distinguish what is right in him, and what is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40880:147"/>
wrong, and beware to confound these. For example, 1.
This is right, that he doth not lean to the worth of his
own works, nor is pussed up with a vain conceit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
before God. 2. That he is sensible of his sinfull imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and corruptions, and of the bitter root of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin in him. 3. It is right in him also, that he aimeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
perfection, forgetting what is behind, and pressing
toward the mark and prize of his calling. But this is
wrong in him, 1. that he fostereth suspicions unjustly
of his own blessed estate. 2. That he doth not observe
the work of Gods grace in himself so carefully as he
observeth his imperfections and corruptions. 3. That
he doth not so much the more make use of Christs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
righteousnesse, as he findeth the imperfection of
his own inherent righteousnesse. 4. That he measur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Gods estimation of him, according to the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he hath of himself, when indeed God in Scripture
doth shew no lesse approbation of him in his wrestle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then he doth in the time of his victory and quiet
condition. 5. That he doth not observe the difference
of the way he doth walk into which is good, from the
flidings, imperfections, errors and mistakes in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
actions and passages in that way. 6. That he doth
lay more weight oft-times upon the judgment of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking
spectators of his course, then he hath reason to
do, and doth not take heed to the sentence of the Lord in
the Gospel, concerning the poor in spirit, the contrite,
the meek and lowly disciple. These things let the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
consider and make good use thereof, for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment
in the way of new obedience.</p>
               <p>19. The ninth cause of disquietnesse is, or may be,
this, if the true convert be not acquainted with living
by faith; for there are many honest and tender-hearted
converts, who, in the sense of their sins, are fled unto
Christ, resolved never to depart from him, and carefull
to lead a blamelesse life, who notwithstanding, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they meet with changes of dispensation, with
variety of temptations, fresh feeling of the power of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40880:148"/>
sin in themselves, or any crosse bodily or spiritual, are
disquieted and cast in suspicion of their state: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they neither will give over to follow after Christ,
nor will God suffer them to perish, yet they make
themselves an uncomfortable and miserable life, by their
leaning to present sense and feeling, when they should
remember the saying of the Apostle (2 <hi>Cor. 5. 7. we
walk not by sight but by faith</hi>) they are cast down, do
mourn and complain, because it is not with them as
they would, and are most part male-content with their
lot, frequently regrating unto God their wants and
imperfections, and seldom are they praising or thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God for what they have gotten of him.</p>
               <p>20. <hi>For removing this cause, let the afflicted, first,
consider what the Apostle speaketh to the afflicted He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
Heb. 10. 36. ye have need of patience, that when
ye have done the will of God ye may receive the promise; for
yet a little while, and he that will come, shall come, and
will not tarry. Now, the just man shall live by faith, <hi>saith he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, let him consider, that to live by faith,
doth require these six duties, 1. That we renounce our
own corrupt reason and sense, lest we count that to be
our life which may be seen or felt, or that which may
be altered and changed, but reckon that to be our life,
which is hid with God in Christ, and shall be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at the glorious coming of our Lord. 2. That the
covenant of grace, and rich promises of the Gospel be
esteemed of us as our meet and drink, whereby our
hearts may be sustained in all adversity, and our hope
upholden in patience through the comfort of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
3. That we make use of all Gods benefits bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon us by vertue of that new right made unto us in
Christ for being partakers thereof. 4. That in all our
actions we implore and seek our strength from Christ,
and give him thanks for the measure whatsoever he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth.
So did the Apostle live, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. The life
which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son
of God.</hi> 5. That we rejoyce and glory more in Christ
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40880:148"/>
Jesus in the midst of trouble, then we grieve for our
troubles whatsoever, whereby as with a sharp pinsell,
he is drawing in us the lineaments of his own Image
and conformity with himself; So did the Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi>
5. 3, 4, 5. Last of all, to live by faith, requireth that in
every condition we should keep faith and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in Christ Jesus, and esteem our selves blessed of
the Lord, albeit we be tossed with troubles immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent from God to exercise us, albeit we do fall in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
tentations, be assaulted with doubtings, and
persecuted unjustly by men: for, it should and may
suffice a believer in Christ, if he be not distressed, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
he be troubled on every side; he must not dispair al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he be perplexed; he shall not be forsaken, albeit he
be persecuted; he shall not be destroyed, albeit he be
cast down, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 9. Upon these and the like
grounds, the Apostle lived a comfortable life, <hi>Phil. 4.
12. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound,
every where and in all things I am instructed, both to be full,
and to be hungry, both to abound and suffer need; I can do
all things through Christ who strengthens me.</hi> Thus must
Christian souldiers live in the midst of their toyling, in
warfare, in want of many things, in watching and
running hazard of life, in hope of victory and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
glory, holding up their hearts by faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>And these things which we have spoken in explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this case, are not intended to hinder the tender
hearted believer from praying, and endeavouring by all
means, that the face of the Lord may shine upon him,
and that he may be filled with the joy of his Spirit; for
we are charged to seek his face and strength continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 105. 4. But all our speech doth drive at this
mainly, that the afflicted in his discouragment and
unquietnesse, meekly submit himself to the will of God,
howsoever he be exercised, alwayes going on in the
way of God according to his vocation, through ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and dishonour, through good report and evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
looking unto the promises which are made to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40880:149"/>
him that endureth to the end. And what is spoken
here of living by faith, must not be abused to softer
negligence in well doing or bringing forth fruits of
faith in every condition, or to hinder the daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of repentance, or to require of a Christian a stoical
stupidity under trouble; but the thing we aim at, is,
that the Christian in all crosse dispensations and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
endeavour by faith to be of good courage in the
Lord, and endeavour to draw vertue from Christ to
bring forth fruits, giving glory to him, whatsoever
measure he shall bestow more or lesse, because it is
Christ who is made unto us wisdom and righteousnesse,
sanctification and redemption, and in him alone shall
the soul of the afflicted have rest, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 24.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">Wherein the converts doubt, arising from his uncertainty as
what time he was converted, is solved.</head>
               <p>THere are some true converts, who after they have
past a good part of their journey to heaven, begin
to halt and make slow progresse, by doubting whether
they be walking in the true converts foot-steps, or
whether they be converted at all, or not. The reason
of their doubting, ariseth from this, that in conference
with sundry of the Saints of their acquaintance, they
have observed, that every one of them could design the
time of their conversion, and from that time can reckon
their age in Christ: Or, from this is their doubt arisen,
that in the Treatise of some modern Writer, they have
read, or from the Sermon of some well esteemed
Preacher they have heard some such doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the true convert falleth out with himself in saying,
I was bred and brought up in a godly family, I have
followed the exercises of religion; after hearing the
heads and summe of christian Religion, I have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the truth; I seemed to my self to believe in
Christ, and entertain the exercise of repentance, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40880:149"/>
to endeavour the amendment of my life; I love these
whom I see to live holily, and I do hate the wayes of
the profane, but because I cannot tell when or what
day or year I was really converted, as I know sundry
of the godly of my acquaintance can do; therefore I
doubt whether my conversion be begun or not, but
mean time, though I will not turn off the way I have
been following, yet I go on halting and heartlesse till
I be cleared of my doubt.</p>
               <p>2. For removing this doubt, we must yield this far
to the afflicted, that many indeed deceive themselves,
who being civilly educated, and from their bairn-age
accustomed with the exercises of religion; are nothing
beyond the foolish virgins, and do rest satisfied with
their own and others opinion of themselves. If such
persons be questioned, when they began to repent, or
believe in Christ; it is true, they cannot design the time
when they were unconverted, but have still been pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and are pleased, with their own estate, and in effect
were never converted. But it is no lesse true on the
other hand, that there are some who indeed are renewed,
in whom, peece and peece, without any notable change,
faith and repentance, and a holy conversation, have
grown with the growing knowledge of the Gospel,
and will of God therein; of whom it may be truly
said, the kingdom of heaven cometh not with obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
of whom it is said, <hi>Mark. 4. 26. So is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground,
and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should
spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to solve the doubt, it maters not whether a man
know or not know the day of his conversion, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he be indeed regenerat and made a new creature.
Wherefore the afflicted may be of good courage, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
serious examination of his own conscience, he be
humbled frequently in the sense, not only of his actual
sins and short-coming of his duty, but also in the sense
of his original and in-dwelling corruption or body of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40880:150"/>
death; if, as he doth indeed loath himself, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all confidence in his best works, so he seriously
imbrace the imputed righteousnesse of Christ, and in
his strength, by faith in him, doth endeavour to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily,
righteously and soberly, (albeit joyned with many
imperfections) he may conclude, he is regenerat: for,
if these three be joyned in him in any measure of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
he needeth not be anxious what day, moneth or
year the holy Spirit began to work these things in him.
Only let him give all diligence to grow in humility,
faith and new obedience, and to hold on this way, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
doubts or impediments he shall meet with; for,
the Apostle exeemeth such a man from the number of
hypocrits and unconverted, <hi>Phil. 3. 3. We,</hi> saith he,
<hi>are the circumcision,</hi> or the Christian converts, <hi>who
worship God in the spirit, and rejoyce in Christ Iesus, and
have no confidence in the flesh.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Wherein is solved the converts doubt of his regeneration,
arising from his apprehension, that the beginning of the
change of his life, was not from the sincere love of God,
but either from terror or self-love, which he conceiveth to
be but carnal.</head>
               <p>SOme true converts are, who can design the time of the
change of their way from sin to Christ, and to a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, whereof they have not only the Church they
live in, but also their own conscience witnesses; yet
after a considerable time, do fall in suspicion, whether
that time of their change was the time of their effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
calling; some of them bringing no other reason
of their doubting, save this, that they were never much
troubled with the terrors of the Law, but most part
allured to draw near to God, and to eshew the way of
sinning by the love of eternal life. Other some, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the soundnesse of their conversion, because the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>error of God and fear of condemnation and hell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40880:150"/>
more with them, for changing their course, then
the love of God and true holinesse did; and both the
one sort and the other do conceive the chief rise of their
change to have been natural or carnal, self-love, fearing
harm, and loving life.</p>
               <p>2. For removing of this doubt, we grant, that there
are many, who after some notable delivery from death,
or some notable benefit received, or after some sharp rod
of chastisement for their sin, have changed their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
way of living, left off grosse vices, and led a more
civil and blamelesse outward life, and yet have neither
seriously repented them of sin, nor seriously fled in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the grace of Jesus Christ offered in the Gospel, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowing what saving faith is, nor carefull to know
it; but of such we do not speak here, for we are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the true convert and renewed man, who in the
sense of sin is fled to Christ, in the sense of his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
maketh the grace offered his refuge, and in the
sense of indigence, looketh up to Christ and seeketh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of him in all things, and by the holy Spirit is striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against sin, endeavouring in some measure of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
to bring forth the fruits of faith and repentance;
and yet for all this, he doubteth of the sincerity of his
own conversion, for the reasons foresaid. To this soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
and wrestler we say (as before we said to him that
doubteth of his conversion, because he cannot design
the time of his conversion) it is not material by what
way, or means or motives, a man is brought unto Christ,
provided he doth come and indeed adhere to Christ;
it is all one whether the rise of the mans turning from
sin to God, was love alluring, or terror driving him,
whether a benefit or a sharp rod, whether fear or hope
did at the first beginning of his change, move him to
seek God; provided, God manifested in the flesh Christ
Jesus the Redeemer of sinners, be now his beloved
Lord, and precious in his eyes: for, he that is most
sweetly allured to come to God, and without much fear
is converted, who possibly after serious conviction of sin
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40880:151"/>
and deserved death, is not keeped long at the door of
mercy, but forthwith is admitted to the throne of grace,
and tenderly entertained by the Spirit of consolation,
may fall in hard exercises afterward. This is evident
in the experience of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> in whom his
brethren, living in the same family with him, did not
perceive any signes of a sorrowfull or heavy heart, as
his brother <hi>Eliab</hi>'s words do shew, 1 <hi>Sam. 17. 28. I know
thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart.</hi> Thus did
<hi>Eliab</hi> judge of <hi>David</hi>'s chearfull carriage, whereof also
we have some evidence, that <hi>David</hi> was of a ruddy and
beautiful countenance, and for some years of his youth,
did passe the time pleasantly, serving God with his
songs and harp while he was feeding his sheep in the
wildernesse: now none can justly question his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
all this time, or his sincerity in this service, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
he was otherwayes exercised: for oft-times
he felt the power of the Law upon his spirit, and was
tossed with the terror thereof, and made to mourn and
weep heavily. Such doth <hi>Iob</hi>'s condition seem to be
in his youth, as it is described, <hi>Iob</hi> 29. but afterward
in the tryal of his faith, what a conflict with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had, the sacred History doth testifie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there is no reason why any, in whom these eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a true Israelit are found in any measure, should
suspect the sincerity of his regeneration, because he hath
been gently handled in his conversion: for it may
come to passe, that the same person may fall in firy tryals
and so hard temptations, as he may fall in doubt of his
conversion, in regard of the sad afflictions inward and
outward whereby he is exercised. In which case he
will be found to be mistaken no lesse then he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in the former case and condition; for, some dear
children of God may possibly, both in their conversion
and most part of their life, be exercised with the terrors
of the Law, and yet retain fast hold by faith on Christs
grace in their deepest afflictions: For instance, we offer
that precious soul <hi>Heman</hi> the Ezrait, who came near
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:40880:151"/>
unto <hi>Solomon</hi> in the point of wisdom, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4, 31.
and yet how bitter his afflictions of spirit were, the
88. <hi>Psalm</hi> beareth witnesse, specially. <hi>v. 13. 14, 15. But
unto thee have I cryed, O Lord, and in the morning shall my
prayer prevent thee. And why castest thou off my soul?
why hidest thou thy face from me? I am afflicted and ready
to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors, I am
distracted,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore, there is no just cause,
that any, in whom the evidences of faith and repentance
may be found, should call the sincerity of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
in question, how hardly soever he seem to be
handled of God: for whosoever is joyned to the Lord
Jesus, and will neither suffer himself to be driven from
him, nor yet will endure sin to remain in himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled,
is certainly a true convert. As for these,
who for some temporal cause, are come to Christ (as
many did come in the dayes of his flesh) that they
might be delivered from some temporal evil, or obtain
some temporal benefit, and for that cause do doubt of
their conversion or sincerity thereof; they need not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
much about the occasions of their first seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God, provided that they have learned what Christs
grace is, and do seek righteousnesse and salvation in him;
for, we read in the Evangel, that sundry, that they
might be cured of leprosie, palsie, blindnesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came
unto Christ, who afterward came and adhered to him
by faith, as the only Redeemer and Saviour of their
souls from sin and misery. Wherefore, in such doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
let not the afflicted trouble himself, nor call his
conversion in question; but let him give all diligence
to strengthen his faith, and to increase in holinesse,
making his calling and election sure by well-doing:
for, if he do this, he shall neither be found idle, <hi>nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus,</hi> as the Apostle
promiseth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>

                  </gap>
of their regeneration, of their effectual calling, and
of the love of God unto them, and that because they meet
with sore outward afflictions, and are assaulted also
possibly with horrible inward tentations which do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
them unexpectedly, and are ready to swallow them
up; for whereas, after divers conflicts in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and peace of conscience following after these sad
exercises of mind, they hoped to have injoyed Gods
peace still after, they do meet possibly with sad cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
which they did not foresee nor fear, and being
yoked in conflict with more fearfull tentations then ever
before, which they find themselves unable to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
they seem to themselves, to have just cause to
call in question all the former work of grace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to doubt of their regeneration, and of their
reconciliation with God. Of this sort, some who lived
in great wealth and outward prosperity, do fall in so
deep poverty, that they are neither able to sustain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
nor their families, but are forced to live on the
private charity of others, or openly to beg. Other
some do fall in heavy sicknesses, yea, in uncouth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
which but rarely do befall any, which seem to
be evidences of the wrath of God. Other some do fall
in horrible tentations, and are troubled with blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
suggestions against God and the holy Scripture,
and the way of the Saints, which as fiery darts do stick
fast unto them, and disquiet them continually. Other
some are tempted unto hainous sins and to such wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse
against themselves or others, as nature doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor,
to which acts of wickednesse they find themselves
so powerfully solisted, as they fear God hath decreed
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40880:152"/>
to give them over, and that they shall be overcome
with the tentations; some after one way, some after
another way, by one sort or other of vexation, are
tossed, so as they suspect God is pursuing them in wrath
and dealing with them otherwayes then with any of his
children. Whereupon oft-times they break forth in
sad complaints, and misbelieving suspicions, saying,
if God loved me he would not deal thus and thus with
me; if I were a true convert, and reconciled with God,
he would not thus pursue me; my case is not the case
of the children of God, for any thing I know, and
other such like regrates and lamentations are uttered by
them.</p>
               <p>2. For solving this doubt, we neither esteem such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
and tentations proper to the regenerat man, or
a token of regeneration; neither do we deny, that such
exercises may befall true converts: for, all sorts of
afflictions and calamities are common to the good and
evil, to the godly and the wicked, so that by those
troubles and miseries neither the love or hatred of God
can be certainly concluded; but thus much may be
said in reason, if these calamities do befall a man, while
he is walking in his own sinfull wayes, then are they
undoubtedly to be interpret as evidences of Gods
wrath, at least fatherly anger, against the afflicted,
and to be esteemed as forewarnings of more and more
heavy calamities to come upon him, yea, and finall
perdition also, if he do not repent.</p>
               <p>3. In which case the afflicted shall do well to humble
himself before God, and give a good construction of
Gods purpose in sending on him such calamities, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
when he might forthwith have destroyed the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he hath sent forth these sad afflictions to waken his
conscience, and to warn him to flye from the wrath to
come, least he perish utterly.</p>
               <p>4. He shall do well also to consider with himself, and
to acknowledge, that such a bitter potion was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in so deadly and desperat-like disease, as his soul
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40880:153"/>
was lying into: for, what should the Lord do unto
those who despise the worth of their own souls and of
eternal life, and do seek their felicity in vain and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
pleasure, profit and honour? what shall he
do with those whom he will not suffer to perish with
this evil world, but break their Idols in pieces and put
themselves to grief, who vex his holy Spirit?</p>
               <p>Wherefore let the afflicted read his sin in the rod
wherewith he is beaten; if he be deprived of temporal
goods, or earthly comforts, which he hath abused to
the hazard of his own soul, let God have the glory of
his justice and mercy also, in that he by cutting off
earthly things from him, is sending him to seek things
spiritual and everlasting in heaven, where Christ is at
the right hand of the Father, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>If he be vexed with tentations unto blasphemies, and
such horrid fearfull sins which even nature doth abhor,
let him consider, that misbelief of threatenings and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are no lesse in effect, than real asserting of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
and that entertaining of sinfull lusts which
fight against his soul, is in effect a defiling and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his own soul; by which afflictions and tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if the afflicted take not warning and repent, he
may justly fear these calamities and tormenting tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are but the beginnings of sorrows.</p>
               <p>But if these calamities and fearfull tentations befall a
man walking in the wayes of God, who is a believer
in Christ, who hath casten his anchor within the vail,
and studieth in any measure of uprightnesse to please
God, let not such a man be afraid; for, God is not
pursuing him in wrath, as Sathan his adversary sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesteth,
but as a most wise and loving father is trying,
and training his faith, and bringing forth the evidence
of grace bestowed upon him, to the praise of his own
name, shaming of Sathan and edifying all beholders of
this man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of concurring calamities, and also deprived of all
consolation from God and man for a season; for at
once he was spoiled of all his goods, deprived of all his
children, tempted by his wife to dispair, despised by
his servants, judged to be a hypocrit by his most intire
godly friends, stricken by Sathan with an unusuall
plague of botch-biles; and how far the Lord did hide
all comfort for a time, the history of his complaints
make evident. Yea, our blessed Lord Jesus Christ,
hath sanctified in his own person, the hardest exercises
of this sort which his children can fall into; for albeit
he could not be defiled with sin, yet he was tempted of
Sathan unto most abominable sins, in special he was
tempted to cast himself down from the pinacle of the
Temple, which was to kill himself; he was tempted to
fall down and worship the devil, which O how hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
blasphemy is it? yea, for a time power was given
to Sathan, albeit not to hurt Christ, yet to carry his
body from one place to another, as we read in <hi>Matth.
4.</hi> and therefore let this be for consolation to such of
Gods children as are vexed with vile and blasphemous
tentations, and solistations to abominable sins, <hi>Heb.
2. 18. for in that our Lord himself hath suffered, being
tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. But if the afflicted insist and say he is so put to it
by Sathans tentations to commit sin against his light,
and is ready to succumb, because he neither hath
strength in himself to resist and stand out, nor is their
appearance or hope of Gods assisting him in his conflict,
because God seemeth to have not only deserted him, but
also to have given him over in the hands of an unclean
spirit to be vexed.</p>
               <p>Unto this tentation we answer, first, that the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Gods children have been exercised after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
for even to the Apostle <hi>Paul (2 Cor.</hi> 12. 7.) there
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40880:154"/>
was given to him <hi>a thorne in the flesh, the messenger of
Sathan to buffet him,</hi> to keep him from pride: which
tentation was so strong and violent, that he could not
resist it by any strength in himself, but was forced to
flye unto God by prayer and beg strength from Christ
to bear him out against the tentation and to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the power of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let the afflicted under this exercise put a
difference between the sin of Sathan the tempter of him,
and his own sin under the tentation; for, the fiery
darts of Sathan, and suggested blasphemies are Sathans
sins, and not properly the sins of the afflicted to whom
these wicked tentations are not pleasant, but are his
greatest affliction. It is true indeed, that tentations
unto sin in some measure draw on some degree of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
oft-times in sinfull men, because it is not with
us as it was with Christ; for when the prince of this
world came to tempt him, he had no stuff of his own
in Christ to work upon; but when he cometh to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
he findeth our corrupt nature and inclination to
yield to his tentations, as his own materials to work
upon, ready to be kindled by his fiery darts; and yet
must we still distinguish the sin of Sathan suggesting
and tempting, from the suffering of the poor afflicted
child of God, who is vexed, with the tentation: for if
the afflicted shall own the tentation as his own sin, and
confound Sathans part, and his own part in that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
he is in danger to be swallo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed up in the sense of
the sin which is not his own but Sathans.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the afflicted must put difference between sin
and troublsome exercise: for God is the author of
trouble, whereby he is about to try, exercise and train
the faith of his child, to reach him patience, and hope
under his trouble; but Sathan is the author of the sin,
whereunto he doth tempt the afflicted, and shall be
punished for it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let the afflicted wisely observe Sathans
drift, and wiles to drive him unto sin one way or other
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40880:154"/>
by these his horrid and bitter tentations; for though
he prevail not with his grosser tentations, to cause the
afflicted commit or consent unto that wickednesse
which he suggesteth by his fiery darts, yet he in some
measure prevaileth oft-times by new tentations follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the back of the other; for when he hath trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the soul of the afflicted child of God with these ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
tentations, then he beareth in upon the mind of
the afflicted, that he hath acted or consented to these
vile blasphemies, and solliciteth him to impatience,
under this trouble, and to doubt of Gods love to him,
and of his being in the state of grace, and to suspect he
is not one of the elect, and to fear that God will not
deliver him from these evils whereunto he is tempted.
Now, these latter tentations oft-times prevail so far
with the afflicted, as he hearkens unto them, yields
unto them in some measure and suspects Sathans false
alledgance to be too true. And so these acts of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
impatience and discouragment, become indeed
the sins of the afflicted, because they are not so resisted,
disclaimed, abhorred and sorrowed for, as the first
sort of tentations were, which do most vex the afflicted.
These wiles of Sathan the afflicted must beware of, least
he continue in, or foster these ordinary sins, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
that Sathan might cast and catch him, he did lay
his net in these extraordinary tentations.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, let the afflicted after he hath perceived Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
wiles and malice, and his own foolishnesse and
weaknesse, look upon the Lords wise purpose, who
by suffering his child so to be exercised, is calling him
to a deeper acknowledgment of his original sin, that
he may be humbled yet more before God, and loath
himself yet more, and have Christs righteousnesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the believer in higher estimation. Upon
which consideration, let him so presse the removing of
the troublesome tentation, as in the mean time he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himself unto God, and patiently endure the trouble,
and put repentance and faith, hope and love to God
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40880:155"/>
in exercise, following his external vocation as he is
able, least Sathan take advantage of him if he be idle;
and withal let him have such a care of his bodily health
as he may be fitted the better for Gods service in his
calling: for we are not our own, but Christs, who
hath bought us with a price, and are bound to glorifie
God both in our bodies and spirits, which are the
Lords, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. and therefore, whether we
eat or drink, or whatsoever else we are about, which
is lawfull, we ought to do it in his name, aud so to
glorifie him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 30.</p>

               <head type="sub">Wherein is solved, the converts doubt of his conversion, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from the power of his corruption manifesting it self
more after his entry upon the course of new obedience, then
it did before he began to repent.</head>
               <p>SOme converts being yet but young souldiers in the
Christian warfare, when they find the corruption
of their nature breaking forth more powerfully then it
did before they did ingage their heart to serve the
Lord, do readily fall in deep discouragment and sad
suspicion, that the renewing grace of God was never
bestowed upon them, whatsoever were their purposes,
promises, and beginnings to mortifie their lusts and
affections. And we must confesse, that this is no small
tentation: for, they who have renounced the service
of their lusts, and have consecrat their life to Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
when they find their lusts prevail, and like to
reign in them, no wonder they suspect their state in
grace; for (2 <hi>Pet. chap. 2. ver.</hi> 20.) it is told to us, <hi>If
men after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, through
the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, they
are again intangled therein, and overcome, the latter endis
worse with them then the beginning:</hi> for, it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for them, not to have known the way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40880:155"/>
then after they have known it, to turn from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commandment delivered unto them. But it is happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them, according to the true proverbe, <hi>the dog is
turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed
to her wallowing in the mire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This condition indeed is perilous, when after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of repentance, sin doth recover its strength again,
and prevail over the whole man, and shew forth its
victory over him in the grosse pollution of the external
man: But most of all is it perilous, when the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and inslaved sinner, lyeth still in his sin, sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and secure, and doth please himself in his polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for, whatsoever he may be, the holy Ghost points
him forth among the unregenerat as a dog or sow. If
such a man after a time shall repent and bewail his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and set himself to the seeking of God in Christ,
and to draw grace out of Christ to mortifie his lusts we
shall not pronounce or determine of his former estate,
whether he was before that time regenerat or not,
but for the present case of his repenting, he is on the way
to evidence his regeneration more clearly then before:
only let him take heed to humble himself in earnest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and to repent more seriously, that so he may
confirm himself, and go on in the course of faith and
obedience of the Evangel, strengthening his brethren
as <hi>Peter</hi> was commanded to do by our Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 22.</p>
               <p>3. But if corruption of nature do not break forth to
defile the whole man, but inwardly stirreth and strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to bring its old servant into bondage again; unto
which tentations albeit the afflicted do not succumbe,
yet he is shaken and staggers in his faith, doubting of
his state, and of the sincerity of his conversion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he findeth the power of sin in him more vigorous,
then he had found it before the change of his old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
We do not deny, but this case is readily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
unto such as are lately converted, from formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in religion, and fair civil carriage before men, to
true repentance and inward holinesse beseeming Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40880:156"/>
This case because it may have sundry causes, doth
require also sundry cures.</p>
               <p>4. First, this case may befall a young convert, who
because he hath not as yet gotten the experience of his
own weaknesse, is somewhat puffed up in the conceit
of his own strength, and is more confident then he hath
reason, that the sincerity of his purpose, shall bear
down and overcome all his spiritual enemies, so oft as
they shall oppose his holy resolution. In this case, what
wonder is it, that the Lord by a new proof of the mans
weaknesse, let him see, that it is not in him that willeth
or in him that runneth, but in God that hath mercy?
to the intent his pride may be broken down, and that
he being humbled in himself, may learn not to trust any
more to himself, but to God, to Christ who by his
Spirit maketh his children to mortifie sin in themselves,
as the Apostle teacheth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. saying, <hi>if ye
mortifie the deeds of the flesh by the Spirit, ye shall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the afflicted in this case, must beware
to fret, or murmure, or entertain suspicions of Gods
grace in himself, but rather let him, after experience
of his own weaknesse, humble himself and renew
the exercise of repentance, and resolve in the use of the
means to lean to the strength of Christ who doth help
his souldiers in their conflict against sin and Sathan,
either by giving them the victory quickly, or else
sustaining them in the conflict by his grace, as he did
the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. to whom Christ did not
grant the victory, till he, despairing of his own ability
to stand out against the messenger of Sathan, did
humbly beg deliverance from the tentation, and then
he gave him assurance, that the assistance of his grace
should prove sufficient to sustain him in the conflict, and
to deliver him in due time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this case may fall out by the meer malice
of Sathan, who doth set himself to vex the young and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ender convert, lately taken out of his dominion, to the
intent he may make him repent his coming out of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40880:156"/>
                  <hi>Egypt,</hi> if it be possible, and by leading out against him
a new army of temptations, may move him to despair
of the victory, and so bring him back to the flesh
pots, and taking on again the yoke of bondage if he
can.</p>
               <p>2. And here consideration must be had, of Gods
wise and holy permission, who suffereth Sathan to put
a young convert to so hard tryals, that in the weaknesse
of his own child, he may make evident his great power,
in upholding his young souldier against the forest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
of Sathan; and his wisdom, in breaking by this
mean the strength of in-born corruption, raging against
the work of grace in his child.</p>
               <p>In this case, let the afflicted remember he is called to
give a proof of his faith and sincerity, that he may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
himself manfully, and not be afraid of the power
of temptations but bear out stoutly, resisting Sathan,
being confident of the victory and of tramping Sathan
under his feet shortly; yea, pre-suppose with inward
temptations, external persecution be joyned, let the
Lords souldier follow the example of the godly He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
whom the Apostle doth exhort to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
after spoliation of their goods, to meet with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
affliction, under hope to overcome, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32. 36.
and, 12. 4.</p>
               <p>3. This case may fall out, not so much from the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power of corruption, as from the growing light of
grace, discovering sin more clearly then before rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:
for he, who before regeneration, was lying
dead in sin, did not feel the weight of sin at all, or was
sensible only of grosse out-breakings, but when the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
light of the Law doth come, opening up the dens and
caves of natures corruption, out of which come forth
legions of sinfull motions, and amongst these, sundry
monsters of unperceived wickednesse, are discovered to
the young convert, what wonder he be afraid, and cast
in many doubts and suspicions? For, if even the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> himself, out of the sense of inherent sin, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40880:157"/>
of the bonds thereof, where-with he did find himself
bound, was compelled with tears to cry out, <hi>Miserable
man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?</hi> Rom. 7. 24. what wonder is it that a novice in
Religion do tremble when he seeth and smelleth the
dunghill and filthy stable of his own unclean heart?</p>
               <p>In this case, all the comforts which the Gospel doth
furnish are to be ministred to the afflicted, hope is to be
fostered in him of victory over all those evils; the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is to be set forth before his eyes under this
exercise, wherein the Lord hath brought to light the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
corruption of nature, of set purpose, that he might
yoke his young souldier in combat with it, and give
him the victory by the holy Ghost, over not only those
evils which do trouble him for the time, but also all
other sins, and so promoveth the mortification and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
of the whole body of corruption in him.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth cause is, or may be this, that the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hath not such estimation of the imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christ as is requisit, but with the slighting of
Christs satisfaction and righteousnesse purchased to the
believer by Christ, goeth about to establish his own
righteousnesse, whereupon the Lord discovereth his
short-coming in sanctification, which in this life is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
and should indeed be followed after carefully,
but not be rested upon. It is indeed natural unto us,
to seek to have perfection in our selves, for our own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and not to follow the way prescribed to us of God,
for perfecting of us unto the glory of God, as may be
seen in the flower of <hi>Israel</hi> after the flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and 10.
Now the order of God is, that we should be first ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by faith in Christ without the works of the law,
that is, God will have us in the first place to confesse
unto him our sins, and renounce all confidence in our
own works before, in, and after our conversion, and to
renounce all confidence in our own worthinesse or our
own strength, and betake us to that righteousnesse, which
by the obedience and satisfaction of Christ is purchased
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40880:157"/>
unto us, and offered in the Gospel to be accounted ours
of meer free grace: In the second place, God will have
us, being cloathed with Christs imputed righteousnesse,
to approach unto the throne of grace, that by faith in
Christ, we may receive the power of the holy Spirit in
a larger and larger measure for encreasing our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
more and more. And in the third place, he will
have us, as we profit and grow in holinesse, to give the
thanks and praise and glory thereof unto God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, who both justifieth us and sanctifieth us by
his own Spirit; and in as far as we come short in the
measure of sanctification which we aim at, he will
have us to be humbled in our selves, and lay faster hold
on Christ who justifieth us, that he, by his Spirit, may
more and more sanctifie us,, and that because Christ is
made of God unto us, not only our righteousnesse,
but also our sanctification, as the Apostle teacheth us,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Now, when any man breaks this order,
and seeketh justification by Christ, but sanctification
by himself, as it were; and when he findeth sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not to grow as he hoped it should, doth not flye
in to the garment of Christs imputed righteousnesse,
which alone is able to hide his nakednesse, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18.
but in stead of humbling himself in the exercise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
is ready to call his justification and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in question, and to cast it away, as it were, what
wonder is it, that God, being justly offended, because
the righteousnesse of Christ is not in due estimation
and precious in that mans eyes, doth not grant unto
him a better measure of sanctification, especially while
he is contending to have his own prescribed measure of
sanctification, with the prejudice of that divine righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
which is by faith in Jesus Christ, and will
not, as a humble penitent, hold grip of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
except he obtain such a measure of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and freedom from wrestling with sin, as he hath
resolved to find in himself before he can stand to
his interest in Christ for justification? What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40880:158"/>
is it, that God suffer sin in the afflicted to put forth
its power more then before, that he may teach his young
convert and souldier, ignorant of his duty and of Gods
order of proceeding with his children, to be more wise,
and to adhere more closely under the sense of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
unto the righteousnesse of Christ, unto which
he did flye and was forced to flye in his conversion?
As also, that he may teach his child, that sanctification
must be drawn out of no other fountain then Christ,
out of whose fulnesse we must receive grace for grace,
and who by faith applyeth to his redeemed ones his
imputed righteousness, and by faith applyeth and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in them sanctification purchased unto them in the
covenant of Redemption?</p>
               <p>5. Wherefore, for remedy of this mistake, first, let
the afflicted, when he perceiveth and feeleth the power
of sin to be more then he conceived he should have
found in himself after his conversion, let him (I say)
forthwith humble himself before God, acknowledge
his natural uncleannesse, and utter inability by his own
strength to resist sin, and being humbled at the heart,
let him blesse God, who of his free grace hath prepared
and freely granted unto him a righteousnesse purchased
by Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. with which being cloathed, he
may stand before the Tribunal of grace absolved. Next,
let him earnestly and daily pray, that he may both hold
fast grips of that righteousnesse of Christ by faith, and
out of the same fountain of Gods glorious grace in
Christ, study to increase in sanctification, and peece and
peece to mortifie and abolish the corruption of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Thirdly, let the afflicted use the ordinances and means
appointed of God for mortifying of sin and repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Image of God in him. And fourthly, let
the afflicted, in the use of appointed means and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by faith look unto Christ, that out of
him he may suck sap, and the furniture of his Spirit, to
bring forth good fruits: for, <hi>without him we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
but if we abide in him, we shall bring forth abundant
fruits,</hi> Joh. 15. 5.</p>

men do deceive themselves and may possibly further
and further deceive themselves (of which self-deceivings
somewhat is spoken in the end of the former book)
what wonder is it, the weak convert stagger, and fear
least he also deceive himself, especially when he seeth
nothing in himself which may not be counterfeit?</p>
               <p>2. For lousing of this doubt, wherein many have
been pusled, we must yield to the afflicted, that there are
many indeed, who do deceive and destroy themselves
with their vain thoughts; which because it doth very
frequently come to passe, it should stir up all men to be
circumspect and wary least they deceive themselves in
the mater of their salvation, and for that intent to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
themselves whether they be in the saith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. least they be beguiled, and so perish. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
tender faith is easily hurt, all their fear must be
turned into a holy carefulnesse, to be found sincere and
serious in the use of the Lords ordinances, least Sathan
beguile them on the right hand or on the left. And for
this end, we offer advice to the afflicted to discern things
that differ, and first to distinguish gifts, common to
hypocrits and true converts, from saving graces or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40880:159"/>
accompanying salvation: for, learning, and skill
to govern great maters, and eloquence and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of deep mysteries, and revelation of things to come,
and the gift of working miracles, and the gift of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospel, may be granted unto the unregenerat
for the use and edification of the Church. The obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of this difference shall teach the afflicted to esteem
well of all the gifts of God, which may serve for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
society, or to edifie the Church, but not to look
upon them as evidences of regeneration, for they are
nothing in comparison of saving graces; for, if he shall
study to humility and repentance toward God and faith
toward Jesus Christ, and love to God and his Saints,
and to a holy life by the grace of Christ, in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
let him esteem more of them, then of all these
common gifts how glorious soever they seem. As also
let him put a difference betwixt the judgment of charity
concerning other mens estate, which contents it self
with probabilities, and the judgment of certainty and
reall verity, concerning his own estate, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the operation of the holy Spirit, bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to our spirits, that we are the children of God,
and revealing unto us what things are freely given
to us of God, to wit, among other gifts, giving unto
us eye-salve to make us know, that we are blind, poor,
naked and miserable, with grace leading us to buy
without money or price from Christ, gold tryed in the
fire, and garments to hide our nakednesse, which is the
righteousnesse of Christ imputed unto us. In the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of charity concerning other mens estate, we see
nothing save what is outward, and cannot pierce into

               <head type="sub">Wherein is solved the doubt of the true convert, whether he
be in the state of grace, because some godly persons look
upon him as an hypocrit.</head>
               <p>SOme true converts, do suspect themselves not to be
true converts, because some of the godly of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
(whose judgment otherwayes is not to be
lightly rejected) not only do suspect them to be hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits,
but by words spoken of them and behaviour
toward them, declare their judgment of them.</p>
               <p>2. This tentation doth not a little afflict the weak in
faith, who of themselves are ready to call in question
their own conversion, and when they perceive their
own suspicion of themselves to be as it were confirmed
by the suspicion and testimony of some Saints (howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
rashly judging other mens hearts) no wonder the
tentation of Sathan, questioning whether they be the
children of God, grow strong against them.</p>
               <p>By this stratageme Sathan useth to assault the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in faith, and to vex them at least, as we may see in
the exercise of <hi>Iob,</hi> whose faith was mightily assaulted
when his godly friends mistook his affliction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
him as a wicked hypocrit. The like we see in
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40880:160"/>
the exercise of the Prophet, <hi>Ps.</hi> 38. 11. when his friends
stood aloof from his plague.</p>
               <p>3. For strengthening the afflicted under this tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
first, let him examine himself so much the more
acuratly, because of the suspicion that the godly have
of him: after which examination, if he find any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of sorrow for sin in himself, and of faith flying to
Christ for relief, and of endeavour to live holily, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and soberly, albeit joyned with much infirmity
and manifold imperfections, let him not cast away his
confidence, but rather strengthen what he findeth of the
Lords gracious work in him, although it seem to him
ready to dye.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let him consider whether this exercise and
affliction be a correction from God, chastising him for
his rash judgment of others, whom possibly he hath
wounded with such rash suspicions of them; but whether
he find this or not, let him not despise this exercise, but
be humbled before God in the acknowledgment of the
reliques of hypocrisie in our corrupt nature, and flye
unto Christ (in whose mouth there was no guile) that
he may be cloathed with his righteousnesse head and
feet; and let him study unto more and more sincerity,
that he may approve himself to God, and to discreet
Judges of his conversation, and let him not alienat
himself altogether so far as in him lyeth from them, by
whose suspicions his faith and good name hath been
wounded, but in humility and charity toward them,
in the constant following of piety toward God and
righteousnesse toward men, labour to commend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to all mens consciences.</p>
               <p>And in so doing he needeth not stand for the rash
judgment of any man: for by so doing <hi>Iob</hi> was victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
over this tentation in his conflict with his friends:
and it is sure, that men may be deceived in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of other mens estate; for, first, the ignorance of
another mans heart, maketh the Judge to judge what
he knoweth not. It is true, God hath granted unto
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40880:160"/>
his children liberty according to his Word to judge of
the actions of other men, and from their actions to
judge of their condition and temper in relation to those
actions; but to judge of their state who outwardly do
what is right, doth not belong to men, but to God who
hath reserved to himself the searching of every mans
heart, and only knoweth who is the upright and who
is the hypocrit, who is the wise and who is the foolish
virgin, the outward conversation of both being like
one to another. Again, to know another mans man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
ingine, inclination and way of his life, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
long conversing with him, comparison of his
actions one with another, and a prudent conjunction
of all signes of his inward disposition, before a discreet
charitable judgment can be had of him. And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
do judge rashly of other mens hearts, do not well
know their own heart, or of what spirit they are in
judging: for many presume too much to justifie their
own condition and state, and make themselves to be as
rules and paterns unto others, and so become too too
rigid censurers and severe judges of other mens conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and state, except they find it like to their own.
And if there be any dissimilitude of manners or discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pance
of judgment, or contention about any mater, then
partiality hindereth a right judgment one of another,
and affection marreth reason many times that it cannot
discern what is right.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the person afflicted with this tentation,
turn himself to God who searcheth the reines, and let
him humble himself in his sight, renewing the exercise
of repentance and faith in Christ, and let him apply to
himself what the Scripture doth pronounce of these
who in the sense of their sin do flye to Christ Jesus, that
in him they may have remission of sin and amendment
of their life: for so did the Prophet in the whole <hi>Psal.</hi>
17. when he had to do with his uncharitable friends
and kinsfolk, and so let the afflicted do.</p>

there is no solid faith in themselves, no lively hope, no

and to renew the earnest-penny of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
forthwith they begin to doubt again, and
to hearken to Sathans suggestions, and to suspect that
their former feelings were but temporary, and not the
special operations of the holy Spirit, and at length
break forth in many sad complaints. And, in a word,
they do not maintain the work of saving grace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

no wayes so hard as was the Prophets, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. yet
they fall out in the same complaint which the Prophet
expresseth, <hi>ver. 7, 8, 9. Will the Lord cast off for ever?
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:40880:161"/>
and will he be favourable no more? is his mercy clean gone

to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender

               </p>
               <p>2. For clearing of this case, two diseases may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the afflicted which is here described. The
one is this, the afflicted setteth himself to live rather by
sense then by faith, and doth put his faith on work of
set purpose that he may obtain or recover consolation
shortly; but if his desire be not shortly granted, he
maketh not use of the formerly felt consolations to
strengthen his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith when consolation is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn:
The other sicknesse is this, the afflicted doth
not take up the nature of saving graces, nor perceive
the beauty thereof, except in the sun-shine of sensible
divine approbation thereof, he doth not take up the
right definition or description of saving graces: for,
saith is to him nothing, if it be not a full perswasion;
except he can pour forth tears alwayes, he thinks he
doth not repent; except he find a joyfull expectation
of Christs coming in glory, he thinks his hope not
lively; and so of charity and patience, temperance,
righteousnesse and holinesse, if he do not find them in
some eminent measur as they may near<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>by stand before
the law, the afflicted of whom we are now speaking,
thinketh he hath nothing of saving grace in him. We
grant, that this sicknesse is very rare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and few they are
that are troubled with it; yet where it appeareth, it
must be speedily cured, but with great circumspection
cured; for the earnest desire he hath of feeling the sweet
sense of the joy of the holy Ghost, must not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed,
but commended to him, and he taught to
cry as it is said, <hi>Cant. 2. 5. Stay me with flaggons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
me with aples, for I am sick of love,</hi> yet with holy
submission unto Gods will for time, maner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
2. He is also to be commended, that in his trouble
he goeth to God in Christ, not altogether without faith
which he putteth forth in active exercise thereof by
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:40880:162"/>
confession of sin, by supplication and otherwayes; but
here is he to be reproved, that while he is actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
faith, love, hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he reckoneth all he
doeth to be nothing, no faith, no hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because
it is not in such a measure as he would. 3. He is to be
commended, that he doth aime at the highest degrees of
faith, love, hope, patience, mortification of sin, and
practice of holinesse, and all commanded vertues; but
here he faileth, that he counteth all as nought, when
consolation and sensible approbation of what he hath
is not felt; for here he despiseth the day of small things,
and unthankfully mis-regardeth the lower degrees of
these saving graces, which notwithstanding are bought
to the redeemed by the same price wherewith the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degrees are bought, to wit, with the precious blood
of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>3. Wherefore let the afflicted consider, first, that
the will of God revealed, requireth of us, that we walk
by faith, and under the sense of our sinfulnesse and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
whatsoever, hold fast the covenant of grace in
Christ Jesus, and by adhering unto him hold up our
heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and entertain spiritual life in us. Secondly, let
him consider, that this way of living by faith and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on the word of Gods grace, doth please the
Lord well; for, without faith it is impossible to please
him; and thus living by faith in him, doth give more
glory of truth, grace, mercy and constancy unto God
then when we suspend the glorifying of him, till we
find the sense of consolation from him: for if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God, only because we find the consolations of
his Spirit, our faith in that case is weak, and leaneth
more upon the pledge and sensible evidence of his truth
bestowed upon us, then upon his promise without a
pledge: for, no man will refuse to give credit to a man
upon a pawn, but God is worthy to be credited upon
his word without a pawn, yea, when his dispensation
seemeth contrary to his promise. Thirdly, let him consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the Lord useth to give sensible consolations
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40880:162"/>
not only to help our faith, in the time of consolation,
but also to help our faith when the consolations are
withdrawn from us, and we are put to hard exercise:
wherein it is our duty to glorifie our God for his truth
and grace, whereof we have sometime had confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by felt consolation, and patiently to wait till he
restore unto us the joy of his Spirit: for if in the want
of sensible consolation we shall put aspersions upon the
Lords work and graces bestowed upon us, and call
them in question, we shall be found in so doing more
carefull of self-satisfaction then to do the duties which
God requireth of us. Fourthly, let the afflicted learn
so to describe and define every saving grace of faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
hope, love and mortification of sin, as the
description may take in the meanest measure of those
graces; for, it is hard to say, that there is no sound faith
where there is not a full perswasion; for the hungry
looking of a trembling sinner unto Christ, must not be
excluded from being an act of faith; it is hard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the exercise of repentance to the sheding of tears,
for many other signs of repentance may be found where
these are seldom, such as is the hatred of sin striving
against all tentations unto it, and flying from all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
which may insnare the believer in Christ in
trespasses. Fifthly, let the afflicted distinguish between
faith and sense of joy, both are Gods gifts, but the
grounds of faith whereupon we are commanded to rest
our selves should be rested on constantly, whatsoever
dispensation of joy or grief we shall meet with: and
this is our perpetual duty, but sense is at Gods free dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
to give and withdraw and restore at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and is a movable benefit, which, the Lord, as
his wisdom seeth expedient for our good, doth give
and continue, withdraw and restore, diminish or
augment. And therefore the afflicted is bound by du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
still to believe and rejoyce in believing. And to
have the joy of sense also he may lawfully study, but
ought not to suffer his faith to be weakened by the want
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40880:163"/>
of it, as the Prophet doth teach us, <hi>Ps.</hi> 42. 11. and, 43. 5.
and, 88. Last of all, let the afflicted be posed upon his
conscience if he dare condemn his flying to Christ in
the sense of his sins as no act of faith, or if he dar deny
his hunger after renewed consolation, and beholding of
God with joy as reconciled in Christ, to be an act of
love to God and of communion with him? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let him confesse with the Psalmist, <hi>Ps. 77. 10. This
my doubting is my infirmity, I will remember the years of
the right hand of the Lord.</hi>

regeneration, because in the using of the means lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to sanctification and salvation, sundry complain
and say, I do not perceive the Lords blessing on my
pains and diligence; I grow not in the knowledge of
things spiritual; my faith doth not grow by hearing
nor reading of the Word of God, nor by meditation
of it; I do not prevail in wrestling against my in-bred sin
and corrupt nature, neither by prayer nor fasting: and
therefore, what shall I judge of my state, but that it is
like I am not converted and renewed? For, if I were
indeed converted and reconciled with God, I conceive
it should fair otherwayes with me then it doth.</p>
               <p>2. In this case the true convert is in hazard of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
slack and careless in the use of the means, and to
grieve the holy Spirit, by prescribing unto him and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
of him unto such a measure of profiting in the
use of the means, and making him know how far he
had profited and advanced in the course of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
Yea, there is danger, lest in this case the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
not only become cold-rife in the exercises of piety,
but also turn loose in his conversation, and follow the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40880:163"/>
allurements of the world, having so far hearkened to the
temptation, as to think it in vain that he hath washen
his hands in innocency; as (<hi>Ps.</hi> 73.) befell the Prophet.</p>
               <p>3. For removing of this doubt, the afflicted hath
reason to check himself for hearkening so far unto the
temptation, as to joyn with hypocrits in his complaint,
<hi>Isa. 58. 5. Wherefore have we fasted</hi> (say they) <hi>and thou

               </p>
               <p>But because nothing doth more trouble the afflicted
then his suspicion of his own hypocrisie, let the causes
be searched from which his suspicion doth arise. One
of them may be this, that in the use of the means, the
eyes of the afflicted are more and more opened to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the power and poyson of his natural corruption
more clearly then he perceived before. And this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphering
of sin more and more, doth hinder him to
see the growth of his light and the growth of his hatred
against manifested sin, joyned with the overturning of
his own high imaginations and native pride. Another
cause may be this, that the true convert hath promised
unto himself, in the use of the means, more and greater
benefits spiritual from God, then he doth by experience
find, which because he doth not find, he thinketh he
hath not profited. A third cause may be this, that the
Lord is about the purging of him from practical errors,
such as are the high estimation of his own diligence in
the use of the means, as if there were some sort of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
annexed unto the works prescribed to the convert by
the Lord, or as if the use of the means had in them some
force and efficacy in producing such effects in him as
the convert hath expected; or, as if the Lord had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged
himself to blesse, sensibly, diligence in the use of
the means, to the diligent mans satisfaction.</p>
               <p>4. Therefore, first, let the afflicted continue in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and bewar of the foresaid practical errors; let
him humble himself before Christ, that he may draw
more vertue out of him by faith, and by so much the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40880:164"/>
more as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing in
the use of the means, let him lay the faster hold on the
covenant of grace, and on Christ offered therein, for
giving righteousnesse and sanctification. Secondly,
let him set upon the exercise of every duty with prayer,
that he may follow the duty in Christs name with his
eye fixed on Gods grace; and after the discharge of
the duty, let him look to Christ, that from him, he
may have the blessing: for, without Christ we can do
nothing acceptably, nor with profit. Last of all, let
him not esteem lightly of the effects of his diligence, as
if he did no wayes profit; but when he hath rightly
considered maters, if he find the least fruit following
his using of the means, let him give the glory of it to
God in Christ the giver thereof, and humbly put up
his lamentation for his short-coming in duties unto
God by prayer: for, this is the way to make progresse
in faith and repentance, and humility and submission
of his will unto God in the use of the means, and let
him thank the Lord, that from day to day he is keeped
from scandalous out-breaking.</p>

righteousnesse from the common operation of Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and impulsion of the holy Spirit.</head>
               <p>THere are some true converts, who have profited
so far in the amendment of their life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
their conversation unto the rule of Gods
Word, that the yoke of Christ is become easie to them,
and their delight is to be frequently about the exercises

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40880:164"/>
believers, in whom no sound renovation of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature will be found. I find nothing in me (saith
one) of the effectual motion of the holy Spirit, but all
by way of morall swasion, by imitation of others, by
education, as may be found in the unrenewed disciples
of morall philosophy: for as they by frequent actions
do acquire habits, wherewith being indued, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
moral duties more easily and with delight; So,
I by discharging acts of religion, and acquainting my
self with them daily, do seem to my self to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a facility and delectation in religious actions and
works of righteousnesse toward my neighbours.</p>
               <p>2. This case we grant is very perilous, and subtilely
coloured by Sathan to deceive and weaken the true
convert; for, it is true, what power hath been seen in
morall philosophy among Pagans, to put a luster on
mens civil conversation, must be also granted to Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
among professed Christians, because divine threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and promises, for procuring outward reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a mans life, are more apt to prevail with a man,
then all morall philosophy; and it is true also, that
education by parents, and imitation of good men, is
of great force morally to perswade a man to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of the outward duties of religion, and to a civil
conversation. Wherefore it is no wonder to see a true
convert doubt of his own regeneration, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
external duties discharged by himself, with the
external duties discharged by others whose heart he
cannot see, but must judge charitably of them, and
yet can neither be clear determinatly to affirm all such
to be true converts, nor to affirm himself to be a true
convert, so long as he suspecteth, that as some others
reformation, So also his own reformation, may prove
no better then from morall swasion, which may be

               <p>3. For lousing of this doubt and strengthening of the
faith of the true convert, let him examine himself, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the conscience of his natural sinfulnesse, and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40880:165"/>
sense of his own unworthinesse and inability to deliver
himself from the power of sin, wrath and misery, he
hath fled, and from time to time doth flye to Christ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the tenor of the covenant of grace, to be
justified, sanctified and saved by him, and doth follow
the exercises of religion and righteousnesse in obedience
to the commands of God. If his conscience answer
him, that so he doth, then, first, let him look upon
his doubting of his state, as the subtile tentation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than;
and that he may be strong against this tentation,
let him renew the acknowledgment of his sins and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
of his weaknesse and unworthinesse and renew
also his consent to the covenant of grace in Jesus Christ
and his purpose to obey the commandments of God in
the strength of Christ: for, by this means he shall gain
the entry into his refuge where-from Sathan was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, by furnishing doubts and weakening his faith.
Secondly, having casten his anchor within the vail,
and setled his faith on Christ Jesus, let him now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his former course, so far as truth will suffer, that
his former course of life, in following with delight the
exercise of religion and righteousnesse, did proceed from
the holy Spirit; and let him consider, that it is not a
sufficient reason to call in question the infused habits of
saving grace, because supernatural habits, infused im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
by the Spirit of Christ, are entertained, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and confirmed by frequent acts and daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
no lesse then natural or morall habits are, which
are acquired by exercise: And this is clear from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wherein are many exhortations to put faith, love,
repentance, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in frequent exercise, that
these gracious habits may grow strong, as the Apostle
<hi>Peter</hi> doth speak, 2 <hi>Epist. 1. chap. ver.</hi> 5, 6. &amp;c. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let him put a difference in judging of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
and the conversation of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whose prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and ends of outward godly carriage, he cannot
judge, as he can do of his own: for, a man in nature
unregenerat, or a temporary believer, may make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40880:165"/>
of true religion, and outwardly go on in a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
conversation, with this opinion, that by his works
he shall please God, and procure salvation to himself.
But the true convert shall be found a renouncer of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in his own works, a man sensible of his own
sinfulnesse and imperfections, who hath fled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth
still to adhere to Christ for righteousnesse and
salvation through him; the finding whereof in any
measure after examination, may solve the converts
doubt: for, a man in nature, cannot so hate sin and
follow holinesse, as to renounce confidence in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
and slve unto Christ for righteousnesse. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let the afflicted convert consider, that the Lords
dealing with his children both by morall motives, and
by effectual perswasion unto the obedience of faith,
may and doth very well concur and agree together, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the special operation of the holy Spirit with any
reason to be suspected, because he sweetly leadeth on
his child, by way of counsell, (without the childs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of any notable impulse) making him to
overcome strong tentations unto sin, whereunto he is
naturally inclined: for, the more victorious grace is
over corruption, the efficacie of the Lords grace is the
more conspicuous, and that obedience is most pleasant
to God wherein corrupt nature maketh most oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Therefore in this case here presupposed, let him
stand to the defence of his faith in Christ, and go on
cheerfully in the way of righteousnesse against Sathans
tentation solliciting him to doubting and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which counsell if he follow, he shall find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that he hath made use of the shield of faith,
and gotten the victory not without the special operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and impulse of the holy Spirit.</p>

               <p>SOme true converts are found, who having for a
time injoyed p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eace of conscience, have called their
conversion in question by occasion of hearing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some sermon of some zealous Preacher pressing the
marks of true and sincere conversion, and making self-denyall
and loving of God for himself, the main marks
of conversion, and without circumspect and wise
difference put by him betwixt legall perfection and
evangelical sincerity, pressing self-denyal and the loving
of God abstractly, further then any Saint doth attain
unto in this life. Whereupon some tender souls, do
fall in question with themselves, whether they be among
the true and sincere converts, because they know that
our Lord requireth self-denyall in every person who
will follow him, and doth condemn them all for unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
who seek glory of men, and not the glory which
is of God: And because the Preacher possibly hath
made the loving of God for his benefits, to be too too
mercenary, and hath pressed without respect to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
that God must be loved for himself, therefore
the weak convert beginneth to be troubled, as if he
were not a true convert at all, saying, what shall I
think of my self and of my following of Christ, seing
I feel so little of self-denyall in me, seing I have loved
Christ for my own good, and many a time in my best
actions I have sought the commendation of men in my
heart, and I have been ill pleased when I did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it?</p>
               <p>2. For solving of this doubt, we grant that every man
who will follow Christ, is bound to deny himself:
And true it is, there is nothing more difficile then to
forsake our own carnall wisdom, and estimation of our
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40880:166"/>
own worth, works and abilities how small <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oever.
Neither is there any more dangerous evil, then in the
discharge of Christian duties, to seek or accept our own
glory and the applause of men: for he that in this point
doth foster his natural corruption, certainly doth not
in so far favour these things which are Gods, but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
his own flesh. Therefore, because the reliques of
this and all other sin do remain in the regenerat, the
Lord by variety of exercises setteth his children daily to
learn this lesson over and over for mortifying their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
lusts. It is their duty therefore, when any spark
of this evil of self-seeking doth appear, to cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
down humbly at Christs feet and confesse the sin,
lest some spark of wrath break forth upon them from
the Lord. For, the end of this exercise, yea, and the
reason of the Lords not removing fully in-dwelling sin,
is to humble us, and send us to Christ, least if he
should otherwayes deal with us, we should grow proud,
and not make such use as becometh us of Gods free
grace and Christs righteousnesse imputed to the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
mean time we must not yield to Sathans tentation,
coloured with pretense of Scripture, as if Christ had
discharged us to seek any good from him to our selves.
or to love him for the good which he hath purchased to
us, and which he from time to time bestoweth on us:
for, when Christ requireth of us to deny our selves, he
requireth indeed the renounciation of our own carnall
and corrupt lusts, and confidence in our own wisdom,
worth and works. But he doth not require of us to
renounce the sanctified love of our own well-being, or
the seeking our sanctification, consolation and salvation
in him alone; for, the love of God and of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
is the main end of all our desires; and the seeking
that God would glorifie his own grace and truth in his
promises to us by sanctifying, comforting and saving
us, is a subordinat mean unto Gods glory: yea, the
more we seek our righteousnesse, consolation and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in God, through Christ, the more we glorifie
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40880:167"/>
God, and do say in substance of God, that he is the
fountain of all felicity, and that he is good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to grant all good things to such as believe in him
and do seek grace for grace from him.</p>
               <p>3. It is true, that we should love God above all
things, and love him more then our selves, and love
him though he should slay us; but it is true also, that
the more we love him for any cause, the more we
esteem of him, the more we magnifie and glorifie him;
and what is love to, and seeking of, God, but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of our own emptinesse and his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency?
and what is our seeking communion
with him, but a refounding of our selves into the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
whence we have our being, that he may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in our being, and fully well-being? And so our
spiritual love of God for himself and for the goodnesse
which is let forth in doing good to us, is not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
love, but is the acknowledgement of his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and of his grace to us, to whom he will be our God
in Christ, even all in all to us in him. As for seeking
of mens applause, whensoever, whether upon receiving
of any benefit, or discharge of any duty, the corrupt
lust of vain glory doth mix it self (which cannot but
obscure and hinder the shining of his glory, which
should be aimed at in all things by us) incontinent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first motion of this our sinfull corruption per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
let out sin be humbly acknowledged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
unto God, the searcher of the heart, and let
supplication in our spirit be made unto him, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
our sin, and mortifie the bitter root of this and all
other evils in us.</p>

               <p>SOme converts are, who by the light of the Law of
God are brought to the acknowledgment of their sin
and misery, and by the doctrine of the Gospel are
brought to seek their relief in Christ, and have taken
on his yoke and submitted themselves to his discipline,
and yet fall in question, whether they be converted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do find such inequality in their conversation,
and such changes in their condition, and variety of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
as they can find no example of the like in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and where it pleaseth them to be free with their
Pastor or confident Christian friend, do fall out in
questions, if ever they have read in Scripture any like
unto them, in such and such particulars as they please
to condescend upon; and if their Pastor or Christian
friend shall give them some example in the Scripture, of
Gods children so exercised, they are ready to find such
differences between the case of the godly in Scripture,
and their case, as they cannot receive satisfaction. And
if possibly it be told them, that their ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e is not singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but such as hath befallen sundry of their Christian
acquaintance in this present age, yet they cannot receive
satisfaction for all this, but still do insist, that their
case is not like to any of the godly. Whereupon they
foster the suspicion of their not being converted.</p>
               <p>2. This ground of judging of mens conversion by
the maner of Gods exercising of them, so as other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Saints have been exercised before them, and of
judging the man to be unregenerat, who is otherwayes
exercised then they know any convert to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised,
did deceive the friends of <hi>Iob,</hi> who in <hi>Iobs</hi>

thou art? and what Saint or holy man can thou name,
to whom thou can compare thy self and say, such a man
hath suffered such things as I do?</p>
               <p>This doubt doth arise from this error and mistake;
the afflicted doth without ground suppose, that expresse
examples of every particular case of the Saints is set
down in Scripture. It is true, there are examples of
many cases which may befall the godly; but it is not
to be expected that we sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll find examples of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
exercise of mind, wherein the Saints may fall:
For as the Evangehst saith, if all particulars were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
the world could not hold or make use thereof. It
is sufficient that the Scripture hath set down rules
whereun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o the Saints should labour to conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that it hath opened up the causes and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of all spiritual diseases, and hath given so many
examples as may clear the rule. It is also a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to make the experience of the most exercised
souldier a rule for every Saints exercises, or to think
that any man can know the variety of cases which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
the Saints: for, there are many whose cases are not
revealed to any, but laid open unto God only, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and are helped by faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>3. Wherefore the afflicted must walk by rules set
down in Scripture, whether he find the practices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in Scripture or not. Now this is the rule, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

we must humble our selves before God, and flye unto
Christ for remission of the guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the filthinesse thereof, for breaking down the power of
corruption, and pulling out the roots thereof; withall
praising and thanking Christ, who hath discovered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us these evils and hath made them our affliction, and
not suffered them to break forth to the scandal of others.
And whatsoever calamity or temporal misery we shall
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:40880:168"/>
fall into, the Scripture hath given order unto us, humbly
to submit our selves to Gods dispensation, and to make
a good construction of Gods love and wisdom in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
us so: for, by this rule <hi>Iob</hi> did walk, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his faith in Christ, his living and loving Redeemer,
against Sathans temptations, and his friends unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
wrangling disputations, when the question was
about his state, whether he had ever been converted or
not, whether he was a wicked hypocrit or not? and by
so doing, he over-came the temptation whereof we are
now speaking.</p>
               <p>And let not the afflicted lay it for a ground that by his
hearing of the exercise of another, like unto his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he can be cured: because no example of the exercise
of another can be found so quadrant unto his condition,
as he could thereby take satisfaction. For, as in compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of mens faces one with another, (such is the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
variety of the riches of Gods wisdom in
framing them) some difference and dissimilitude will
be found betwixt face and face; So, in comparing of
the cases of the Saints, none of them can be found in all
things so like one to another, but some dissimilitude shall
be found between them. Wherefore, the afflicted shall
do well, in every condition, to draw near God, and pour
out his heart before him at all times: for, God is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for us in all cases, <hi>Ps.</hi> 62. 8.</p>

marks of regeneration.</head>
               <p>SOme true converts sometime are in suspense, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether they be indeed converted, because they
do not discern in themselves the unquestionable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of their conversion; and albeit they have the
undoubted marks of regeneration, to wit, the daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
and acknowledgement of their sins, and do flye
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40880:169"/>
daily by faith unto Jesus Christ, and are endeavouring
in some measure of sincerity to bring forth the fruits
of new obedience, with respect to all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
concerning love to God and the brethren, yet they
dar not defend the sincerity of these evidences, because
of the discerned imperfection thereof: for, when they
do compare these marks of the new creature with the
rule, they find much halting and short-coming therein.
In special, they find their sense of sin to be but weak,
their faith in Christ to be weak, and their failings
and short-comings in the love of God and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
to be many, So that they scarcely dar allow these
begun saving graces, the name of saving graces. And
among other defects, they reckon their not feeling of the
spirit of Adoption, whereof the Apostle speaketh to the
converted Galatians, <hi>Gal. 4. 6. Because ye are Sons,</hi> saith
he, <hi>God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,
crying, Abba, Father.</hi> And, <hi>Ephes. 1. 13. In whom after
you believed, ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise.</hi>
Which Spirit of promise and of adoption, sealing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
they conceived was known and discerned in the
Apostles time by every believers feeling in himself.</p>
               <p>2. For solving of this doubt, something is spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concerning the imperfect fruits of faith, the budd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
and blossoming whereof are not despised by
Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 13. and, 6. 12. But that this doubt
may be more fully answered, let us take up the causes
thereof, 1. one cause is or may be this, that the afflicted,
albeit, together with the endeavour to lead a blamelesse
life, he be indued with the grace of prayer, and looketh
on God as his father; yet he doth not take up this work
of God in him, to be the work of the Spirit of Christ,
illuminating his mind about duties, framing his will
and affections unto new obedience, stirring him up to
prayer and helping him in prayer, but in the earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
he hath to find the operations of the Spirit in a
larger measure of evidence, he doth not mark the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
operation, but doth slight it as nothing, or doth not
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40880:169"/>
esteem of it as becometh, and so in his advertance raiseth
and fostereth doubts in himself, which do keep his faith
in chains: for removing of which cause, let the afflicted
observe the operation of the Spirit of Christ in the
meanest degree, for the confirmation of his own faith,
and comfort and thanksgiving unto God, as narrowly
as he doth observe in himself the first motions of sin
and stirrings of corruption, for his own humiliation
and exercise of repentance; for wrong judgment under
pretext of humility, doth not please God. Now it is
an act of injustice not to give unto God the praise of
every good thing in a man, especially when the man is
found to be cast down in himself, and to be thirsting
in his soul for a more intimat communion with Christ,
as is presupposed in this case.</p>
               <p>3. The second cause is or may be this, that the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
albeit he hath had oft times sweet and sensible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
and confirmation of the promises of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and hath thereby been put out of doubt of his
adoption for the time, yet when new temptations do
arise (according to what was expedient for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of his faith) because the same sweetnesse is not
felt, but heavinesse for the while, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6, 7. he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
the consolations he hath had, or suffereth them
to be called in question. For removing whereof, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the afflicted is cut short in the point of sense or
sensible consolation, let him then strive to abound in the
work of the Lord, and not slacken his hand in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of religion and of his lawfull calling, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to please God in all things: for, seing the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace imbraced, is a firm and solid ground
for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith to fix upon, albeit full perswasion and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
consolation were neither at all, or but very rarely
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elt in this life; the afflicted (whom we have to speak
to here) hath no cause to stumble, but reason to blesse
God, who hath in any measure, at any time, comforted
him by the Gospel: for, that condition which the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
wisheth for, is reserved unto us in heaven, and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40880:170"/>
promises, such as are made to the meek and mercifull,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. which qualified promises they look upon as
conditional, excluding them (as they conceive) who
do not find in themselves such qualifications: and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they are not clear about their right to receive
the offer of the Gospel, because they want, as they
conceive, fitnesse in themselves to receive the same, and
thus are they oft-times vexed with doubts whether they
be in the state of grace or not.</p>
               <p>2. For lousing of this doubt, sundry things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said, by the way, in answering other doubtfull
cases. But because many do meet with this difficulty,
we shall speak a little more particularly to the case;
and, first, it is needfull, that the afflicted be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about that which is right in him, that the thing
which remaineth and is ready to die, may be strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
To this intent we commend the afflicted, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sensible of sin, and feared for-wrath, he hath fled
unto Christ for refuge; next we commend him, that
he hath begun to give new obedience to Gods Law, and
doth purpose to follow on as he shall be enabled; and
thirdly, we commend him, that albeit he cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that near conjunction with Christ, which he
would, yet he neither will, nor dare forsake Christ, not
put himself out of the number of weak believers in
Christ, for he hath said in his heart with <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh.
6. 68. <hi>To whom shall I go? for Christ hath the words of
eternal life.</hi> Hitherto all is right, and the afflicted
must resolve to cleave close to this foundation, because
Christ hath said, <hi>Ioh. 6. 37. These that come unto me I
will in no case cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For his doubt arising from the nature of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
absolute, conditional and qualified, looked upon
by him as if they were conditional, we answer. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
That these qualified promises, having some mark in
them of true believers, are not exclusive of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
who find in themselves a defect of the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but they are inductive unto all believers, to study
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40880:170"/>
the attaining of that qualification, and are corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of these belivers who find in any sensible measure
these qualifications: For example, promises made to
the mercifull, to the peace-makers, to the upright in
heart, do not exclude these who find themselves short
in these graces, and yet are hungry and thristy for
righteousnesse, yet are poor and indigent of all good
in themselves and daily beggers at the throne of grace
for what they want, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. for, these qualifications,
found in a weak believer, are signes and effects of sound
faith in them. And we must grant, that of these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
specified in these qualified promises, some of them
are more eminent in some of the Saints, and other some
of them more eminently seen and felt in other some of
the Saints. And in the same person, one of these quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
may sometime shine more clearly, and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time by some tentation, or mistake, be over-cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and not shine so clearly as before, yet the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are comfortable to all them who find the same
in themselves, and are inductive to make every believer
to aime to excell in these graces, and so to confirm their
own faith more and more, as (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7.) we
are exhorted. Again, these qualifications, are signs
of a believer already entered in the covenant of grace by
faith in Christ, and begun to bring forth good fruits,
but they are not the conditions of entering into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
for then none could enter in covenant till first
these qualifications in exercise were sound in them, and
that were to dis-annull the covenant of grace, and to set
up a sort of covenant of works; for there is not another
condition of entering in the covenant but faith in Christ
only, whereby the humbled sinner, renouncing all
confidence in any good in himself, or from himself, doth
betake himself wholly to the grace offered in Jesus
Christ in whom perfect righteousnesse is to be found.
Now unto the man who shall believe in Christ, all the
promises of the Gospel are made, upon this condition,
that he do believe in Jesus Christ; which condition of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40880:171"/>
presuppose the afflicted should have what he wisheth,
consolations alwayes running like a river, where were
place for trying, exercising and training of him in his
faith? but let him work and wrastle on, and among
hands he shall have as much peace as may suffice a
pilgrim.</p>
               <p>4. The third cause is, or may be this, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
hath grieved the Spirit of God, either by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
his gracious operations to some other cause then
grace, or counting his consolations to be but flashes,
and like unto delusions; or, that the afflicted by corrupt
communication, or grosse offences, hath provoked God
to anger, as befell <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 51. For removing of this
cause, whether the sin of the afflicted hath been more
or lesse provoking, let him with <hi>David (Ps.</hi> 51.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the exercise of repentance and faith in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
who only can renew a right spirit in him, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
restore him to the formerly-felt consolation and
joy of his Spirit, and let him walk more warily here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
that he provoke not to wrath so mercifull a father.</p>
               <p>5. The fourth cause is, or may be this, that the
afflicted, albeit he hath consented to the covenant of
grace, and hath embraced Christ Jesus offered in the
Evangel, yet he doth not set to his seal to the truth of
God without an hink, or fear and suspicion of his right
to apply the grace offered; in which case so long as he
doubts, and doth not rest his sinfull soul on the Word
of God, offering grace to every soul sensible of sin, who
shall flye to Jesus Christ, what wonder the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
doth with-hold the sealing of the mans faith? For
this is Gods order holden forth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. that a
sinner should first six his faith on Christ offered in the
Gospel, and after he hath believed (not before he do
believe) wait for the sealing of the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>For removing this cause, 1. let the afflicted acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that his hesitation, doubting and suspicion, is
justly chastised of God, because he hath not firmly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to the covenant embraced by him, and because
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40880:171"/>
he hath not given unto God the glory of his truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a pawn, and yet doth in effect quarrel and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
that he doth not find these consolations which
are given and but rarely, it may be even to the sound
and strong in the faith. 2. Let him for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his faith, hereafter consider well, how strong and
solid a foundation faith hath to lean unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even Gods
promise and oath given unto all that do flye to Christ
for refuge and relief from sin and misery, <hi>Heb.</hi>

study to be so fast glewed unto Christ in every
condition and case he findeth himself, and go about
the exercise of repentance and faith and new obedience
in his calling, submitting himself to the will of God
in every dispensation: which direction if he shall aime
to follow, he shall not want the fruit of his faith, and
honest endeavour to please God: for, <hi>Psal. 97. 11.

               <head type="sub">Wherein is solved the doubt of the true convert, whether he
be indeed converted, because he cannot confidently apply
to himself the promises of the Gospel.</head>
               <p>THere are some true converts, who albeit for fear of
the wrath of God for their sins, are already fled unto
Christ, and have hid themselves under the wings of the
propitiatory in the shadow of the Almighty Mediator,
and are already begun in earnest to give new obedience
to the law of God; yet from time to time they fall in fear
and trembling suspicion that all be not a sound work
of grace in them; and that partly because they cannot
confidently apply to themselves the promises of the
Gospel, whether absolut, such as are made to the
Elect, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31, 31. or conditional, such as are made to
believers in Christ offered in the Gospel; or qualified
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40880:172"/>
promises, such as are made to the meek and mercifull,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. which qualified promises they look upon as
conditional, excluding them (as they conceive) who
do not find in themselves such qualifications: and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they are not clear about their right to receive
the offer of the Gospel, because they want, as they
conceive, fitnesse in themselves to receive the same, and
thus are they oft-times vexed with doubts whether they
be in the state of grace or not,</p>
               <p>2. For lousing of this doubt, sundry things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said, by the way, in answering other doubtfull
cases. But because many do meet with this difficulty,
we shall speak a little more particularly to the case;
and, first, it is needfull, that the afflicted be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about that which is right in him, that the thing
which remaineth and is ready to die, may be strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
To this intent we commend the afflicted, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sensible of sin, and feared for-wrath, he hath fled
unto Christ for refuge; next we commend him, that
he hath begun to give new obedience to Gods Law, and
doth purpose to follow on as he shall be enabled; and
thirdly, we commend him, that albeit he cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that near conjunction with Christ, which he
would, yet he neither will, nor dare forsake Christ, nor
put himself out of the number of weak believers in
Christ, for he hath said in his heart with <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh.
6. 68. <hi>To whom shall I go? for Christ hath the words of
eternal life.</hi> Hitherto all is right, and the afflicted
must resolve to cleave close to this foundation, because
Christ hath said, <hi>Ioh. 6. 37. These that come unto me I
will in no case cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For his doubt arising from the nature of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
absolute, conditional and qualified, looked upon
by him as if they were conditional, we answer. 1.
That these qualified promises, having some mark in
them of true believers, are not exclusive of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
who find in themselves a defect of the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but they are inductive unto all believers, to study
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40880:172"/>
the attaining of that qualification, and are corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of these believers who find in any sensible measure
these qualifications: For example, promises made to
the mercifull, to the peace-makers, to the upright in
heart, do not exclude these who find themselves short
in these graces, and yet are hungry and thirsty for
righteousnesse, yet are poor and indigent of all good
in themselves and daily beggers at the throne of grace
for what they want, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. for, these qualifications,
sound in a weak believer, are signes and effects of sound
saith in them. And we must grant, that of these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
specified in these qualified promises, some of them
are more eminent in some of the Saints, and other some
of them more eminently seen and felt in other some of
the Saints. And in the same person, one of these qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
may sometime shine more clearly, and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time by some tentation, or mistake, be over-cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and not shine so clearly as before, yet the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
are comfortable to all them who find the same
in themselves, and are inductive to make every believer
to aime to excell in these graces, and so to confirm their
own faith more and more, as (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7.) we
are exhorted. Again, these qualifications, are signs
of a believer already entered in the covenant of grace by
faith in Christ, and begun to bring forth good fruits,
but they are not the conditions of entering into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
for then none could enter in covenant till first
these qualifications in exercise were sound in them, and
that were to dis-annull the covenant of grace, and to set
up a sort of covenant of works; for there is not another
condition of entering in the covenant but saith in Christ
only, whereby the humbled sinner, renouncing all
confidence in any good in himself, or from himself, doth
betake himself wholly to the grace offered in Jesus
Christ in whom perfect righteousnesse is to be found.
Now unto the man who shall believe in Christ, all the
promises of the Gospel are made, upon this condition,
that he do believe in Jesus Christ; which condition of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40880:173"/>
faith in Christ, when it is now performed, and by the
grace of God, the man made a believer in Christ, then
the absolute promises of making a new heart, and of
writing the Law of the Lord therein, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 31. and
<hi>Ezek,</hi> 11. 19.) and all the promises of saving graces set
down in holy Scripture, do all of them belong to the
believer in Christ, in whom all the promises are <hi>yea</hi> and
<hi>amen,</hi> as if his name were set down.</p>
               <p>4. As to his doubt, arising from his weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
application of the promises, let the afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what God hath already wrought and is a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him by way of application: for, first, God hath
granted to him the use of the meanes with others in the
visible Kirk, so that it may be said unto him in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as it is, <hi>Esa.</hi> 5. 4. what could be done in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means and offer-making of grace which is not
done? Secondly, God hath drawn more near unto
him, and hath illuminat his mind about his sinfull
state in nature, and about the way of delivery by faith
in Christ, and yet more, hath inclined his heart to
accept of the offer of Christ and make answer to the
call, as <hi>David</hi> did: <hi>When thou saidst, seek my face, my
soul answered, thy face O Lord will I seek,</hi> Psal. 27. 8.
Thus God hath applyed Christ and the promises of the
Gospel to the afflicted, and hath made the afflicted to
flye unto Christ offered in the Gospel and to apply him
unto himself, that hitherto the afflicted hath no reason
to complain of not application of Christ and his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
on Gods part, nor yet of begun-application on
the afflicted's part. Where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in-lake then? I
answer, the defect is, first, in the afflicted, who hath
not duly considered the passages of Gods gracious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to him, and drawing of the man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in Christ; another defect is, that the afflicted upon
groundlesse mistakes, doth not lay claim to Christ and
to all the promises of grace for righteousnesse and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in him, and that because he is not so clear of
his right unto, and interest in, Christ, as he can lay claim
confidently unto the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:40880:173"/>
5. For clearing of the afflicted in this his right and
warrant, confidently to apply Christ and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospel, let him consider, first, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sentence of the curse and condemnation of all them
that do not believe on Christ, <hi>Ioh. 3. 18. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in Christ, is not condemned; but he that believeth not,
is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the
only begotten Son of God.</hi> Secondly, let him consider
the largenesse of the Gospel, wherein grace is offered
to all and every believer, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16. God so loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi>
He saith <hi>whosoever,</hi> without exception, lest any man who
desireth to believe in Christ, should doubt that he shall
be received and made welcome. Thirdly, let him me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
upon the wonderfull mystery of the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Son of God, who, that he might ransom
and redeem his people from sin and misery, hath assumed
humane nature into the union of person with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature, and given a perpetual pawn and pledge of
his hearty willingnesse to reconcile, justifie, sanctifie
and save to the uttermost every one who shall come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God through him: whereunto his mediatory Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and cloathing himself with most sweet relations of
Prophet, Priest and King to all his followers, doth
hear abundant witnesse. Fourthly, let him hearken
to the quickening and comfortable invitations which
by his Spirit, speaking in Scripture, he uttereth in the
ears of all to whom the Gospel cometh with a joyfull
sound; <hi>Ho, every one that thirsteth!</hi> Isa. 55. 1. to 10.
<hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy loaden,</hi>
Mat. 11. 28. <hi>We are Embassadors for Christ, as though God
did beseech you by us, we pray you, in Christs stead, beye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. <hi>And whosoever will, let him
take the water of life freely. Rev.</hi> 22. 17. Fifthly, let the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
consider what answer he will give to the expresse
command of God, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 23. This is his comand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we should believe in the name of his Son Iesus
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40880:174"/>
Christ, and love one another as he hath commanded us.</hi> For,
this commandment being directed to all the hearers of
the Gospel, chargeth every one without exception,
first to examine seriously their life by the rule of Gods
Law, that thereby they may be convinced of their
damnable state in nature, and made to acknowledge
their sin and misery, and inability to help themselves:
Secondly, having examined and acknowledged their
natural lost condition they are commanded to flye to
Jesus Christ, that by faith in him they may be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Thirdly, that having fled to Christ, they should
evidence their faith by love to Christ or God in Christ,
and their neighbours, especially such as are of the house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
of faith. In which commandment, both the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of applying Law and Gospel, is set down, and the
necessity of believing in Christ, upon the warrant of
this clear command; so that whosoever is a hearer of
the Gospel, and doth not in this order flye unto Christ,
he is inexcusable, even the wicked and worst of men.
And much lesse excusable is the afflicted convert of
whom we are now speaking, who already hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
his lost condition without Christ, and
knoweth that there is no hope of relief, except by faith
in Jesus, and hath fled to Christ, and dare not depart
from him, if this man shall stand here and not relye
on Christ and rest his soul upon him confidently, what
excuse can he make? If he do object, that his name is
not written in this command, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. it hath no
force to impede his faith, for neither is his name written
in any of the ten commands of the morall Law, and
yet he findeth himself tyed to the obedience of every one
of them, and why is he not tyed also to this sweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Gospel of grace, as well as to other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?
this command being given forth as the last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of Gods will, for relief of them who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that they by the law are condemned? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let not the afflicted any more pretend the difficulty
of applying Christ and his graces offered in the Gospel,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40880:174"/>
seing it is presupposed he hath fled to Christ, and dare
neither depart from him, nor for the pretended scruple
draw confidently in unto him; but let him check and
chide himself for not haunting Christ, and conversing
with him in heaven in that humility and confidence
which the Word of the Lord doth allow unto him and
commandeth him to take up and hold fast.</p>

               <head type="sub">Wherein is solved the doubt of the true convert concerning
his conversion, arising from the observation in himself of
presumption and security in his prosperity and of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
in adversity.</head>
               <p>THere are some true converts, who albeit they are
neither idle nor unfruitfull in the work of the Lord,
and in acknowledging of Christ, yet are frequently
called in question about their state in grace; for when
their conscience is quiet, they fall in suspicion that their
faith is but presumption, and when through tentation
in adversity they are put to wrestling, their suspicion
is, that then felt weaknesse of faith in wrastling is but
misbelief. And when the frequent perturbations of
their mind, do make them indisposed for any exercise
of religion, a suspicion is raised, that the faith which
they seemed to have, is but dead, because when there
is most need of bringing forth fruits they are altogether
unfit and unable to bring forth any fruits. What shall
I think of my estate, faith the afflicted, who when an
enemy doth not appear am secure, and when I must
enter the combat with the adversary, I faint, and oft-times
when I am called to the exercise of religion, I am
confounded, I am stupid and impotent to discharge
any duty therein?</p>
               <p>2. That this doubt may be solved, the three causes
of his doubting must be removed. As to the first, which
is the suspicion, that his faith is presumption, we do
not deny that carnall confidence in prosperity useth to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40880:175"/>
assume to it self the name of true faith, and that even
true converts, do sometime deceive themselves concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the measure of their faith, both on the right hand
and on the left, by judging faith not questioned, to be
strong faith, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith in wrastling to be weak or none
at all. We grant also, that some mixture of presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
will be found joyned with true faith, and of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
also. Which evils do lurk and hide their power,
till the man be put to some tryal. Wherefor the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
hath need of discretion, that he may have a right
esteem both of the operation of the holy Spirit, and of
the power of native corruption in himself, for faith
must not be condemned for the imperfections of it, or
for the mixture of presumption and misbelief with it.
And to help his judgment, let him observe the nature
of prevalent presumption, and the nature of true faith,
which differ one from another in these four respects,
first, presumption is founded upon a false imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without any warrant of Gods Word; but faith
taketh heed to the Scripture, that from the Word it
may give a reason of believing. 2. Presumption is
negligent and idle in the discharge of duties, but faith
taketh head to the commands of God, and is diligent
and serious in the use of the means. 3. The presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man doth not make question of his estate, but bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
himself, when his way is to be hated, for he doth
not examine himself, that he may know certainly in
what condition he is, but he that puts his faith in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
doth carefully examine his carriage and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
lest he deceive himself. 4. The presumptuous man
in all his wayes and actions is well pleased with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but the believer, because of the sinfulnesse he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in all his actions, is ill pleased with himself in his
best actions many times, and renounceth all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his works, that he may wholly depend on the
grace of God.</p>
               <p>3. Let the afflicted therefore who so doth look to the
Gospel, as he also maketh use of the Law, both in
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40880:175"/>
prosperity and adversity, maketh conscience of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of religion and duties of his calling in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and is never so well pleased with himself but he
observeth the power of corruption in himself, let him
(I say) not reckon himself among the presumptuous,
let him not esteem his quietnesse in believing to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
               <p>4. As for his suspicion, that his saith is null, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it proveth weak in conflict, let the afflicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
lest he help and strengthen Sathans tentations
against his faith, albeit he find his faith weak in tryals
and assaults, and not answerable either to his own hope
or others expectation of him; yet let him not quench
the smoaking flax, nor break the bruised reed, but let
him follow Christ, humbling himself before God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his defects, and going about to strengthen that
which is remaining. 2. Albeit in some fit of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he slide, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, and find that he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
too much of his own strength and honest purpose
as <hi>Peter</hi> also did, yet let him not think that his faith is
null, but let him weep with <hi>Peter,</hi> and turn again by
repentance, and watch better over his own heart for
time to come.</p>
               <p>5. As for the suspicion he hath, that his faith is dead
or idle, because when fruits are chiefly called for, he
finds himself uterrly indisposed, unfit and unable to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
any work of religion, as cometh to passe in the
time of passions, perturbations of mind, and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the conscience: for clearing whereof, we do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that wrath and contention do hinder
prayer and other exercises of religion, as the Apostle
doth insinuat, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. where he commandeth hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
to carry themselves discreetly toward their wives,
least their prayers in the family or in secret be hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. the Apostle commandeth men
to pray every where, lifting up pure hands without
wrath or doubting. We acknowledge also, that not

also it is found by experience, that any perturbation of

as may be seen when any person is surprised
with the report of some notable damnage, or is possibly
wounded by some accident, or terrified by the sight of
imminent danger; yet for all this, none of these
things can prove faith to be dead, but doth shew the
infirmity of a mans mind, the use of whose reason may
be hindered for a time by perturbations and sudain pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
and at the most, the presupposed cases may
prove the weaknesse of faith, and the interruption of it
in the putting forth it self vigorously for the time, but
cannot prove the deadnesse or <hi>nullity</hi> of faith, whih af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
such passions are past, doth set forward to bring
forth fruits in better measure: wherefore let not the
afflicted halt in his way for such tentations, but let him
make straight steps to himself, least that which is halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be turned out of the way; let him reject these fiery
darts and tentations tending to weaken his confidence,
let him humble himself in the sense of inherent corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and wash frequently his conscience at the fountain,
which is opened up in the house of <hi>David</hi> for purging
away sin and uncleannesse; let him carry himself the
more circumspectly in all things, because of his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
experience of Sathans malice, of the power of
sin, and of his own infirmities.</p>

               <head type="sub">Wherein is solved the doubt of a true converts regeneration,
arising from some false rule applyed without reason to
himself.</head>
               <p>SOme true converts, judging their state by some false
rule, do not only torment themselves, but also (so
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:40880:178"/>
far as in them lyeth) by pronouncing false sentences of
their own state, go about to extinguish the spunk of
piety which is in them. The false rule whereby they
do judge themselves, is strengthened by a groundlesse
perswasion, that it is a true and sure rule, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
when they think or speak of it, they prefix no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it, but some confident asseveration, such as
<hi>without doubt, it is most certain,</hi> and <hi>I am perswaded of it,</hi>
and such like. If I were regenerat and truly converted,
without doubt, I should be in a better disposition then
I am, I should love the Lord more fervently, I should
understand the mysteries of Gods Word more clearly,
I should not be so little affected with the sense of Gods
benefits bestowed on me, I should not go so lightly
under the conviction of so many sins against God as I
feel in me, I should be more diligent in the work of the
Lord, in my calling I should walk more humbly and
circumspectly in all my conversation, and such like
many expressions. The same course doth the afflicted
follow in his examination of the operations of the holy
Spirit, and of every Christian vertue in himself: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, saith he, if this were truly as a Christian
vertue in me, there would not be such a disposition as
I find in me, my condition should be such and such as
became a new creature, which because I do not find
in me, I have just reason to call in question my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
And here is a port opened for Sathan to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at, and to throw all his fiery darts at the miserable
soul of the weak convert, whence many complaints do
break forth, and thanksgiving for mercies received and
for the time injoyed, is broken off and ceaseth: And
partly through diffidence, partly through murmuring,
the Spirit of the Lord is provoked to wrath.</p>
               <p>2. We grant, that this is a dangerous evil not only
to the person afflicted, but also to such as are familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted with his condition, because this disease
readily doth infect others, as it came to passe in the
camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> where the murmuring of some, set the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40880:179"/>
body of the army on a mutiny against God: for, one
that is weak in the faith, when he heareth such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
in the mouth of one whom he judgeth to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
then himself, incontinent he falleth on complaining
of his own state, saying, that he hath more weighty
reason to suspect the soundnesse of his conversion, then
the person hath whom he hath heard suspecting his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the state of grace.</p>
               <p>3. Wherefore let the afflicted before he shall vent
his suspicion of his state, examine the rule whereby he
hath passed sentence on himself, whether he can make
it good from the Scripture: for, it is not sufficient to
say, <hi>without doubt,</hi> and I <hi>am perswaded</hi> it is true, except
it can be confirmed by the infallible warrant of Gods
Word; and let his friend who shall hear his complaint,
expresly require a reason of his confidence, that such a
rule is clear from Scripture, and that the application
thereof is made righteously. Which if he cannot prove
otherwayes then Sathan doth enforce his tentations,
that is, either without Scripture, or by abusing Scripture
contrary to the intent thereof, let him acknowledge his
readinesse to misbelieve and disobey the Word of the
Lord, and to hearken to Sathans tentations to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
of his own faith, and hindering of his cheerfull
obedience to the Lords commands: and because such
question-making of being in the state of grace, is oft-times
very inconsideratly uttered, even before them who
do not allow the complainers misconstruction of his
state, or if they should allow it, and say to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainer,
that they believed that suspicion of his state
were very just, it should grieve the complainer more
then the doubt it self: Therefore let the afflicted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hearken to the suspicion, nor vent it when it is
strongly suggested; but let him humble himself before
Christ, because of these defects and wants of such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of saving grace as he would have; and in the
sense of these wants, let him cleave close to Christ for
covering his nakednesse, and earnestly endeavour by
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:40880:179"/>
faith in Christ to be made more and more conform to
the examplar of holinesse holden forth in the Scripture.</p>

               <p>SOme sincere converts, who uprightly do serve Christ,
and adhere unto him by faith, when they consider
the doctrine of the deceitfulnesse of the heart of man,
and how many are deceived by trusting to the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their own heart, concerning their regeneration
and justification, do begin to call in question all the
work of their own conversion, and do fear least they
be found in the number of the finer sort of hypocrits,
who deceive both themselves and others, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them but a civil life and form of religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the power of godlinesse, and do sleep to death in
security: of which sort our Lord Jesus forewarneth,
that not only privat persons, but also many preachers
shall be found, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. of whom we may suppone,
that they were not conscious of open and grosse wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse,
but were of a blamelesse carriage before the
world, professing the Christian faith, and teaching
others to believe in Christ, and doubted nothing but
Christ should judge of them as reall Saints; to
whom for all that, Christ shall one day say, <hi>depart
from me ye workers of iniquity, I never knew you.</hi> It is
certain that such men have been deceived by their own
heart: which when the afflicted doth consider, he
standeth astonished and trembleth for fear, saying with
himself, what shall I think of my former opinion of my
blessd state, I fear my heart hath deceived me, as
others of greater gifts and better life, have been deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their own heart.</p>
               <p>2. This is a doubt which hath need to be solved; but
neither this nor any other doubt can be solidly and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40880:180"/>
effectually solved by any mean, except the holy Spirit
give a blessing to the means: for, it is certain, that
there are many, who being religiously educat and free
from grosse vices, do not repent of their sins, are not
touched with the sense of their original sin and corrupt
lusts, but without taking any burden on their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
for these, do passe by their time, well pleased
with their own estate. Some also there are, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fallen in grosse and scandalous sins, do find for
some time remorse of conscience for these grosse sins, but
for their other sins beside those, and for their in-born
corruptions, are not carefull, thinking it sufficient if
thereafter they do not fall in such grosse faults: The
first sort of men, do deceive themselves, thinking they
have little to repent of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in regard they are free of grosse
out-breakings. This last sort deceive themselves also,
because they esteem their natural sorrow for such sins
as are grosse and scandalous, to be true repentance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they be not humbled for the fountain of these out-breakings,
to wit, their in-born corruption of nature
and filthy concupiscence, and the daily out-breakings
thereof, to the polluting of their spirits, whereof they
do take litle or no notice. Many also there are who
deceive themselves, esteeming the outward exercises of
religion, and some works (in themselves commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
to be sufficient fruits and evidences of their faith
in Christ and of their regeneration, albeit they have not
as yet fled to Christ sincerely, neither ever put a right
estimation upon the imputed righteousnesse of Christ.
Such men, when they should renounce all confidence
in their own works, and in the sense of their sinfulnesse
flye unto the covenant of grace offered in Christ, that
in him they might have remission of sin, and from him
by faith draw strength and ability to bring forth good
works, they run a contrary course; for in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their own strength they go about sundry duties
toward men, and exercises of religion toward God,
trusting in those works, as if by works they were to be
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40880:180"/>
justified. Therefore justly shall Christ say unto them,
<hi>depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I never knew you.</hi>
Such were many of the Israelits, who being ignorant of
the righteousnesse of God, went about to establish their
own righteousnesse. These things when one, weak in
faith doth consider, no wonder he be troubled and be
afraid lest he deceive himself and perish as others have
done.</p>
               <p>3. This is a dangerous disease, and so long as it is
not cured, it hinders much the tender beginnings of the
new creature, that it cannot come up to manly strength,
First therefore, let the afflicted wisely examine the
course of his by-gone life, lest he either absolve, or
condemn himself, rashly; and let him beware lest he
esteem the worse of the evidences of a new creature, and
the fruits of faith, because these that look to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their works, can produce the like works. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
let the afflicted call to mind whether in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ormation of his life, the Law as a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagoge
did lead him unto Christ; and whether since
that time, the law did daily put him on, and force
him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lye to Christ, and to embrace Christ and his
righteousnesse, and hath made him to study obedience
to the law, out of love to God, so much the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as he perceived himself obliged thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
grace granted in Christ to him; for if any
measure of the daily exercise of repentance, if any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of love to Christ, and any measure of endeavour
of new obedience, be found after examination in
the person afflicted, out of doubt the ground is laid
solidly of his salvation, out of doubt he hath an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the work of grace by the operation of the holy
Spirit in himself.</p>
               <p>4. If in this examination the afflicted be not clear,
but the doubt doth yet stick, because of the suspicion
he hath of the felt deceitfulnesse of his own heart, we
offer unto him this counsell, that he quickly humble
himself before God, and do ingenuously acknowledge
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40880:181"/>
the native perversenesse and deceitfulnesse of his heart;
and for that very reason, let him embrace Christ the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
in the armes of faith, offering himself to every
condemned sinner; and let him thank God who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered
unto him this deceitfulnesse of his heart, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Christ unto him for the true remedy of this and
every other sinfull malady. And in the mean time, let him
put a difference between himself and an hypocrit, in
whom the deceit of the heart is neither acknowledged
nor seen, but fostered and defended: for, a close hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
after hearing of the doctrine of the deceitfulnesse
of the heart, will stand to the defending of his own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
and will take it hardly if any man labour to
convince him of any measure of hypocrisie: but a
true convert, or regenerat person, will not deny but
much hypocrisie may be found in him; and albeit he
be sorrowfull, that this deceitfulnesse of heart hath had
lodging in him and lurked too long, yet is he willing
and glad to have this evil more and more discovered
unto him, and heartily doth he deliver up this traitor
to Christ, to be mortified and abolished by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>5. But if the afflicted cannot be quiet and satisfied,
still fearing and suspecting he be found a man unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
and that for the running issue of this filthy boyl,
opened up to him by the sword of the Spirit, let him
beware that he passe not permptor sentence against
himself, that he do not conclude himself to be a man
altogether in the bond of iniquity; but let him suspend
for a time, the disputation, and do that which is allowed
unto every self-condemned man in the beginning of his
conversion, that is, quickly let him flye unto Christ for
remission of sin, let him lay hold on that righteousnesse
purchased by him; and the more he feareth to find
God a severe judge, let him the more firmly lay hold
on Jesus Christ the Mediator, who justifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
by faith: this is the only solid way to persevere
in faith, to overcome Sathan, to solve doubts, to resist
temptations, and to cure the wound made by Sathans
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40880:181"/>
firy darts; for, unto that man, who in the sense of his
sins and ill deserving, and inability to help himself, doth
flye unto Christ, it shall never be said by Christ, depart
from me, I never knew thee.</p>
               <p>6. Now when the person afflicted hath of new laid
hold on Christ and guarded the fortresse of faith, and
repulsed the tempter, who by all means, and specially
by quarreling and questioning the by-past work of
grace in him, had laboured to weaken and overturn his
faith for by-gones, and for the present also, lest it should
convalesce and grow stronger for time to come; now
(I say) let the afflicted after victory return to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
and to the examination of his state in grace, of his
faith in Christ and of his regeneration, and he shall
see all the begun saving graces which were darkened
by temptations clearly appear, and shall perceive the
several steps and degrees of Gods grace toward him in
former times, more evidently then he could discern them
in the hour of darknesse and temptation. And so he shall
return from this battel strongerin faith then he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and more perswaded of the work of the holy Spirit
in him, then he was before the temptation.</p>

               <head type="sub">Wherein is solved the doubt of the true converts conversion,
arising from his breach of the covenant of Grace, as he
conceiveth.</head>
               <p>THere are some sincere converts, who, albeit they do
not doubt but penitents, flying to Christ, are receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in favour with God, are justified from their sins, and
do obtain right unto all the priviledges of the Saints;
yet, they doubt whether every sincere convert shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the covenant of Grace, if possibly they have
so far abused grace, as to defile themselves again with
the pollutions which they seemed to repent of before.
And this erroneous opinion of the instability of the
covenant of grace, they do apply to themselves; for,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40880:182"/>
when they have found by experience, the power of sin,
as it were not only rageing, but in appearance reigning
in them, as the conscience of their relapsing in their old
sins beareth witnesse. And when they know their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
so corrupt and ready to sin yet more, they doubt if
this condition can stand with being in the covenant of
Grace; and whatsoever they have found of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this covenant, they now fear that they be fallen
from grace, because they have, as they conceive, broken
the covenant of Grace on their part, therefore they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
also, that God in justice, being provoked oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by them, hath now at last dissolved the covenant
of Grace on his part: for (say they) it is no reason
that God should be tyed unto them in covenant, who
so many wayes have violated that covenant; but as
<hi>Adam,</hi> by sinning, excluded himself from all benefit of
the covenant of Works, So is it reason, that every one
who have violated the covenant of Grace as I have
done, should be excluded from the covenant of Grace.
And here the afflicted doth stand as a miserable man,
uncertain what to do: in which condition, horrible
temptations and heavy suspicions of their state do arise,
namely, that they are in the condition and case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Esau</hi> was, who when he had sold his birth-right for
a messe of pottage, found no place for repentance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he sought the blessing with tears. Now what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be in the conscience of the afflicted in this
case, it is easie (for them who at any time have felt the
wrath of God) to conjecture. And this doubt doth
vex the man most, who is conscious of his often abuse
of the grace of God: for, what shall I do, saith he?
shall I defile my self and go and wash, and again defile
my self and go and wash, and by this means augment
my own guiltinesse from day to day? what is, if this
be not, to abuse the grace of God?</p>
               <p>2. That this evil may be removed, we must confesse
that there are many, who after some remorse for some
sins, raised by a natural and unrenewed conscience, do
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40880:182"/>
weep now and then (as <hi>Saul</hi> did for his injust persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>David</hi>) and do think, that by their tears they
have washen away their sin, and attained to some sort
of quietnesse in their conscience for a time, who yet do
not cease from their wickednesse, but remain in their
natural state strangers from God and Christ. We must
also acknowledge, that some of the regenerat in their
carnal security, falling back in their old sins, ordinarily
are sharply chastised by God; and indeed no wonder
is, that such as have once attained to peace with God,
do meet with broken bones, after they have abused the
grace of God, in giving way to their sinfull lusts, which
was the case of <hi>David, Ps.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>3. As for those who fall in open grosse scandalous
sins which defile the whole man, soul and body both,
it is safest for them (whether they were before that time
converted or not) to let alone long disputation, whether
they were regenerat or not before their fearfull fall, and
to stir up themselves to a deep search of the wickednesse
of their nature, that they may be humbled before God,
and in the sense of their in-born sin and grosse actual
out-breakings, flye unto Christ for pardon and grace to
bring forth better fruits then they have done.</p>
               <p>4. As for these who have not fallen in grievous open
transgressions, but in their wrestling against sin, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the victory they would, or hoped to have, do find
themselves polluted in their spirits, and put to the worse
in their conflict against their sinfull lusts and passions,
and that very frequently; and thereupon they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
that either they were never in the state of grace,
or if they were in it, that they have abused and broken
the covenant of grace; To these we answer, that every
transgression of the commands, albeit it be a violation
of the covenant of works, yet is not a dissolution of the
covenant of grace: for, it is one thing to fail in a duty,
which the covenanted party should have done; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to break or dissolve the covenant of grace;
for, it is provided in the covenant of grace as a special
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40880:183"/>
article, that God will forgive the sin of his confederat
people, when they confesse their faults, and sue for
pardon according to the promise of mercy to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 31, 32: and lest any humble sinner should
be discouraged and not receive this solution of his
doubt, let him consider the words of the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi>
6. 1. expresly set down for their comfort, who, having
resolved to live holily, justly and temperatly, are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in an offence, and are not purposed to abuse mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or turn the grace of God into lasciviousnesse; and,
1 <hi>Iob. 2. 1. These things I write unto you</hi> (to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in Christ, carefull to live holily) <hi>that ye sin not;
but if any man sin, we have an advocat with the father,
Iesus Christ the just one.</hi> And this article of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
for granting daily remission according to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the Saints, maketh the covenant of grace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,
and to be daily made use of, as we are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Lords prayer. And in this doth the covenant
of grace differ from the covenant of works, which by
any one sin is so violat, as the curse doth follow, till
the sinner run in to the covenant of grace in Jesus
Christ: And by this doctrine a door is not opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sinning, but the door only is closed to keep in the true
convert from desperation, and running away from
Christ, and to help him out of the mire of discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein he is fallen, lest he sink in it and despair.
Neither is the study of holinesse hindered by this way,
or the diligence of the convert slakened in the duties of
new obedience and pleasing of God, but only servile
fear in the maner of serving God, is taken away, and
the obligation of love to God (who is found to be so
mercifull) is more strictly tyed upon us: which love
(as it is augmented daily by new confirmations of faith,
and fresh experiences of his grace to us) doth cast out
servile fear, as the Apostle teacheth, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>As for the afflicted convert, his fear that he be like <hi>Saul,</hi>
who though he felt remorse and shame, when all the
beholders in his army saw him so confounded by <hi>Davids</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:40880:183"/>
loyall carriage toward him, yet did he not repent this
sin at all, nor amend his life at all; there is no ground
to suspect himself to be like unto him, or to <hi>Esau</hi> who
was solicitous only for an earthly blessing; and when
he could not have the first place in his fathers blessing,
contented himself with what portion in the earth he
could have beside. Therefore let the afflicted labour
to understand well the nature of the covenant of grace
and the several articles thereof; and let him consider,
that there is no advantage to be had by excluding of
himself from that covenant, but that if he will be saved,
in every condition he must draw near to Christ, and
lay hold on him for remission of sin, and fresh furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of grace for every duty: for, <hi>it is good alwayes to
draw near to him, because he will destroy all them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
far from him,</hi> Ps. 73. 27.</p>

of God. And for the same reason, do forbear under
this exercise to apply unto themselves the precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
made to the faithfull servants of God in the
Scripture. What am I (saith the afflicted) that I should
presume to intrude my self in the number of the Saints?
what am I, that I should apply to my self what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to true converts and sincere servants of God?
Were I such a one as this person, or that person is, I
might then, for my consolation, apply promises made
unto such Saints; but now I cannot apply their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
except for conviction of my conscience, that
I am justly for my unlikenesse unto them, secluded from
the promises made unto them, and those that are like
unto them.</p>
               <p>2. For lousing of this doubt, we must acknowledge,
that the comparison of our selves with the rule of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
holden forth in the Scripture, is to be aimed at
by all; and the comparison of our selves with the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
servants of God, who have attained a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of growth in holinesse, is very profitable if it be
prudently managed: For, the first comparison teacheth
us what we should endeavour to attain, and the other
teacheth us what may be by the grace of God attained
unto even in this life.</p>
               <p>Again, both these comparisons do serve to humble
us before God, when we perceive our selves not only
short of perfection, which cannot be fully attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
in this life, but also short of these degrees which may
be attained, and have been attained by others in this
life, we cannot choose but think the more meanly of
our selves, and put down the sailes of self-estimation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:40880:184"/>
Thirdly, this sort of comparison is profitable to make
us more uprightly renounce all confidence in our own
inherent righteousnesse, and flye for refuge to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of Christ obedience and satisfaction imputed
unto all that believe in him, according as the example
of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> who renounced all confidence in his
priviledges, performances, sufferings and inherent
righteousnesse, counting <hi>them all but dung, that he
might win Christ and be found in him, not having his own
righteousnesse which is of the law, but that which is through
the faith of Christ; the righteousnesse which is of God by
faith,</hi> Phil. 3. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>3. But this sort of comparison is dangerous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
when it tendeth to discouragment, when it mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us think little of the measure of Gods grace granted
unto us, when it makes us heartlesse in the course of
obedience, and hopelesse that we shall attain unto the
measure whereunto the Saints have attained.</p>
               <p>4. Wherefore let the afflicted strengthen the thing
which remaineth and is ready to die, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. let
him beware lest he quench the smoaking flax, or break
the bruised reed, wherein he hath Christs help to look
unto, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 3. Again, let the afflicted consider, that
there are divers degrees of saving faith, divers degrees
of the measure of sanctification and growth in grace;
for, some are old men, some young, and strong men,
and some babes in Christ, and that the same duties in
the same measure, are not to be expected from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and weak beginner, which are required of the strong
and experimented souldier. 3. Let the afflicted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that nothing is given, nor promised, nor
done unto the Saints in Scripture or in latter ages for
any merit or worthinesse in them, but altogether of
free grace: and so much the more should this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
as this doubting of the afflicted, arising from
comparison of his condition with the measure of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in others, doth presuppone the contrary, as if
God did deal with his children according to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40880:185"/>
of their persons and merit of their good works,
which is a false supposition; for, why doth the afflicted
cast down his courage and weaken his faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in God, but for this very cause, that he count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himself a much more unworthy man, and of lesse
merit before God then those Saints were, or are, with
whom he hath compared himself? 4. Let the afflicted
by so much as he doth preceive himself more unworthy,
and more sinfull then those Saints with whom he hath
compared himself, thrust himself the more into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of rich grace; let him so much the more lay hold on
the imputation of Christs righteousnesse, and cover his
nakednesse therewith, and employ Christ by faith so
much the more, that out of his fulnesse he may receive
grace for grace, and be made able by his Spirit to bring
forth more abundant fruits, and come up nearer unto
conformity with Christ, and the examples of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Saints. 5. Let the afflicted consider, that we must
live by rules set down in Scripture, aiming sincerely
at obedience of holy precepts, albeit we have not yet
come up unto the practice of the rule in that measure,
which others have attained unto.</p>

in an evil condition.</head>
               <p>EXperience teacheth, that sundry true converts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they, feeling themselves oft-times in an ill
condition, do call in question their being in the
blessed state of grace, not considering, that the condition
of a man, whether in the state of nature unrenewed,
or in the state of grace, may be comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in better or worse condition, and yet his state remain
the same. The multitude of the misbelieving Hebrews,
were in an evil condition, at the one side of the red
Sea, when they repented their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:40880:185"/>
but in a better condition when they did sing praises un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God on the other side of the Sea, and yet for their
state, some were, yea most part, still in nature unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed:
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were in an evil condition
when their passion offended God at the smiteing of the
rock; but when they did interceed with God for the
people, when wrath was kindled against the host, they
were in a better condition: and both in the one time
and in the other they were in the state of grace, true
Saints in Gods estimation. This mistake of the weak
in faith, not putting difference between their present
disposition and their state, maketh them judge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be in the state of grace when their condition is
good, and to be in the state of nature unrenewed when
they feel themselves in an evil condition: when they
observe their heart inlarged to run the way of Gods
commandments, then they esteem themselves truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat,
and when they feel themselves sluggish in the
work of the Lord, dull in hearing the Word, flow to
believe what the Scripture speaketh, when they esteem
their ordinary service to be after a form of godlinesse,
without affection and power, and what service they
do, to proceed from fear of wrath, rather then from
the new and right principles of a regenerat man, then
they question all the works of grace in themselves.
What shall I think, saith the afflicted, concerning my
state in grace, when I find my condition so frequently
not only short of what it should be, but also polluted
with divers sorts of sins?</p>
               <p>2. For answer, we must grant, that the externall
duties of religion, may be discharged from fleshly and
corrupt principles; for, many do perform commanded
external duties, that they may eshew the reproach of
impiety, or that they may insinuat themselves in the
good estimation and favour of the godly, or for some
base earthly ends for which gross hypocrits do whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they do in religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:40880:186"/>
Like unto these are all self-deceiving hypocrits, who
go about to establish their own righteousnesse, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
that righteousnesse which is of God by faith, as
if God could be obliged to take their performance for a
full, satisfaction for their former sins, and would look
upon their works as meritorious of eternal life; and
therefore because men may deceive themselves, 1. the
afflicted shall do well to examine himself whether he
hath renounced all confidence in the flesh, or his own
works, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. and fled unto Christ for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
with some measure of honest endeavouring
to worship and serve God in his spirit; which if his
conscience can witnesse unto him to be his way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he is walking, then may he be assured that he is a
true convert. 2. And albeit it be true that the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the regenerat man do many times obscure his
state in grace, yet can they not extinguish the sponk of
regeneration begun in him, or prove the work of grace
in him not to be at all. 3. We grant that the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a true convert at sometimes may be so bad by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of sinfull distemper and fleshly carriage, that many
unrenewed mens conversation shall be found far more
commendable, then the present condition and carriage
of the renewed man in his sinfull condition: In which
case neither God nor his own conscience, nor any that
feareth God can speak any thing but wrath to him, till
he repent and turn to God for mercy in Christ; yet the
afflicted penitent convert, lamenting his bad condition,
is in better case then any unrenewed man can be into:
for, the very grief and perplexity which he findeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his condition is so oft ill and sinfull, proveth his
good affection toward God, and his earnest desire to
walk before God unto all well-pleasing, in all things
and at all times.</p>
               <p>3. But if the afflicted shall insist and object, that
the fear of Gods wrath and judgments, ordinarily is a
main motive which setteth him on to do the duties and
service which God requireth of him, and not the love
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40880:186"/>
of God, the felt in-lake whereof, doth make him go on
halting and heavy in the wayes of God. We answer,
that albeit the fear of Gods wrath and judgments look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon alone, doth not prove regeneration, yet it may
well consist with regeneration: because God doth not
for nought joyn with his precepts, fearfull threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of judgments against those who shall transgresse his
commands, that they may be as a spur in his childrens
sides to presse them to their duties, and as a bridle to
curb and check their vitious inclination unto sin, which
lodgeth in all men by nature. And this motive is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the experience of the Prophet, <hi>Ps, 119. 120.
My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy
judgments.</hi> 2. It may be that the afflicted, lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
unto God, be not free as yet from the spirit of
bondage, but be keeped in some measure under the
bonds of servile fear, God so disposing, for the humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
exercising and training of his child lately entered
in his holy warfare; in which condition his fear is
commendable, when it ariseth from the conscience of
his sinfull short-coming in Gods service, and of the
prevailing of his corruption against the begun work of
renovation. Wherefore, let the afflicted go about the
discharge of commanded duties in his christian calling,
and particular station wherein God hath placed him,
in what condition soever he shall find himself. 2. Let
him compare his present condition, which he doth
count an ill condition, with the by-gone better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whereof he hath had possibly experience frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and when he calleth to mind the comforts he hath
had, and the inlargement of heart to run in the way of
Gods commandment, in hope of a change of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition to the better, in hope of finding renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
blinks of the Lords countenance, let him humbly
wait on God in the use of the means appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till the
day-star arise in his heart, praying with the Psalmist,
that God would quicken him according to his loving
kindnesse. 3. Let him cleave the more closely to the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40880:187"/>
covenant of grace and the righteousnesse which is by
faith in Jesus Christ, withall giving thanks unto God
for the grace bestowed on him, for the giving unto
him eye-salve to see his blindnesse, nakednesse and
misery, and for making sin odious and grievous unto
him in any measure, and for drawing him to Christ to
be his refuge in his worst condition.</p>

and have their conversation blamelesse and without

                     </gap>ce
sweet water and bitter?</hi> &amp;c. unto the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This doubt the afflicted wrestles with, and saith
with himself, what shall I think of my self, whose heart
is so polluted, that it casteth forth continually dirt and
mire? how shall I reckon my self among the Saints?
how shall I incrude my self among the justified, who
find so little evidence of the work of sanctification in
me? For, faith should purifie the heart from this pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
whereof I do justly complain.</p>
               <p>2. For solving of this doubt, many things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
spoken which serve for the curing of this case, and
comforting the afflicted in this condition; but because
one and the same doubt, doth diversely present it self
now in one shape, then in another, and doth vex the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:40880:187"/>
afflicted in sundry wayes, we shall answer this doubt
proposed as it is set down.</p>
               <p>First therefore, let the afflicted examine himself whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he may with some measure of honesty say with the
Psalmist, <hi>Ps.</hi> 66. 18. I do not regard iniquity-in my
heart. I do not so delight in sin, but that sin is still my
affliction and my daily grief. Secondly, let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
himself, whether the power of corruption doth
break forth in words and deeds or not, or if it do burst
out in some passionat fits, whether he doth open the
sluce and give it way, or whether he sets himself to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the out-breaking of sin, and is humbled for what
doth break forth. Thirdly, let him examine whether
he flyeth to Christ to wash him, and help him against
the power of sin, or not. If after examination he can
in any measure of honesty joyn with the Apostle in his
lamentation, and recourse unto Christ for delivery,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, 25. he may be assured, he is in the state of
grace: For, there is a vast difference between a mans
being sold unto sin by his native corruption captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him, and a mans setting of himself unto sin, as a
voluntary servant of sin; for, a renewed man may be
in sundry cases a captive to sin, and is a fighter against
sin; But a man selling himself to sin, is a slave volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
suffering sin to reign in his mortall body.</p>
               <p>Let the afflicted therefore comfort himself, because
in him there is a perpetual conflict between the flesh
and the spirit, between his native inclination to sin, and
the new creature, or inclination to holinesse. Neither
let him by mis-understood Scripture formerly cited, vex
himself; for, his faith is indeed upon the work, and
the way of purifying his heart; first, because he doth
flye to the bloud of Christ, which cleanseth him from
all sin, in respect of remission granted. Secondly, there
is a constant endeavour to be more and more holy, and
to draw vertue by faith from Christ to bring forth good
fruits, well-pleasing unto God. Thirdly, he is about
to mortifie his lusts by the Spirit of Christ, and to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40880:188"/>
purge out the leaven of all filthinesse of flesh and spirit,
albeit he cannot purge it out all at once, or wholly in
in this life. And fourthly, because albeit his doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his estate in grace be not allowable, yet it doth
bear witnesse that the remainder of pollution in him is
his grief, affliction and vexation. So also that other
Scripture, <hi>Iames,</hi> 3. 11. which faith, that out of the
same fountain proceedeth not salt water and sweet, is
not to be understood so as if no rotten speech could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
proceed out of the mouth of a regenerat man at
any time; for <hi>Iames</hi> doth witnesse, that in many things
we sin all, in thought, word and deed: But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that he that bridleth not his tongue, his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is vain, and nothing but a presumptuous boasting
of that wich is not reall and in truth, and that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with regeneration, that out of a mans mouth,
pretending to blesse God, cursing of men who are made
after the similitude of God, should flow forth as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
flow forth from a running fountain without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolment.</p>

               <head type="sub">Shewing how to quench the fiery darts of Sathan, and resist
his sinfull suggestions whether of shorter endurance or of
longer continuance.</head>
               <p>SOmetime on a sudain Sathan casteth a fiery dart of
tentation unto some sin, as his messenger seeking to
prepare the lodging for him: which tentation he doth
so furiously presse, as if he would not be refused, or
could not be resisted; and possibly may so bear-in his
tentation, as the convert may be afraid that Sathan
shall prevail, finding himself, as it were, over-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered
and unable to bear out in such a case, as the
Apostle had experience of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 7, 8, 9. who found
himself, as it were, buffeted and abused by the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of Sathan, and unable of himself to resist him.
The remedy whereof is, that the afflicted with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40880:188"/>
be humbled in himself, in the sense of his in-born
sinfulnesse and inability to overcome tentations. 2.
That he flye to Christ the captain of militant souldiers,
and do pray unto him instantly to help to bear out in
the conflict, and to be rid of the Tempter. 3. Let
him hold fast the faith of promised grace, and wrestle
on so long as it shall please God to exercise him so.</p>
               <p>With such a tentation <hi>Iob</hi> also was exercised, which
so far prevailed as to make carnall and corrupt nature
speak for it. The tentation was very fearfull, and no
lesse then self-murther, <hi>Iob, 7. 13, 14, 15. When I say
my couch shall ease my complaint, then thou scarrest me with
dreams, and terrifiest me with night-visions, so that my
soul chooseth strangling and death rather then life.</hi> The
remedy whereof is, with <hi>Iob</hi> to flye to the Redeemer,
and fix faith upon him, and to present the tentation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God by prayer and humble lamentation, striving
against the suggestion, and never to give over relying
on God, as he did.</p>
               <p>2. Sometime Sathan when he cannot find instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to charge the convert with hypocrisie, and a
course of wickednesse, as he found in <hi>Iobs</hi> tryall, by
his uncharitable friends, he useth immediately to fall a
railing against the whole course of the work of grace
in the convert, and charge him falsely with deep
guiltinesse, as calumniators use to do in their furious
flyting and slandering of such as they hate, hoping
how false and groundlesse soever the calumnies be, that
yet something shall prove likely and probable, and so
fasten something upon the innocent. In which case,
let the afflicted lift up his mind to the Lord, and pray
him to rebuke Sathan. 2. Let him humble himself in
acknowledgment of his natural corruption, and having
fled to Christ for righteousnesse, let him take the shield
of faith for quenching that dart. 3. Let him as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
contemn these devilish slanders of Sathan, and
set his mind on some better employment then to dispute
with so impudent and restless an adversary; for we have
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:40880:189"/>
other businesse to go about, then to take notice of the
dogs barking at us: but if it please God to continue
that exercise from day to day, let the afflicted in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
submit himself to God, and direct his speech and
thoughts unto God only, not answering directly such
a <hi>Shimei</hi> at all. It is not safe to direct our speech to
Sathan at all, but let us say to God, the Lord rebuke
Sathan.</p>
               <p>3. Sometime Sathan falleth on with suggestions,
blasphemous against God and all the grounds of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and fathers all these blasphemies on the afflicted
as his proper sins. In which case, let the afflicted be
humbled before God, because of original sin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Sathan maketh use, as of something of his own in
us. 2. Let him renew the grips of faith on Christ the
Mediatour in whom the fulnesse of the Godhead dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
reconciling the elect world to himself, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
their sins unto them. 3. Let not the afflicted
look upon these blasphemies otherwayes then as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
malice against God, for so they are indeed, and
not the sins of the poor soul vexed with such suggestions.
4. Let the afflicted beware of discouragments, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
or weakening of his faith in God, of impatiency
and fretting under this sad exercise: for, there is more
cause of fear from Sathans second subtile tentations then
from his grosse suggestions, whereby at the back of the
former grosse blasphemies, he goeth about to draw the
afflicted to the suspicion of the former work of grace in
him, and of Gods love unto him. His wiles in this
case are much more dangerous then his violence in his
furious lyon-like assaults: for he may more easily get
the consent of the afflicted to some sits of misbelief and
impatience or some other sins, then to admit or consent
unto any of these grosse blasphemies suggested.</p>
               <p>4. Sometime when the young and tender convert, is
reading or hearing in Sermon, the sad sentences of God
against such and such sins, which do reign in the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Sathan flyeth on him with a false application, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40880:189"/>
                  <hi>thou art the man,</hi> and doth not a little disquiet the
weak in faith. In which case, let the afflicted consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that whatsoever is spoken in or from Scripture
of the maledictions of the law, are spoken against them
that are under the curse of the law and covenant of
works, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8. who have not repented their sins,
nor fled to Christ, nor are aiming at reformation of life
and sanctification, but these curses are not spoken against
the righteous, that is to say, against such as in the sense
of their sinfulnesse do loath themselves and are fled to
Christ for refuge, and have taken on his yoke upon
them, already justified, and begun to be sanctified.</p>
               <p>5. Sometime Sathan doth abuse the Scripture and
put a wrong sense upon it, that thereby he may wound
these that are weak in the faith: For example, it is
written, <hi>Rom. 14. 23. whosoever doubteth, is damned if
he eat.</hi> But thou (saith Sathan to the young and weak
convert) hast done many things whereof thou didst
doubt whether they were lawfull or not, yea thou hast
eaten the Supper of the Lord with doubting: therefore
thou art damned. Again it is written, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 29.
He that eateth</hi> the sacramental bread of the Lord, <hi>or dink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
of the cup of the Lord <hi>unworthily, eateth and drinketh
his own condemnation:</hi> but thou, saith Sathan hast eaten
the bread and drunken the cup of the Lord unworthily,
for thou knowest thou art very unworthy: therefore
thou hast eaten and drunken thy own condemnation.
In this case and such other like, let the afflicted convert
inquire of the Pastor, or some faithfull Christian better
acquaint with Scripture, concerning the sense of the
words of Scripture, which seem to make against him,
that the words being well understood, the doubt may
be dissolved. As for example, these foresaid abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Scriptures, do only declare the sentence of the law
against him that doth what he doubteth to be lawfull,
but doth not exclude him from mercy upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of his sin, and flying to the mercy offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Christ Jesus. And by eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40880:190"/>
we must not understand that every one, who
finding himself unworthy, flyeth to the grace offered
and sealed in the Supper of the Lord, eateth unworthily,
for, so no man should eat worthily, for all worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,
in the sense of their unworthinesse, must
and do flye to free grace offered in Christ; but the
meaning is, that these do eat and drink unworthily,
who profane the Sacrament, and put no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
this holy banquet of the Lord, and a common
supper; yea and even this sin of not discerning the
Lords Body, doth not exclude the man from mercy:
for, the Apostle, for remedy of this sin, exhorteth these
who are guilty to judge themselves, that so they may
not be judged by God, who pardoneth the penitent,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. And so let the afflicted, for strengthening
of his faith, know, that every Scripture which speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
against sin, doth drive the guilty man unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and faith in Christ, without whose grace, sought
after and embraced, there is no salvation.</p>
               <p>6. Sometime Sathan, the adversary of all converts, doth
assault the faith of Gods children, when he findeth
them under some present guiltinesse lately contracted, or
under tryall of their faith, as under desertion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolation,
or some miserable condition, whereof he
taketh advantage to suggest to the child of God, that
his faith is but phantasie, that God neither loveth him,
nor can love the like of him. In which case, let the
afflicted humble himself before God, and flye to him
in Christ offering reconciliation; let him, 1. resolve
firmly to adhere to the covenant of grace offered to self-condemned
sinners through Christ. 2. Let him observe
his present condition to be the day of his visitation, tryal
and probation what use he will make of Christ in his
difficulties and straits. 3. Let him in the use of Gods
worship wait for the day-star of divine consolation
promised to those that wait on the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 10.
11, and <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 3. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 31. And last of all (lest
we insist too long in reckoning the innumerable wiles
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40880:190"/>
of the crafty serpent) let every convert consider, that
there is no time while we dwell in the tabernacle of this
body of death, wherein we may be secure from Sathans
insinuations and crafty suggestions, or his more disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and open assaults; that there is no businesse we
can go about wherein this crafty hunter shall not dig
a pit or lay a snare to intrap us, no affliction nor diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
wherein he shall not study to keep us back from
making Christ our refuge, our helper and deliverer:
and that therefore we must take heed to obey the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Apostle, <hi>Ephes. 6. 10, 11, 12, 13. Finally, my
brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might;
put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil,</hi> and so forth to the end of
the Chapter.</p>

               <head type="sub">Wherein are some mixed cases spoken of, whereunto the true

               <p>THere are, beside the cases whereof we have given
some examples and instances, other cases also, which
we may call <hi>mixed cases,</hi> the causes whereof are partly
natural, partly spirituall, wherein the true convert may
be afflicted with both bodily and spirituall distempers;
melancholious humors abounding in the body, and
Sathan, busie to stir himself in these distempers to the
weakning the faith of the convert, may take advantage
to vex the child of God.</p>
               <p>2. These bodily distempers are common both to the
unrenewed and to the regenerat: for, God hath not
exeemed his children from diseases of the body; for,
<hi>the righteous and the wise, and their works, are in the hand
of God; no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that
is before him: all things come alike to all, there is one event,</hi>
(or accident which may befall) <hi>to the righteous and to
the wicked, to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:40880:191"/>
to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; as is
the good, so is the sinner, and he that sweareth, as he that
feareth an oath,</hi> Eccles. 9. 1, 2. <hi>Saul</hi> the King of <hi>Israel</hi>
in his melancholious fit, may (by the instigation of an
unclean spirit, changing himself into an angel of light)
fall on prophesieing in the midst of his house, while he
is about to murther <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam: 18. 10. and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
hath shewed, that some lying in grosse sins, who
while they were themselves and in their wits, were
found very rude and ignorant in maters of religion and
things divine; but sometimes sudainly falling in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholious
ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asie and rapture, they could rehearse a
number of passages of Scripture, and seemed to pray,
and to bring a number of arguments in their praying,
as if they had been wrestling with God for mercy, of
which Scriptures or words of prayer, they had neither
sense nor memory, when they came to themselves, after
the melancholious extasie was over, which sit lasted
sometimes an hour, sometimes two or thereby; all
which time they neither did hear nor see the wittnesses
sitting by, and beholding the spectacle. On the other
hand, experience hath shewed how far Sathan may
abuse and hath abused the phantasie of some holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in the height of sharp feavers and frensies; and
what speeches against God and their own souls, by his
instigation they have uttered. We have an example
in <hi>Iob,</hi> who in his hot feaver and painfull boils, like a
man distracted, cryed out, that God was turned an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to him, that he did shoot all his arrows against him,
whereupon in his distemper he cryed for death, and
cursed the day of his birth most bitterly. Of which
expressions when he is challenged by his uncharitable
friends, and judged to be nothing but a wicked hypocrit,
he excuseth himself, that when he spoke these words he
was not himself, but in a roving distemper, <hi>Iob. 6. 26.
Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that
is desperat, which are as wind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But our purpose here is not to discourse of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40880:191"/>
in general, nor what may befall in common
to the godly and the wicked in melancholious fits: for
this doth require a larger Treatise, and the concurrence
both of Physicians and Divines. We purpose only
to speak to what the true convert is obnoxious unto;
and when we speak of mixed cases, wherein both the
distemper of the body and brain do concur with the
temptation of Sathan, we do not take notice of any
light distemper of body and mind, which suddainly
cometh and is soon removed, or which the privat dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the child of God, in the use of the means may,
and useth to overcome. Neither do we meddle
with phrensies and madnesse, which so bereaveth the
man of the use of common reason, that he cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
or make use of wholsome advice and counsell
from the Scripture, or rightly conceive truth when it
is told unto him (for in such a case the Physician only is
to be called to deal with the diseased, not excluding the
prayer of the Pastor and Christian friends for him)
But we are to speak concerning more moderat distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
wherein the afflicted may lay forth his tentations,
and propound the reasons which seem to fortifie his
doubts and to dispute of them &amp; receive reasonable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to his objections, as they are offered unto him. And
in a word, such a condition of the mans mind as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him ready to hear and follow the advice, both of
the Physician and the Pastor, as his need requireth.
Now it is not our, that the imagination of these who are
of this midle sort of distemper, doth ordinarily fain to
its self sad and terrible things, and being fired with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholious
humours and tentations of Sathan mixed
therewith, useth to represent to its self Gods hot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
death, condemnation and hell, as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes; so that it is no wonder, that for the
the time they doubt whether they can possibly be in the
state of grace. But in special, this seemeth most heavy
unto them, that their conscience in the mean time doth
write bitter things against them, and double upon them,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40880:192"/>
the deserved sentence of condemnation, casting up the
particular sins (possibly repented of, and pardoned)
as meriting rejection from God. And here mainly is
the stick.</p>
               <p>2. In discerning and curing such cases, there is great
need of wise circumspection: For, first, information
must be had of the afflicted's condition so far as his
friends and familiars can furnish. 2. The cure of his
wound must be tenderly gone about, as the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian
useth to do, when he is to deal with the aple of
a mans eye. 3. Whatsoever seem at the first, it shall
be safest for the comforter of the afflicted, not to speak
peremptorily of the mans state or condition, yea, nor
to judge within themselves determinatly about him.
4. But it shall be sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est to hear the afflicted patiently, to
lay out his own condition more or lesse confusedly, in
moe or fewer speeches, as he is able to expresse it. 5.
What is further to be searched after, by prudent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations,
let it be pumped up so far as conveniently
may be. 6. So soon as his condition is clear to the
Pastor, or friend who is about to help him, let the
speaker unto him, recollect in few words his condition
as he conceiveth it, and take up his doubt in a word
as shortly as may be, that the afflicted may perceive,
that his case is well taken up by the Pastor or Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
friend. For oft-times here is the cure marred,
when the afflicted conceiveth that his case is not
rightly apprehended, or what is spoken, is not
spoken to purpose. 7. Whatsoever his case seem to
be, Christian compassion must be shewed to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
and his affliction estimat no lesse then the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
conceiveth of it, but made possible for God to
cure it. For even our Lord in the resurrection of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
groaned in his spirit, in compassion toward the
mourning friends, before he gave them the full conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
And surely, compassion doth well become a
Physician: for, it is an addition to the affliction of the
afflicted, when the beholder cometh to him, to think
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:40880:192"/>
little of his pain. 8. Whether the afflicted seem to be
a convert or not, let him be exhorted by his present ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
to humble himself before God, and confesse his
original and actual sins to God, and flye to the grace
of reconciliation, and remission of sins and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
holden forth in the Gospel to every self-condemned
sinner, through Jesus Christ our Lord; for, Christ is
the end of the law for righteousnesse; when the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is burdened, and the rod is heavy, the curse of
the law, and the rod of correction do drive the man to
flye unto Christ and take his yoke upon him: And this
course is wholsome and safe whatsoever be the afflicted
mans estate, whether he be converted or not.</p>
               <p>5. And as for that speciall stratageme of Sathan,
whereby he beareth in the sentence of condemnation on
the afflicted, and fiteth his phantasie with the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ingemination, and inculcating of this fiery dart,
crying over and over again blasphemous words, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the afflicted with the sin thereof, and pronouncing
sentence against him, saying, thou art condemned, thou
art a reprobat, and such like; the afflicted man must
be informed, 1. that such peremptory sentences are not
from the Lords Spirit, speaking in the Scripture, but
from the false accuser of the brethren; for, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
not condemnation, but remission of sin to
every one that flyeth to Christ. 2. That he must put
difference betwixt Sathans part in the sinfull suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and his own part in rejecting of them, abhorring
them and grieving for them. 3. That he must put a
great difference between his imagination (or phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie)
and his conscience, between the voice sounding in
his phantasie, whether he will or not, and the sentence
of his well informed conscience approving, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowing
what is offered unto it to be chosen or refused<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
consented unto, or dis-assented from, by the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
judging according to the rule of Gods Word: for,
a sentence of words may be suggested to the phantasie,
repeated and obtruded upon the phantasie a thousand
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:40880:193"/>
times, which the conscience may and should refuse,
and reject a thousand times. We know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that a sentence of words may, by oft repeating in
the ears of a parret and other birds, take such an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on the phantasie of the bird, that it shall repeat
vocally the words one by one and pronounce them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
as if that sentence had been the work of its
own invention: So also we see, that by frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of any whistle or song, the phantasie of some
birds may be so beaten and informed, that they shall
chant the same song over and over again, and make it
as if it were its own. Now phantasie and imagination
being a thing common to man and beast, it is certain,
that the phantasie of a man, may be wrought upon,
and stamped with the like impression. And this much,
as experience teacheth us, doth befall men: for when a
certain song or toon is sung in our audience, and is often
repeated, our phantasie before we be aware, useth to
repeat and same song or toon, or quietly whisper the
notes and measure of the song or toon: And after our
judgment hath observed this work of the imagination,
we can hardly stay our imagination or phantasie, while
we are about other serious thoughts from its secret
sowthing of the measures and notes of the song: for,
phantasie will not be ruled by the laws of reason, more
then the outward sense of seeing can be hindered from
observation of what it seeth, whether pleasant or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant.
What wonder is it then, that Sathan who
hath great influence on mens imagination, doth make
so deep impression on it by continual iteration, that
the afflicted seems to himself to own those blasphemous
suggestions as his own thoughts, and as the voice of
his conscience, and yet they are indeed nothing but
Sathans whistling, and false sentences pressed on the
mans imagination? And put the case, that his delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
mind should take them for the justly deserved sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of the conscience, yet are they only the voice of
the conscience ill informed, not judging of the mater
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:40880:193"/>
according to the rule of Gods Word, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth not
impute Sathans suggestions to the soul afflicted by
them, and mourning for them. And so much for sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the doubts of the true convert concerning his
state in grace and regeneration.</p>

some examples of those cases
which concern his condition. In
which cases, albeit the state of the
convert, be not at the first brought in question, yet his
conscience may be deceived, and miscarry for a time
to his detriment. Of which cases that we may speak
the more clearly, some considerations must be premised
and taken along with us.</p>
               <p>1. A mans sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and his condition sometime are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a larger sense indifferently for the same thing,
as when we say that all the regenerat are in a blessed
state or good condition, and that all the unregenerat
are in a miserable state or in an evil condition: But
when we put difference betwixt these two in a more
strict sense, a mans state is that relation of his person
wherein he standeth either as a child in grace, or as a
child of wrath. In which sense every convert is said to
be in the state of grace: and every unregenerat person
is said to be in the state of wrath, judicially declared
such in Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:40880:194"/>
But the condition of a man is his present morall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in order to his exercising of vertue or vice, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or worse. In which sense the renewed man, or true
convert, is said to be in a good condition, when he is
going about the duties of religion and righteousnesse,
as becometh a renewed man; and said to be in an ill
condition when he is otherwayes disposed, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
for the present. And in this sense an unrenewed
man, is said to be in a better or worse condition for the
present, in comparison with other unrenewed men, or
with himself at another time. In which sense, <hi>Mark,</hi>
12. 34. Christ speaking to the Scribe who answered
him in all things discreetly, saith, <hi>thou art not far front
the kingdom of heaven.</hi> The condition for the present of
this Scribe, was better then his fellows, and better then
his own at another time, and yet his person was in the
state of wrath, because he was not entered in the state
of grace, or in the kingdom of heaven, howsoever he
was not far from it. In this more strict sense the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
state of the mans person is fixed so long as the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
sentence of the Judge (binding the unconverted to
the curse that is pronounced in the Law, or in the
Gospel lousing the converted from the curse) doth
stand.</p>
               <p>But the morall disposition and the condition of the
man, whether in the state of grace or nature, is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and changeable to the better or worse, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
with others, or himself at another time. Whence
it is, that one and the same person may be in a better or
worse condition, his state remaining the same, to wit,
good, if he be renewed, and evil if he be still in nature
unrenewed.</p>
               <p>2. But here we are about the condition of the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man only, which may be better at one time, and
worse at another time, as his disposition and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>age,
in order to the duties of religion and righteousnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out to be better or worse, according as his actions
and behaviour are more or lesse conform to the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:40880:195"/>
will of God, and as his conscience doth its duty
more or lesse commendably. Sometimes his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon good grounds speaketh good to him, while
he studieth to walk before God unto all well-pleasing,
and then he may say with the Psalmist, <hi>Ps. 26. 12. My
foot standeth in an even place, in the congregation will I
blesse the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this good condition we need not say much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is no present disease which calleth for cure
of this case. Only it is for the child of God in this case
necessary to observe dyet and exercise to maintain his
good condition, and to watch over his heart and wayes,
that he may continue and go on therein. All that we
have to deal with, is the ill condition of the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
when his conscience doth deceive him, or doth
not discharge its duty: for, in this case only remedy and
cure is called for.</p>
               <p>3. As that condition wherein the convert is best
pleased with himself, is not alwayes the best; So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is that condition wherewith he is worst pleased, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the worst: But that is the best condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the holy Spirit doth most bear down the power of
sin, and advance the work of sanctification of the man;
and that condition is the worst, wherein sin most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth.
And as the goodnesse of a mans condition, is
is not to be estimat by any eventual accident, but by
its own nature and proper effects. So the illnesse of a
mans condition, is not to be estimat by any eventual
accident, but by its own nature and proper effects, as
God in the Scripture giveth grounds of judgment of a
good or ill condition: for otherwayes, by the default
of the renewed man, the best condition may degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
in a very ill condition. As when a man doth abuse
divine consolations, and after receiving of the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
earnest of the inheritance, from the holy Spirit, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
carnally secure, and negligent in his duties, or
when after some grosse pollution of himself in body
or soul, having grieved the holy Spirit, he doth not
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:40880:195"/>
humble himself as became him, but by Sathans sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
of wicked thoughts against God and his former
work in him, doth fall in suspicion of all former graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
operations of the holy Spirit in him, and mis-cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all these former experiences; and in his tentation
esteemeth and nameth them, among Sathans delusions,
or else at least suspecteth and feareth they shall prove no
better then such. On the other hand, the worst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the renewed man, by the wisdom, mercy
and power of God may be turned to advantage in order
to Gods glory, and the renewed mans salvation, as
the experience of the Psalmist doth shew us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116,
3, 4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. An evil condition is so called, either, 1. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the evil which the convert not only feeleth real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but laments it seriously; or, 2. in respect of the
converts estimation only, who laments his good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
without cause; or, 3. in respect of a reall evil,
which the convert lamenteth not at all, but lyeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it securely. Of the first sort is the condition of the
convert when he seeth his own blindnesse, nakednesse
and misery, the hardnesse of his own heart and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse
of it, and doth flye for remedy thereof to
Christ the true Physician, to cover and cure all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.
This condition is evil only in respect of felt
evil, but in respect of the converts making the right
use of the discovery of these evils, and flying unto Christ
for relief therefrom; it is a good condition, because
the diseased convert carryeth himself well and wisely in
this exercise. Of the second sort is the converts condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when his faith is put to tryall by manifold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
and tentations, and he conceives himself to be
in a very evil condition: wherein he ought not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
himself, but to judge this condition to be a good
condition, according to the Apostles exhortation, <hi>Iam.
1. 2, 3. My brethren, count it all joy, when ye fall in divers
tentations, knowing that the tryall of your faith worketh
patience.</hi> Of the third sort is the condition of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:40880:196"/>
who when (for example) he feels himself
unapt and unable to pray, or praise or discharge
any duty heartily, doth not trouble himself with
this his ill case, but either layeth-by the doing of the
duty, or doth the work negligently and perfunctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and pleaseth himself in so doing for a time. This
condition is evil indeed, both in respect of his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
diseases, and of his sinfull slighting the duty of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
relief thereof.</p>
               <p>5. For rectifying the judgment of the conscience in
any or all of those conditions, first, let difference be
put between the <hi>sinfull diseases</hi> and distempers of our
spirit (which are evil indeed) and the discovery thereof
unto us, which is a benefit in it self, and a gift of eye-salve
bestowed by Christ upon us, and <hi>the right use</hi> of
that discovery by flying unto Christ, which is yet a
greater blessing, even the work of God drawing us
to the Saviour of souls the remedy of every evil. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
let difference be put between <hi>tentation,</hi> or try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of faith, and <hi>yielding</hi> to tentation under affliction.
The observation of tentation offered to make us depart
from the truth in tryal, is a matter of joy, but yielding
is a sin, and mater of sorrow indeed. Thirdly, let
difference be put between <hi>grief of mind,</hi> or heavinesse
in affliction, and <hi>anguish of conscience</hi> for sin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
For, a man may have a grieved mind, and a
quiet conscience at one time. Fourthly, let difference
be put between our <hi>sinfull sicknesse</hi> of indisposition to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
duties, for which we should be humbled, and
Gods <hi>dispensation</hi> for the time, partly chastiseing us with
a lesse and more sparing measure of ability for these
duties, and partly teaching us thereby to make better use
of Christs offices for pardon of sin, for helping and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our infirmities, then we have made. Fifthly, let
difference be put between <hi>Gods</hi> part and <hi>Sathans,</hi> the
<hi>worlds</hi> and <hi>corrupt natures</hi> part, and the part <hi>of the new
creature.</hi> Gods part is ever wise, holy, just and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
tending to bring his children unto a good and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:40880:196"/>
better condition; Sathan, the worlds and the flesh or
corrupt natures part, is to procure and hold on, and
make worse an evil condition; and the part of the new
creature, is variable, as it falls forth in the battel against
the flesh, which lusts against the spirit, and it against
the flesh, so that neither of them have the victory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
till the warfare be ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and grace be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with glory, for and through Jesus Christ our Lord:
These differences being observed the conscience may
discern between a good or evil condition so much the
better.</p>
               <p>6. One and the same convert may observe in himself,
if not all, yet the vicissitude of the most notable
changes of a spiritual condition, as may be seen in
some, especially of his Ministers, of whose exercises
he is to make use for the consolation of his afflicted
people; which Ministers may say with the Apostle,
2 <hi>Cor. 1. 6. Whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation
and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same
sufferings, which we also suffer; or, whether we be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
it is for your consolation and salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Sundry converts may be diversely disposed and
exercised about the same evil or spiritual disease: for
one, under the observation of his evil case, may wrestle
against it, and not call his own blessed state in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
another, under the same disease, may fall in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
and doubt, whether he who is in such a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may be a true convert or not, and his person in the
state of grace or not; yea one and the same convert, in
the beginning of his ill condition, while he first enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in conflict with his evil condition, may for a time
look upon himself as a true convert, notwithstanding
of his present ill condition; but afterward when he
findeth his evil condition to remain, and not likely to
be removed, he may fall in doubt about the <hi>state</hi> of his
person, whether he be a true convert or not. In which
case let him make use as is said in the former Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:40880:197"/>
8. The variety of changes of the conditions of the
true convert, ariseth from the variety of the causes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
As for example, 1. sometime in the warfare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the flesh and the spirit, the new creature prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
sometime corrupt nature: and both of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
sometime more, sometime lesse, whence vicissitude
of changes of condition cannot but follow. 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Sathans temptations, setting on in his assaults more
or lesse furiously, or more or lesse subtilly, do make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of conditions, as Sathan is more or lesse wisely
resisted. 3. Sometime the Lord hideth his countenance
from his child more or lesse, sometime in adversity,
sometime in outward prosperity, as his wisdom findeth
it meet for the welfare of his beloved children.</p>
               <p>9. Sometime the conscience doth discern an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and doth give forth a right sentence about it.
In which case, let use be made of the ordinar remedy
of sin and misery. As, 1. let the afflicted search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the causes which have procured his evil condition,
as the Lord after prayer shall furnish light. 2. <hi>Let</hi>
him acknowledge his sin and ill deserving, and the
Lords holy, wise and righteous dispensation. 3. Let
him grow in humiliation, and in diffidence of his own
wisdom, ability and righteousnesse. 4. Let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the exercise of his faith in Christ for pardon of
sin, for mortifying the roots of it, and for letting forth
his helping hand for ability to make him watch over
his own heart and wayes, and to bring forth good fruits.</p>
               <p>10. When the converts conscience faileth in right
judging of its own ill condition, 1, it either taketh an
ill condition to be good, (and in this case it is silent
and saith nothing, but lyeth secure and well pleased
without cause) or, 2. it judgeth a good condition to
be altogether bad, or at least not so good as it is indeed;
or, 3. it doth not distinguish a good or ill condition
simply, from a condition partly good and partly evil;
or, 4. it stands in doubt what to judge of the mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
being uncertain what to pronounce of it till light
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:40880:197"/>
dispell the mist and confusion wherein it lyeth for the
time. Let us instance some cases and examples in every
one of these four kinds.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II</head>
               <head type="sub">Wherein is handled, the case of such as are fallen from their
first love, and are well pleased in this case.
The first rank shall be of some cases, wherein the conscience
of the convert is deceived, by judging the mans evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to be good enough.</head>
               <p>IT cometh to passe sundry times, that the renewed man
seemeth both to himself and others also, to go on in
bringing forth external fruits of new obedience, when
in the mean time his love to Christ is much abated and
cooled toward him, in comparison of the fervency
which in his first conversion he had: whence it cometh
to passe, that his works in his calling are discharged
without that eye and affection toward Christ, which
sometime he carried toward him; for, in the beginning
of his conversion, when remission of sins, reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with God, and the blessed change made in his state
through Christ, was green and fresh in his present sense,
how dear Christ was unto him, cannot be expressed;
but this fervor oft-times doth cool, when his wonted
estimation of Christ is not entertained, as appeareth in
the Galatians, who at their conversion were carried with
such a measure of love toward Christ, that if it had
been possible, they would have plucked out their own
eyes and given them to the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> for Christs
cause, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 15. and yet this love did soon cool, both
toward Christ and the Apostle. It cometh to passe
also oft-times, that the renewed man, contenting himself
with the seal of the holy Spirit, and the consolation
which once he felt, resolveth to go on in the discharge of
Christian duties in his calling, and either doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this cooling of his love to Christ, or layeth it not
to heart, but pleaseth himself, in this condition, as suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:40880:198"/>
to carry a converted man to heaven. And so usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
three faults do concur in this sicknesse. The first is
a notable defection from aiming at the measure felt in
his first love at his conversion: for we speak not here
of daily distempers which the convert doth mark and
mourn for, and is about to have healed by bringing his
wounds unto Christ to be cured in the exercise of faith
and repentance daily. The second is the not observing
of this decay of love, or the mans ignorance of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to entertain communion with Christ in the sense of
his daily sins, wants and wounds; for the removing
and curing whereof, Christ is to be loved daily
no lesse then at the man his first conversion.</p>
               <p>The third is, the mans being well pleased with this
condition so long as his conversation is blamelesse,
whereof we have an instance in the condition of the
Ephesians, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. whose labour in the work of the
Lord, zeal against hypocrits, patience in troubles for
Christs cause is commended by Christ. But he reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them, first, because they had left their first love, and
did not only come short of the measure of their first
love, but did not lay to heart this sin, did not repent it,
or take course to have that measure recovered; <hi>thou hast
left,</hi> or laid down, <hi>thy first love,</hi> that is, 1. thou hast
remitted and come short of that measure of love which
formerly thou had. 2. Thou hast not been displeased
with thy self in this thy defection. 3. Thou hast laid
aside the care of recovering the measure of thy former
love. This condition is very dangerous, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in the experience of the Galatians, who falling from
their first love, did cast themselves open to superstitions
and errours, and in danger to be cut off from Christ,
by their defection from the faith of the Gospel once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
The reasons for which we say this defection in
love is dangerous, are three; the first is this, the greatest
measure of love to Christ and rejoycing in him is lesse
then his excellency and merit at our hands doth deserve.
If therefore we shall slide from our duty in aiming to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:40880:198"/>
hold up this measure of love to him, which we have
once attained and cease to grow therein, (because his
new mercies are daily letten forth upon us from day to
day) in effect, we judge our first love hath been too
too vehement, and so Christ is lightly esteemed of, as
if he were not still to be loved withall our mind, heart
and strength. The next reason is this, when love to
Christ, to his Ordinances and sanctified ones, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to relent and cool, incontinent the external exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of religion and righteousnesse begin to fall short
of this principle of love, and to go on more and more
slowly, and so peece and peece to decay: for, as when
a tree is smitten in the root, it may retain for a time
green leaves, but after a time it withers, and neither
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eareth ripe fruits nor leaves: So also in the exercise of
plety and righteousnesse, if love toward God our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and delection in his service and obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
be diminished, it may readily come to passe,
that the very outward works, yea and the profession of
duties due to Christ, be taken away also: and this is
the judgment wherewith Christ doth threaten <hi>Ephesus
I will come upon thee, and remove thy candlestick out of his
place, except thou repent,</hi> Rev. 2. 5. The third reason is,
because Christ, who is altogether lovely and love it
self, the very Son of the Fathers love, is a jealous God,
and cannot long indure not to be met with love from
them to whom he hath manifested his love. Therefore
he doth make hast to correct this slighting of his love,
and to manifest his wrath against these that lye still
well pleased with themselves under this condition, <hi>I will
come unto thee quickly</hi> (saith he) <hi>and remove thy candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,</hi>
Rev. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>2. That the conscience of the true convert, who is
lying in this condition, or is declining from his former
measure of love, may discharge its duty more easily and
solidly, it is needfull that the man, being convinced of his
fault, first consider, how reasonable it is that he should
return to his first love, or formerly felt measure of it:
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:40880:199"/>
for, the forgivenesse of his manifold sins, wherein he lay
before his conversion, for the translating of him from
darknesse to the glorious light of Christs Kingdom,
should never be forgotten; the proof which he hath
gotten by his conversion, that Christ hath loved him and
given himself for him, should be alwayes called to
minde with hearty affection; the great need of Christ
wherein he standeth for renewed pardon of sins, for
furnishing him with his Spirit to mortifie the deeds of
the flesh, and to bring forth more ripe and abundant
fruits of new obedience, should bind him to abide and
grow in his love. Secondly, let him consider how use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and profitable unto us, is fresh, green and growing
love unto him; for, love to him, makes us frequently to
think of him, frequently with delight to speak of him,
to seek after more and more near-communion with
him, to have our conversation with him in heaven,
where he sits at the right hand of the Father, and to live
in heaven, where our love is, more then where we so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ
in this world. Love makes us love what he
loveth, and hate what he hateth; love sharpens our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
after God in Christ, kindles and inlarges our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
toward him, as the beginning of the 63. <hi>Psalm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
doth make evident. And if the Lord shall seem to
with-draw himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> love makes the true convert follow

love to Christ, when the loving kindnesse of

more formidable then death, when Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were not grievous but the joy of his heart, when
Gods Word seasoned and sanctified his bitterest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
Fourthly, let him consider at what a losse he
is of many spiritual comforts, whereof he hath depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself, and in how many sins (of omission at least)
he hath fallen, since his declining from his first love, and
what miseries he hath drawn upon his own spirit at
least, if not also temporal chastisements joyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
and after comparison of his condition when his
love was servent, with his present condition since his fall
from his sometime-measure of love, let him humble
himself before Christ and flye in unto his rich grace, as
a true penitent, and let the fear of wrath, in case he set
not himself to recover what he hath lost, hold him up
to his duty; for, this is the remedy which Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

they toleart others to professe, teach and practise
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:40880:200"/>
what is false and dangerous, and pernicious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others. This fault may befall not only Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and Pastors, Parents and Masters of families,
Children and Servants, but also be found in all and
every one, who do defend or excuse such an ungodly and
dangerous toleration which may provoke God to wrath
and insnare many in a course of sin. The pretences, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
and deceits whereby men delude themselves in this
sin, are the same which the Patrons of loose and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
toleration of every error in religion do make
use of, to wit, that mens consciences must be free in the
mater of religion, and no wayes be urged to use all
means which may give them right information, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
their expression and practice which may infect,
pervert or insnare others among whom they live: for,
say they, Gods people must be a willing people, and
God only is Lord of the conscience: and a curbing
of mens profession and practice, serves not to make men
religious, but hypocrits also, and such like other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but no excuse of this sort can justly hinder any,
who is in any place of authority, or power, or relation,
to be active or concur to extinguish the incendiary fire
which may devour the house of God, and Kingdom
wherein they live: for, whosoever have power over
others, and do not put forth their power to curb and
represse those who lay a stumbling block before others,
do not only not impede the growing contagion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the body wherein they live, but also in effect
do countenance, protect and promove the spreading of
the contagion of error &amp; wickedness which they do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerat,
yea and private persons, who do not lament the sins
of such as do destroy themselves and infect others, and do
not mourn for the sins of them also who should represse
the contagion, do make themselves accessory to these

                  </gap>ledged, which we leave to those who have answered
the objections of ungodly toleration: but the truth is,
the fear of wordly inconveniences oft-times doth more
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:40880:200"/>
prevail for giving way to licentious toleration, then the
fear of sin and wrath of God doth prevail for discharge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was the sin of the Church of</hi> Pergamus, <hi>which
did not take order with, and represse the, seducers of the
Lords people and their followers within their jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
Rev. 2. 14, 15. I have a few things against thee, because
thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who
taught <hi>Balack</hi> to cast a stumbling block before the children
of <hi>Israel,</hi> to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of
the <hi>Nicolaitans;</hi> which thing I hate. <hi>This was the sin
which Christ did reprehend in the Church of</hi> Thyatira,
Rev. 2. 20. I have a few things against thee, because thou
sufferest that woman <hi>Jesabel,</hi> which calleth her self a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesse,
to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</p>
               <p>2. For remedy against this evil, 1. let us verse our selves
well in the Law of the Lord revealed in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that we may know well what are the duties which
God requireth of every man in his station, and what
vices he forbids, lest we mistake vertue for a vice, or vice
for a vertue. 2. Let us beware of rash censuring and
licentious carping at mens infirmities, as the Apostle
<hi>Iames</hi> giveth commandment; <hi>My brethren, be not many
Masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
for in many things we offend all.</hi> 3. Let us ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
contend for the faith which was once delivered
to the Saints, <hi>Iude, v.</hi> 3. lest seducers draw away the
Lords people from the truth of Christ. 4. Let every
one consider his station, place and power given to him,
and prudently go about the amending of other mens
faults and his own also: for otherwayes, a good duty
may be marred in a mans hand by imprudent manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof. 5. Let a man resolve to meet with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in curbing false doctrine and scandalous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and as a wise Wariour to behave himself so, as he
may obtain the promises which Christ hath promised
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:40880:201"/>
to the victorious, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. 26, 27. For, it is much
better to displease man for his good and others, then
to displease Christ, and make our selves partakers of
other mens sin and judgment, and the true convert will
easily make the choice.</p>

and cannot easily be condescended upon: for,
many defects and wicked motions of the heart, do usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concur with the neglect of duty, and commission
of actual sins, against the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ction of the conscience,
at least without the remorse of conscience and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
before this fearfull condition fix it self on a
man; and of this sinfull sicknesse, there are sundry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
The first is, when the worship of God and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of his precepts is performed perfunctoriously, as
when the confession of sin, is without sorrow for sin
or remorse of sin in particulars; when prayer is made
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:40880:201"/>
without earnest desire, to obtain the request; when
deprecation of wrath is made without fear of danger;
when intercession is made without sympathy and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
affection; when thanksgiving is offered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
estimation of the benefit received; when singing of
psalms is discharged without melody and harmony of
the heart, when conference of holy subjects is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
or discharged slightly, and without reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
when the hearing of the Word is without
attention of the mind; when the reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is followed without endeavour to profit thereby,
without observation of the will and providence of God
for edification; when the profession of religion is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
zeal and fruits suitable as occasion doth offer:
whosoever doth rest well pleased with himself in this
case, he is overtaken by this malady.</p>
               <p>The second degree is, when this evil goeth further
on, and doth defile the outward man: as when the
tongue is not bridled, the man doth not take heed
what he speaketh, but lets idle speeches, profane and
rotten communication fall out of his mouth, which do
not only not serve unto edification, but serve also to
corrupt the hearer. And he that pleases himself in
this case, declares his religion vain in so far, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 26.</p>
               <p>The third degree is, when this evil breaks forth in
grievous scandalous practices, as in the open professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some errour, in making or fomenting a schisme,
in contention, emulation, envy, drunkennesse, lacivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
fornication, or such like: for here, dead works
do openly appear, and the garment of Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is openly defiled. This seemeth to be the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many in the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> in whom, beside
the profession of christian Religion, little spiritual life
was to be found. And therefore Christ, the searcher
of hearts, calleth them dead or ready to die, <hi>Rev.
3. 1, 2. Thou hast a name that thou art living, but thou
art dead,</hi> or in a deadly condition tending to death cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to follow, if it be continued in, from which
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:40880:202"/>
condition our Lord doth except some, who had not
defiled their garments, but so carryed themselves as
their conversation was answerable to their holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<hi>ver.</hi> 4</p>
               <p>That this deadly sicknesse may be cured, 1. it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that the conscience of such a secure sinner, be
wakened both by others and by himself, and that by
setting his sins before his eyes, together with the merit
thereof, and the wrath of God kindled against him,
and destruction at hand if he do not speedily repent
him. 2. Heed must be taken of Sathans wiles, that the
wakened and convicted sinner despair not; for in this
case there is no small danger of it, when he who had
given his name to Christ, findeth himself to be in Sathans
camp and service, and wearing the badge of Sathan in
giving so publick scandal to the people of God. 3.
Whatsoever spunk of faith or hope, or repentance, or
desire of returning unto God, and setting himself against
all sin hereafter, is found iu such a person, must be
entertained and fostered, lest that little sponk be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
which is ready to dye. 4. Let him call to
mind the Word of God whereby he was first moved
to turn unto God, add to consecrat himself to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Christ, and let him compare his sometime bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conversation, with his late pollutions, that he may
be ashamed, and hast himself in unto nearer fellowship
with God, from whom he hath so filthily and fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made defection. 5. Let him be upon his guard and
watch over his heart, lest he be overtaken again by
the tentations of Sathan, his own corrupt nature, and
the intising example of the world, lest he perish in his
transgression, if he shall again provoke the Lord. 6.
And last of all, let him set before himself the ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
which Christ hath made to a victorious wrestler
of this kind, <hi>Rev. 3. 5. He that overcometh the same shall
be cloathed in white rayment, and I will not blot out his name
out of the book of life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning the converts pleasing himself in his luke-warm
condition.</head>
               <p>IT cometh to passe sometimes, that the true convert,
being as he conceiveth sure of his own salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
negligent in the mater of his sanctification, and
worshiping of God in the spirit, and turneth himself
about to his own ease and following of what he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
lawfull: for, because he conceiveth he hath a sure
grip of Christs grace, and of the gifts &amp; benefits flowing
from him, so as he needs not now to vex himself in the
exercises of religion as sometime he did when he was
not sure of his reconciliation with God; therefore he
judgeth it sufficient, if he do follow the exercises of
religion more coursely, eshew grosse scandalous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings,
do some works of almes and charity, as he
hath occasion, and follow the works of his calling
blamelesly, giving the rest of his time to be spent in
worldly cares, ease of his flesh and lawfull recreations.
In which condition he pleaseth himself very well, as if
he had attained the way of Christian felicity both in
soul and body: For he misseth nothing in maters spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and necessary to salvation, he is rich and hath need
of nothing. Whereupon he troubleth not himself to
grow in sanctification, or to set others on work, for
adding one vertue to another, if they trouble not the
peace of the Church, or do not disgrace religion by a
scandalous life: If any man in Christs maters, will be
more earnest then his neighbours, he doth not find fault
with it, but let him be as diligent as he pleaseth, for
he resolveth not to oppose any man in Christs service,
nor to presse any man to mend his pace in Christs way,
and to say the mater in a word, he is a luke-warm man,
neither a reall and feckfull friend to Christ, so long as
helyeth in this condition, nor yet an open adversary of
Christ or his wayes. In this sicknesse readily do they
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:40880:203"/>
fall, who after that the pains of their new birth, and
difficulties in their reconciliation are past, do impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
lay hold upon their liberation from the terrours
of the law, and dream of so sweet rest in their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
flowing from the Gospel (as if now their enemies
being all put to flight, and their bonds wherewith they
were bound, were all loosed, broken and laid aside)
they might compose themselves to security and sleep,
when indeed they should stand upon their watch, and
upon their guard, least some other way the enemy
should set upon them, and catch them in new snares
and straits, as the Apostle doth fore-warn, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.
13, 14. This was the condition wherein some converts

for albeit we do not think, that all these who are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for luke-warmnesse, were regenerat, yet we cannot
judge that all the regenerat and true converts, were free
of this sicknesse, when we see Christ professing his love
to the luke-warm, and out of love directing his reproof
toward them, whereby he doth invite them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and to return to that sweet communion with
himself, which they did not follow after, for the time.
And to make it appear, that true converts might fall
in this luke-warmnesse, he giveth warning to all that
have ears to hear, to hearken unto what the Spirit doth
speak unto the Churches.</p>

by this his luke-warmnesse, wherein he hath by his
fleshly security made no account of the spiritual riches

this disposition of luke-warmnesse is unto Christ,
who preferreth the open hostility of aliens, to the luke-warm

condition of those who professe for him, and
hath declared he will not comport with them, but spew
them out of his mouth, except they shall speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
3, Let him consider how many and sad plagues
of heart he lyeth under if he examine himself well,
which may certifie him of the flame of Gods wrath
ready to follow on the smoak of begun spiritual plagues.
4. Let him be speedily humbled before the Lord for his
vain gloriation of self-perfections, and supposed need
of nothing, when indeed he is blind, naked and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

               <head type="sub">Concerning such converts as lean unto the props of carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and please themselves in this condition.</head>
               <p>OFt-times it comes to passe, that true converts, while
they conceive that they trust in Christ only, are
found to lean too much on their own worth and
strength, and graces bestowed on them. In which
condition, by so much as they are well pleased with
themselves, they do in so far displease God, and do
provoke him to jealousie, and they who are most over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with this sicknesse are most senslesse of it, and are
most malcontent, that any man should suspect them, to
be in an evil condition; yea, and they conceive, that
no man is able to convince them of self-confidence, and
here they lye over till God bring them to tryall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their mistake is made clear unto them. Their tryall
ordinarily cometh by some affliction, by some power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
tentation, and by some degree of felt de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ertion:
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:40880:204"/>
for, this sicknesse, as it is contracted by prosperity, So
it is fostered, and hid by prosperity, till the prop of
their carnal confidence be shaken by unexpected adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
Of which purpose, that we may speak the more
clearly, we shall point forth two sorts of this carnal
confidence, and shall shew the difference of those two
sorts, by the difference of these two pillars whereupon
carnall confidence is upholden. The one is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
benefits, which God doth ordinarily bestow on
good and bad, renewed and unrenewed persons. The
other is, some observable measure of the operations and
fruits of the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>As for confidence in the common benefits of God,
sometimes true converts fall too much in love with
earthly and temporal benefits, do seek too much after
them, embrace them greedily when they obtain them,
rejoice too much while they injoy them, fear too much
to loss them, and mean time do not perceive the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of their affection about them; and if they be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as in any measure guilty in this case, they will not
acknowledge their fault, but go about to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of this sort of failing, saying, we know our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that if riches increase we should not set our heart
thereon, that we should not love too much our own
children, parents, parties, friends and comfortable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
that we should not delight too much in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
nor glory in the common gifts and enduments of the
mind, wherein ungoldy men may excell, and go far
above us; that we should not affect too much the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of men, or esteem too much of being honoured
of men. They will also readily confesse, that they are
not far from the danger of being drunk with prosperity,
and falling into the sleep of carnal security, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much weight on this weak pillar of creature-confidence:
But for time by-past they are ready to
averr, they have been very cautious, lest they should
fall in this fault, and for time to come, that they hope
to watch against all snares of this sort, and so they
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:40880:204"/>
think all is well; but when it doth please God in his
wise dispensation to change their outward condition,
and to turn their externall prosperity in adversity; when
God takes away the comfortable benefits which he had
bestowed on them, and brings upon them some sad
calamity, incontinent they are in the dumps, and sit
down astonished, they begin to call Gods love in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whereof they boasted before. Thus their faith
discovereth its weaknesse, and the mixture of carnal
confidence with their faith doth clearly appear, which
before did lurk as drosse doth in the gold or silver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be purified, which doth give the masse a greater
bulk without greater worth or price. This infirmity
and mistake the Psalmist did observe in himself, <hi>Psal.
30. 6, 7. In my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved;
thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi> This infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the convert, and his mistake, shall be yet more
manifest, if we shall compare the confidence of the
convert in the promises of God for food and rayment so
long as God giveth riches, with their confidence when
their means do fail and poverty cometh on. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of God remain the same in the having and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of riches, but there is a great ods between their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to be furnished when they have riches and their
confidence when means do fail, which confidence now,
is very feeble. Wherefrom doth this change come let us
see? Certainly it cometh from the removing of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
props of their confidence: for when upon the failing
of these props and pillars, faith in the promise doth stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
it is a sure evidence, that they have leaned too
much weight on the means, who mis-believe when the
means do fail.</p>
               <p>3. For curing of this sort of carnal confidence, and
leaning too much on temporal benefits, let the convert
thus mistaken, after his experience felt, that he hath been
carnally confident, not be discouraged, as if his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which he seemed to have placed on God, were
altogether vain, and in no degree spiritual: but let him,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40880:205"/>
first, be humbled before God, and submit himself to the
Lords rod; let him acknowledge the wisdom, justice
and mercy of God, who hath removed this prop of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
confidence, and reduced him from going astray to
depend more on God then he hath done. 2. Let him
strengthen his faith in Christ, according to the renor of
the covenant of Grace, and that so much the more as he
finds his own unrighteousnesse, in following and relying
on creature-comforts to have been great. 3. Let him
set his affections upon things spiritual, which are above
the earth, and to be found in Jesus Christ, who is at the
right hand of the Father, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. 23. and to loose his
estimation and affection from these things that are on
earth. 4. Because this sicknesse is not well observed,
except in the time of adversity, let the afflicted person
approv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> himself in the point of sincerity of adherence
unto God, by his trusting in God now, when he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
means and creature-comforts, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, who in
this condition blessed God for the giving of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
and blessed God at the removing of them from him,
<hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 21. For, by so doing, he shall learn both to have
and want, and in every condition to be content, as the
Apostle was taught, <hi>Phil,</hi> 4. 12. and this is for the first
sort of carnal confidence.</p>
               <p>The other sort of carnal confidence, is that which
too much leaneth to some apparent measure of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and fruits of the holy Spirit, observed by the
convert in himself: and this sicknesse may be taken up
and perceived chiefly by comparison of the converts
stronger confidence of the love of God toward him, so
long as he can find evidenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> signes of his regeneration,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is weaker
confidence of the love of God toward him under the
cloud of descrtion, or under some powerfull temptation,
when these evident signes of his conversion are darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or do not appear so clearly unto himself as they did
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In which case, his confidence is greatly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and his faith not a little shaken with doubting. In
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:40880:205"/>
both the one and the other condition, the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>venant of
Grace standeth fixed, and the promises of the Gospel
remain the same, and the convert still adhereth to the
covenant and claimeth interest in Christ, more or lesse
confident. Whence cometh then this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his former confidence which was strong, and his
weaker confidence now in the change of his case, being
brought low? Certainly it proceedeth from the smiting
of the pillar whereupon his former confidence was too
much fixed: for, whensoever the mist is cleared up, and
he findeth the livelynesse of the work of grace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
his confidence convalesceth, and returns to it's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
strength, as it seemeth to him; and when his graces
are darkened, he falleth in a languishing weaknesse of
faith.</p>
               <p>This sicknesse is so frequently incident to the Saints,
that few shall be found who are not again and again
overtaken in it: for, how few are they who are not
much more confident when they find a heart freely
poured forth in prayer, when they injoy the peace of
God in their heart, when the love of God is shed abroad
in their heart, when they find the consolations of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, when they observe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruits of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in themselves, when the candle of the Lord shineth
in their soul, and the tokens of Gods savour toward
them are manifest; and on the other hand, when they
find their spiritual condition changed, when darknesse
falleth on their spirit, when they find themselves unfit
for worship and unable to do service, but most of all,
when they perceive tokens of fatherly wrath against
them super-added unto the foresaid evils; in this case,
who is he, that beside the inevitable perturbation of
mind incident to those who are strongest in faith, doth
not find a diminution of his former confidence, and a
conflict with temptations, fears, doubts and difficulties?
which diminution and abating of his confidence in his
tryals and inward exercises, doth evidently prove, that
in his best condition he hath laid too much weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:40880:206"/>
on the mutable disposition of his soul, and hath not so
stucken to the Word of Gods grace through Jesus as
became him.</p>
               <p>2. That this sicknesse may be the more easily cleared
and cured, it is expedient to answer some questions, which
being discussed, may inform and edifie the afflicted.</p>
               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <head>Question 1.</head>
                  <p>THe first question which the afflicted may propound,
is this, Seing the signes of Gods favour, manifested
in the bestowing and continuing of common benefits
and gifts outward and inward, do certainly serve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
a mans faith in God, is it not very reasonable to say,
that the signes of Gods wrath, manifested in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of those benefits, do certainly serve to debilitat
and weaken a mans faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Signs of Gods favour, and signs of Gods
wrath, are not inconsistent, because God can carry love
and favour to a man, and be angry at him also for the
present ill disposition wherein he is; for, love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
wrath, are not opposit and inconsistent, but love
and hatred are inconsistent. 2. Let it be granted, that
any signes whatsoever of Gods favour, may be made
use of by the convert for strengthening of his faith;
yet it must not be granted, that the taking away of those
signes of favour, should be made use of for weakening
of a mans faith: For, many things may encourage a
man to do his duty, which being removed, must not
discourage him, or justly hinder him to do his duty.
3. There is a great difference between the man, who
never found any other sign of Gods favour beside pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
in common benefits, and the man who, beside
common benefits, hath felt a work of grace upon his
spirit, bringing him unto the sense of sin, and chasing
him to Christ, and making him to take on his yoke.
The first sort of men, can neither from the having nor
wanting, or removal of common benefits, conclude eh
is loved or hated, for so are we taught, <hi>Eccles. 9. 1, 2,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:40880:206"/>
No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before
him, all things come alike to all,</hi> &amp;c. But a man of this sort
hath reason to judge, that the sending on him adversity,
and wakening of him out of a fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shly and deadly securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
doth speak more of Gods favour to him, then his
prosperity did. And this other sort of men, who have felt
a work of special grace on their hearts, may make use
both of their prosperity and adversity for confirmation
of their faith. 4. Put case that a convert, chased unto
Christ in the sense of his sin, and resolved to bear Christs
yoke upon him, shall find common benefits taken back
from him in fatherly wrath; yet must he not yield to
the weakening of his faith, but rather yet more humble
himself, in the sense of his sins which have stirred up
wrath against him; and flye in to Christ, and lay hold
more closely upon his grace because God, being offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

God to change his dispensation toward them, 3. Let

of Gods favour, yet new obedience of
faith and fruits of the spirit, are sure signes of Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
favour bestowed only on the Elect: Seing then, as
these signes when they are present, serve much for the
strengthening of faith, so also when they are amissing,
have as great force of reason to debilitat faith, yea seing
faith without fruits is dead, may it not be concluded
where no fruits are, no faith is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If the question be of the universal want of all
fruits of faith, such as is to be found in all unrenewed
men, whose fruit cannot be good so long as the tree is
evil, whose seeming service cannot be acceptable, so
long as they remain unreconciled to God through
Christ, let the question be yielded unto. But we are
speaking of the true convert, in whom there is a missing
of the measure of formerly felt fruits, and that in the
time present, wherein by some temptation or tryal, their
faith is sifted and winnowed. And here indeed there
is a vast difference between them that were never hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in the sense of their sins, nor led for relief from sin
and misery unto Jesus Christ, and the true convert, who
hath renounced the works of darknesse, and hath fled
unto Christ and consecrated himself to his service, and
who is set upon a new course of life, hath brought forth
new fruits of repentance, faith, love and hope, and hath
felt consolation in this course; and now under exercise
of conscience, looketh upon himself as barren ground,
doth lament his impotency to bring forth good fruits,
and while he is under this exercise, liveth in a sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
blamelesse and free of scandal-giving: great ods
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:40880:207"/>
between this man, and a man yet in nature. We
grant in the unrenewed man, who is a stranger to the
life of grace and true godlinesse, the sentence holds, <hi>No
fruits no faith;</hi> but as for the convert, who hath had
comfort in Christ, and brought forth good fruits in
some measure, he must not reason from his present dead
condition, felt and lamented barrennesse, to the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of true faith in Christ, or to the weakening of his
saith, or marring his confidence further, then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
he hath leaned too much on his formerly

looking to the holy Law of God, and finding no

of the fruits of the Spirit, and then do dispute against
their own faith by the Apostles words, <hi>Iam. 2. 20.
faith without works, is dead?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If the conscience do pronounce according to the
truth as the mater is indeed, it cannot be denied but faith
without works is dead; and God is greater then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and knoweth all things: But when the conscience
is misled by a tentation powerfully pressed in by Sathan,
in the time of some sad affliction, and appearance of
Gods displeasure, the testimony of the conscience is not
a sufficient proof to infer so hard a conclusion: for, it
cometh to passe oft-times, that the convert, who liveth
blamelesly, and entertaineth the love and purpose of
well-doing in his heart, followeth the exercises of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
constantly, is not negligent in his calling, and is
ready upon occasion offered to let forth the fruits of love
to his neighbour, for all this sometimes walketh in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:40880:208"/>
darknesse, and under desertion, seeth no light, as <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
50. 10. In this case it may be, he set all his works at
nought, as no wayes answerable to the Lords Law. I
see nothing (saith he) but sin in me, I see no fruit of true
faith in me, I feel no operation of the holy Spirit in
me, save the work of convincing me of sin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse.
In this case we must not give credit to
the afflicted, but convince him rather of his error, and
in special of his leaning too much weight on his works
before this sad exercise fell upon him; for, when a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
maintaineth his faith in Christ, only so oft, and
so long as he findeth in himself the fruits of new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but when he hath new experience of the power
of the body of death, and findeth the course of good
behaviour, and bringing forth good fruits to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in himself, incontinent he resiles from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
such a man certainly giveth evidence, that he
hath relyed too much on his former felt righteousnesse
an himself: for he doth as if he durst not for sin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
unto Christ, and so he falleth in <hi>Peters</hi> case, who
looking on his own sinfulnesse and the brightnesse of
Christs Godhead shining in a recent miracle, cryeth
out, <hi>Luke, 5. 8. depart from me, O Lord, I am a sinfull
man:</hi> for, <hi>Peter</hi> in this case did forget Christs mediatory
office, and that he stood so much the more need of
Christs drawing near to him, as he was a man convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of sinfulnesse. Another answer we give to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
the afflicted person must not think, that he wants
altogether the fruits of faith, albeit he find them to be
short of the perfection which the Law doth require, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he find not the fruits whensoever he would exact
them, albeit he find them not in that measure as he hath
found them before: For as trees are not to be esteemed
dead, or barren, which bring forth fruits in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
albeit they bear not fruit in winter, So faith is not
to be esteemed dead, which, as occasion is offered,
bringeth forth the fruit, at one time, of mercy, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, of justice and equity, at another time, the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:40880:208"/>
evidence of zeal, at another time, of love, and other
vertues, albeit when occasion or opportunity offereth
not, it doth not exercise such and such vertues: yea,
albeit sometimes when occasion calleth for the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of such and such gracious vertues, the convert be
somtime found in-laking or short of doing duty, or guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of doing contrary to duty, faith must not be counted
dead for all that: Because it may come to passe, that
faith may be so wounded, and fall sick and languish,
and fall in a swound, that it cannot bring forth fruits
till it be recovered of its sicknesse, as we may see in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,
David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> whose faith fainted, but failed
not altogether: It is true, they suspected they were cut
off, and gone when they were in hard exercise, but after
that they did look up to the mercy of God in Christ,
draw near unto him, and did shew themselves alive
in the Lord, and to be in the state of grace. Last of all
we answer, that the regrate of the humbled soul of its
barrennesse and short-coming of bringing forth fruits
as it would, is no small evidence of life and sense in the
inward man: And of such a disposition it may be said,
as it is written, <hi>Cant. 2. 13. The figtree putteth forth its
green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good
smell:</hi> For he that is fled to Christ, and laments his
barrennesse, is a lover of doing good works, and of
bringing forth the fruits of the Gospel.</p>

doth prove him not to have been a believer in Christ for
time by-past, which is the first question; and the same
want of all good fruits heretofore, doth answer the
other question for his present duty, and in time to
come, to wit, that now except he will perish, he must
flye to Christ and believe in him. In proving of this
assertion, that I have heretofore for such a space of

and certainty of our effectual calling is not attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but by reasoning from our good works, that we are

and election, and so may be leaned unto?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> A man may make use of his good works for
confirmation of his faith, and yet not lean his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon his works, but upon the grace of God, who
hath called him of his free grace, and made him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the offer of his free grace, and given unto him both
to will and to do of his free grace, and made him to be
Gods workman-ship, created of Gods free grace unto
good works, wherein he hath made him to walk. Thus
grace is by Gods word and working cleared up to the
believer to rest upon, without laying too much weight
upon the mans work: but if a man lay hold on Christ
and his free grace, only then, when he observeth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
such and such fruits of faith, and looseth or slacketh
his grips of Christ when he feels deadnesse and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to good works, justly we may call this a carnal
confidence in his works: for when he ought, with <hi>Paul,</hi>
Rom. 7. 24, 25. so much the more to flye in to Christ
and his righteousnesse, as he findeth the body of death
powerfull in him, and in-born sin strong to hinder his
obedience, he doth contrary wayes abate of his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
languish and decay in his faith, and look like a
departer from Christ, we must say, he putteth carnal
confidence in his own works.</p>

truth and sincerity of saving faith in me, except
I do observe in me, and can bring forth my good works
to prove the reality of faith in me; how is it possible
that I should not lean weight on my good works, seing
the proof of my faith is by my works, which proof if
I have not, I am at a stand, I cannot prove my self to
have been a true believer in Christ, I cannot perswade
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:40880:210"/>
my self that I have been and am a true believer in
Christ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The observation of the fruits of faith in me
is not the only proof of my believing in Christ; for, the
very act of imbracing the offer of reconciliation made
to me in the Gospel, and flying unto Christ for a refuge,
when I am chased by the Law, by the conscience, and
felt wrath pursuing me for sin, may be clear to me by its
own light and scriptural evidence, albeit (it being
possibly the very instant of my conversion) I cannot
produce any fruits or evidences of my conversion past;
or else what shall be said of malefactors on the scaffold
presently to be put to death, and possibly not wakened
in conscience before, not fled to Christ before? What
shall be said of sick persons near unto death, who being
self-condemned, do betake themselves in their last agony
unto the grace of God in Christ offered to self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
sinners in the Gospel? 2. I must put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between a reason to prove that <hi>I have believed,</hi> and
a reason why <hi>I may and must now believe.</hi> The reason
to prove that I have believed, is from the effect to prove
the cause thereof, to wit, faith to be in me: but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why I may now, and must believe, is from the cause
to infer the effect that should be in me: the cause of
believing in Christ, is Gods command to self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sinners; which command I must now obey left I
perish, and so if I find fruits, I prove I have believed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I feel the love of God shed abroad in my heart,
and that I love God who hath freely loved me; and
here I reason from the effect, to prove that the cause of
this fruit, to wit, sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing faith, hath preceeded and is gone
before. Again I prove that I should believe, because
the offer of the Gospel and of free grace in Christs, made
to all self-condemned persons, renouncing confidence
in their own worth or works, is made to me, with a
command to believe in the Son of God, Christ Jesus;
for which cause, I may and ought to cast my self upon
his grace, who justifieth the ungodly, flying to him,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:40880:210"/>
without the works of the Law. 3. I must put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between my <hi>having</hi> fruits of faith in me, and my
<hi>observing</hi> and finding these fruits in me: for, a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
may have both faith and fruits; and for the time,
being under tryal and temptation, may be so darkened,
that he can see nothing in himself but sin, and apparent
wrath pursuing him for sin, as may be seen in <hi>Ionah</hi> in
the belly of the fish, <hi>Ionah</hi> 2. 4. and, <hi>David, Ps.</hi> 51 9, 10.
4. I must put difference between my perswasion, that
I have been and am a true convert and a sincere believer,
and my perswasion, that I have right, reason and good
warrand to believe in Christ in my lowest condition:
howsoever then I find my self emptied of all signes of
saving grace in me for the time, yet my perswasion, that
I should in this sad condition flye to Christ and believe
in him, doth serve to make me consent heartily unto the
offer of the covenant of grace in Christ, doth serve to
make way for my justification, and looseth all doubts
and objections of Sathan tempting me to mis-believe,
and to run away from Christ and the offered mercy in
him. 5. And last of all, I must put difference between
making use of good fruits brought forth by me, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of my faith, and my putting confidence in,
or laying weight on, these good fruits: for, many true
converts do here fail, and do not mark the mistakes;
for when they find love to God and his Saints, with fear
and holy reverence, and such other like signes of grace
in their hearts, and outward fruits thereof in their life,
then they do believe in Christ and rejoice in him: but
when at another time, they find hardnesse of heart, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanity
and perversenesse of a wicked nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they are like to quite their interest in the covenant
of Grace, and to stand aloof from Christ like strangers,
when they should most be humbled and creep in to
him for remission of sin, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d hiding of their nakednesse
by his imputed righteousnesse. And what is this in
effect else, then in the first place to lean on their works
and holy disposition, as if there were merit in them, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:40880:211"/>
then after in the next place to believe in Christ who
hath furnished them those fruits? whereas they should,
in the sense of their sin and unworthinesse, first, flye to
Christ, and firmly adhere to him by faith, that out of
his fulnesse they may receive grace for grace, according
as we are taught to do by Christ himself, <hi>Ioh. 15. 5.
He that abideth in me, and l in him, the same bringeth forth
much fruit; for without me, you can do nothing.</hi>

               <p>TO speak of delusion and bewitching in the general,
requireth a large Treatise. It shall suffice our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to speak of it, as it hath place in the point of
doctrine and practice erroneous: Which we describe
thus, <hi>Delusion is a powerfull operation of a lying Spirit,
whereby he obtrudes to men some noysome error in doctrine
or practise contrary to true doctrine, fairded over with sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
deceits, and doth perswade inconsiderate souls effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to receive the error for truth, and to defend and spread
it in their rash zeal:</hi> For explication of which descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we say, 1. <hi>delusion is a powerfull operation of a lying
Spirit,</hi> wherein Sathan in Gods judgment is permitted
to put forth his power in lying effectually. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all his effectuall delusions, there is a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
righteous judgment of God in loosing reins to the
rempter, that by delusion, one sin in one degree, may
be punished by a following sin in a higher degree.
No wonder therefore that a lying Spirit do work more
effectually when he is not restrained by the powerfull
hand of God. 2. We say, that delusion is in some
dangerous error tending to the damage of the Church,
and hazard of souls. And this we say not, as if we
did think, that any sin doth not draw with it, the
merit of death (for the wages of every sin is death) but
because Sathan is not so busie, to spred and foment such
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:40880:211"/>
errors, as are lesse perillous, as he is active in such
errors which do most tend to pester the Church and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the professors of religion from the path way of
saving doctrine. And to this purpose he essayes all
means, that he may obscure and darken the truth, and
devise and spread abroad the most pernicious errors.
Mean time he is not idle in sowing and spreading lesser
errors, that he may stir up contention and jangling in
the Church, whereby precious time, which should
be spent for mutual edification, may be idly wasted in
needlesse disputes, and mens minds may be prepared to
receive grosser errors. Thirdly, we put some difference
between errors in doctrine and errors in practice, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
there cannot be one error in practice, whether it be
in the external worship or government of the Church,
or in outward conversation, which being stiffly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
hath not some error of judgment and doctrine
joyned with it, or else it should not be contrary to sound
doctrine; yet there may be an error in doctrine and
judgment of the mind, when in the outward practice
the error may lye hid, and men of contrary judgment
may consent and agree in the same practice. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we presuppose the errors, whereof we are speaking,
to be coloured and covered with fair pretenses, and to
be found deceitfull sophistry: For otherwayes a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Christ could not be easily insnared, if the error
were seen in its own colours, if it were demonstrat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him with sound reason to be contrary to sound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and pernicious to the welfare of the Church, and
to mens souls. For in this case, every ingenuous and
honest mind, would keep off from the error as from a
deep pit: But Sathan setteth forth the error, as if it were
no error but most consonant to wholsome doctrine, and
profitable for mens souls and the Churches good. And
by plansible pretenses, sets out the error so as it may
seem lovely and worthy to befended, and spred
abroad by all means. Fifthly, in this delusion we are
speaking of, we presuppose, that in the person deluded
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:40880:212"/>
there is a perswasion (stronger then any probation
which he hath) can support: For there the efficacie of
error doth specially appear, when the lying Spirit, by
probable conjectures, appearance of advantage and
sophistical disputation, doth perswade the deluded soul,
that the error is as sure as if by divine oracle it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
and declared to be a truth. How this can be,
and how Sathan worketh this perswasion, it is not to
our purpose to make inquiry: For, lying Spirits have
their own way, unknown to us, whereby they insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat
and suggest their errors unto men. It may suffice
us, that the Scripture hath taught us that Sathan can
form objections against our faith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 10, 11, 12.
and throw them at us as fiery darts, and work strong
perswasions in unstable or ignorant souls. Such was
the perswasion of the Galatians, which the Apostle
avoucheth to have been procured not by God who had
called them, <hi>Gal,</hi> 5. 8. Sixthly, we presuppose in a
powerfull delusion a bastard and misled zeal, making
the deluded man ardently to defend and promove the
error which he hath embraced: For, this is Sathans
main endeavour, when he hath leavened with error
one or moe in a Church, to make all the use of them
he can to leaven the Church with the same error.</p>
               <p>And to the intent this mater may be the more useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken of, three questions must be answered so briefly
as may be. The first question is, whether such a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
delusion may befall a true convert? We answer it
is possible, and experience proveth it: that it is possible,
we learn from the Apostles fear, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 3. I fear
least by any means as the serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his
subtility, So your minds should be corrupted from the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
which is in Christ,</hi> He was feared also for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians,
lest they should be deluded, <hi>Col. 2. 4. This
I say, lest any man beguile you with intising words.</hi> And
ver. 8. <hi>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and
vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments
of the world, and not after Christ.</hi> Wherein it is clear,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:40880:212"/>
that this sort of delusion may befall the Saints. Now
that it hath indeed and in experience befallen some true
converts, it is evident by what Christ saith to the
Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> Rev. 2. 20. <hi>I have a few things against
thee, because thou sufferest that woman</hi> Jezabel, <hi>which
calleth her self a prophetesse to teach and to seduce my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to
Idols.</hi> And the Apostle shews the mater evidently to
have befallen the Galatians, <hi>Gal. 3. 1. O follish,</hi> or mad
<hi>Galatians, who hath be witched you, that you should not obey
the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Secondly, that this delusion drew deep, and
was very dangerous, appeare, <hi>Gal. 1. 6. I marvel that
you are so soon turned from him that called you into the grace
of Christ unto another Gospel.</hi> And, <hi>Gal. 5. 2. they were
in danger to lose all benefit by Christ;</hi> and, <hi>ver. 4. in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and on the way to fall from grace.</hi> Thirdly, the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
did erre both in doctrine and practice; in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
because they sought to be justified by the works
of the Law, <hi>Gal,</hi> 5. 4. In practice they erred, <hi>Gal.
4. 10, 11. ye observe dayes aud moneths, and times and years,
I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in
vain.</hi> Fourthly, their error was fairded with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
of the truth, which made them greedily embrace
the error: for, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9, they turned themselves back to
Mosaical rites and ceremonies now abolished under the
pretense of sometime commanded duties. And, <hi>ver.</hi>
21. they desired to be under the Law, and so run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under the curse. Fifthly, their error was not by
a light opinion held by them, but by a full perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wrought in them, not by Christ, but by a lying
spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 8. Sixthly, this bastard, and unhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
zeal was evidenced both in the seducing teachers, and
in the misled Galatians, <hi>Gal. 4. 17. They zealously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
you, but not well: yea they would exclude you that you
might affect them,</hi> that is, draw you away from the soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Christ and his true Apostles, that you might be
their affectionat disciples. And as for the Galatians,
deluded by Sathan, by their means, they turned their
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:40880:213"/>
ardent affection toward the Apostle almost in hatred
against him, <hi>Gal. 4. 15, 16. Am I become your enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I tell you the truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is clear, that true converts are subject to
this evil, and ready to fall in it except they watch care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and earnestly deal with God to keep them from
deceivers: for, many young converts are like lambs
and sheep, very simple, and being lately turned unto
the course of holinesse, they are easily taken with every
appearance of piety, whereof if they do apprehend any
seeming signs in seducers, they suspect no guile in
wolves clad with sheeps skins, wherethrough they are
overtaken unawares, and moved to separat from the
society of the Saints by the fleshly authors of division,
who by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts
of the simple, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. As for the second question what are the
effects and marks of such a delusion? We answer,
there is a delusion active wherein Sathan and his sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
instruments do set themselves on work to delude,
and there is a passive delusion in the party deluded by
Sathan and his instruments. The effects of the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or lying spirit, and the marks of delusion in
the party deluded do concur; for, the effects of Sathans
powerfull delusion do appear in the party deluded as
signs and evidences of the effectual delusion: These
effects and signs albeit they be many, we shall content
our selves to specifie some of them.</p>
               <p>The first and chief effect and sign of delusion, is, the
rejecting of a point of true doctrine, and the avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a false error contrary thereto. This we call the
first and principal sign, or mark of delusion; because
except this sign be found, other signs albeit they point
forth a perilous condition, yet without this effect and
sign be joyned, they do not prove delusion in the strict
sense wherein we take it here. This sign the Apostle
doth point at in the Galatians, <hi>Gal. 3. 1. O foolish Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians!
who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:40880:213"/>
the truth?</hi> where he challengeth them for rejecting the
truth and obedience unto it.</p>
               <p>The second effect and mark of delusion, is a bastard
perswasion whereby the person deluded layeth hold on
a most false error, as if it were a most solid truth, and
without hink or doubt rests upon it, as if it were a
divine truth: This sort of perswasion we call a bastard
and illegitimat perswasion, 1. because it is not wrought
by the Spirit of Christ: for which cause the Apostle
makes the Galatians perswasion not to be right and
legitimat, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 8. Secondly, because this perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
neither leans upon upon Gods Word rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
nor upon any firm reason deduced reasonably
from the Scripture. Thirdly, because this perswasion
of the deluded that his tenet is true, is stronger then his
perswasion of many articles of his faith, for which he
hath clear Scripture; and yet this perswasion of the
deluded is not so strong when it cometh to tryal, as
weak faith well grounded is, which when the force of
tentation and persecution cometh, is more able to bear
out, then the deluded mans perswasion wherein he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth.
Upon which ground, the Apostle doth not
doubt but the Galatians, beign true converts, shall
renounce this false perswasion, and return to the truth
which they had forsaken. Last of all, we call this a
bastard perswasion, because it draweth its original
and strength, not from clearnesse of Gods revealed truth,
but from the agreement which the error hath with some
carnal affection, whereunto this error doth service, for
which respect, carnal and corrupt reason is easily drawn
to maintain it pertinaciously.</p>
               <p>The third effect and sign of delusion, is, the causing
division and schisme in the visible Church needlesly;
and this effect doth readily follow on the former two:
for where error in doctrine, and in the rule of practice,
getteth up the head, it falleth out inevitably, that the
defenders of the truth and spreaders of the error, shall
fall in contention and division. In which case, the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:40880:214"/>
Apostle doth exhort the Romans, howsoever they
should pity the misled multitude, yet carefully to mark
the causers of the division, <hi>Rom. 16. 17. I beseech you
brethren, mark them which cause division and offences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them;</hi>
which presupposeth they deserve excommunication if
they be obstinat.</p>
               <p>The fourth effect and sign of delusion, is foolishnesse
or a sort of madnesse, which appeareth partly in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerat
embracing of the error, and partly in the
defending and promoving of it: for, if the error in it
self be considered, it is a falshood and deceit; or if we
look to the hasty receiving of it, when no sound proof
can be had of it, it is foolishnesse; or if we consider
the damage which followeth the defending and spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, which the party deluded did not fore-see and
guard against, it is a madnesse, and cannot but be so:
for, a false doctrine, albeit at first it may carry the
appearance of piety and prudence, yet when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with Scripture and rule of right reason led by
Scripture, it is found nothing but vanity, falshood,
cosening and deceit, as the Apostle doth insinuat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the errors which in his time were sprouting
forth in the Church, <hi>Col. 2. 23. which things have a shew
indeed of wisdom in wil-worship and humility, and neglecting
of the body, not in any honour, to the satisfying of the flesh,</hi>
that is, they are not worthy of any estimation, for they
serve only to satisfie fleshly corruption of nature, as he
observeth in the authors of Angel-worshiping, of
whom he averreth, <hi>that they intrude themselves into those
things which they have not seen, vainly puft up by their
fleshly mind,</hi> Col. 2. 18. And he calleth the Galatians
<hi>foolish,</hi> or mad, for their embracing of the error, <hi>Gal.</hi>
3. 1. and for hasty embracing of it, <hi>Gal. 1. 6. I marvel
that you are so soon removed from him that called you into
the grace of Christ, unto another Gospel:</hi> for there are
many who after much time spent, and pains taken,
upon them by faithfull Pastors, do not come up to the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:40880:214"/>
understanding of the heads of the doctrine held forth
in the Catechise, and proofs given thereof by Scripture,
and yet will very readily imbrace an error, and seem to
themselves so well to understand it, and to be able to
argue for defence of it; whose folly and madnesse may
be seen in this, that they do not consider the bitter fruits
of their error; to make a schisme in the Church they
think nothing of it; to rent the body of Christ they
care not for it: and for this very cause, the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
the Corinthians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that falling in contest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
among themselves about the excellency of their
teachers, they rent the Church, the body of Christ, did
despise his dominion and government, and gave his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto men, and did not regard the lamentable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of the schisme; no not when they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
and rebuked by the wiser sort of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. and, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2.</p>
               <p>The fifth effect and sign of delusion, is the pride of
the deluded, and vain gloriation in their error: for, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
gloried in men, and made it a matter of praise
to themselves to have such and such men heads of their
schisme, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. and upon this ground did despise
and contemn one another. And the Apostle giveth
this mark of Schismaticks and Sectaries, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 2.
Men</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
boasters, proud,</hi> &amp;c. and the followers of the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesse
<hi>Iezebel,</hi> did despise the Orthodox as ignorant
dolts, uncapable of the high mysteries and spiritualities
of the Gospel, which indeed were nothing but the deep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of Sathans delusions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
               <p>The sixth effect or sign of delusion, is rash, preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and bastard zeal: This the Apostle did mark in
the mis-believing Jews, <hi>Rom. 10. 2. They have a zeal of
God, but not according to knowledge,</hi> saith he. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous
and rash zeal is far more firy and hot then true
zeal in the godly: for, the error for which the deluded
do strive, is the native brood of corrupt nature; and
therefore it hath corrupt reason and affection stout for
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:40880:215"/>
it, and no wonder that corrupt nature be strong to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and advance its own birth. But true zeal is much
more moderate; partly, because it is carried on with
knowledge and prudence, doth fear to offend God by
yielding to passions, and hath to strive against corrupt
nature which cloggeth and hindereth every grace in the
convert, and this amongst the rest. 2. This preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and bastard zeal, doth render the deluded person
too pertinacious in the defence of the error wherewith
he is overtaken, that rather then he will quite his error,
he will imbrace another error to maintain the former
error for which he doth contend. And this cometh to
passe, partly, by a sort of necessity, and partly, by corrupt
willfulnesse. Partly of necessity, I say, because one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
error being received, draweth after it many other
errors: for, it is impossible to defend one error in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but by broaching and maintaining moe errors.
I say partly, by corrupt willfulnesse, because when the
deluded person findeth himself in dispute intangled, so
as he must either renounce the error which he hath
imbraced, or receive and maintain another error which
followeth thereon, he chooseth rather to imbrace the
error which followeth upon his first error, wherein he
was first insnared. 3. Holy zeal loveth every truth,
yea loveth other points of truth, as much as it loveth
that particular doctrine of truth which discovers the
error; neither will it suffer a believer, for the defence
of any point of doctrine, to passe from another truth;
but preposterous and bastard zeal is contrair: for, if
many points of truth come in comparison and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with the error which the deluded man hath drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in, he will mis-regard them all rather then forsake
his error, albeit he professe other truths to be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and necessar then his erroneous tenet. A proof
of this we have in the Pharisees, who made the great
things of the Law of none effect, for upholding of their
own traditions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 6. And the same power of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
may be seen among Papists, who will not so hotly
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:40880:215"/>
pursue or punish so severely the breach of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
as they do pursue and punish the neglect
of superstitious ceremonies. 4. Preposterous and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
zeal, is very busie to spread and propagat an
error, by all means, venting false doctrine, And such
mens speeches do spread as a gangren, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17. and
a little leaven of this kind is ready to leaven the whole
lump, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 9. In which case Christ advertised and
exhorted his disciples to beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees, whereby they were about to leaven the
whole Church. And this furious zeal, as experience
hath taught, doth spare no pains or labour to draw on
moe and moe to the profession of the zealots errors, as
may be observed in Pharisees who compassed sea and
land to make proselyts, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 15. 5. This bastard
zeal of deluded persons, carrieth them to have respect
unto, and estimation of, them that embrace their error,
and to seek respect and estimation from them who are
overtaken with their error. This was evident in the
schisme of the Corinthians, of whom some did choose
to be called such mens disciples, other some did choose
to be called the disciples of another man, and all did
glory in their leaders, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. 21. And on the other
hand, the heads of the schisme did glory in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and excellency as they conceived of their disciples.
This the Apostle observed in the seducers of the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and in them that were seduced by them, <hi>Gal. 4.
17. They zealously affect you but not well, yea they would
exclude you</hi> (from communion with God &amp; us his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles)
<hi>that you might affect them.</hi> 6. This bastard zeal
of the deluded, doth drive them to disdain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
all them who oppugn their error, yea and to hate
them, as experience did shew among the Corinthians:
for so soon as schismes did arise in <hi>Corinth,</hi> dissentions
also did arise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20. and of
this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vil the Apostle doth complain, <hi>Gal. 4. 16. Am I
become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</hi> And this
much may serve for our purpose concerning the effect
and signs of delusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:40880:216"/>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. The third question is, what are the causes
of delusion? For answer, the causes are many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
for some causes are principal causes, some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient,
some meritorious causes, and some promove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and helping forward of this evil: And which causes
and instruments, God doth so over-rule in his justice,
power and wisdom, that he turneth all to his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and welfare of his Church: This we learn from
the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 1, 2. Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Spirit
speaketh expresly, that in the latter times some shall depart
from the faith, giving head to seducing spirits, and doctrines
of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisie, having their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
seared with an hot iron, forbidding to marry, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from meats which God hath created to be received,</hi> &amp;c.
Where, first, he foretells, that there shall be a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the doctrine of the Apostles, whereof he giveth
an instance of that which might seem furthest from
suspicion of delusion, to wit, a putting of a religious
restraint upon the use of things lawfull in themselves,
as marriage and meats. The authors of this delusion,
1. he points forth to be lying spirits, and men seduced
by a lying spirit. 2. The way of seduction he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells,
shall be by lyes spoken in grosse hypocrisie. 3. Left
any should wonder how this could come to passe, that
any man against his conscience should dare to speak
lyes, he points at the cause procuring, to wit, the stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
and senslessenesse of the conscience, they have their
conscience seared with a hot iron. And, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14,
15. speaking of deluded seducers of the people, <hi>Such are
false apostles</hi> (saith he) <hi>deceitfull workers, transforming
themselves into the Apostles of Christ. And no marvel, for
Sathan himself is transformed into an Angel of light.</hi> Where
among sundry wayes of deceiving, he points forth one
of Sathans stratagemes, to tempt men to make a shew
of piety and counterfeit appearance of holy zeal, and to
pretend the authority of God, to delude the simple. By
which delusion, whosoever are insuared they are ready
to put on the same coat; for, being deceived, they
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:40880:216"/>
deceive others, pretending Scripture, that they may
fight against Scripture; and pretending holinesse and
piety, that they may hinder in others the true exercise
of holinesse.</p>
               <p>As to the causes of ready embracing of errors, 1.
there is propension aboundant in the natural corruption
of the heart to lay hold on any error offered, <hi>Ier. 17. 9.
The heart is deceitfull above all things, and desperatly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who can know it?</hi> Another cause is pointed forth by
Christ, <hi>Mat. 22. 29. You erre, not knowing the Scriptures,
nor the power of God.</hi> A third cause is the want of mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tification;
for the Apostle doth reckon heresies and
schismes among the works of the flesh; and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
1 <hi>Tim. 6. 10. The love of money is the root of all evil,
which while some have coveted after, they have erred from
the faith.</hi> And concerning the instruments of delusion
and division in the Church, the sentence of the holy
Spirit doth stand sure: for he knoweth the evils of the
heart perfectly, <hi>Rom. 16. 18. They that are such, serve

               <p>As for passive delusion in seduced people, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
prophesieth, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 3, 4. The time will come when
they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

choyce of such men to be their Pastors. From this
sort of teachers Christ fore-warneth his disciples to keep

they will seem innocent and harmlesse lambs, but their

But the meritorious cause of this giving men over to be
deluded, is plainly set down, 2 <hi>Thess. 2, 10, 11. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

This judgment, albeit it pursues unto the death only
the reprobat, yet whiles in some degree for a time, it
may over-take the elect and renewed persons, because
some of them, sometime are found to give way to their
lusts, and not to take head to the truth which by Gods
blessing might kill these lusts, therefore God in his
justice suffereth them to be infected with a contrary er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and to eat the bitter fruits of their folly, that being
corrected they may repent, and for ever fall out with
their carnall lusts and reject the error whereby they
were infected: for God in his wisdom and justice, most

shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall shew
great signs and wonders, in so much that (if it were possible)
they shall deceive the very elect.</hi> This is also manifest by
what the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18, 19. where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that God hath decreed to permit heresies to
arise, that both the truth oppugned by the heresie, and
the true converts, may be made the more manifest: for
by this means, the lusts and wickednesse of some, is
brought to light; some are chastised, some perish just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
some have their weaknesse and folly discovered, by
being tainted with error for a time, and in their

forth from the bonds of temporal judiciall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heart, whereby God hath chastified his child
for harbouring such lusts in himself as made way for
the error: yet the cure of delusion is not desperat, for
the Apostle giveth good hope of possible and certain
recovery out of it: for, <hi>Gal. 5. 10. I have confidence in
you</hi> (saith he to the insnared Galatians) <hi>through the
Lord, that you will be no other wayes minded, but he that
troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>For preveening and curing of this evil, the Apostle
commandeth Pastors to hold forth to all sound doctrine,</hi>
to preach the Word and to be instant upon all occasions, in
season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering
and doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>2. Let the deluded person be disputed with, that by
arguments drawn from Scripture he may be convinced,
as the Apostle dealt with these who denyed the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and with these who sought to be
justified by works among the Galatians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="424" facs="tcp:40880:218"/>
3. Let the deluded be exhorted to examine accuratly
his own conscience, how he standeth affected to his
own carnal wisdom and earthly lusts; for if he be
proud in the conceit of his own wisdom, power or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or any gift he hath received, or be led by the
lust of the eye, lust of the flesh or pride of life, and
come to God by prayer to solve his doubts, or to teach
him the right way, he shall receive such an answer as
<hi>Balaam</hi> received, and such as the Lord threateneth to
give, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 2, 3, 4. &amp;c, for he hath by his lusts
deceived his own conscience, and made it a flatterer of
himself when it should have been a grave counsellor
being well informed.</p>
                  <p>4. Let the deluded person be exhorted to be humbled
for the sins which he granteth to be in himself, and flye
to Christ for pardon, pity and help against his own
known corruptions, making use of all Christs offices
in the sense and acknowledgment of his standing in
need of the benefits thereof daily; for if he do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
known sins, but go on in them against the light
of his conscience, how shall he expect that God shall
give him light in his doubts, or errors, who maketh
no use, or an ill use, of the light he hath? and if he be
in a course of grieving the Spirit of the Lord, and
make no use of the grace that is offered in Christ, how
is it possible that he who doth not follow Christ, should
eshew to walk in darknesse?</p>
                  <p>5. And last of all, let the party deluded consider how
from time to time, and most evidently in this time
wherein we live, God hath punished the lusts and
sinfull practices of professed Christians, with giving
them over to their own hearts lusts, and letting them
not only walk in their own counsells, and in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of their own ill hearts, but also in his justice,
sending to them strong delusions, and false teachers to
authorize their errors, and hold them on in the way to
perdition. What wonder to see God for the light
esteeming of baptisme bestowed on men in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:40880:218"/>
and the not making use thereof for mortification
of lusts and sanctification of life by faith in Jesus
Christ, to let loose phanatick Anabaptists, to teach
men to renounce their baptisme? What wonder to see
mens loose-living in the service of their sensual lusts,
punished with letting loose antichristian Antinomians,
who turning the grace of God in wantonnesse, do
avouch whatsoever they do, it is no sin, and that they
are not bound to keep the law, which Christ professeth
he came not to dissolve, but by the contrary to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
it? What wonder to see mens carnal confidence
in their own wit, worth, strength and ability, works
and merits, punished with letting loose lying spirits to
harden them in their error? And what wonder to see
God punishing the abuse of the Gospel, and refusing
to receive the truth in love with giving men over to the
spirit of Antichrist and strong delusions, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.
The patrons and propagators of such errors and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

               <head type="sub">Concerning the converts conscience, mistaking vice for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and pleasing himself in this condition.</head>
               <p>THis case differeth from the case of delusion, which
we have taken for erring in the matter of Religion,
whether doctrine or worship, pertaining to the first
table of the Law; but this mistaking conscience is in
the practice of duties of the second table, when the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the duty is confessed, but in practice and action,
vice is practised under the notion and pretense of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and the man is pleased with himself in so doing.
Whereof it shall suffice to give three instances.</p>

                  <head>The first instance.</head>
                  <p>THe first instance wherein a convert may be for a
time mistaken, is, when a man pleaseth himself
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igardly parcimony, and narrow scraping together of
mony to the hinderance of spiritual duties, under pretense
of frugality and diligence in his calling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby
he perswadeth himself, that his practice is so far from
sin, as it is rather commendable and worthy to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat,
for he conceiveth that according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
he is not slow in the work of the Lord, but fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
in spirit, serving the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. that he
is working with his hands that which is good, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
4. 18. that he is providing for the necessity of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for which if he should not provide, he should be
worse then an infidel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. If the mater were
found so to be after examination, true it is, frugality,
diligence in a lawfull calling, and provision for a mans
family, are commendable; but here is the deceit of the
heart found, when anxiety is found in stead of moderat
carefulnesse; when hasting to be rich is found, in stead
of moderat diligence in his calling; when love of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and avarice is found, in stead of honest provision
for a mans family. We grant also, that this mistake
is not easily discerned by beholders, but yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
himself, after examination, may discern it, when
he looketh upon the effects, signs and concomitant evils,
such as are felt impediments, and hinderances of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
disposition: for, this covetousnesse of things
earthly, whereof we are speaking, doth marr the study
and endeavour for things spiritual, and diminisheth
the fear of sinning in the mater of gain, and taketh up
the time due for spiritual exercise. In this case, carnal
joy in the getting gain, is a sign and evidence of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
heart, and so is also wordly grief for want of
successe, or for not getting expected and desired gain, a
proof of this mistaking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:40880:219"/>
The causes of this evil, are the too great fear of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
an over-high estimation of riches, a diffidence of
Gods providence, a doubting of Gods promises to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
his own with food and raiment, and things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for this temporal life: which diffidence Christ
doth expresly discharge, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24, 25. But for a
remedy of this evil, the person guilty cannot seek after,
nor embrace it so long as he is not convinced of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
condition; wherefore, for clearing a mans mind
in this point, let him examine himself whether in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
gain his heart be oft-times surfetted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with the cares of this life, and made frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indisposed for prayer and religious exercises, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be too much taken with gladnesse when he
gaineth, and grief when he suffereth loss and worldly
damage, whether he useth, for hope of gain or fear of
life, to lye and flatter, or dare deal injustly in his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains,
whether he findeth himself slow unto exercises,
of religion, but prompt and ready for secular affairs?
whether he spend the time heavily in religious exercises,
and is weary of them, but can passe the time pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the affairs of this life? If he find himself convinced
by shrewd signs of this evil, let him humble himself
in Gods sight, flye unto Christ for fastening his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for righteousnesse and eternal life through Christ;
then let him not cast off his diligence in and faithfull
discharge of his lawfull calling, but by a religious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of mind, and observance of all religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
seasonably, temper and moderat his diligence in
secular affairs, and depend upon God more then he
hath done for the successe of his labours, and take from
God loss or advantage as he giveth it, so as he may
be found in prosperity and adversity submissive unto
God and ready for the discharge of charity and equity,
as occasion shall offer.</p>

                  <head>Another instance.</head>
                  <p>THere is another instance, wherein a convert may be
mistaken, to wit, when a man pleaseth himself in
in the prosecution of privat revenge, that he may pay
home to such as have wronged him in the mater of his
credit and reputation, or in his goods, or bodily harm
done to him or his friends: for, this ungodly disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he may pretend possibly, a care of following retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive
justice, wherein he may seem to himself to come
short, except he should watch for a recompence-giving
to the person injurious; he may possibly pretend a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
respect to publick peace and welfare of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
of the society wherein he liveth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he may seem to himself to come short if he should
suffer the person injurious to him to go away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished;
he may pretend also his own safety and
security for time to come, whereof he may seem to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
carelesse except he make it evident, that whosoever
doth him wrong shall be made sensible of his injury
done; he may pretend that the glory of God requireth
so much, that sins should be punished, the avenging
whereof, if it should be delayed longer then occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of revenge should offer, or till the Magistrat should
take notice of it, no punishment should fall upon the
injurious at all; and last of all, he may pretend the
good of the party injurer, who by feeling the smart of
his wrong done may be led to repentance, and made
to learn by his suffering the recompence of his injury
done, to carry himself more equitably toward his
neighbours in all time coming. All these pretenses
may bear weight in the corrupt inclination of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
and may harden him in his sinfull course of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a privat revenge on the person who hath injured
him. And his corrupt inclination may be observed by
himself, 1. by the stirring of his passion and wrath
against the injurer, whensoever he doth see the party
injurer or call the injury to mind. 2. By dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:40880:220"/>
and hiding from all men the sense he hath of the
wrong received, till he find an occasion offered to be
avenged on him. 3. By a stop made in his own pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for remission of sins, by his conscience telling him,
he could not subscribe the condition put in the prayer
for remission of sin by Christ, which is <hi>forgive us our
sins, as we also forgive them that sin against us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The causes of this sinfull condition are, 1. corrupt
and unmortified carnal self-love, with a too high esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of himself in pride, which maketh the injury
seem so much greater as he hath a higher estimation of
himself. 2. A defect in his christian love, meeknesse,
long-suffering, patience and pity, which should have
their exercise specially in cases of provocation of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified
affections. 3. The oblivion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God, and of the manyfold sins daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against him, whereof if there were a due estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had, the fountain and course of carnal revenge,
should soon be stopped, that privat and carnal revenge
should not break forth.</p>
                  <p>When these evils are found out and acknowledged
by the convert in himself, the main remedy thereof is
in and by Christ, who hath died for us when we were
his enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. and for whose cause greater
sins against God, are daily forgiven to us, then are
the injuries done unto us by men. 2. In this case also,
the grave admonition of the Apostle should not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
<hi>Ephes. 4. 26, 27. Let not the Sun go down upon
your wrath; neither give place to the devil:</hi> Giving us
to understand, that if wrath, which draweth with it
the desire of revenge, shall lodge all night with a man,
the devil will lodge with it also, stirring the man up to
pursue a revenge whensoever he findeth opportunity.</p>

                  <head>A third instance.</head>
                  <p>A third instance of this possible mistake of a convert,
may be found, when he pleaseth himself in his
carriage too much for his own carnal satisfaction in
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:40880:221"/>
meat, drink, apparrel and recreations, and here he
may be hardened by sundry pretenses which he may
have for his excesse in the use of things otherwayes
lawfull. As, 1. that what he spendeth upon himself
is of his own means. 2. That his recreations are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and allowed unto him of God. 3, That in all this
he hath a care of his health. 4. That he doth not spend
more upon himself then his rent and ability may well
bear. 5. That God hath said, by the mouth of a wise
King, that this course which he doth follow in allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on himself, is the gift of God, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 19. And
last of all, that he might seem justly a nigard, if he did
not well to himself when he is able so to do; and here
are pretences abundant. But if after examination of a
mans own self, he shall find the aboundance of earthly
things weakening his desire after things spiritual, or
shall find the sense of his in-born corruption laid over
to sleep in his prosperity, or shall find his flesh wax
wanton against the spirit, and to prevail in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict:
or shall find his compassion toward the poor and
afflicted to grow cold, and his delight in things spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
much diminished, or shall find too great a share
and portion of his time bestowed upon his body, and
but little time bestowed upon the care of his soul, a
wakened conscience may easily convince the convert,
that maters are not so right with him as he supposed.</p>
                  <p>The remedy of this evil, is not for a man to turn unto
another extremity, and to a contrary vice, as if there
were no place for a wise moderation, or as if at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a more liberal use of the creature were not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto men, or as if a spiritual disposition of a mans
spirit, could not consist now and then with any ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
or festivity: for, it is plain from Scripture, that
there is a time to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>east, and a time to fast, a time to
labour and a time to be refreshed, both in body and
mind after labour. In which prudence, the Apostle
had not a little advanced, when he saith, <hi>Phil. 4. 12,
13. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:40880:221"/>
every where and in all things I am instructed, both to be full
and to be hungry, both to abound and suffer need: I can do
all things through Christ that strengthens me.</hi> But here is
the remedy, 1. that distrusting our selves, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the snares which Sathan layeth for us in all things
we have our conversation with Christ, and set our
affections on things which are above, as the Apostle
giveth direction, 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. Next, that we watch
against the lusts of the flesh, least at any time our
hearts be su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is pleasant to the flesh, <hi>Luk. 21. 34. Rom.</hi> 13. 14.
For we are not debters to the flesh, to fulfill the lusts
thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 12. but are bound so to care for our
bodies, so as our souls have no loss thereby; for, the
lusts of the flesh do fight against our souls, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11.
And to this end, let the admonition of the Apostle be
well remembred, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31. This I say, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the time is short, it remaineth that both they who
have wives be as though they have none, and they that weep
as though they weept not, and they that rejoyce as though

his conscience, for whose liberty he ought to dispute;
the mater may be seen in an example or instance one or
two: King <hi>Saul</hi> receives a command from God to slay
all the Amalekits and destroy them and their beasts;
when it cometh to execution, <hi>Saul</hi> conceiveth it shall
be for his honour to spare <hi>Agag</hi> and reserve him for a
triumph, and that it should be for his advantage to
spare the fattest of the cattel, whereof the people might
make use for sacrifice; So advantage and honour do
sollicit him. The peoples consent who followed him,
helpeth on his resolution to spare <hi>Agag</hi> and the fattest of
the cattel: fear to offend the people whom he had
drawn on to consent unto his mind, concurreth to the
giving forth his decreet, contrary to Gods command;
and so his conscience being bribed, faileth against the
command of God. In which resolution and practice
<hi>Saul</hi> doth please himself.</p>
               <p>The like treachery in <hi>Saul</hi> falleth forth in the mater of
the Gibeonits: The Gibeonits preserved from <hi>Ioshuas</hi>
time, did grow in number to the detriment of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits
as he conceived, the oath of a covenant sworn for
sparing their lives standeth up on the one hand to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from slaying of them, the advantage which
his kindly subject might have by killing them and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
their lands and goods, standeth up to intise him
to kill them, on the other hand: <hi>Saul</hi> being taken with
the bait of advantage and honour from the people of
<hi>Israel,</hi> for whom he was zealous, inclineth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to mis-regard the oath of the covenant, partly
because it was given without Gods counsel and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
yea contrary to his positive command, dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a covenant with the Canaanits; partly because the
Gibeonits deceived <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the elders, and fained
themselves not to be of the number of the Canaanits, but
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:40880:222"/>
men of a far country; partly because many years had
interveened between the day of <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s covenant with
them and his time, and it seemed unto <hi>Saul</hi> very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that a rash and unadvised oath should be still
in force from generation to generation; and partly also
because the form of the civil Government was now
changed, whereby <hi>Saul</hi> conceiving himself not to be
obliged as successor to the Judges, but as King ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at Gods special direction, as free a Monarch as any
in the world, and not bound by the oath of the rash
swearing Judges and Elders in <hi>Ioshuas</hi> time, doth trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously
seduce his own conscience, and falleth upon
the off-cutting of the Gibeonits by the sword. How
many are they who by such intisements, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their own hearts, and for worldly gain or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or for eshewing of damnage, do embrace errors in
religion, and follow that course which most serveth
to satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie their own lusts, or is most applauded unto
of them who are in power? From which sort of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
dealing nothing can divert, and draw back the
man to repentance, except the Lord partly by disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and partly by Church-censures and civil punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
shall discover unto them their treacherous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in selling the truth and betraying their conscience
for base ends, and so bring them to repentance.</p>
               <p>In this case, such as are pretended maintainers of
liberty of conscience, but in effect patrons of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
living after their own lusts, put in their objections.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Obj.</hi> It is necessary for me, saith one, to do what
I do, and to think what I think; I conceive I have
reason for me and am perswaded that what I do and
professe is lawfull, and that that is not lawfull where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
censures and punishments tend to draw me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What necessity can be pretended for a deliberat
mans actions and profession except a morall necessity of
doing duty and of not sinning? Natural necessity he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
alledge for the justifying of deliberat sinfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
For if he pretend original sin and native corrupt
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:40880:223"/>
inclination to sin, it is no excuse for sin, but a grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself a sinner by kind, by natural inclination
and custom; or, if he pretend a civil necessity, it is
either for hope of gain or fear of wordly loss, and that
is but a base reason to move a man to do what is in it
self sinfull. If conscience be pretended, and that he
cannot without sin do what is against his conscience, he
must know that a conscience mis-informed cannot
warrant a sinfull tenet or practice: for except a man
renounce the error which he hath embraced, both the
error is his sin, and the profession and practice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the error, doth make his sin double; if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that except he do as his conscience diteth unto
him, he sinneth, because the conscience is the rule of a
mans actions, he must know, that the conscience is not
the absolute rule of a mans actions, but the Word of
God must be the rule of his conscience and of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
also. Because if he put his conscience in the place
of Gods Word, and not in subjection and subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereto, he must justifie the murtherers of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
of whom Christ giveth warning, that they who
kill his servants shall think (to wit in their conscience)
that they do unto God good service, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 2. If he
pretend, that upon this ground, liberty of conscience
is altogether destroyed, if men living under civil and
ecclesiastick Government, must renounce the light of
their conscience and give obedience to mens command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he must know, that he is mistaken, and that
the true liberty of the conscience standeth in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods Word, and doing service unto God. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth sound doctrine tye any man to renounce the
liberty of his conscience, but to renounce the error
which hath blinded him, and to renounce his lust which
hath opened the door unto the error which hath misled
him, lest both he perish in his sin, and the society
wherein he liveth be infected with the error, and fall
under the wrath of God. If he pretend, that neither
the will of a man, nor his conscience can be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:40880:223"/>
For, the nature of the conscience and will, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
freely what the man shall do; and the Lords
people must be a willing people, <hi>Ps.</hi> 110. 3 He must
know, that albeit the will and conscience cannot be
compelled, yet the carnal lusts which have seduced
the conscience, may be crossed and curbed by ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick
censures and civil punishments, that the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and will, being better informed, after the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the deceitfulnesse of their lusts, which did mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
them, they may freely disclaim the error, &amp; their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
venting thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If he pretend, that God is the only
Lord of the Conscience, and no man may take upon
him that power to prescrib unto, and command ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let him know that God indeed is
the only Lord of the conscience, and because he is Lord,
therefore hath he appointed his Ministers to teach men
the truth, and to presse the disobedient members of the
visible Church with censures; and hath put the sword in
the Magistrats hand to see his will done, and to punish
such as refuse to give obedience to his commands, that
so obedience may be procured to God the only Lord of
the conscience, In which case albeit the acts commanded
by the will and conscience, are curbed and restrained, yet
the will and conscience, is not compelled, but is brought
to a better determination of its own elicit acts, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained a clearer light about its duty, it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the outward man to say &amp; do what is right. If he
pretend, that religion is not to be propagat and press'd by
force, but by the word preached, and heresies are to be
rooted out, not by the sword but by the power of truth
holden forth to the heretick, let him know, that there is a
difference between propagation of religion among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
or people not under the charge of the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat,
or Church Judicatories, and the preservation or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of religion among them that are within the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church, and under the power of the civil Magistrat.</p>
               <p>For albeit the only way to bring religion in request
among heathen nations and strangers to the covenant of
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:40880:224"/>
promises, be that way which the Apostles did follow,
preaching the Gospel to all, and receiving such as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the Gospel into Church-fellowship, yet the
Magistrat, having civil dominion over heathen Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
may after information of them by the Preachers
of the Gospel, break their Idols and abolish them, and
restrain them from doing contempt unto the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or abusing of the Sabbath, as the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the moral law doth give warrant; yea, and
may compell them to use the means whereby they may
be instructed in the true Religion. Again, let him
know there is a difference between dealing with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and strangers from the commonwealth of <hi>Israel,</hi>
and dealing with these who have given up their names
unto Christ, have entered in covenant with God, and
by baptisme have consecrat themselves and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
unto the faith, worship and obedience of God, and
do professe the christian Religion, and yet go about
by their errors and practices to corrupt and over-turn
the true Religion and saith of others among whom they
live: for, such may and should be not only instructed
by Sermon, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rence and dispute, but also punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the civil Magistrate for their deceiving of the
people, and troubling the flocks of Christ, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.
and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. If he pretend, that Church-censures
and civil punishments can serve for nothing but to make
men dissemblers and hypocrits in the mater of religion,
which is most odious in the sight of God and wise men,
let him know, that every hypocrit shall bear his own
iniquity: Ecclesiastick censures and civil punishments
concern the words and deeds of the outward man, that
they may be ordered so as Religion and the peace of the
Kingdom may not suffer detriment. If any man say
and do that which is right in hypocrisie and dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the society wherein he liveth is safe; but for his
hypocrisie let the dissembler answer to God for it. And
yet it is not to be presumed, that all who by censures,
and fear of civil punishments do forsake error and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:40880:224"/>
truth, are dissemblers and hypocrits in so doing,
because they are means appointed of God for curbing
and reclaiming erroneous persons, wherewith he giveth
his blessing when it pleaseth him: for by censures and
civil punishments, the allurements which have enduced
them to error are cut off, such as are applause of men,
vain glory, worldly advantage, sensual pleasure, and
such like, wherein the erroneous have been taken as in
an evil net, which being broken, the insnared captive
may come freely off his error, and embrace the truth,
and take in good part the censures and civil punishment
which drew him out of the snare into the right way:
As we are assured by the prophesie of <hi>Zechariah,</hi>
chap. 13. 6. <hi>And one shall say</hi> (to wit, to the converted
sectary) <hi>what are these wounds in thine hands? Then he
shall answer,</hi> those <hi>with which I was wounded in the house
of my friends.</hi> But whether by those means the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
be reclaimed heartily or in dissimulation, respect
must be had to Gods commands and his peoples good,
by curbing of vice and error, according as God hath
given power to the Church and to the civil Magistrat,
<hi>Rom. 13. 3, 4. who is appointed the minster of God for the
peoples good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he shall object, that he who chargeth him for his
error, is no lesse subject to error, then he whom he
chargeth, yea, that Governours ecclesiastick and civil
are no more exeemed from the danger of erring, then
privat persons, yea, that the determinations of Synods
and Councils are not infallible, yea, that he is perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the error he is charged of, is no error, but not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the truth which the reformers of him pretend
unto. Let him know that the force of his objection
doth assert, that truth and righteousnesse is settled upon
the mis-perswaded sectaries part, and that the Church
and Magistrat who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>indeth fault with him, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to perswade them of the truth, which they do
presse upon the sectary, and so cannot condemn or
punish him; but he must know, that it is one thing to
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:40880:225"/>
say <hi>one may erre</hi> in the latitude of a possiblity indefinit,
another, to say <hi>one doth erre</hi> in such a particular wherein
he hath the light of Scripture and reason clear for him.
The sectary will not deny he may erre, but he will
maintain that in such one or other article of his professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he doth not erre. Shall he maintain his plea, that
he doth not erre in such a point of error? and shall not
the Magistrat and Church maintain their plea, that they
do not erre in punishing such an obstinat erroneous
person? Christ hath committed the keyes of doctrine
and discipline to his Church, that privat persons may
know Christs will by the ministery of the Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he will be holden for an heathen or publican, <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. 17. He hath also committed the power of the sword
unto the Magistrat, who doth not bear the sword in
vain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. And therefore let the Church and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat
do their duty, and let erroneous persons cease
to stumble the Lords people by their error and practice,
and suffer themselves to be brought in order by such as
have commission and power to move them by censures
and civil punishment thereunto.</p>
               <p>If still he will insist and alledge, that by this means
a Christian by censures and civil punishment, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to sin against his conscience, let him know, that
a scandalous sectary or licentious libertine, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
at all to sin, but to say and do that which is right
and to hearken to the Word of God rather then to his
own erring conscience; for the scandalous sectary,
schismatick or heretick lyeth in a twofold sin, the one
is in his spirit, believing and embracing an error, the
other in his external words and deeds corrupting the
minds and maners of Gods people. If after conference
and disputation, the sin of his misled mind cannot be
taken away, yet the correcting of him by Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and civil punishment may restrain and bind him
up from troubling, and infecting others with
his leaven and ill example; and so his sinning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
is cut off, and he made in so far to cease from
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:40880:225"/>
evil: wherein he doth not sin in so far, because sin is
not every transgression of the ditement of the conscience
simply, but the transgression of the law, and ditement
of the conscience speaking according to the law, is a
sin. It is true indeed, that whosoever doth judge the
ditement of his conscience to be the Law of God, and
yet doth the contrary, must by interpretation of his
deed be holden guilty of sin, because he who by fear or
hope can be moved to do contrary to the ditement of
his erring conscience, in effect doth professe he may
be moved by hope or fear to do contrary to the dite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his conscience well informed. Mean time it is
expedient, not only for the good of the society of Gods
people, but also for the good of the erroneous person
himself, that he be curbed and hindered, by these that
have lawfull power, from doing yet more harm, and
restrained from following the course of sin and filling
up the full measure of sinning, which he was about
to do.</p>

               <p>This sicknesse even converts are subject unto sundry

put a sort of worth and merit in effect, upon their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

them that did seek God daily, who delighted in his

thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our souls and thou
takest no knowledge?</hi> The history also of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi>
and <hi>Abiram</hi> is notour, wherein we see what esteem <hi>Korah</hi>
and his complices had of their own holinesse, and of
their accesse to God in their prayers that they durst
hazard and lay their lives in pawn, that God should
make them as welcom when they came with their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres
to pray before him, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> yea and
more welcome then they.</p>
               <p>Such a sort of deceit is that whereby some fanaticks,
enthusiasts and hereticks do foster themselves in their
own folly, and imagine they are no small men in Gods
account, because they find a sort of eloquence in their
prayers, which they conceive God would not give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, except he were well pleased with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
prayers and wayes; and that the true convert
also is subject to this sicknesse, appeareth by this that
<hi>Moses</hi> in charity judged many who countenanced the
conspiracy, to be godly persons otherwayes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
exhorted them to forsake the unhappy society of
these wicked men. And sure it is, that sundry of the

the obstinat transgressors, for it is clear that all the
sons of <hi>Korah</hi> did not perish, <hi>Numb.</hi> 26. 11. and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
mention is made of the posterity of <hi>Korah</hi> in the

               <p>But we need not insist much here, seing experience
teacheth, that many go on confidently in maintaining
schisme and error, perswading themselves of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

do flow according to their wish from day to day.
And many are, who if they find fredom in prayer, for

For remedy of this self-deceit, men must know, that
it is one thing to pray much, and another thing to be
heard and their prayers and persons accepted. The
Jews are told by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, chap.</hi> 1. 15. that
albeit they put up many petitions, the Lord will not
hear them, because their hands were full of blood. 2.
Carnal affection may easily creep in and stir up a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
of prayer, <hi>Iam. 4. 3. you ask and obtain not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you ask amiss, that you may bestow what you pray for

which God is not minded to grant unto them, as <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>

1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 16. 1. And <hi>David</hi> may pray for the life of <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shebas</hi>
child and not prevail. 4. On the other hand
prayers put up from a straitened heart in a sad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may prove no lesse pleasing unto God then when
the supplicant doth find most inlargement of spirit,
and fredom of prayer. How oft did the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the deeps, when his spirit was overwhelmed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, when darknesse and the cords of death did

Apostle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.) giveth us to understand, that the
spirit of the convert may be so straitened by afflictions
bodily and spiritual, that they are not able to set their
words in order before God, yea, nor have clear noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their necessities and desires, but in stead of an
oration, do sigh and groan unto God. Wherefore if a
man shall in the sense of his sins and wants, have his
daily recourse unto Christ, and be carefull to bring
forth the fruits of the spirit, praying for what is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
with submission to God what measure and at what
time he pleaseth to give, he may be sure his person and
prayers are acceptable, as we are taught, 1 <hi>Ioh. 5. 14,
15. This is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask
any thing according to his will, he heareth us; and if we know
that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have

               <head type="sub">Of the converts esteeming the peace of God to be but a carnal
security.</head>
               <p>VVE have brought forth some examples of the first
sort of the conscience erring, by esteeming an
evil condition to be a good condition. Now let us look
upon some examples of a conscience erring, by esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a good condition to be an evil condition. Of the
which sort this shall be one.</p>
               <p>Sometime some converts do mistake the peace of
God granted unto them after hard exercise, and do
esteem the quietnesse of their conscience, to be nothing
else but a carnal security and sleepy disposition of the
conscience. To which case that we may speak the
more clearly, we do not deny that many are, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
fall in a carnal security and please themselves
therein, conceiving they have the peace of God and a
blessed quietnesse of conscience. Such persons have no
doubt nor suspicion but all is well with them, for they
do not examine and compare their condition and
wayes with the Word of God, but sleep sweetly in
their carnal security and negligence of spiritual duties,
like to these luke-warm Laodiceans, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. Of such
we do not speak here. 2. Again we do not deny, that
true converts are in danger to suffer the peace which
God hath granted unto them, to degenerat unto a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
security. For easily may a convert after consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
divine fall in a sleep, as the Spouse did in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
5. 2. But we are speaking of the case of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
watching unto duties, who after no small vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his conflict with the tentations of the devil, with
the terror of the law and sense of divine wrath, hath
gotten the victory by faith in Christ, and hath obtained
peace with God graciously granting his petition; we
are speaking here of these converts who after the Lord
hath granted peace unto them through faith in Christ,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:40880:227"/>
dare not injoy their peace, but do suspect that their
peace is not sound, and at length do count and call
it carnal security; and so do breed themselves new
troubles of mind. The pretense and seeming reason
whereby they do deceive themselves is this. When
God, say they, seemed unto us angry with us, when we
found no peace and were wrestling under the sense of
sin, and in doubt whether such as we should find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
then we did pray very earnestly, night and day,
then we were diligent in hearing and reading of
the Word of God, and were painfull in the exercise of
all duties of religion and obedience. But now we find
our selves much cooled and slackened in all these duties,
whereupon we justly suspect the peace which we now
do find, to be nothing else but a carnal security of a
sleeping conscience. By this mistake all thanksgiving
for the peace granted unto them is well-near suffocat &amp;
extinguished. Their former condition under doubts and
fears, is judged to be better then their present condition,
they wish their former fears may return, rather then
they should continue in this condition, wherein their
tears are dryed up, and their former diligence eaten
up. Hence go they on to lay forth their complaints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their intimat acquaintance, concerning Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
and dealing with them, because the spirit of
fear and reverence toward God, the spirit of grace and
supplication is much diminished and near-by quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them. By which complaints they do not only
breed trouble to themselves, but also make heavy the
hearts of their godly friends, and do tempt them to
fall into the like complaints and to grieve the Lords
Spirit.</p>
               <p>2, This mistake doth arise, partly from the not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
and esteeming of the gracious gifts of peace, and
other graces bestowed upon them, and partly from a
wrong comparison of their former &amp; present condition.
For, first the afflicted person taketh no notice of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of a new creature in himself, he doth not consider
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:40880:228"/>
how great a benefit is bestowed upon him, when he
feareth to offend God, feareth to be shut out from soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
with him, and earnestly desireth to be sure of his
favour in Christ: he hath not a due estimation of having
peace with God and war with sin in himself, joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
to be freed from the torment of the conscience
condemning him according to the law, and withall a
desire and delight in the obedience of the Gospel joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together. 2. He doth inconsideratly exact of his
conscience, that his soul should be in the same dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
before peace be granted, and after that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
or that his affections should be stirred up one
and the same way in both these cases: for before peace
is given he cannot choose but he must have sorrow,
heavinesse of heart, unquietnesse, fear, and such like
other sad affections. But after that God granteth
peace, these perturbations are quieted, tormenting
fear ceaseth, lamentations are restrained, tears are
washen away in a good measure, and in their place,
do thanksgiving to, and praises of God succeed, and
every duty do call for their own place in a pacified
mind, so that the mans body be not neglected as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but care had of keeping health, for inabling to
do what is required of him in his calling toward every
one with whom he liveth: For, now his condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
changed, why should not his affections, and the
effects depending on them be changed also? Who can
reasonably exact the same duties of a man in a fight,
which he may require of him when he hath gotten the
victory? who can expect the same carriage from a
man when he is sick and when he is in health? Doth
not the Apostle say, <hi>Iam. 5, 13. If any man be afflicted
let him pray? Is any merry, let him sing Psalms.</hi>
               </p>

of conscience and faith under the sense of sin and fear

exercise? 3. Whether this peace hath followed after
prayer and supplication made to God for it, that he
might without fear of his enemies serve God all the
dayes of his life? 4. And last of all whether his heart
still inclineth and endeavoureth to give obedience to
the commands of God, and to be grieved for his short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
therein? If these things do concur which
beseem a convert, let him perswade himself his peace
which he hath censured for carnal security, is the solid
peace of God mistaken by him. And therefore, 1. let
him no more suspect the gift of God, but hold fast the
Word of God, which faith of the soul chased to Christ,
hath laid hold on, that being now justified by faith, he
may have peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. For, God doth
not give to his supplicant carnal security for peace, a
stone for bread, and an adder for fish. But, 2. let him
observe the wiles and malice of Sathan, who cannot
indure that the soul fled from him to Christ should have
peace, or in the enjoying of it blesse God for his gift
of grace. And, 3. let him study to make use of this
peace granted to him, going on in the obedience of Gods
commands chearfully, and to be ready for new conflicts
and assaults from Sathan, and not be afraid of being
deprived of the peace of God, while he by faith in
Christ is yoked in battel against sin which he seeth in
the world and feeleth in himself.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the case of a convert, taking some acts of justifying faith

               <p>THis case is like the former. Some true converts are,
who have fled to Christ for remission of sin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

made for sanctification and consolation, and full salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
after this life, in such a measure as doth suffice them
for encouragment to wrestle with difficulties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:40880:229"/>
with they may meet in their way to heaven. But when
the highest and most excellent priviledges of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
are presented to them, and come to be made use
of, such as are, <hi>sitting together with Christ in heavenly
places,</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hes. 2. 6. <hi>being co-heirs annexed with Iesus
Christ,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. <hi>So esteemed of,</hi> and loved by Christ,
<hi>that they who touch his Saints, do touch the apple of his eye,
Iudging the world and the damned Angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 3.
and such like other priviledges, they are at a stand, and
dar not apply these priviledges for fear of high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
               <p>2. Neither must we wonder that a soul should fall
in this exercise, and yet adhere to Christ as a convert and
true believer: For, when a sinner for fear of perdition
is chased to a Saviour, and dar not loose his grips lest
he fall in the pit, he may seem to himself to be in good
case if he get in to Christ, albeit he do not thrust himself
upon such high priviledges, and joyn himself with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and the Patriarchs and Prophets. Like unto <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth,</hi>
who judged himself to have found grace enough
at <hi>Davids</hi> hand, that his life was spared, but trembled
when he was priviledg'd to come to the Kings table, who,
in his own eyes, was like a dead dog for his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse,
as he judged of himself. Or like the prodigal
in the Gospel, who in his own eyes was not worthy to
be counted a child of the family, but content to be as
one of the hired servants in his fathers house. And
true it is, that the wonderfull largenesse of the promises
of the Gospel maketh the true convert, lately come forth
of the slavery of sin and Sathan, to stand so astonished,
that he dar not take to him so glorious titles, priviledges
and consolations as the Scripture doth allow him: yea,
when he would lift up himself to believe the glory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
he can no more apprehend the infinit love and
grace of God propounded and adjudged unto him,
then he can measure the heaven with his span, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
in his hand the great Globe, and round of heaven
and earth. From such a consideration was it, that
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40880:229"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> did at first utterly refuse to suffer Christ to wash
his feet; and that <hi>Martha,</hi> in the beginning of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with Christ, could not think of so great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
as the resurrection of her brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> before
the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>2. The convert in this case, doth wrong to himself
and to the Word of God, and to the liberality and rich
grace of God; for, so long as he suffereth himself to be
born down from imbracing, as safely he may, the rich
allowance of God upon a soul reconciled to him by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith in Christ, he not only cuts himself off from that
measure of joy of the holy Ghost which he may have,
but also giveth occasion and advantage to Sathan, to
brangle and call in question, whether the man hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
believed in Christ at all, or whether he hath laid
hold on Christ for righteousnesse and salvation by faith
un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ained; for, if it be presumption for a self-condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sinner, flying unto Christ by faith, to lay hold upon
the benefits which Christ hath prepared, purchased
and offered unto him upon this pretended reason, that
these benefits are so hudgely great, and the man so
small and unworthy in his own eyes, why may not
Sathan, with as great reason, (if there were any weight
in it) call it presumption for such a man to lay claim
unto Christ, who is greater then all his benefits, and so
beat him off from faith and confidence in Christ the
great gift of God, made of God, to poor sinners fled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, wisdom and righteousnesse, sanctification and
redemption?</p>
               <p>3. Wherefore, to help the convert in this condition,
let him consider, he doth well to be feared for presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for it is a fearfull evil: but, let him remember to
put due difference between presumption, and true faith
and confidence; for, 1, presumption is proud and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
up with self-conceit, but we pre-suppose the convert to
be humble and laid low in his own eyes, in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we are speaking of. 2. Presumption is secure and
negligent in the discharge of commanded duties; but
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:40880:230"/>
the convert we speak of, is about the use of the means,
and in some measure diligent in discharging command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
duties in his calling. 3. Presumption layeth hold
upon promises not made to the presumptuous, and
troubleth not it self with precepts and threatnings; but
the convert in this condition we are speaking of, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
both precepts and threatnings, and is so far from
putting forth his hand, without a warrant, unto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
that he stands aloof from laying hold on moe
promises, then he conceiveth necessar to save his soul
from hell. 4. The presumptuous promiseth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
felicity, albeit he walk in his own wayes, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the grace of God into lasciviousnesse, incouraging
himself to sin because God is mercifull; but this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
sheweth sin, and followeth the way which may
lead him to the possession of all promises. Therefore,
1. let the convert in this condition remember, that Christ
and all his benefits are so joyned together in the grant
of grace, that he may confidently say, with the Apostle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. that seing Christ is given to the believer
flying unto him, it cannot be but God with him will
give all things also. 2. Let him consider, that it is a
dangerous mater, not to give credit unto Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Word holden forth in one promise, as well as in
another: For, seing he is worthy to be believed in the
first promise, of receiving into favour a sinner flying
to Christ, why shall he not have the glory of truth and
grace in the rest of the promises, which belong to the
accomplishing of the full glorification of the man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.
3. And last of all, let the convert in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
consider, how near he draweth to a popish error
in this practice; for, Papists do measure the gifts of
God unto men, by the mans merit and well-deserving,
and not by meer grace only, and upon this ground do
reckon it presumption for any ordinar Christians to be
assured in this life, that God will guide them with his
counsel, and at their departure out of this life, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
receive them into glory. For, if the convert,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:40880:230"/>
being chased by the law to lay hold on Christ (who is
the end of the law for righteousnesse unto every one
that believeth) shall stand aback from laying hold on
the highest priviledges of Saints, and the greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
made to justified souls, because of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse,
doth he not say in effect, if I were more
worthy and like in holinesse unto such and such Saints, I
could be more confident to lay hold on these high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises:
which ground, if it be once holden, it makes the
reason of the mans confidence to be his own well-deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and not the meer and only grace of God the free
promiser thereof, and so the way of salvation by grace
should be undermined and over-turned: which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
because the Apostle, <hi>Ephes,</hi> 2. 8. saith, <hi>that by
grace we are saved through faith, and that not of our selves,
it is the gift of God.</hi> Therefore let not the humbled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
think it presumption to lay hold on Christ and the
fulnesse of all promised grace in him, how large so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the condition of the convert, fearing that the joy of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost which he hath felt, be found only to be either the
joy of speculation, common to temporal believers, or a meer
delusion.</head>
               <p>OF this sort also is this case, wherein the convert
doth suspect, that the joy of the Spirit which he
hath felt at some times was either a joy of speculation
or contemplation only, such as Philosophers may find
in their study of humane learning, or else a delusion of
Sathan also. This case may fall upon the true convert
in the time of affliction and felt desertion, when not
only the sense of consolation is withdrawn, but also
sorrow and heavinesse have seized on his spirit, when
the sharpnesse of affliction takes up the whole soul, and
sorrow doth fill the heart. At such a time the memory
of by-past joy is greatly darkned, and the sense of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:40880:231"/>
grief inflameth the whole man. For as it falleth
forth in a mans body, that both sweet and sour liquor,
do affect the sense of tasting most, when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
felt, but when they are past, the memory of
them doth affect the imagination only, and that but
lightly in comparison with present sense. As the sense
of a fiery coal doth otherwayes affect us when it touches
our flesh, then the memory of the pain we have felt, doth
move us when the pain is past; So it is in the passions
of the soul, for joyes spiritual shine for a while, when
they are lately raised up in the soul, but after a time
they are darkned, and in some sort worn out, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when grief doth arise, then they are swallowed up
with sorrow, or are well near forgotten, or lightly
esteemed and rejected: <hi>My soul refused comfort,</hi> saith
the Psalmist, <hi>Ps.</hi> 77. 2. Such was <hi>Davids</hi> condition,
<hi>Ps.</hi> 116. 11. when he <hi>said in his haste all men are lyars:</hi>
at which time, whatsoever joy he had felt, in believing
the promises made to him by <hi>Samuel</hi> or other Prophets,
he counted all to be but deceiving of him and delusion.</p>
               <p>This mistake is strengthened ordinarily by Sathans
tentation and wicked suggestion, watching upon all
occasions to traduce and slander all Gods words and
operations. The complaint of <hi>Ieremie</hi> savours of this
malicious suggestion, which the Prophet layeth out
before God to be rid of it, <hi>Ier. 20. 7. Thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me, and I was deceived.</hi> Yea, oft-times it cometh
to passe, that our old man and corrupt inclination
taketh part with Sathan, and when occasion doth
offer, scorneth all the spiritual affections of the new
man, as <hi>Ishmael</hi> mocked <hi>Isaacs</hi> devotion.</p>
               <p>2. This evil except it be speedily and solidly cured,
not only casteth the convert in a miserable condition, but
also calleth in question his state, whether at all he be
regenerat, reconciled and in the state of grace: for, if
the joy of the holy Spirit granted to the supplicant
praying to God in Christ, for confirmation of his faith,
granted to the mourner for sin, that he may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:40880:231"/>
shall be esteemed as the effect of speculation
only, then the comfort of the earnest-penny and first
fruits of the spirit is lost, the confirmation of faith by
that consolation is enervat and weakened; thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
formerly offered for the comfort sometime felt, is
recalled, and the testimony of Gods Spirit, speaking
according to the word in oft-repeated experience, is laid
aside. And so the afflicted soul shall seem to himself in
worse condition then when he was lying in his sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he shall seem to himself to have lost his labour
from the time that he renounced his sins. Wherefore
it is necessary, that this sicknesse be speedily cured, lest it
prevail.</p>
               <p>3. For remedy of this evil, let the afflicted lay aside
the dispute for a time whether his joyes and spiritual
experiences of the Lords working in him, have been
reall, as they sometime seemed, and let him turn his
eyes upon his present miserable confused condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
let him take a new view of his sins and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse,
let him observe Sathans malice, power and
wiles to weaken faith, and what need now he standeth
in of Christ Mediator, Redeemer Surety and Physician
by office, after a new discovery of his sinfulnesse; and
let him look upon the riches of the grace of God offered
in the Gospel to every hungry and thristy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul flying to
Christ for refuge, and let him say to God, Lord there
was never a time wherein I had more need of Christ for
righteousnesse and salvation, behold I flye unto thee, I
welcome and embrace Christ offered in the Gospel, and
heartily do consent unto the covenant of grace through
him, and do accept, embrace and relye upon remission
of sins through him, and the imputation of his satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
righteousnesse, made over to such as flye unto
him, or else I should perish utterly, and do give up
my self to thee, that thou mayest write thy law more
powerfully on my heart. By this means the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the afflicteds interest in the covenant of Grace
shall be more fixed and made sure to him, and Sathan
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:40880:232"/>
disappointed of his design to cast the afflicted by his
tentations in mis-belief, and separation from Christ.</p>
               <p>4. Thus when he hath renewed the grips of faith in
Christ, let him now enter the lists, and dispute the
solidity of his former felt experiences, by discussing the
objections which did weaken his estimation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
felt joyes of the Spirit. One objection against
them was, because they were of short endurance, and
therefore seemed not solid. The answer may be this,
The short staying of the joy of the Spirit is no proof
against it, as not true joy; for, it is sufficient earnest
of the promised salvation, if when the Word of God
in the Gospel speaketh peace to the man fled to Christ
he findeth the Word believed to be confirmed to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
by peace and joy, albeit the sense of it remain
but a short while; <hi>After you believed,</hi> saith the Apostle,
<hi>you were sealed with the spirit of promise,</hi> Ephes. 1. 11.
As it is not sufficient to prove, that wholsom water
given to a feaver-sick person is not a wholsom drink,
because the cooling refreshment by it, endureth but a
short while; So it is not sufficient to prove, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
and joy given to a sorrowfull sinner, seeking
favour through Christ, is not solid and true joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it stayeth but a short while. It is sufficient, that
it hath stayed so long as was needfull; for, after the
word of promise was believed, the joy was sent to ease
the afflicted souls present grief, and to give him earnest,
that full and lasting joy should be given in due time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. When the messenger hath done his commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
let him return to his master. As the sheet let down
in the vision from heaven to <hi>Peter,</hi> after it had served
for <hi>Peters</hi> instruction, it was taken up to heaven again,
<hi>Act.</hi> 10. The Spouse in the <hi>Canticle</hi> knew by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that her spiritual joyes would not last long, and
therefore chargeth the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that they
waken not her beloved till he pleased.</p>
               <p>5. Another objection is this. If my joy had been
solid (saith the afflicted) it should have brought forth
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:40880:232"/>
better fruits then it hath done; but joy spiritual, as I
then called it, did degenerat into a carnal security, and
I was not the more holy by it. To which objection the
answer may be this, the blame of this is not to be laid
on spiritual joy, but upon the abuse of this mercy, by
ingratitude for this gracious blink of felt favour, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in the use of means to entertain this sense, by
sleepinesse of conscience and other sins, and namely the
laying too much weight upon this sense, and not fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heart by so much more upon the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
when felt consolation may be withdrawn, is a just
cause; for, spiritual joy is not given to any to build
upon its continuance, but to make the convert hold the
confirmed word of promise so much the faster, when for
the exercise of faith, comfortable feelings are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn.
The spouse in the <hi>Canticle</hi> after a feast of this
kind, falleth a sleep, and giveth slight entertaining to
the Bridegroom when called upon by his word, for
which she is chastised, by his withdrawing of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
presence, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. But let us put
the case, that the felt joy of the spirit were not abused,
yet is it not unusual for God to withdraw consolation,
and to send trouble and anguish on the soul of his dear
child, to try his faith and train him on to hold the
word of his grace, in the hardest condition he can be
into, as he did exercise <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> the Prophet,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 20. and the Psalmist, <hi>Ps.</hi> 77. In which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to suspect that the consolation and joy of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
speaking to the heart by his word, is not his gracious
operation, or is a delusion, cannot but exceedingly
grieve the Lord, and give him cause to chastise this
suspicion with desertion.</p>
               <p>6. But how may I know, saith the afflicted, that my
joy was solid and was indeed the gracious operation of
the holy Spirit? For answer, 1. If this joy was given
to him when, or after, he was lamenting his sins, and
fearing wrath deserved, and flying unto Christ offered
in the Gospel, he hath reason to reckon that joy to be
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:40880:233"/>
such as the Word of the Gospel doth promise and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.
2. If during the time of his sweet feeling of peace
and joy through Christ, he found his faith in God, and
love to Christ confirmed and strengthned, if the Word
of the Gospel was in more estimation with him, if his
heart was inlarged to blesse, praise and thank God for
manifesting himself in Christ reconciled, if the purpose
of following after holinesse was renewed in him, he
hath no reason to suspect his joy and comfort. 3. If
after the removing of this sweet feeling he is going on in
the study of holinesse, believing in Christ, how heavy
in heart soever he may be, by affliction and tentation,
he may be assured his sometime felt joy of the Lords
Spirit was solid, and his present suspicion thereof to be
an evidence of his infirmity, and of a tentation from
Sathan. This was the way how the Psalmist wrestled
out of his sad condition, <hi>Ps.</hi> 77.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the converts suspecting, that his zeal for God and against
the sins of others hath been fleshly severity and imprudent
temerity</head>
               <p>IT cometh to passe, that they who love God sincerely,
and cannot endure the out-breakings of the wicked,
do sometimes transgresse the bounds of moderat zeal,
and being overtaken in some miscarriage, for which
being rebuked by their friends, or by them in power
censured or civilly chastised, do in stead of moderating
their zeal in time coming, grow more slack and remisse
in their zeal, suspecting themselves inclined to unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
severity and rashnesse, and ready to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
haters of mens persons by those among whom they
live, as in some by-gone experience they have already
felt. And upon this occasion the tentation of Sathan
falleth on, tending to extinguish the fervency of true
zeal required in all true converts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:40880:233"/>
And here there is danger lest true zeal grow cold,
and the convert become luke-warm, both in curbing
sin in others under his charge, and in pursuing duties
in his own person. In which sicknesse he may be the
better pleased with himself, by so much as his friends
and others do commend him for his moderation and
prudence, as they shall call it.</p>
               <p>2. As to the remedy of this evil, there is no doubt,
but that may befall true zeal, which is common to
other vertues, of which there is none so perfect, but
some in-lake or excesse may be observed in them. And
therefore, as it is without reason to go back from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
duty in the exercise of other vertues, because im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
therein are remarkable from time to time,
So is it without reason to grow luke-warm in zeal
which may render a man loathsome unto Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi>
2. 3. Wherefore let the convert take heed what the
Lords Word doth require of him in his calling, and
labour to discharge his duty towards others, so as he
may be found both zealous and prudent, that in the
expressions of his zeal against sin, meeknesse and love
to the offender may be manifested. 2. To this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
let the convert carefully take heed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
these three properties of commendable zeal,
which are, 1. The fear of God. 2. Humility of heart.
3. The love of his neighbour: for, the <hi>fear</hi> of God
will not suffer the convert to depart from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;
<hi>Humility</hi> of heart will make the man mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
in his expressions; and the <hi>love</hi> of his neighbour
will make him mix meeknesse and compassion toward
sinners with his zeal against offences. This is the right
seasoning of zeal, which the Apostle calleth the zeal
of God according to knowledge.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the converts suspecting his aiming at circumspect walking,
shall be found in him scrupulosity.</head>
               <p>SOmetime it cometh to passe, that the convert, being
under hard exercise before his consolation, doth put
on the whole armour of God, and studieth to walk
circumspectly for a while, but after a time he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
somewhat weary of the yoke, suspecting he hath
given too much way unto scrupulosity, whereupon he
becometh more remisse and slack in his watchfulnesse
and diligence, laying aside the armour of God, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
laid aside the armour of King <hi>Saul,</hi> wherewith he
was not accustomed.</p>
               <p>For satisfying himself in this course, I presuppone
he maketh use of three pretended reasons. The first is,
because it is impossible for any man to attain to such
circumspection in his carriage as becometh him: for,
it is no lesse then to aim at perfect obedience of the law,
which the Apostle hath declared to be impossible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the weaknesse of the flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. The
next pretended reason is, because this bending of a
mans spirit maketh the conscience unquiet, that a man
cannot injoy the peace of God granted in the Gospel.
The third pretended reason is, because it doth restrain
christian liberty in many things lawfull, so as a man
can neither make use of recreation of body, or mind
without scruple; and here we must beware on the one
hand lest we give way to any degree of mis-regarding
the law, which is the error of the Antinomians; and
on the other hand, lest we insnare the conscience of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
and hinder them in the lawfull use of what God
doth allow unto them.</p>
               <p>2. For remedy of this evil, let the convert know
that there is a necessity of aiming at circumspect walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This duty is indispensable: for, if a chink be
opened here in the vessel for the least entry of water, it
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:40880:234"/>
may ere long fill and sink the whole ship: for, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
standeth unmoveable, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b. 12. 14. Follow peace
with all men and holiness, without which no man shall see
the Lord.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 15. As he that hath called you
is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation.</hi> And,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 48. Christ hath said, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your father
in heaven is perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ground being laid, let us examine these three
pretended reasons. As to the first, albeit the attaining
unto the perfect obedience of the Law in this life be
impossible, because of the infirmity of corrupt nature;
yet, the aiming at the perfect obedience of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
is both possible and profitable, and he who aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at perfection of obedience in this life, shall attain
it fully in the life to come. It is one thing to <hi>give per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
obedience unto the Law, for in many things we do
sin all of us; another thing <hi>to endeavour,</hi> according to
the measure of grace given, to obey the Law perfectly.
For, God, who hath loosed converts, fled to Christ, from
the convenant of Works or the covenant of the Law,
he hath not loosed his subjects from obedience to the
Law-giver, he hath not abolished the ten Commands,
he hath not loosed the duties of the redeemed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
souls, but by receiving them in favour through
faith in Christ, he doth augment their obligation to
serve the Lord their Redeemer, so much more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and carefully, as the grace is large in forgiving
them their sins, and translating them from the slavery
of sin and Sathan, into the kingdom of Christ.</p>
               <p>Again, albeit it be true, that it is impossible to attain
perfect obedience unto the Law, yet there is great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to be had by circumspect walking and aiming
at perfect obedience: for, this, 1. doth glorifie our
heavenly Father, when we strive to be conform to his
will and to have respect to all his commands. 2. This
endeavour adorneth the Gospel and profession of our
most holy faith, whereby we lay hold on the grace of
free justification, that we may become the servants of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:40880:235"/>
righteousnesse indeed. 3. This endeavour beareth
witnesse of our since<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> desire to serve God with all our
heart, albeit we attain not to the perfection of obedience
in this life. 4. This endeavour giveth unto us daily,
new mater of humiliation, when in our aiming at our
duty, we come very short of our mark we shoot at.
5. This endeavour and short-coming, for all we can do,
maketh us despair of seeking justification by works
before God, and to esteem highly, and make use by faith,
of Christs satisfaction for us imputed to us for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
which is a garment able to hide our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and nakednesse. 6. This endeavour to walk
circumspectly, puts us to the exercise of all christian
graces, and to strive with others and with our selves, to
perfect holinesse in the fear of God.</p>
               <p>3. As for the second pretended reason, that this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
to walk circumspectly, may make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
unquiet, it puts a foul aspersion on the holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 15, 16, 17. who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
this to be a mans wisdom, and so a good mean
of making his conscience quiet, and to establish in it
the peace of God: For, by this endeavour, to walk
circumspectly, believers in Christ are assured, that they
are without the reach of condemnation, because they
walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.
Secondly, this endeavour is the evidence of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which accompanyeth true faith, and in a maner,
doth guard the conscience from just challenges which
might trouble the same. Thirdly, by this endeavour,
the believer is, by a holy necessity, forced to cleave closse
unto Christ, to converse with him in heaven, that the
pollution of daily sin may be washen away, by new
application of Christs expiarory sacrifice to the believer,
and that Christ may let forth more strength to him to
walk in the way of commanded duties, and so the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
may stand in the grace of God. Thus the peace
of God, offered and covenanted in the Gospel, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in him, so long as this endeavour, to walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly,
is entertained.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:40880:235"/>
4. As for the third pretended reason against circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
walking, as if by it Christian-liberty shall be
crossed and cut short, it is a false pretense; for, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair
is true, that Christian-liberty is not hurt, but helped
and preserved, by circumspect walking: for, this is <hi>true
Christian-liberty,</hi> to have allowance of the use of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
which God doth bestow with his blessing, so far
as may serve our well-fare; seing it is not a point of
Christian-liberty, licentiously, by intemperance, to abuse
Gods benefits, and turn them to our own hurt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let our heart be all day in the fear of God, that
we may, in lawfull manner, make use of lawfull things;
neither doth the study of holinesse make recreations of
body and mind unlawfull, but restraineth immoderat
and untimeous use of things lawfull. All that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
liberty granteth unto us, is, that whether we eat or
drink, or what lawfull thing else we do, we do all for
the glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. that is, so as we may
be strengthened and set forward, to glorifie God in
Christ in necessar duties. As for the maner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to be keeped in the use of things lawfull, prudence
must be asked of God, who will direct us in this as in
other Christian duties.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Concerning the converts suspicion, that his softness of heart
is nothing but a natural disposition to weep upon any
occasion.</head>
               <p>VVHen the Lord hath taken away from the sinner
a heart of stone, and hath given unto him a
heart of flesh, so that he dar not any more harden him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against the threatnings of Gods Word, but doth
tremble at the hearing thereof, as speaketh <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 66. 2.
and in his prayer doth pour forth his heart ordinarily
with tears, he may (as experience hath taught) fall in
a suspicion of this ordinar or frequent melting of heart,
as if it were nothing else but a childish or woman-like
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:40880:236"/>
temper of body and spirit, and no evidence of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for spiritual causes, which the Scripture requireth
and commendeth in the penitent.</p>
               <p>2. In this case there is danger on either hand, if the
convert be not wary and circumspect in this condition;
for, on the one hand he is in hazard of making light
account of the work of God, who hath taken from him
the heart of stone, and given him an heart of flesh. On
the other hand, he is in hazard of laying too much
weight on his tears, if once he be satisfied about the
suspicion he hath of his own tears, and made clear, that
they were proofs and evidences of his sincerity in his
prayers to God.</p>
               <p>That there is a danger on either hand, experience hath
taught; for, some sincere converts, having entertained
the suspicion, that their tears in prayer proceeded from
the soft temper of their natural complexion &amp; dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of spirit, have resisted their inclination to mourn, and
striven against letting forth of tears so far, that they have
become so dry for a long time, and have prayed more
perfunctoriously then before, that when just causes of
grief and tears were given unto them, they were not
able to bring forth one tear for easing of their grieved
heart. On the other hand, experience hath taught, that
some, looking upon the expressions of the Saints in
Scripture concerning their tears, have laid so much
weight upon their tears, as they have numbered, in a
manner, all the drops of their eyes, and from the lesse
or more quantity of them, made reckoning of their
own better or worse condition, and of Gods accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their prayers lesse or more.</p>
               <p>3. This tendernesse of heart, and easinesse to be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto tears, for spiritual motives, is a rare gift. Few
they are, who with sense of the body of death and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin bearing them down, do lament their natural
sinfulnesse in their best condition with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 24.
Few shall be found so affectionat, to the glory of God
and salvation of peoples souls, as to pour out tears both
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:40880:236"/>
in secret and openly, for promoving thereof, as the
Apostle did, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 19, 21. and, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. Few
like <hi>Timothy,</hi> whose heart was so tender, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
could not but observe his tears, and remember them,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4. Yet, we doubt not, that from age to age
sundry be, who by the grace of God have this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
melting heart, according to the measure of Gods
free donation, some with tears, some without tears.
And therefore, if there be found in such mourners, an
honest endeavour to walk circumspectly, let not the
suspicion, that their tendernesse is but natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of spirit or bodily complexion, be entertained.
Only let the giver of the grace of a tender heart be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
upon, and not their tears, as if they were any more
then witnesses of their honest affection in spiritual
exercises; for, such prayers may prove sincere and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, both when they cannot mourn, and
also when their heart seemeth withered, hard and dry.</p>

            <div n="17" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Concerning the converts suspicion, that all his devotion is
but lip-labour which is not joyned with a tender and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heart, and with Gods sensible approbation.</head>
               <p>AS some are suspicious of their condition, because
of their ordinar tendernesse and melting of heart;
So other some are suspicious of their condition, because
they find not their heart tender and soft in their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
All converts do agree in this, that God must be
worshiped in spirit and truth, and that it is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
worship to God, if a man draw near him with
his lips, when his heart is far from him: whereupon,
every convert, when he is mindfull of his duty, goeth
about to worship God with understanding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
affection of heart, to confesse sin, deprecat wrath,
ask of God things necessar, interceed for others, give
thanks to God for his benefits, and praise him for his
works and working, so as his affections may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:40880:237"/>
to his expressions, and the conscience may approve
both his words and his hearty affections, and God may,
with his peace and consolation, approve the worshiper.
But some converts are, who, albeit in sincerity they
worship God, yet they count all their devotion to be
but lip-labour, except they find their affections waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up and their heart tender, and some vigour of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
life in their exercises, and the sense of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of their worship, by giving sense of his
peace and consolation to them in their worship. Hence
oft-times doth suspicion arise, without just ground,
that they are deserted of God, that he is displeased with
them; and this suspicion being entertained, doth send
forth complaints, and bringeth on coldrifenesse in prayer
and discouragement.</p>
               <p>2. This unjust suspicion of the grace of prayer, the
Lord doth oft-times chastise by with-drawing peace
and comfort, and order in prayer and of words also,
that he who complained that his devotion was but lip-labour,
because he sound not such measure of affection
as he would have had, nor that consolation which he
wished to have, shall find himself in worse taking after
his complaining, then he was in at first, when he began
to suspect his condition. It is true, that confusion of
mind, and want of words to expresse the case wherein
he is, may fall on a convert, by reason of afflictions and
manifold temptations, and yet he may be free from this
suspicion of Gods affection and acceptation of his
person and prayers; as the Apostle doth teach us,
<hi>Rom. 8. 26. Likewayes, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities;
for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the
Spirit it self maketh intercession for us, with groanings which
cannot be uttered.</hi> But when this cutting short of the
gift of prayer, in any measure, doth follow after suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of Gods respect and good will toward the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and discouraged convert, it is a fatherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement
from God, threatning the convert with a
greater measure of desertion and heavier temptation,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:40880:237"/>
except he repent his folly and return to God, whom
by his suspicion and misbelief he hath offended.</p>
               <p>3. For remedy of this evil, these five things must
be distinguished by the afflicted convert; 1. the labour
of the lips, or formality in prayer or devotion; 2. prayer
in faith; 3. prayer with felt and observed affection in
prayer; 4. prayer approven of God; 5. prayer with
the sense and feeling of Gods approbation.</p>
               <p>As to the first, the labour of the lips, or formality in
prayer which the Scripture doth condemn, is when a
man prayeth with his mouth for things necessar or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and is about the external work of devotion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he pleaseth himself, and doth rest upon the work
wrought without affection of heart or faith, as we
see, <hi>Is.</hi> 58. 1, 2, 3. and this is not the case of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
of whom we are speaking; for, because he esteems
his devotion to be but a formality, he is displeased with
himself and is unquiet.</p>
               <p>As to the second, prayer in faith, is when the convert
misseth freedom of speech, and answerable affection to
his speech in his devotion in prayer, praises, thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
intercession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet, because the duty is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
he doth offer it up to God with hope of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
and yet is displeased with himself, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in the sense of his coldrife affections, which is the
duty of the convert of whom we are speaking, but
the not esteeming this his devotion through Christ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
is his fault.</p>
               <p>As to the third; prayer or devotion with felt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in discharging it, is when the convert poureth
out his heart unto God with fredom of speech, and yet
cannot be quiet, because he doth not feel any sign of
Gods approbation of him and hearing of his suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and this was the case of the Psalmist in sundry
Psalms. But this is not the case of the convert we are
speaking of; for, he complaineth of the hardnesse of
his heart and want of affection, and doth weaken his
own faith, which is his fault.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:40880:238"/>
As to the fourth; prayer approven of God, is
when the convert doth offer his devotion to God in
sincerity, and prayeth for what is promised, in hope to be
heard and answered in due time. And this prayer or
devotion is approven by God in Scripture, whether
the convert be satisfied with the measure of answerable
affection to his words, or not, as the Apostle testifieth.
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 14, 15. And this should be observed by the
convert, of whom we are speaking, for rectifying his
judgment and quieting of him, albeit he neither find
his affection moved as he would, nor find consolation
from God as he would.</p>
               <p>As to the fifth; prayer or devotion, with the sense
and feeling of Gods approbation, is when God not
only approveth the converts prayer and devotion,
by his Word in the Scripture, but also by his Spirit
doth sensibly comfort the supplicant, and sends him to
his calling with joy. So did he deal oft-times with
the Psalmist <hi>David,</hi> and so did he comfort <hi>Samuels</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in, and after her prayer, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. This is the
thing which the convert we speak of would be at, and
which would satisfie him if he could come to it.</p>
               <p>4. This condition is the sweetest to the supplicant,
and much to be desired, with submission to Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
whatsoever it be, but it is not the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
acceptable to God, as we see, 1 <hi>Ioh. 5. 14. 15.
This is the confidence which we have in God, that if we ask
any thing according to his will he heareth us, and if we know
that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask we know we have the
petitions that we desired of him.</hi> And that the mater is
so, may be perceived in <hi>David's</hi> condition at sundry
times; for, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119, seven or eight times he prayeth,
<hi>Quicken thou me according to thy word.</hi> He findeth in
himself much deadnesse of spirit, yet he continueth
meekly praying to be quickened in the service of God.</p>
               <p>5. Wherefore, so oft as the convert is displeased for
any defect he findeth in his devotion, let him, 1. hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himself in the sense of his imperfection, and betake
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:40880:238"/>
himself so much the more to the intercession of Christ,
and lay hold more firmly upon the satisfaction made
by the Mediatour, and draw by faith grace for grace
out of his fulnesse, and let him in faith and sincerity
worship God, and live holily in his conversation and
not be afraid that his devotion shall be esteemed of
God to be but lip-labour. 2. To this end, let him
rightly construe Gods dispensation, and consider that
his gifts are wisely given forth for the good of his
people: for, sometime he giveth to will that which is
good, without ability for the time to effectuat what
the convert willeth; he may give a willing heart to
pray affectionatly, and not for the time grant ability
to pray as his child would, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. Sometime he
may give no more but to sigh and groan, without abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to expresse the confused desires of his heart, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 26, 27. Sometime he will suggest words, and make
the supplicant in sincerity of faith present the words put
in his mouth, <hi>Hos,</hi> 14. 1. 2. Sometime he will grant
to the supplicant to bear out much disputation in his
prayers, without sensible consolation, <hi>Ps.</hi> 77. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
he will grant the supplicant a loosed heart in
prayer and abundance of tears, and yet seem for a time
not to regard them, <hi>Ps.</hi> 6. Sometime he will grant
confidence and consolation to the supplicant, as, <hi>Ps.</hi> 6.
and many other <hi>Psalms.</hi> And certainly, the variety of
divine dispensation to his children cannot be told; in
all which, he requires of his supplicants meek submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and perseverance in prayer, with confidence to
find a good answer at last: for, if his child do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
well of the measure which is bestowed on him, he
may readily find the measure he complained of, more

               <head type="sub">Concerning the converts looking upon the sight of his faith,
as if it were the failing of his faith.</head>
               <p>SIncere faith in Christ is the special grace of God,
given to the elect only; which grace, the more we
do exercise it, the more we please God: for, without
faith it is impossible to please him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. This
saving grace the Lord taketh pleasure to put it unto try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and exercise, that thereby he may train it on, and
foster and increase it, and bring it forth to light, both
for his own glory and for the commendation of his
children, as is told us, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. In which exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
the true convert is oft-times much mistaken, and
doth mis-construe his condition. The reasons are, 1:
the faith of young converts is very imperfect, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is many wayes darkened, and the application of
promises is very weak. 2. When Sathan by his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
obscures the truth, which should strengthen
faith, the convert finding himself in the mist, may be at
a stand, till his sight be cleared up and he freed from the
tentation. 3. The sincere convert, in the conscience
of his own imperfection, and consideration of the
deceitfulnesse of the heart, is wary and suspicious, that
he may be easily deceived, and take historical or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
faith for true saving faith, and so doth readily lay
hold on Sathans suggestions against the sincerity of his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith. 4. In the conflict, which his faith oft-times hath
with mis-belief, strengthened by Sathans tentations,
he finds himself now and then foiled by yielding unto
the suggestion of Sathan; as <hi>Davids</hi> experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
may befall both the elder and younger souldiers,
<hi>Ps. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>6. 11. I said in my haste, all men are lyars,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Samuel</hi> and other Prophets, who promised to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
in Gods name he should be King. 5. In the fight
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:40880:239"/>
of faith, some infirmity is alwayes manifested, and the
convert is forced to acknowledge, that his faith is not
so strong as he supposed it to be before the fight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he is ready to suspect his fight in faith to be a
fainting and decaying in faith. 6. Sometime the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
by giving way to sin, doth grieve the holy Spirit,
and provoke him to withdraw his comfortable testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
which he gave in former time to the convert,
which bringeth him into suspicion of the sincerity of
his faith, which seemed to himself sound and unfained
before.</p>
               <p>2. This case is both troublesome to the convert and
dangerous; for, till it be cured, it groweth like a rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
feaver, and sets upon the vital power of justifying
faith, and at least hindereth the exercise thereof not a
little.</p>
               <p>For remedy whereof, let the afflicted convert put
difference between an infirm faith, and felt infirmity
in faith fighting: for, albeit the convert, in the conflict
of faith against tentations to mis-belief, do feel infirmity,
yet is not his faith to be accounted infirm simply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
whatsoever infirmity he feels in his fight, yet his
fighting against tentations proveth his faith to be so
much the stronger, as he resisteth mis-belief and cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
closer to Christ.</p>
               <p>2. Let him consider, that the Lord suffereth his child
to be exercised with tentations, of set purpose to
humble him, and empty him of all confidence in his
own wisdom, righteousnesse and strength, that he may
gather strength in his fighting, by Scripture, holden up
to God in prayer, and so wax valiant in fight, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
have been helped before, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 34.</p>
               <p>3. Let the convert put difference between faith and a
setled perswasion: for, setled and full perswasion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all dubitation for the time, But saving faith may
may be where doubting is and unbelief is felt; as the
father of the possessed child in his prayer to Christ mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
manifest, <hi>Lord, I believe,</hi> saith he, <hi>help my unbelief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:40880:240"/>
4. Let him put difference between dubitation sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
and faith striving to overcome dubitation: for,
dubitation bewrayeth infirmity of faith, but striving
against dubitation, doth evidence life and vigour in
faith to be present, and is acceptable service to God.</p>
               <p>5. Let him put difference between the doubting of
the truth of the promise and the weak griping of it; for
he that doubts of the truth of the promise, is, (<hi>Iam.</hi> 1.
6, 7.) like a wave of the sea, and can expect nothing,
But he that layes hold on the promise, with a trembling
hand, and striveth to hold it fast against doubting, may
expect to obtain.</p>
               <p>6. Let him put difference between his suspicion of
the failing of his faith and the right judging of it: for,
in the mean time of his fighting and fear of failing, he
goeth on in exercise of faith, fearing to succumb, yet
resolute not to depart from Christ: In the love and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of whose grace, he goeth on and groweth, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the victory and for a nearer felt fellowship with
him; which if he did observe and consider, his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be rectified.</p>
               <p>Last of all, let him put difference between a hasty
apprehension of the failing of his faith, and a fixed
opinion that his faith is but fancy: for, a strong souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
may be surprized on a suddain (as <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 31. 22.
and <hi>Ps.</hi> 116. 11. and <hi>Ionah,</hi> 2. 3, 4. do furnish instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
who shortly after did gather their courage and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the lists afresh, and became victorious against their
tentations unto misbelief.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the wrestler be of good courage; for,
nothing can prove the sincerity of his faith more then
his wrestling against distrust, and his looking towards
Christ through all the clouds which hinder his sight,
and his sorrowing for his unbelief, for his weak hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grip of the covenant of grace, and for his inability
to glorifie the truth of the Gospel, and rich grace of
God offered in Christ: Especially when he consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that the Spirit of Christ commendeth the exercise
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:40880:240"/>
of faith, with variety of temptations, for a mater of
great joy, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 2, 3.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning the converts straitning his charity toward others,
more then he did at the first time of his conversion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his former larger charity, was unwarrantable
folly.</head>
               <p>ALl converts must agree to Christs saying, <hi>Ioh. 13. 35.
By this shall all men know, that ye are my disciples, if
ye have love one to another.</hi> No man doubteth of this
his duty in general; but sundry make question about
the exercise and expression of their charity: for, some
conceive, that their former charity (in the mater of
judging of others, and in the mater of affection to
others, and in the mater of actual expression of their
charity) hath been ill bestowed toward unworthy and
ill-deserving persons. And this they reckon to have
been folly; and therefore do resolve to dispose of their
judgement, affection and good deeds more prudently
then they have done, that their charitable estimation,
affection and expression actual, shall be drawn forth
toward the worthy and well-deserving disciples of their
acquaintance, thus they condemn for folly what was
right indeed. The main pretenses of reason for their
resolution, are two. The first is, because they perceive
many whom they judge wise and godly, to exclude
from the number of believers, or disciples of Christ,
all in whom the evident signs of regeneration do not
appear, and so do think they may draw the circle of
their charity in strait and narrow bounds, and may shun
to keep Church-fellowship in the pure Ordinances of
Christ with any, save approven visible Saints. The
other pretense is, because they have found themselves
oft-times deceived by those, of whom sometime they
have entertained good thoughts, and no small esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:40880:241"/>
1. As for the first pretense, it belongs to the question
of the constitution of visible Churches, whether it be
founded upon visible Sanctity or evidences of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
or upon visible entering in the external cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, and profession of subjection to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Discipline of Christ. Of which question,
there is enough written by learned and godly men, and
and in this place it doth not fall in conveniently to be
disputed.</p>
               <p>2. Concerning the other pretense, of being oft-times
deceived by sundry, such as were unworthy of respect;
we grant, that there are many hypocrits who pretend
to be Saints, and worthy to be blamed in that respect:
and it is no wonder, that the charity of many wax cold,
when so many speak vanity, every man to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<hi>Ps.</hi> 12. 2. for this our Lord foretold, <hi>Mat. 24. 12.
Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
cold.</hi> Yet, it is not iustifiable to cut charity short, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of mens ill-deserving; <hi>Rivers of tears,</hi> saith <hi>David,
run down my eyes, because they keep not thy Commands.</hi>

               <p>1. <hi>Ob.</hi> But some may say, the same Psalmist did hate
the wicked and profane. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. But he did so with
a perfect hatred, not with a carnal and corrupt hatred
against their persons, but with a spiritual and sincere
hatred, tending to the abolishing of their vice and safety
of their persons; for which end, the Psalmist presenteth
his affections to be examined of God, and teacheth
men, by his example, to purifie their hearts in hating
sinners. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

2. <hi>Ob.</hi> But, put case, saith one, that I am a civil Judge,
shall my charity hinder justice and cutting off male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
man-slayers, or others such-like? <hi>Ans.</hi> Not;
for, charity to the malefactor may stand with the love
of Justice and the Common-wealth, when the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
is adjudged to death. For, when <hi>Ioshua</hi> was
to destroy <hi>Achan,</hi> he exhorted him to repent and give
glory to God, that his soul might be saved, <hi>Ios.</hi> 7. 19.
Likewayes, the Prophets, when they denounced the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Cities and Nations, had melting hearts in
compassion toward them who were condemned by
God, <hi>Is. 16. 11. Ier,</hi> 48. 36. and Christ our Lord,
charity it self, weeped for the misery of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinat
justly to destruction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Obj.</hi> But, (saith he) a special regard must be had
toward believers in the exercise of charity, <hi>Gal. 6. 10.
Ans.</hi> It is true; but the Apostles words are, <hi>As we have
opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them
that are of the housheld of faith.</hi> Which houshold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
of all them, who by profession have subjected
themselves to the doctrine and discipline of Christ, and
are members of the visible Church.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Ob.</hi> But (saith he) as all that are of <hi>Israel,</hi> are
not the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. So all that are in
the visible Church, are not of the houshold of God.
<hi>Ans.</hi> Who hath made thee a Judge either to discern
who are elect, who not? or to discern what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of this man or that man, whereby thou may
abandon charity toward him? God hath given to us
his Spirit, saith the Apostle, that we may know what
saving grace he hath given to <hi>our selves,</hi> but not to know
what he hath bestowed on <hi>others. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11.
God, who only searcheth the secrets of all hearts, hath
reserved the judgements of mens hearts to himself, and
he alone can discern who is the hypocrit, and in whose
heart there is no guil.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Ob.</hi> But (saith he) the judgment of charity i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
not blind, but should be according as the truth is;
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:40880:242"/>
otherwayes, I shall esteem a man a true convert, who
is not regenerat, and so deceive my self. <hi>Ans.</hi> The
judgment of charity, concerning other mens inward
estate and condition, is not one alwayes with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to verity; for, the rule of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of charity, is equity and commanded duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the judgment according to verity to God. For
this distinction the Apostle gives ground, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6, 7.
in charity judging all the Philippians to be sincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts;
he saith, his speech and estimation of them was
according as <hi>was meet</hi> for him to think. Now equity
required, that he should judge the best of them all, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he did not know the hearts of them all, as he saith,
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. charity <hi>believeth all things, hopeth all things,
endureth all things.</hi> But, for the judgment of other
mens estate and condition in grace, according to verity,
he doth forbid men to judge before the time, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 3. 5.
Rom. 14. 4. Iam.</hi> 4. 12. And, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 12. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
speaking in charity of <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> saith, he is <hi>a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
brother, as I suppose.</hi> 2. If we see it our duty to
show charity to our neighbour, whatsoever he be, our
charity is not blind, but clear-sighted.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Ob.</hi> But (saith he) mens profanity, wickednesse
and atheisme, may clearly be seen; for, the Psalmist
saith, <hi>The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart,
that there is no fear of God before his eyes,</hi> Ps. 36. 1. and
Christ, speaking of false Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 16. saith,
<hi>Ye shall know them by their fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What the Prophet saith by the Spirit, and what
Christ saith, is true; and we grant, that mens ill deeds
and corrupt doctrine, do be wray their naughty inward
disposition: but what serveth this to justifie thy rash
judgment of thy brother, that there is no saving work
of grace in him, because they cannot perceive the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
signes thereof in him, in whom possibly thou can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find any reigning vice, or open out-breaking scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals?
What doth this serve to hinder expressions and
fruits of charity toward open sinners, so long as God
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:40880:242"/>
waiteth patiently on their repentance? It is one thing
to be wary, lest we be infected with the contagion of
mens ill maners or corrupt doctrine; another thing to
cut them off from being the objects of our charity.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Ob.</hi> But we are forbidden (saith he) to have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with sinners who may intise us to sin, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 11.
and to make friendship with an angry man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 22. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This warinesse may consist with charity: for,
albeit we cannot be partakers with evil workers, or
enter in needlesse familiarity with those with whom we
cannot converse and be free of damnage from them, yet
we may not exclude them from the object of our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or carry our selves so toward them, as they can
take no good from our hand: for, so long as we live in
the world, we must follow peace with all men and
holinesse, <hi>Heb. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 10,</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Obj.</hi> Albeit it be true, that we must in common
duties of civility and humanity, prudently behave our
selves, yet we must carry otherwayes to professed
Christians, if their conversation be grosly scandalous;
for, with such we are forbidden to eat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This place pertains to the exercise of the key of
discipline, and execution of the censure of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
judicially pronounced by the Church; as, <hi>ver.</hi>
12. following, doth declare. And this, as it doth not
cut off natural duties of parents, or children, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
married one to another, So it can well consist with
charity toward the excommunicat, who, in order to
his salvation, should be thus dealt with, that he may
be humbled and brought to repentance: And so doth
the Apostle give warrand; for when he hath given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to excommunicat such as walk disorderly, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi>
3. 14, 15. he subjoines, for keeping charity to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicat
person, saying, <hi>Count him not as an enemy,
but admonish him as a brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. <hi>Obj.</hi> But I (saith he) have been mistaken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
oft-times when I esteemed charitably of some,
loved them dearly, and bestowed not sparingly on those
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:40880:243"/>
who proved afterward unworthy of such respect and
dealing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Our Lords words may satisfie this objection,
promising whatsoever is done to a disciple, in name
of a disciple, shall not want a reward. Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
needs not count thy self deceived in this respect.
But, if thou by rash intruding thy self, to judge better
or worse of the mans inward condition, hath deceived
thy self, be more wise in time coming. For remedy
of this evil, 1. let not the convert, mistaken in the
point of charity, be feared to be mistaken and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from exercise of his charity, because he knoweth
not the sincerity of the mans profession: There are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
enough between him and the party toward
whom charity is to be exercised, such as bonds natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
civil, ecclesiastick and spiritual, obliging to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
2. Let him be sparing in judging of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
even within himself, and far more in expressing
his judgment of him to his prejudice. 3. Let him
rather judge this, that he lay no stumbling block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his feet, which may hinder him in a good, or
harden him in an evil course, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 13. Let him
not be rigid and censorious in aggreging every sinfull
infirmity in his neighbour, for this is forbidden, <hi>Iam.</hi>
3. 1, 2. In a word, let a convert beware to alienat any
man from making use of his charity, whether by injust
suspicion of him, or inhumane dealing with him, or
imprudent speeches of him, but rather let his whole car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
toward all in every case be such, that a patent
door may be for mutual giving and getting good one by
another.</p>

               <p>HItherto we have spoken of two sorts of the converts
mistaking of their condition, and have given some
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:40880:243"/>
instances of their being well pleased with themselves in

follows, that we give some instances of a third sort of

as if it were altogether evil, when indeed his condition
is partly good and partly evil; and the first shall be of
those who do lament their condition, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

as they should, cannot be affected with the sense of

that the hardnesse of heart whereof he complains, is
not that hardnesse of heart which the Scripture calleth
hardnesse of heart: For, the Scriptures do not charge
any man of this sin who lamenteth his sinfulnesse, but
those who do not acknowledge their sins, and go on
in them when they hear them reproved, mis-regarding
what God saith, commandeth, commendeth or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
Mean time we do not deny, but those in-lakes
whereof the convert doth complain, are sinfull defects
of duty, and inclinations of corrupt nature unto hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heart. But we deny, that this defect lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is charged in Scripture for hardnesse of heart. 2. Let
the convert consider the difference between the evil
whereof he complaineth, and the good gift of God
pointing out that evil unto him, and making him to
dis-allow it and lament it, and he shall find his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not altogether evil, but such as he hath cause to
be humbled in himself for it, and also to blesse God
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:40880:244"/>
for discovering this defect, and making him lament it.
3. Let him consider, that his lamenting his coldrise
affection to God and his small compassion toward
men, is good and commendable; for this lamenting
the defect, beareth witnesse of his will and desire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the duty, and in effect is a part of the exercise of
repentance, and of begun renovation of his heart. 4. Let
him consider, that there may be made good use of this
condition, both for the exercise of humility, because
of felt defects of needfull graces, and also for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of faith in Christ, by application of his imputed
righteousnesse, which hideth the nakednesse of felt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and drawing vertue from Christ to sanctifie and
renew the heart more and more. 5. And last of all,
let the convert under the sense of this defect in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
study to bring forth the effects of those affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that is to say, let him go about to do the work
of a lover of God, in having respect to all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
and to do the work of a compassionat
affection toward men in misery of soul or body, and so
what seems to him in-laking in his heart, shall be found
forth-coming in his hand and actions for the greater
glory to God and edification of his neighbour.</p>

God should be worshiped in spirit and truth, and
that the more a man strive to be sincere and upright in
his worship, the lesse can be comport with the sin
which doth hinder his worship. When therefore a true
convert doth perceive in himself so great levity of his
thoughts, that in the very time of hearing Sermon,
praying to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or singing of Psalms, his mind run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
out to think of naughty and profane things, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
idle and foolish maters, unworthy of his
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:40880:244"/>
thoughts at any time, but most untimous and sinfull in
the time of divine service, he is so displeased with his
condition, that he condemns all the service and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he is about for the time, and cast it away as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
polluted; and if he find this sicknesse from day
to day cleaving fast unto him, he falleth in discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in question with himself, whether it be better
to break off at least in secret, such ragged worship, or
to go on to offer the sacrifice of a fool unto God: for,
so he doth esteem of his devotion, thus leavened, with
vaiging and vanity of his mind.</p>
               <p>In this case, the convert doth not only mis-regard
what is right in his devotion, or divine service, but also
by fretting, discouragement and mis-behaviour of his
spirit, is ready to augment his sinfull condition, and
to provoke the Lord to be wroth with him indeed.</p>
               <p>2. For remedy of this evil, let the convert judge
wisely of his condition, that he charge not himself with
guiltinesse more then he ought to do, and that he may
take a right course to be free of guiltinesse, and healed
of this sicknesse where guiltinesse is found. And to this
end, 1. let him put difference between vaiging of mind
with interruption of worship, and the natural course
of his phantasie and understanding, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with the continued acts of worship; for, as the eyes
of a man, running to some place, cannot choose but see
every visible thing in his way, and yet runneth on
without staying till he come to the place he aimeth at;
So the phantasie and understanding, cannot choose but
take up, and discern whatsoever is offered unto them
in time of prayer from the outward senses, or from the
memory, and yet make no interruption of prayer, such
is the natural agility of a mans mind; and therefore
this natural course of imagination or phantasie, must
not be charged as guiltinesse upon the worshiper, who
followeth on the work of worship notwithstanding.
2. Sundry suggestions may be cast into the converts
mind by Sathan to marr his worship, which must be
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:40880:245"/>
charged on Sathan chiefly, and the worshiper not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
made guilty thereby. 3. When the worship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is interrupted, and the mind falleth off from the
work of devotion, or divine service, and entereth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
discourses about vain, vile, or impertinent maters,
let the convert not only acknowledge guiltinesse here,
but also examine, if this his vaiging of mind in prayer
and divine service, be not also a chastisement from God
for his not acknowledging of God in his affairs, and
and for loosing reins to his mind to roave all the day,
which justly meeteth him at night in his devotion, as a
rod on his back for his voluntar vaiging from God in
his former walking.</p>
               <p>3. These considerations being premised, and the sins
which have drawn on this evil being discovered, and
the power of indwelling-sin perceived, and the power
of Sathans temptations noticed, and the Lords chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rod justified, and his own culpable infirmity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged;
1. Let him humble himself and flye to
the rich grace of God offered in Christ, and lay stronger
hold on the satisfaction made by Christ, imputed
to all believers in him, that guiltinesse may be, by free
pardon, removed. 2. Let him pray for more assistance
of the holy Spirit in all the exercises of religion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a gracious granting thereof, in Gods wise dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
of the measure of his grace in the use of holy
Ordinances. 3. Let his heart be in the fear of the Lord
all the day long, making him lift up his eyes from time
to time to God in the midst of his lawfull affairs, how
mean so ever. 4. Let him gather his thoughts before
every religious exercise, by way of preparation, lest he
take the name of the Lord in vain, by rash and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
rushing in upon divine Service. 5. Let him
thank the Lord for granting him grace to see his sinfull
vaiging of mind, and to be displeased with it, and to
confesse it. 6. Let him be comforted in the Lord, who
gathereth the ragged and scattered honest desires of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants,
and taketh away the iniquity of the service of
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:40880:245"/>
his clients, as our high Priest, bearing, in his appearing
for us, as it were, on his fore-head, <hi>Holiness unto the

when they should go and seek to make good use
of their infirmity, and go to Christ for remeed, as the
Apostle did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
               <p>The cause of this evil is, the relicts of corrupt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inclination to seek to be justified by works, and to
have in our hand ability to do the good which we
would do; for, albeit the convert be forced to seek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God by remission of sins in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
yet in his course toward heaven and salvation,
he desireth to have a store-house and treasure of strength
in himself, to be made use of as he willeth. For, it
seemeth to him, in his carnal wisdom, a poor shift to
be, in every good action, put to beg supply from
Christ by prayer, and to stand waiting on in a
dependance on Christ, till furniture come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

our Lord doth suspend to give, till his infirm and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
child hold up his heart as an empty vessel to receive
influence from him, according to his wise pleasure, the
inconsider at convert doth trouble himself and falleth in
a distemper.</p>
               <p>2. This case is not altogether evil as the convert doth
take it; but this much is right, that he looks upon the
Law as holy, spiritual and good, that he desireth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to obey it, and that he loaths himself for his felt
unconformity unto it: Yet, this is wrong in him, that
he doth not humble himself, but is cast down and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:40880:246"/>

of the furniture to be brought unto him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by faith in Christ, and that this grace is nearer
and more ready to serve his turn, then if it were in his
own hand.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore let him renounce more and more all
confidence in his own righteousnesse, with the Apostle,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. let him thank God in Christ, in whom

               <p>SOme converts sometime, do passe rash sentence against
themselves for ingratitude, namely when after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
some notable benefit, for which they had made
earnest supplication to God, and for which, before the
receiving of the benefit, they had oblieged themselves
by vow to a thankfull acknowledgment of the favour
prayed for, they find themselves come short of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
promised and hoped-for chearfulness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
in praising and thanking the Lord; whereupon
they not only fall in heavinesse, but also in a sort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against themselves, and quarrellous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of their condition, and by this means, are so
far from performing their vows, that by their impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
they do involve themselves in no small guiltinesse:
and for this distemper of mind and indignation against
themselves, they conceive themselves to have just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
partly, because they find their rejoycing in God,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:40880:246"/>
and thanksgiving to him, for the benefit received, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
answerable to their earnest praying for it; partly,
because the benefit received seems to them to have lost
much of the estimation it had before they did receive
it; partly, because they find even that small measure
of joy, at the receiving of the benefit after some few
dayes, to grow cold and likly to evanish. Hence doth
suspicion begin to get footing in them, that for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
the Lord is angry with them, and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
the benefit on them, not in mercy but in wrath,
and so they fall in the guiltinesse of ingratitude more
and more.</p>
               <p>2. For removing of this evil, five practical errors
must be removed, which ordinarily concur in this sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The first is this, the afflicted, in his promising
unto God to be thankfull, will be found to have had too
much confidence in his own strength; trusting, that in
his resolution, his heart could not but melt in the sense
of the mercy granted. And this appeareth by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against himself, when he findeth, that in his
resolution his heart hath deceived him; as if he had
expected the benefit from God, and the thanksgiving
from himself; whereas he should have distinguished
these two benefits, to wit, the gift prayed for, and the
thanksgiving for it, and should have depended upon
God for bestowing of both: for, the grace of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
for a benefit asked and received, is greater then
the benefit prayed for; which if the afflicted had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
well, he should have humbled himself before
God for his not performance of his duty, rather then
fallen in a proud quarrelling for his inability to be
thankfull.</p>
               <p>3. The second error is an unequal comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the desire he had to obtain the benefit, and the
rejoycing in God for the benefit received; for, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to obtain the benefit, oft-times hath in it a great
measure of natural and carnal appetite, and seeking of
some part of self-perfection; but the rejoycing in God,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:40880:247"/>
which the convert purposed to offer for the benefit, is
spiritual. And we are much more inclined to seek
these things which pertain to the commodity of this
life, then to perform spiritual duties; So that it is not
to be wondered at, when our desires, in part natural, are
not followed with equal affection spiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>4. The third error is, when the convert doth not put
difference between the estimation of the benefit, and
the joy in God for bestowing of it, but measureth them
with the same line, not considering that estimation is
the act of the intellect and judgment, and that joy is
the act of the affection; and both of them in this case
exercised about divers obiects: the estimation respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the benefit it self, the affection of rejoycing in God
who did bestow it, respecting the giver of the benefit.
Now the estimation of, and delighting in, the benefit,
may be lesse or more, while the estimation of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
in bestowing of it, remaineth the same. And
therefore, the convert should not charge himself for lake
of estimation of God and his gifts, albeit he feel much
variety in the respective motions of his affections.</p>
               <p>5. The fourth error is, when the convert counts all
the estimation of, and thanksgiving for, the benefit, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
or spiritual received, as nothing, because it is not
answerable to the worth of what is received, or to the
kindnesse of God who hath granted it: which reason,
if it were of weight, there should be no acceptable
thanksgiving from any Saint on earth, during this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
life; for, it is impossible that any measure of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
from men should be found answerable to the
causes of their thankfulnesse, whether manifested in
temporal or spiritual benefits. And therefore, upon
this consideration, the Psalmist, <hi>Ps.</hi> 116. 11. cryeth
our, <hi>What shall I render to the Lord, for all his benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ifth error is, when the convert taketh it for
an evidence of an unthankfull mind, if the fervour of
praising God, once kindled after the fresh receit of the
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:40880:247"/>
mercy, shall after some time, seem to cool or decay;
which if it were true, no room should be left to any
holy affection, except only to the expression of joy for
benefits received. But the truth is, that one duty must
so be studied, as other duties have their time and place
also; for, we are commanded to rejoyce and tremble
also, to rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and to mourn
with them that mourn. Again we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that some expressions of thankfulnesse becometh
the convert upon the fresh receit of the benefit, which
are not required to be alwayes afterward continued.
We read of the impotent criple restored to his limbs by
<hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 3. 8. and that for joy, he leaped and cryed
out; but no man would require of him that he
should alwayes thereafter have daunced and cryed out,
and yet he might be found among the number of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
receivers of favour from God.</p>
               <p>7. These errors then being removed, let the convert,
1. with the Psalmist, <hi>Ps.</hi> 103. charge his soul to blesse
God at all times, and to remember all his benefits,
and not forget any of them, and to <hi>confess</hi> his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God, which in the Scripture, and specially in the
<hi>Psalms,</hi> is put for blessing, praising and thanking God;
for, the word that signifieth in the Original to <hi>confess</hi> and
<hi>praise,</hi> or <hi>thank,</hi> is oft-times one and the same. 2. Let
him beg grace to be thankfull for benefits no lesse ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
then he doth beg the promised benefits themselves.
3. Let him put the sacrifices of thanks and praise in
Christs hands, by whom the calves of our lips are made
acceptable unto God. 4. Let the convert comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that in the life to come, he shall be taken up with
praise and thanks-giving to God for ever and ever.</p>

lesser troubles surprize them, they are foyled and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

their indignation at themselves, and their fretting is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
so much the more, as the cause of their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency

               <p>2. But the true cure of this evil, is in discovery
and removal of the causes thereof, which are three,
1. Carnal confidence of the convert in his own strength,
as able to overcome lesser troubles. 2. Neglect of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
toward God in his rencounter with smaller provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

crosses, use to flye unto God by prayer to help them to
bear the same, but when they meet with lesser crosses,
they oppose their own strength unto them, and puts
not up the mater to God, and so their infirmity is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.
3. Gods wise correcting his child for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening

in any thing, but depend on God for setting a watch
before his mouth, and keeping the door of his lips, and
mainly for keeping his heart from inclining to any evil

and of his assistance to mortifie the deeds of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>Fourthly, let a difference be put between submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mind and quietnesse in mind. Submission may
be sincere, when pain of body maketh the convert to
cry, when affliction maketh him a man of sorrow and
grief; yea, when corrupt nature doth fret and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
provided that the convert control and condemn
his corrupt nature, and suffer it not to break forth in
words of impatiency, but prayeth to God to help him
to bear the burthen and endure his exercise with
patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:40880:249"/>
Fifthly, let a difference be put between the sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of corrupt nature and the trouble which doth stir
it up, and the sorrow which the convert hath in the
observation of both; for, the sin is the work of the
flesh and Sathan, the trouble and affliction is the work
of God, the sorrow for sin felt, is the work of Gods
Spirit also; and the sorrow for pain, loss, shame, or
any sort of trouble, is moderat and sanctified when the
convert offereth himself willing to endure it, so long as
God shall be pleased to continue it. Last of all, let it
be considered, that a wrestled-for submission, please<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God no lesse, then a victorious submission doth
please the convert, because in wrestling against corrupt
nature, the convert testif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth his will to please God, his
glorifying of Gods wisdom, justice, power and love,
how ever the Lord deal with him. After which wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the Lord doth give submission victorious, and
quietnesse with it.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning the converts mistaking of his condition because of
tentations.</head>
               <p>GOds children oft-times are not only heavy and
grieved because of tentations (which the Apostle,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. presupposeth to be ordinary, and in some
respects needfull) but also fall in a mistaking of their
condition, as if it were altogether evil and displeasant
unto God, because they perceive themselves many
wayes polluted in their conflict with them. Which
pollutions, albeit they cannot be denyed to be polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and should not be excused, or extenuat, yet
should not darken or obscure the grace of God in a
convert striving against tentations, and lamenting his
pollutions contracted by occasion of them.</p>
               <p>2. These tentations, that they may be the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovered, we shall divide them in three sorts. 1.
some of them are directly from God, in a wise and
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:40880:250"/>
holy manner, for tryall and exercise of faith, hope,
charity and other graces, and do not in any way tempt
men to sin. 2. Some are from the flesh and the world,
alluring or inducing men to sin; which two we joyn
together, because concupiscence or the flesh, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature, joyneth it self with the world, and these
two help one another, and therefore are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Ioh. 2. 16. All that is in the world
is the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life.</hi>
And when men are tempted by their own lusts, the
world doth furnish objects, allurements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to sin. The third sort are, the tentations from
Sathan, who beside that he is not idle to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of concupiscence and the worlds inducements, so
is he chiefly busie to throw his fiery darts against the
convert, and to sollicit men to such sins as the convert
doth most detest and abhor.</p>
               <p>As for the first sort of tentations from God, they are
ordinarily by afflictions bodily or spiritual, wherein
oft-times the converts do not observe the Lords purpose
and will revealed in Scripture, or are forgetfull of the
admonitions and consolations which they have heard
from Scripture, which was the case of the afflicted
Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5. and so they are more vexed then
they should be; and, (<hi>Ps.</hi> 42. 11.) dejected and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,
and do suspect that God is angry with them
and with the way they walk in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Of this sicknesse, there may be three causes, 1. the
bitternesse of affliction for the present time wherein it is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elt. 2. The sense of by-past sin which the afflicted
doth suspect God is pursuing, and making hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> possesse
the sins of his youth, <hi>Iob.</hi> 13. 26. The third, is the
observation of in-born corruption, discovered unto the
afflicted much more then in prosperity.</p>
               <p>4. For remedy of this evil, let the afflicted convert
perswade himself from the Word of God, that in all
the afflictions of Gods children, the Lord doth intend
the tryall and exercise and increase of faith, and other
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:40880:250"/>
grace, bestowed on them. And upon this considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the afflicted should rejoyce in this exercise, <hi>Iam.</hi>
1. 2, 3. Secondly, let him remember, that with the
tryall of faith, there is alwayes a discovery of infirmity
and corruption of nature in the afflicted: As in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
of gold, both the good mettal and the drosse are
discovered, which as he should acknowledge, that he
may be keeped from fretting, So must he still remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that the Lord doth intend the tryal of his faith,
that he may be constant in believing on Christ, the
only help and relief from sin and misery. Thirdly, in
whatsoever condition he is in, let him endeavour to go
on in patience, experience and hope, which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make him ashamed, for this doth the Lord teach
us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4. and <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>As for the second sort of tentations, from the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh and from the worlds allurements
and terror, let the convert afflicted follow the same
course which is prescribed in the remedy of the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the first sort.</p>
               <p>As for the third sort of tentations, which are from
the devil tempting men to atheism, or blasphemy, or
dispair, or self-murder, and such like, which even
nature doth abhor, whereof something is spoken else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
1. let the afflicted convert put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the devils sin in tempting to vile sins, and his
own seeming feeble resisting, wherein albeit he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himself polluted, yet his not yielding testifieth his
dissenting from those fearfull sins whereunto Sathan
doth tempt him. 2. Let him put difference between
the consent of his unmortified corrupt nature inclinable
to every evil, from the lust of the spirit which fighteth
against the lust of the flesh, which hindereth the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
from getting the victory. 3. Let him put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the sufficiency of Gods grace upholding
him in the conflict, and the full victory against the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of Sathan buffetting him: for, God useth to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend
the victory for a time, and yet make his grace
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:40880:251"/>
sufficiently uphold his souldier till the victory be given,
as <hi>Pauls</hi> experience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. teacheth us. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it is a pleasant spectacle to the Lord to look upon
his weak child striving against the flesh, the world and
Sathan, and <hi>standing out</hi> by faith in Christ against
them all. 4. Let him consider, that by these tentations
of Sathan unto vile sins, God can, and doth mortifie
sin, and make his child watchfull and strong against
both the sinfull inclination unto these and all other sins.
In the mean time, let him beware of a more slye and
subtile tentation, which Sathan useth to slide in at the
back of these ugly and grosse tentations; which is this,
when he hath pressed with all violence these fiery darts
and vile suggestions upon the convert, he chargeth the
afflicted soul with a giving consent unto them, and
like a scolding calumniator impudently beareth guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
upon him, and all to make him apprehend his
condition to be worse then it is, and to suspect, that
God, by this exercise, is pursuing him in wrath; and
this tentation is not readily observed by the afflicted
convert, but yielded vnto more then to the gros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore, in the last place, let the convert guard
against this tentation which brangleth his faith, and
lay the blame, with the Apostle, on corrupt nature,
whatsoever guiltinesse is found, <hi>Rom. 7. 17. Now, then
it is no more I that doth it, but sin that dwelleth in me;</hi> a
speech beseeming a man free of out-breaking and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
corruption, and striving against all inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of corrupt nature. And for remedy of this and
other evils, let him renew the acts of his faith in Christ,
laying hold upon the covenant of Grace, that he may
more confidently draw near unto God reconciled in
Christ, and so no more doubt of Gods good will to
him, notwithstanding of his hard exercise under ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
for, thus Sathan shall not only flye from the
first tentation, being resisted, but also be disappointed of
the successe he expected in questioning the coverts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and weakening of his faith.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning the converts mistaking his condition when he doth
observe some degrees of Gods deserting of him.</head>
               <p>TO speak of the sorts and degrees of Gods deserting a
soul, requireth a large Treatise, and the case and
cure thereof is already publickly set forth by a learned
and godly Preacher of the Gospel. It shall suffice, for
our purpose, to speak of it only so far as it concerneth
the converts mistaking his condition when he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
himself deserted, whether the desertion be
reall or apparent only, and falleth into suspicion of
Gods love to him, or that God is displeased with him,
because he findeth not such lively influence of Gods
Spirit as he hath found, and such assistance of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
presence as he did expect in discharge of religious
duties, or exercises wherein divine providence hath
yoked him. The Scripture and daily experience do
furnish instances of sad complaints of the Lords hiding
his face and withdrawing or with-holding of light or
peace, or consolation, or strength and ability for spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For remedy whereof, 1. let the convert remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that God doth not leave a believer fled to Christ
for relief from sin and misery, alwayes and for ever, but
for a short time, and that he keepeth love to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
albeit he do hide the tokens of his love some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
and dispose of the acts of his love, as he seeth sit
for the advantage of the work of grace in them. Let
him put difference between desertion and the gift of
discerning of the desertion: for, albeit desertion be of it
self a sad visitation, yet the sight and observation of it,
testifieth Gods presence with his child, giving eye-salve
and light; and thereby doth not only teach that wound
to be curable, but also that the Physician is begun the
cure of it, by pancing and lancing the wound. 3. Let
him not count it a desertion, when God in any service
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:40880:252"/>
whereunto he puts his child, emptieth him of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of his own ability, that he may open his mouth
wyd and be filled: for this emptying of the convert, is
the very fitting of him for fresh supply from Christ to go
about the service in Christs strength and furniture,
which the Apostle felt by experience, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 10.
When I am weak,</hi> saith he, <hi>then I am strong.</hi> Poverty of
spirit, and hunger and thrist for righteousnesse, are
not to be counted desertions. 4. Let him observe the
degrees of Gods presence, no lesse then the degrees of
his absence, as the Psalmist did when he recollected
himself, <hi>Ps.</hi> 73. 23. after the tentation which troubled
him was overcome. <hi>Neverthelesse, I am continually with
thee. Thou holdest me by thy right hand,</hi> and <hi>ver. 26. my
flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of my
heart and my portion for ever.</hi> 5. Let him put a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
upon Gods dispensation, believing alwayes,
that God doth what he doth for good to his afflicted
subject; whether he draw forth, by his desertion, the
latent-corruption of the heart, as he did to <hi>Ezekiah, 2
Chron.</hi> 32. 31. or whether to prevent out-breaking of
corruption, as he did to the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. 8,
9. or whether to exercise his faith, love and patience,
and to sharpen his prayer, as he did to the Psalmist
frequently. And therefore, let him, in the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of whatsoever degree of desertion, humble himself
before God, flye in more closely unto Christ, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
wait upon the change of his conditon, in the use
of the means, and following the duties of his calling as
the Lord shall enable him: for, this is the counsell of
the Lord, <hi>Isa. 50. 10. Who is he among you that feareth the
Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servont, that walketh in
darknesse and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the
Lord, and stay upon his God.</hi> And this much sufficeth for
instances of the third sort of the converts mistaking his
condition.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning cases, wherein the convert is in doubt what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
about his condition.</head>
               <p>IT resteth, that we speak of the fourth sort of cases of
the conscience of the convert, wherein he is at a stand,
and in doubt what to determine of his present condition.</p>
               <p>2. In these doubtfull cases, the convert is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deceived, as in the former ranks of cases it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed
of him; because in this sort of cases, the
convert doth not positively determine the question
wherein he is fallen, but standeth in doubt what to
resolve upon.</p>
               <p>3. Cases of this sort pertain to the mind and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the convert, and if his judgment be cleared by
loosing of the question, incontinent he is satisfied and
quiet.</p>
               <p>4. It is necessar for the converts clearing, that he form
the question rightly; and to this end, 1. let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
his case and condition in himself, so accuratly as
he can. 2. Let him ingenuously lay forth the question
or doubt he hath, before his Pastor or Christian friend,
acquainted with cases of conscience, and ask their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
what to think of, or what to do in, such a case.
The reason why he must examine narrowly his own
condition, before he speak of it to another, is partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
otherwayes his doubt or question may prove fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
and unworthy of an answer; partly, because
the convert, after examination of his case and prayer
unto God, may find satisfaction to his doubt; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because, if his doubt remain, the question may be the
more clearly propounded, and so receive the more clear
and speedy answer for his satisfaction.</p>
               <p>5. Of this sort of questions, we shall propound some
examples and give some resolution unto them, whereof
use may be made when such like questions shall occur.</p>
               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:40880:253"/>
                  <head>The first question shall be, concerning confusion of mind.</head>
                  <p>IT cometh to passe sometime, when a convert is upon
examination of his own estate or condition, that such
a mist and darknesse falleth on his mind, and such a
croud and throng of thoughts within him, that he can
discern nothing but mist, multitude of thoughts, and
darknesse and confusion. The question is, what shall
he think or do, for removing of this confusion of
thoughts and darknesse of mind?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This case befalleth converts frequently, and
therefore had need to be the more carefully cured:
Which cure, that it may the better go on, let the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
renew the examination of his former behaviour, and
see if he can find out the meritorious cause thereof in
himself; for, this case oft-times is the castigation of
the afflicted, for his former negligence and omission of
duties, or slight discharge of religious worship: yea,
it may be found possibly, that the afflicted hath been so
carelesse in keeping his heart in the fear of God, that
he hath involved himself too far in earthly and thorny
affairs, or hath exceeded in the use of things lawfull, or
by some corrupt communication, hath grieved the
Lords spirit, and so hath drawn on some desertion and
with-drawing of illumination from him.</p>
                  <p>2. This case may also fall out, from some present per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation
of mind and passion, whereby his reason is
so taken up for the time, that it cannot discharge its
duty: as cometh to passe usually in anger or fear, or
grief, or some such like passion as may be seen, when
a man is injured by his neighbour, or doth meet with
some damnage, or is put in fear of some imminent evil
coming on him, or findeth sharp pains of body, or some
such like cause perplexing him. The question is, what
shall he think of this condition?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If the afflicted shall examine how he is fallen
in this case, and shall, in consideration of his weaknesse,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:40880:253"/>
be humbled before God by prayer, he shall not want
clearnesse of mind, and directions from God what to
do and how to behave himself, in ordering of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
aright, <hi>Ps.</hi> 50. 23. for, the Lord gives wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
liberally, to all that ask it of him in faith, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 5.

God.</p>

               <div n="2" type="question">
                  <head>The second question is, concerning the convert, who most part
walketh heavily.</head>
                  <p>THere are some true converts, who after examination
of themselves, cannot deny, but their heart is toward
the wayes of God in their calling, and that as they find
the imperfections of their service, so they are forced to
renounce all confidence in their own righteousnesse, and
to flye to the righteousnesse of Christ, as the only true
garment able to hide their nakednesse; yet, they are for
the most part heavy in their spirit, seldom they rejoyce,
but many times they weep; and howsoever they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
confidence in Christ for <hi>the state</hi> they stand into,
yet, when they consider their ordinar heavinesse of
heart, they doubt what to think of this their <hi>sad condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This condition, if well considered, is very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
albeit not alwayes comfortable; for, the Lords dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
toward such a person thus exercised, is well
tempered and wisely mixed: for, he neither suffereth
the heavy in heart to cast away his confidence in Christ,
nor to be idle and unfruitfull in his vocation, nor to
glory in his own works, or put confidence in them, but
so keepeth him up to the duty of more and more esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christs righteousnesse, and drawing of strength
from him by faith, that he goeth on in his course up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,
albeit not fed as he would be by the consolations
of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>2. For remedy whereof, let him quiet his mind; for, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
examination of his own natural inclination, he shall
find the reason of the Lords dispensation toward him,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:40880:254"/>
sparingly giving unto him such measure of consolation
as he would have, to be this, least he should abuse the
same, and lean more to the sensible feeling thereof then
to the word of faith: and therefore, however he find
heavinesse of heart through manyfold tentations, let
him hold on his way in the obedience of faith, he shall
after a whiles patience and wrestling, meet with as
much peace and consolation as may suffice a pilgrim,
walking from strength to strength till he appear before
God in heaven, where all tears shall be wiped away
from his eyes. Mean time, let this ground be holden
fast, that God mixeth the cup of his own children as
he findeth it fit for their edification.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="question">
                  <head>The third question is, concerning the converts, who for not
looking on their originall sin and the out breakings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
are in doubt what to think of their former condition.</head>
                  <p>SOme converts are, who after a quiet possession of
peace injoyed in a blamelesse conversation among
men, and in the exercises of religion uprightly before
God, after examination of their condition more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
do find, that the conscience for a long time hath
been silent, and hath not changed for the motions of
original sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but suffered them to go on securely under
the guiltinesse of the daily sprouting forth thereof. In
this case, as they dare not cast away their confidence in
Christ, nor their holy purpose of walking uprightly
before God; So they cannot justifie the silence of their
conscience, which hath suffered the motions of sin (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not consented unto) to go away without chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
or reckoning made for them, and here they are
in straits, and doubt what to judge of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> In this case, the silence of the conscience is not
to be excused: And the peace of the convert albeit it
may be sound, in order to the converts <hi>state</hi> in grace,
yet the condition wherein he is, is not good, but mixed
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:40880:254"/>
with much security; for, to make the condition of a
convert to be good, it is not only required, that his
conscience be keeped free from grosse pollutions, but
also that he be daily aiming at mortifying of sin, and
that to this end, he daily give an account unto God of
his wandering and vanity, and of the observed out-sproutings
of the bitter root of original sin, that he
may, after his best behaviour, perceive a necessity of
that prayer, taught us by our Lord for daily remission
of sins, and so may daily have the answer of God from
the Evangel, saying, <hi>Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are
forgiven unto thee:</hi> For, there is a twofold absolution of
the convert, one is in order to his person, which Christ
calleth <hi>the washing of the whole man,</hi> the other is in order
to his daily imperfections and blemishes of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
which Christ doth call <hi>the washing of the feet.</hi>
By vertue of the first sort of absolution, the child of God,
flying to Christ, is judicially declared free from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
by the other, the believer, making use of
the fountain opened up in Christ, is exeemed from his
acknowledged uncleannesse. This is clear from Christs
words, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 10. Mean time we confesse, that the
motions of sin in our mortal bodies are so innumerable,
that no man can overtake them, yet must they be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for an heap at least, as <hi>David</hi> doth teach us, <hi>Ps. 19.
12. Who knoweth the errors of his life? cleanse me from
my secret sins.</hi> And this same lesson doth the Apostle
teach us, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. Wretched man that I am,</hi> saith he,
<hi>who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank
God through Iesus Christ.</hi> Wherefore, let the convert
go on in his formet godly and righteous behaviour and
conversation, not mis-regarding the sproutings of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin, but giving account thereof unto Christ, as
said is, that he may glorifie that righteousnesse of
Christ by faith, and injoy peace with God, not only in
order to his <hi>state,</hi> but also in order to his <hi>condition</hi> daily.</p>

               <div n="4" type="question">

                  <head>The fourth question is, how the convert may know and be
certain of his justification.</head>
                  <p>VVHen the true convert heareth the different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of Theologues, concerning the act of
justification of a believer, some saying, that it is an
act of God <hi>immanent,</hi> whereby he willeth the absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the believer; some saying, that it is an act of God
<hi>emanent</hi> and <hi>transient</hi> from God upon the spirit of the
believer; some saying it is the sentence of the Judge,
absolving the believing sinner from the curse of the law.
The believer here possibly is at a stand, and knoweth
not how to answer the question till his doubt be loosed.</p>
                  <p>For the satisfaction of the convert, first, we may
safely say, that it is not material whether the convert
be able to take up the quiddity and formal notion of the
act of iustification, provided he be a believer in Christ
and know that the believer in Christ is justified before
God, and that being justified by faith, he hath peace
with God, and can apply these truths unto himself, in
the exercise of repentance and new obedience. But if
possibly, the convert cannot be satisfied till his doubt
be answered, let him consider, that he must distinguish
between justification actively taken as it proceedeth
from God, and justification passively taken as it is
terminat on the justified man; as it is taken actively,
these four things are to be distinguished, 1. Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
will and decree, to absolve from sin and wrath
every believer in Christ. 2. Gods actual revealing in
time this his gracious pleasure in the Gospel. 3. Gods
judicial application of this general sentence to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
in the point of his conversion, whether the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
perceive his absolution or not for the time. 4.
There is a sensible intimation of this sentence unto the
believer, joyned with peace and joy, which the Apostle
calleth the shedding abroad of the love of God in the
heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. and the sealing of the holy Ghost
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:40880:255"/>
stamping the heart with holinesse, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. The
first three makes the absolution of the believer certain,
whether the believer thinks so or not; but the fourth,
which is the sensible intimation of this sentence, doth
make the believer both sure and joyfull.</p>
                  <p>As justification is taken passively, four things may
be distinguished in the believer justified. The first is,
his actual receiving of Christ, offered in the Gospel
for a perfect remedy of sin and misery. The second is,
the Lords judicial setling of the general sentence of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
upon the believer, as if he had spoken to him by
name, as he did to the Apostles, <hi>Ioh. 15. 3. Now are
ye clean through the word I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ave spoken unto you,</hi> that is,
you are clean from the guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of sin by my absolving of
you. The third is, the believers observing, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
act of his conscience, that he hath fled to Christ
for absolution, and therefore justified indeed. The
fourth is, the feeling and observing of the testimony of
the holy Ghost bearing witnesse with his spirit, that he
is a child of God absolved from sin and wrath. The
first two of these, to wit, the act of faith, receiving of
Christ and of the right made by Christ to the believer
in him of his absolution, may be in, and on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
without the other two, to wit, his observation
of the act of faith, and the felt intimation of this worl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of grace by the holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>2. For solving of the doubt then; as justification is
actively taken, as proceeding from the immanent act
of Gods eternal purpose and decree to justifie the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
it is no more the actual justification in this life,
of which we are speaking, then the immanent act of
Gods eternal purpose to raise the bodies of believers in
Christ, and to glorifie them in soul and body, can
be called the actual resurrection of their bodies, and
glorification of both soul and body in this life.</p>
                  <p>But the transient act of justification in a judicial way,
which is the Lords judicial sentence of absolution of the
believer, declared by his Word, set down now in holy
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:40880:256"/>
Scripture, it is indeed and formally the believers justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and is judicially terminar upon every believer
in the act of his conversion, whether the believer doth
clearly perceive his own conversion, or be in suspicion
of his being reconciled and justified.</p>
                  <p>And this may be made to appear, if we compare the
condemnation of the unbeliever with the absolution of
the believer fled to Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18. As he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
not in Christ is condemned already, because
the curse of the law and condemnation, pronounced in
the Scripture by God, the soveraign Judge, stands
against him so long as he doth not believe in the only
begotten Son of God: And this sentence standeth fast,
whether the unbeliever take notice of this sentence or
not, whether he do apply it to himself or not, do find
grief for it or not: So the believer in Christ is relaxed
from condemnation and absolved, and hath right unto
eternal life and begun possession of it, albeit for the time
of his infancy, tentation, trembling and fear, it be not
so, albeit he doth not perceive the blessed change of his
state, nor doth lay to heart, as he might, the words of
Christ judicially pronouncing the sentence, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
him as certainly as if his name were expressed,
<hi>Ioh. 3. 18. He that believeth on him, is not condemned,</hi>
and <hi>ver. 36. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting
life,</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. from <hi>ver.</hi> 37. to 41. Hence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the formal act of justification of a man fled
to Christ, is to be found in the written sentence of the
judge absolving every believer and the man we speak
of.</p>
                  <p>There is another transient act of God, in an actual
revelation of justification, wherein the holy Ghost
openeth the eyes of the believer to behold and perceive
the gift of saith already bestowed on him: Of this
speaks the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. And after that the
holy Ghost hath pointed out his own grace, bestowed
on the believer, he followeth his work, by giving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
peace and joy as earnest of life everlasting,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:40880:256"/>
whereof the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Ephes. 1. 13. In whom
ye also trusted, after ye heard the word of truth, the Gospel
of your salvation: in whom also, after ye had believed, ye
were sealed with the spirit of promise, which is the earnest
of our inheritance.</hi> Therefore, he that desireth to have
the intimation of his justification, after flying for refuge
unto Christ for relief of felt sin and feared wrath, must
read his absolution in the Gospel, as well as he hath
read, before that, his condemnation in the law. Unto
which sentence of absolution, let him hold fast in his
daily endeavour after sanctification.</p>

               <div n="5" type="question">
                  <head>The fifth question is, how to satisfie the convert who findeth
himself pursued for his sins after remission believed, and
is brought in question what to judge of his case.</head>
                  <p>MAny converts have fallen in <hi>Iobs</hi> case, and seemed
to themselves to possesse the sins of their youth, <hi>Iob,
13.</hi> 26. For, after conversion and felt reconciliation, they
find the sins they did repent of, and did believe to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
through Christ, objected to them afresh, pursued
with sharp accusations, and signs of wrath joyned
therewith. Their reconciliation and righteousnesse
through Christ, they purpose to hold fast; their old
guiltinesse, and sentence of their conscience writing
bitter things against them, they cannot deny: The
pinch is here, either the remission they did believe is
null, or the challenge is unjust, do they reason with
themselves; the nullity of their remission they dare not
admit, and the just ground of challenge they cannot
deny, and the doubt what to think of this case they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
shun, not seeing, how these things can consist and
stand together.</p>
                  <p>2. For answer to this doubt, these four things must
be distinguished, and how they may all consist one
with another, must be timously considered. The four
things to be distinguished are, 1. the reconciliation of
a convert with God; 2. the remission of the reconciled
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:40880:257"/>
mans sins freely gifted unto him by God; 3. a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bitter accusation raised by Sathan against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

convert; 4. The holy and wise dispensation of God,
permitting &amp; ordering these renewed accusations of his
child by Sathan, for the tryal and exercise of his faith
and growth of his repentance, and other good ends.</p>
                  <p>Now for the consistence of these four, we need not

by the means: for, there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Sathans renewing of accusations for sins forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Gods making null the remission granted, the
Lord can suffer the one to be, but the other he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
suffer to be: for, when a true convert groweth neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
and falleth in such sins after conversion as he
lived in before conversion, no wonder Sathan be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to call his former conversion in question; yea,
the Lord may justly cast up to his child his former

                  <p>4. Wherefore, let the convert maintain the solidity
of former remission of sins, and make good use of his
former sins which went before his conversion, and let
him follow the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> who did not suffer

confession of them upon all occasions for his own daily
humiliation, for the edification of others, and for
magnifying the glory of the grace of God, and yet for
all this, did not suspect the remission of sins received:
For, by this means the convert shall preveen accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and stop Sathans mouth, and make his accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

grace and mercy, and of the stability of the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sin granted.</p>

               <div n="6" type="question">
                  <head>The sixth question is, of a convert casten, not only in an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
for the time of his conversion, but also in a doubt

                  <p>SOme converts fall in <hi>Heman</hi> the Ezrait his exercise,

While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted,</hi> saith he. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
hath been offered by some to the afflicted, to follow
the practice and experience of some eminent Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,
who being brought to such straits with good
successe, have submitted themselves to God, to save them
or destroy them as he pleased; after which submission,
they have felt the marvellous sweet embracements of
Gods loving kindnesse, making them sure both of their
conversion and election. Whether to follow this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and experience of some notable Saints, is the
doubt, wherein the convert is not clear, and knoweth
nor how to carry himself toward God in this case.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="504" facs="tcp:40880:258"/>
2. For answer to this question: It is free for God to
comfort a soul casten down, when, and how, he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
it is free for God to passe by the infirmity and
error of a terrified soul, coming to him not in the wisest
way prescribed to him, and to look to the necessity of
the mans consolation, and not to his way of seeking of
it. But, howsoever it pleaseth God to comfort some
extraordinarily, yet this is not the duty of the afflicted
to come with such an unrequired submission unto God:
for, it limiteth the Lord, in a manner, either to comfort
the man speedily, or suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r him upon apparent refusal
for the time, to dispair: For, Gods order is to bring the
sinner under the sense of sin and acknowledgment of
deserved wrath for sin, and then to charge him to believe
in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and after believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Christ, to seal the believer with the stamp of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and the earnest-penny of the inheritance, which
is peace with God, and joy in the holy Ghost shed
abroad in his heart.</p>
                  <p>3. Wherefore, as for the conversion of a man strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the pains of the new birth and fear of everlasting
wrath, and tempted to suspect that he is not elected:
It is a more safe way to lay aside all disputation about
Gods decree (because secret things belong to the Lord)
and to look to the Lords command, and to his own duty
of flying unto Christ: So for the recovery of a convert,
fallen in <hi>Ionahs</hi> case, and made to suspect, that he is
a reprobat cast off of God, it is a more safe way not to
dispute for the time, either his election or conversion,
whatsoever suggestions may be cast in by Sathan, then
to offer unto God an absolute submission to be saved or
destroyed as he pleaseth, and then to lye in sorrow till
God give an answer of consolation: for, God doth
not require such a submission, but calleth for an act of
faith and obedience; for, God hath declared in his
Word, that he delighteth not in the death of a sinner,
but that he should repent and turn to God and be saved.
Secondly, in this submission the heart will be found
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:40880:258"/>
deceitfull, which neither will nor can submit to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
Thirdly, this offer of such a submission as
this is, [Lord, I know not whether thou hast chosen
me or rejected me in thy decree, but I submit my self
to thee absolutely. If thou wilt destroy me, thou shalt
be found to be just, and I do confesse so much unto thee;
but if thou wilt save me, I shall proclame thy grace]
such a submission, I say, is but in effect, a tempting of
God speedily to reveal his secret counsel, either by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
if the submitter be an elect, or refusal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
if he be a reprobat. The only safe way in the
foresaid case, is to be humbled before God, and flye to
Christ by prayer, (as <hi>Heman</hi> did, <hi>Ps.</hi> 88. and as <hi>Ionah</hi>
did, who choosed to look again to his holy Temple,
where the Mediator sat upon the mercy seat between the
cherubims) and not suffer such a thought as repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.
Thus did <hi>Heman, Ps. 88. 13, 14. But unto thee
have I cryed, O Lord, and in the morning shall my prayer
prevent thee. Lord, why castest thou off my soul, why bidest
thou thy face from me.</hi> Let the command of God to
every self-condemned sinner, to believe in Christ, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
against all temptations to the contrair; 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 23.
This is his commandment, that we should believe on the name

they apprehend their lips polluted, and their hearts

Chap.</hi> 17. in as far as the convert determineth not, and
doth not what is right, but goeth wrong and pleaseth
himself in his bad condition. But here we speak to
this case, as the convert is in doubt only, and desireth to
be keeped from deceiving himself. In which case we
say, that as it is the converts doubt, so we must confesse,
that this case of indisposition and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a chastisement of us, drawn on by our selves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we do not watch unto prayer, we do not study to
keep our hearts in the fear of the Lord all the day long,
we do not foster that tendernesse of conscience which
might furnish us mater of humiliation, and of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to God upon observation of our faults against
God, and of Gods favours daily and hourly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably

our conscience challenging us for our loose and
uncircumspect walking, our affections dull and dead,
and all the powers of our souls taken as with a palsie,
that we cannot bestir our selves in worship as we should
and would. Therefore, in this case, let the convert be

and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

away the iniquity of our pollution of holy things; and
let him nor defer his worship till another occasion, but
wrestle against all impediments and follow out the
work in hand, blessing God for his pointing out unto
him his wants and weaknesse, his wandering and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of mind, his slipping and sliding in his wayes, and
for opening unto him a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his pollutions and healing his wounds. And that the
convert may be encouraged to aim at, and follow on,
this way, let him consider, that the converts worship
may be pleasant and acceptable to God, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
is much displeased with himself in the discharge of
it: for, there is a worshiping of God in faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sense and feeling of the hearts inlargement; and
there is a worshiping of God with felt enlargement
of heart. The worshiping of God in faith is pleasant
unto God, albeit the worshiper in perplexity and wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with temptations and corruptions, be much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with himself. The worshiping of God with
inlargement of heart is pleasant, both unto God and to
the worshiper also, as (<hi>Ps. 119. 32.) David</hi> gives us to
understand, <hi>I will run the way of thy Commandments,</hi> saith
he, <hi>when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</hi> But when this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement,
by sensible assistance of the holy Ghost, is
not perceived, the Psalmist is but a dead man in his own
estimation; yet, he doth not forbear or delay to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

               <div n="8" type="question">
                  <head>The eight question is, how to satisfie the convert, doubting
what is the sin which God pursueth by long-lasting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</head>
                  <p>IT falleth forth oft-times, when a true convert, being
a long time pressed under some lasting crosse or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
doth inquire after the special causes of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
and when he cannot be clear what to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
doth doubt what to think of his condition: for,
he acknowledgeth his sins, common to him and other
converts, to be innummerable; but apprehendeth that
it is some special sin pursued by God, which is the cause
of his affliction, which because he cannot condescend
upon, he is at a stand, and doubteth what to think
or do.</p>
                  <p>2. For answer we say, 1. such a case is more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom
then dangerous; for, so long as he is observing
his sins, common to him and other converts, and in the
exercise of repentance is daily humbled before God
for his known sins, he must not be anxious, albeit he
know not the particular sin pursued, as he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:
for, albeit the Lord afflict no man but such as
have sin in them, yet he doth not alwayes, in afflicting
of his children, pursue unknown sin in them. For,
sometime he afflicteth his child to preveen his sinning,
hedging up his way with thornes, lest he should follow
after beloved lusts. Sometime he doth afflict him to
try his faith, to teach him patience, meeknesse, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and other virtues, such as are <hi>dying</hi> to the world,
<hi>seeking</hi> after things spiritual, <hi>compassion</hi> toward others
in affliction. 2. When the afflicted hath composed
his mind to reverence Gods dispensation, whatsoever
it is or shall be, then let him yet again look upon his
affliction, and it may be he shall read in the rod what
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:40880:260"/>
is the Lords quarrel. 3. Whether he shall find the
special cause of his affliction or not, let him turn all his
indignation, zeal and hatred against the body of death,
the bitter root and bulk of actual sins, and watch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
over the motions of original sin, or concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
in himself. 4. And let his whole exercise stir
him up to have Christ in greater estimation, to make
use of Christs righteousnesse imputed to believers, and
to invocat his holy name for the right use-making of
his affliction.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="9" type="question">
                  <head>The ninth question is, how remission of sin may be said to be
granted in respect of sins to come.</head>
                  <p>IT is commonly said, that the convert, in his justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hath the remission of sins by-gone and sins to
come: whereupon the question is moved, how this can
stand with daily renewed remission of daily sins; on
the one hand, daily renewed remission seemeth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
first, because we believe, that remission of all
sin, is the priviledge of all believers in Christ, and the
abridgement of the special articles of faith set down
in the Apostles Creed, as it is called, holdeth this forth.
2. Because it is certain, that Christ, in his death, did
compleat the payment of the price of redemption from
all sin, as 1 <hi>Ioh. 1. 7. The blood of Iesus Christ cleanseth
us from all sins.</hi> 3. We are said to be not under the
law, but under grace, and so fred from the curse of the
law. 4. Because if daily remission of sin be necessar
to be granted, then it presuppones, that both original
sin, and every actual sin flowing forth from it daily,
must be taken notice of, reckoned for, and repented of
daily, which is impossible. On the other hand, the
convert seeth, that every transgression of, and disconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to, the law is sin; and the Apostle, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 8.
speaking of himself and other converts, saith, <hi>If we
say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not
in us.</hi> And Christ hath taught us, as oft as we pray for
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:40880:261"/>
our daily bread, to pray also for the remission of sins.
The question is, how the doubt of the convert may
be cleared?</p>
                  <p>2. For answer: We must grant to the convert, that
original sin remaineth in the believer, and is not only
an exceeding sin, as the Apostle calleth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 13.
but also is the fountain of all actual sins which doth
pollute the conscience, and sometimes also the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man. 2. We must grant also, that there cannot
be an actual and properly called remission of sins which
are not yet committed: for, no man is guilty of that
fault wherewith he cannot be charged: for, such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
were a dispensation and licence to sin, such as
the Pope granteth to his slaves to gratifie them, in allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their vile lusts for inriching himself with the price
of that iniquity. 3. If such an actual remission of sins
were given in justification, the once justified person
could never become a daily debtor by his daily trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
contrary to the declaration of Christ in one
of the articles of the Lords prayer.</p>
                  <p>3. For solving the doubt then, we must distinguish
the significations and acceptions of <hi>remission of sin:</hi> For,
1. it is taken for remission <hi>purchased</hi> by Christ, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the covenant of Redemption, in favours of the
elect, but not applied unto the elect before the mans
conversion, <hi>Heb. 10. 12, 13, 14. But this man, after he
had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the
right hand of God: from henceforth expecting till his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
be made his foot-stool. For by one offering he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
for ever them that are sanctified.</hi> 2. It is taken for
remission <hi>promised</hi> by Christ to all that shall believe in
him, to be bestowed on them so soon as they shall turn
to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. Thirdly, it is taken for the <hi>sentence
of absolution,</hi> judicially applyed and adjudged to the
actual believer, <hi>Eph. 1. 7. In whom we have redemption
through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the
riches of his grace.</hi> 4. For the <hi>actual remission</hi> of all
sins past before his conversion, <hi>Rom. 3. 25. Whom God
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:40880:261"/>
hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood
to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are
past, through the forbearance of God.</hi> 5. For a <hi>constant
right</hi> to daily remission of sin, and accesse to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
opened up in the house of <hi>David,</hi> (that is, to all
the children of the houshold of faith in Christ) <hi>Zech.
13. 1. In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the
house of</hi> David, <hi>and to the inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>for
sin, and for uncleanness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. So then, the convert hath, first, the <hi>actual remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of all sins preceeding his conversion, and withall
his <hi>state,</hi> changed from being a child of Sathan, to be
a child of God. Secondly, he hath <hi>right unto</hi> daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins, as they fall out after conversion; for,
Christ, speaking of the remission had in the time of
conversion, calleth it <hi>a washing of the whole man,</hi> Joh.
13. 10 <hi>He that is washen needeth not to wash, save his feet,
but is wholly clean,</hi> to wit, for the <hi>state</hi> of his person ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in Christ, and for the application of his right
unto daily remission. Christ teacheth all his disciples
daily to pray for it, which Christ calleth the <hi>washing
of the believers feet,</hi> Joh. 13. 10.</p>
                  <p>5. For answer to the objections, made against the
necessity of daily renewed remission of sin, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that the article of our Creed is so far from
making daily remission of sin not necessar, that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
it must be extended, not only to the remission of
sins past before conversion, but also to the right made
unto us, for daily remission of the sins which run daily
from the relicts of corrupt nature not fully mortified;
for otherwayes, the believer could not have quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
in the daily exercise of renewed repentance
and faith in Jesus Christ. 2. As to the second objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
concerning the perfect purchase made by Christ of
remission by-past and to come; It doth prove indeed,
that there is no other sacrifice for sin, nor price of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
from sin, save that which was compleated on
the crosse; but it doth not prove, that we must only
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:40880:262"/>
once make application of this purchase; for, Christ
keepeth the full purchase in his own hand, and doth
let forth the application thereof, as we stand in need, in
his own order and by degrees, till he perfect us in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
and glorification also.</p>
                  <p>6. As for the third objection, we must not think, that
when we are loosed from the Law as a covenant of
Works, we are loosed also from the commands of the
Law: for, the covenant of Works prescribed in the
Law, is posterior, both in order of nature and time, to
the natural writing of the Law in mans heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.
And therefore, when the covenant of the law of Works
is taken off, the authority of the Law to direct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
all moral duties doth remain, and can no more
be dissolved, then the obligation of the reasonable
creature to be obedient to the Creator, can be abolished:
and therefore, when the believer falleth in a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he meriteth death and destruction as the wages of
sin. But Christ our Advocat, who liveth for ever to
make intercession for us, holds off the execution of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
wrath, and giveth to the believer the grace of
renewed repentance and faith in him, and so saveth the
believer, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. and, 2. 1.</p>
                  <p>7. As for the last objection, taken from the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of knowing, taking notice of, or confessing every
sin wherewith we are daily polluted, or from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of putting repentance and faith in exercise
about every particular sin; we answer, first, that the
children of God, notwithstanding of this impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
acknowledged by them, have sought and obtained
renewed remission of their innumerable sins, <hi>Ps.</hi> 40. 12.
and, <hi>Ps.</hi> 19. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>8. Secondly, such as are justified by faith, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of such sins as they know and do remember, are
accepted of God, as if they had confessed all their sins
particularly, because he that hath no mind to deny or
excuse any sin in himself, but is willing to open up
his heart to God in sincerity, and to canfesse every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:40880:262"/>
if he were able, he hath presented a contrite
heart before God, which is a sacrifice acceptable to
God, <hi>Ps. 51. 8, 9. Ps.</hi> 32. 5. and this much also Christ
doth teach us, speaking of the Publican who made a
short and general confession of his sins in sincerity,
and went home justified, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is not impossible for a watchfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to observe daily, as many particular sproutings
from the root of in-born sin, as may humble him
daily, and bear down all confidence in his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and furnish to him mater for exercise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and faith in Christ. And this lesson the Lord
did teach his people under the Law, by the twice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
sacrifice every day morning and evening, that his
people observing daily the running issue of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
might daily have their recourse by faith unto the
lamb of God, that takes away the sins of his own
people, and hitherto we are directed to look, <hi>Is.</hi> 45. 22.
and, 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 2. 1. Mean time, on the one hand, let us
beware to lay any sort of merit upon our daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of faith and sorrow for sin in our repentance,
otherwayes we should be found offerers unto God of
satisfaction from us, and not suiters of remission of
sins from God; and on the other hand, let us beware
to be discouraged, albeit we do not find daily the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
intimation and sense of remission: but as we
apply the Law to our selves in the exercise of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
So let us apply the sentence of absolution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in the Gospel, in favours of every penitent
soul that flyeth to Christ for refuge.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="question">
                  <head>The tenth question shall be, concerning spiritual dispositions
of mind and qualifications, which may be joyned with,
or separat from, the special work of true conversion and
saving grace.</head>
                  <p>THe Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6, 9, 10. tells us of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
qualifications which may be found in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:40880:263"/>
men, and also he tells us of <hi>better things which
do accompany salvation,</hi> and are sure evidences of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
Of the first sort, there are, among others,
these five. 1. A legal conviction of the vilenesse of
sin and vanity of the world. 2. A renouncing of
unlawfull pleasures, joyned with a refraining even
from lawfull and allowed wordly delights. 3. A
natural desire of salvation and of sanctification, that
they may be saved. 4. A purpose to live righteously,
holily and soberly in this present world. 5. An out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
change of maners and conversation, so far as
they may be blamelesse before men. These and such
like qualifications may make a fair show in the flesh,
and yet may be found to be not only in true converts,
but also in such as are strangers from the life of God:
such was the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> before conversion; such
was <hi>Israel,</hi> Rom. 9. 31. <hi>Which followed after the law
of righteousnesse, and did not attain to the law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.
Who being ignorant of Gods righteousnesse, did
and going about to establish their own righteousnesse, did
not submit themselves to the righteousnesse of God,</hi> Rom.
10. 3. Of this sort are such of the Papists, who go
about to be justified by their own works, and do but
mock at the imputation of Christs righteousnesse,
calling it blasphemously, a putatious or conceited
righteousnesse; not considering, that the Pope and his
servants do reckon the imputation of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and merits of men, and of the superfluity of the
Saints righteousnesse, by reason of their works of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation,
to be worth a great sum of money, as
they find their merchants.</p>
                  <p>Concerning these five qualifications, some converts,
especially such as desire to see the evidences of saving
grace in those with whom they will joyn in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Church-membership, may make question
what to think, whether they be saving graces, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
operations of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="515" facs="tcp:40880:263"/>
2. For answer, we must distinguish between a mans
judging of those qualifications in himself, and his
judging of another, in whom these qualifications ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be; for, a man judging of himself, may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to a clear and certain discerning of saving grace
in himself, as the Apostle giveth us to understand,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2: 11, 12. In which case of our judging of
our selves, this much may be said; that if a man
find in himself, those qualifications joyned with faith
in Christ for righteousnesse and eternal life, and is
seeking furniture from Christ to bring forth fruits of
his faith in new obedience, he may be quiet and be out
of doubt of saving grace in himself: for, unto such
a person, the description of a true convert may safely
be applyed, <hi>Phil. 3. 3. We are the circumcision,</hi> &amp;c.
And pre-suppose he hath observed these qualifications
in himself, before he hath observed his closing with Christ,
or his application of the offer of reconciliation
through him, he neither needeth nor should trouble
himself or others with questioning, whether such and
such qualifications in him, before his fixing on Christ,
were the common or special operations of the holy
Ghost: for, seing the kingdom of heaven cometh
not with observation alwayes, it is hard to determine
of the first beginnings of the working of saving
grace by the holy Spirit, because saving faith hath in
it the substance of historical, dogmatical and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
faith. And therefore, when both saving faith,
and historical, dogmatical and temporary faith, may
produce belief of the law, and convince the man of
sin, and wrath due for sin, and produce the belief of
the Gospel also, without application of the offer of
reconciliation, how shall a man determine whether
these effects were produced by vertue of dogmatical
and temporary faith, or by vertue of saving faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the time that the humbled sinner flye in unto
Christ, and seek to draw furniture from him for new
obedience of the law of love toward God and man,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:40880:264"/>
and so put difference betwixt saving faith, and that
faith which may be in an unregenerat aud unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
man? But, when the man is come up to apply
Christ, and cleave unto him for righteousnesse and
life, and furniture to carry him on the way unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
it is not his wisdom to dispute whether these
five qualifications were common operations of the
spirit or effects of saving faith, not as yet manifested
to be such, before the person did close covenant with
God in Christ, for not imputing his sins unto him, and
making solid reconciliation with him.</p>
                  <p>3. As for judging of others, when we observe these
qualifications, all or some of them, we must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
positively what sort of operation the holy
Ghost hath in hand; but our part is, according to
our place and calling, to help on the least preparatory
qualifications, which may serve to be inductive and
serviceable to beget and foster saving faith in them,
even when the sense of sin and unworthinesse is like
to drive them from Christ, as it did <hi>Peter,</hi> when he
cryed out unto Christ, <hi>Depart from me, O Lord, for I
am a sinfull man.</hi> For, God hath not made us Judges
of the operations of the holy Ghost in this or that
person, but to be their helpers unto faith when we
perceive any good qualification in them, and helpers
of their repentance when we perceive any out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evil in them.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="11" type="question">
                  <head>The eleventh question shall be, of the converts doubting
what to think of his condition, when he finds more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of prayer in the presence and audience of others,
then when he prayeth in secret alone.</head>
                  <p>IT is not a case unusual, that some converts do find a
great deal of freedom of prayer in the audience of
others, more then alone; for, they have experience,
that when they pray in the audience of others in their
family, or occasionally elsewhere, their prayer is more
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:40880:264"/>
copious then when they are alone, their stile of speech
more polished, their words in better order, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
more significant, their notions more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,
more fervent, more zealous, then when they
are in secret in their closet; which difference, when
they consider, they doubt what the matter doth mean.</p>
                  <p>2. For answer, first, there is a difference to be put
between solitary prayer in secret, and prayer in soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
with others; for, in secret oft-times the converts
worship is carried on in the sense of his sinfulnesse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness
and indisposition presented to God through
Christ, with sighs and confused groans without words;
for he studieth most for affection, and not for words,
having no ear to care for but the ear of the searcher of
hearts, who knoweth his weaknesse, fears, tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and wrestling with doubts. But in company, he
studieth most to make use of knowledge, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
himself so, as he may carry along the company
with whom he prayeth with consent, that he may edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himself and them in worship; and in this case, he
may find greater fredom possibly then he findeth alone
in secret.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is oft-times found, that God (for his
own glory, and the mutual edification of two or three
gathered together in his name) doth inlarge the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of speech in the speaker.</p>
                  <p>Upon which considerations, the doubting convert
may satisfie himself; only let him beware least vain
glory, or studying to have the applause of such as hear
him pray, do not blow wind in his sails; and in as
far as after examination he findeth himself guilty, let
him, when he is in secret alone, be humbled before
God for it, and crave pardon through Christ, seeking
help and healing of this wicked inclination.</p>

                  <head>The twelfth question shall be of the doubt which the convert
may have in a case contrary to the former.</head>
                  <p>SOme converts do find themselves more inlarged in
secret prayer and alone, then in the company of
one or moe. In company, saith he, I cannot utter
my own privat condition without a needlesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
discovery of my present case to others, and
I can hardly conjecture what may be their necessity
with whom I pray, or condescend upon petitions
and thanksgiving fit for us in common. I am taken
up also with thoughts of what estimation my hearers
may have of me. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in secret prayer I am freed
of that care, I am not feared that God shall mis-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue
my words, or thoughts. I may in secret make
a long pause in my petitions, and fall in meditation
upon some passage of Scripture, and after a while
direct my speech unto the Lord: I may expresse my
affections by voice and gesture, as they fall out, and
pour forth my heart to God with tears, without fear
of being esteemed an hypocrit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mean time I
doubt what my indisposition to pray in company doth
import, when duty calleth for it.</p>
                  <p>2. For answer, we grant, that God, to some of his
dear Saints, whose prayers in secret he will accept and
reward openly, hath not given ability to edifie others
by way of praying in their audience; to others in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of age of sexe, to whom modesty and silence is
most suitable, he hath not given confidence to pray in
name of others, whether moe or fewer, as their mouth.
But as for these, to whom God hath given ability and
a calling, by reason of a charge in the family, or some
occasional exigence, to pray in the audience of others,
and yet notwithstanding they do foster their natural
aversenesse from such a duty, they had need to examine
themselves, whether they be hindered by fear to loss
some of their estimation at the hands of the hearers, if
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:40880:265"/>
possibly all things should not be found so well digested
and expressed in the prayer, as they would.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="13" type="question">
                  <head>The thirteenth question, shall be of the converts doubting
what to think, when he compareth his disposition to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Gods dispensation toward him in prayer.</head>
                  <p>SUndry converts, when they compare their own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
dispositions to prayer, with the divers dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
of God toward them in prayer, they are at a
stand what to think. Sometime (saith one) albeit I
be very hardly drawn to pray at all, yet when after
wrestling, the conscience of the duty doth set me on
work, my prayer goeth on as I could wish, light is
furnished to me what to confesse, what to thank for,
what to seek both for my self and others; whereby I
gather, for the time, that the Lord is pleased with my
person in Christ, and hath accepted my prayer. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
it fareth otherwayes with me: for, when time,
place, and leisure for prayer concur, and I am now
about to make use of opportunity, and do fall down
before the Lord to speak, on a suddain, I have nothing
to say; matter, words and light do fail me, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and confusion falleth on my mind, and my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
suudry times is stopped, and closeth with a sigh or
groan; which dispositions of my heart and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Lord when I compare, I am in doubt
what to think.</p>
                  <p>2. For answer, in the first case, concerning the
Lords blessing of the aiming at duty, the matter is
clear and speaks for it self; for, God will have us to
aim at a right frame of spirit when we are about the
discharge of any part of his worship, but not forbear
to do the duty, if we cannot reach that fitnesse of spirit
which we desire; let us strive against all impediments,
and God will help us to fight, will give the victory
and reward it for our encouragment to set upon our
duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="520" facs="tcp:40880:266"/>
As for the other case of setting on the duty, and
missing, of furniture to discharge it, let us consider, that
God in this dispensation is teaching us, that both the
discharge of any duty, and the successe thereof, do
not depend upon him that willeth, or on him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
but upon God that sheweth mercy; yea, he
teacheth us by experience, that to will and to do are
two distinct gifts, the one whereof sometime he will
give and not the other, and sometime he will give
both, that we may learn not to limit the Lord in any
case, but really acknowledge that every good gift it
from him, that we may aim at our duty and depend
on him for the blessing.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="14" type="question">
                  <head>The fourteenth question is, how to solve the doubt of the
convert in another like comparison of his disposition and
Gods dispensation.</head>
                  <p>SOme converts, out of their own experience, may
say, I being in a sad condition of heart, have sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
times diligently used all means to be comforted,
and have wondered within my self, that my pains have
produced no hoped-for effect, but the heart hath lyen
dead, like the child of the Shunamit, when <hi>Gehasi</hi> laid
the staff of <hi>Elisha</hi> upon him. At another time I have
been surprized unexpectedly with inlargement of
heart, with liberty of speech in prayer, with peace
and joy in the holy Ghost, to the no small confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my faith, and what to think of this divers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
I cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>2. For answer, the doubt may be satisfied, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Lords grace and wisdom toward his
child; in the first case, he giveth grace to use the
means, and suspendeth the sensible fruits thereof, to
teach us, 1. that he hath indeed tyed us to the use of
all appointed meatis, but left himself free to give the
fruits thereof, in what time, and in what measure
he pleaseth. 2. He teacheth us, that whatsoever bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:40880:266"/>
he doth bestow upon us in the use of the means, he
doth bestow them, not <hi>for</hi> the using of the means, but
<hi>by</hi> the using of the means. 3. He teacheth us, that
there is no inherent vertue, nor effectual power in the
means, but that the means are the way wherein we
must walk, that we may find the blessing from God
in using the means, and not put confidence in them.
4. He teacheth us, whatsoever mean or instrument is
made use of, we should, with <hi>Paul</hi> planting and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>
watering, give the glory of the increase, fruit and
successe unto God alone.</p>
                  <p>3. As to the other case, wherein the Lord doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his childs using of means, and giveth an answer
ere he call, thereby he teacheth us the same lesson, to
wit, that what blessing God doth give, he doth it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of grace and not for works. 2. He teacheth us,
that what blessing we expect in the use of the means,
he will give it, not when we would, nor in what
measure we would, but as he sees it fittest for our
good and his own glory, that so we should neither be
frustrat of the fruit of the means using, nor yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the fruit thereof as a deserved reward of works,
but as a gift of meer grace.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="15" type="question">
                  <head>The fifteenth question, shall be about the measure of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
or sanctification, whether it be growing or
decaying.</head>
                  <p>OFt-times true converts fall in this doubt, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
when they are in a sensible and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
condition, for then they seem to themselves to
be growing in holinesse; neither fall they in this
doubt when their condition is sensibly evil, as when
the power of in-born sin either breaketh forth in
action externally, or defileth their spirit at least; for
then they seem to themselves to be decaying. But
this doubt ariseth when they are going on in their
ordinary way of a blamelesse conversation, without
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:40880:267"/>
any observable change of their spiritual condition to
the better or to the worse. Then is it, that they seem
to themselves in a dubious condition, and cannot
say, whether mortification of corrupt nature, or sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
be on the growing hand, or not.</p>
                  <p>2. For answer to this doubt about the measure of
holinesse, 1. it is not safe curiously to inquire, what
measure of holinesse a man hath attained: for, <hi>as it is
not good to eat much honey: So for men to search out their
own glory, it is not glory,</hi> Prov. 25. 27.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is hard to determine the question;
for, God useth to hide from his children, especially
the younger sort, these operations of the holy Spirit,
which may in any sort weaken their endeavour in
piety, or softer pride in them, but he discovers unto
them their sinfulnesse and the imperfections of their
obedience, that he may set forward their repentance
and laying hold on Christ righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is such an instability of any good
condition wherein any convert may be, so great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of tentations, such a vicissitude of victory of the
flesh and of the spirit in their daily conflict, that
hardly can any man satisfie himself in the solution of
this question: for, he who thought himself dead to
the lusts of the flesh, and to riches and honour, may
shortly find himself overtaken in the net, and fall soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the mire, and be found carnal.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, let him that stands take heed least he
fall, let him watch and pray least he be overcome
in tentation, let him study to observe the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of nature, and imperfections of his best works,
that the righteousnesse of Christ may be in greater
estimation in our eyes, and we may grow in faith
and love toward God, drawing vertue from Christ, and
furniture to every good work. This is the way to
grow in holinesse indeed, and not to be proud for any
thing in us, or done by us; and this is the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Apostle did constantly walk, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 14, 15. 16.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="16" type="question">
                  <pb n="523" facs="tcp:40880:267"/>
                  <head>The sixteenth question is, what the convert shall think or
do in hard afflictions.</head>
                  <p>VVHen the convert doth fall in long-some bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diseases and sad afflictions, by unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
and long-lasting adversity, when Sathan is
permitted to vex him with sore tentations, when
God doth hide his face for a long time from him,
when he exposeth him unto the cruel persecution of
worldly men, he cannot choose but fall in many
doubts and perplexities: for, when God doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
afflict him, he readily suspecteth that God is
angry at him; if he louse reines unto Sathan to sift
him and vex him, if he answer not his supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
comfort him not readily, what wonder mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of thoughts arise in his heart? The questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, in this case, what shall the convert think
or do?</p>
                  <p>2. For answer. It is true, the Lord useth oft-times,
in his deep wisdom and unchangeable love to his
children, to exercise them, as is said, and Sathan
will not fail to whisper in their ear, that God doth
not love them; in which case, if the convert do
not stand fast, in the faith of the love of God through
Christ, in all his tentations, he cannot stand out in
the conflict.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, that he may guard and strengthen his
saith, first, let him seek wisdom from God, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Lords dispensations toward himself, by
the word and working of God in his children, set
down in the holy Scripture; in exercising of whom
by affliction, he hath discovered the corruption of
their nature, the bitter fruits of sin, and promoved
the work of the mortification of sinfull lusts that are
in the world, to wit, the lust of the eye, the lust of
the flesh and pride of life, and taught them humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
meeknesse, patience, temperance and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:40880:268"/>
toward others in affliction. Secondly, let him
set his affections on things spiritual, and on our
blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ, who is at the right
hand of the Father making intercession for all them
that call upon him, that they may be saved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
remembering, that as the Law is a pedagogue
to lead us and draw us unto Christ, So affliction
is a pedagogue to lead us to the Law, and to
Christ the end of the Law for righteousnesse and life.
Thirdly, let him learn, in examination of his own
condition, accuratly to distinguish the Lords part
exercising him with trouble, for tryal, and training
him on in the obedience of faith, as for his own
glory, so for the good of his afflicted child; and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
part, in cruelty, craftinesse and malice, tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and and vexing him; and his own part, who hath
deserved much more affliction then is come upon
him: which considerations may keep him from fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and murmuring in his trouble, how heavy so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be. Fourthly, let him put difference between
sinning and suffering of trouble, that he may choose
to endure affliction, rather then by sinning draw on
much more trouble.</p>
                  <p>3. But if the afflicted convert seem to himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
of God, in respect of the speciall operations of
the holy Ghost, let him be of good courage, he is
not altogether deserted who can observe the decaying
of saving graces from the measure he hath found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
he is not altogether deserted, who loveth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, and longeth after it, and can
go to God and regrat his desertion as a sad affliction;
for, if our loving Lord Jesus Christ hath withdrawn
himself out of the sight of his afflicted child, yet hath
he persumed his own foot-steps with the unction of
his own Spirit, that he may quicken and kindle his
childs love and desire toward him. This regrated
desertion is but in part, not altogether, yea, it is
not a reall but a seeming desertion. The Lord rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:40880:268"/>
in his love, albeit he hide the effects of his love
for a time: He preserveth the habits of saving grace
as his own seed in the afflicted heart, albeit he do
not alwayes draw them forth unto action: if he
withdraw the sight of saving graces, yet he aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the estimation of them, and langour to find
the Lord working in him. If the afflicted observe
well, he shall see the hand of the Lord in some part
of his works, so that in his hardest condition he
may say, with the Psalmist, <hi>Ps. 73. Neverthelesse,
I am continually with thee, thou holdest me with thy right
hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. If it shall please God, with immediat afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from himself, to suffer, not only Sathan to fight
against the faith and consolation of his child, but
also to super-add a fiery tryal of his faith, by cruell
persecution for righteousnesse, let him still, for all
this, be of good courage, because in all such battels
the Lord of hostes shall be with him, who will not
suffer his souldiers to be tempted above their strength,
but, with the tentation, will give an issue, that they
may escape, and will furnish strength to them, that
they shall overcome: for, he hath laid up a crown
of righteousnesse for all them that keep the faith,
and at last will give it to all that love the coming of
our Lord Jesus. Wherefore, let the afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
humble himself under one or all these exercises,
and not doubt of his condition, seing it is agreeable
to the Scripture and lot of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>5. It is true, that all affliction to the flesh, for the
present, is a bitter potion, but yet reached forth to
the patient by the hand of our Physician and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father. It is a fire, but will not consume the
burning bush; it is a furnace, but will not destroy
any mettal but drosse only; it is a labour, but shall
in due time bring forth the quiet fruits of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
it is a rough fyle, but the more sharp it be,
it shall so much sooner rub away the rust of the
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:40880:269"/>
vessel of grace, make the soul of the penitent more
bright, and, by the blessing of God, render him
more humble in his thoughts, more fervent in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
mor constant in the faith, more strong to bear
whatsoever burthen shall be laid on him, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to grow in all vertue, more carefull to keep
communion with God, more innocent in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
more clean in his conscience, and at last
more blessed, Let not then the afflicted convert
regard the labour he is put to, but look to the fruit,
reckon the worth of healing, and not the bitternesse
of his potion; let him not look to the pain of the
affliction, but to the fatherly love of God chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, who expressely hath told us, that he chasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all whom he loveth, lest they perish with the
world; let him not shift the battel, but set his eye
on the crown, and go on in the way of God, how
many soever his tribulations shall be: for, as the
outward man by trouble doth decay, So the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man is renewed daily: for, the Apostle, who
who was most acquaint with such exercise,
hath, for incouragment of all who are under the
crosse, said, <hi>Our light affliction, which is but
for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and
eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things
which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for
the things which are seen, are temporal, but the things
which are not seen, are eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="17" type="question">
                  <head>The seventeenth and last question, shall be about the relicts
of sin in the Saints in this life.</head>
                  <p>THe remainder of sin doth often-times drive true
converts to many doubts; for, when carnal
lusts and sinfull passions seem to be subdued, and in
a good measure mortified, incontinent, upon the
least occasion (as dying ashes when sulphureous
pouder is cast upon them) they kindle and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed:
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:40880:269"/>
and when their spirit is most willing and
ready to do good, corrupt nature standeth up and
maketh opposition, so that the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vert cannot do the
good he would; yea, such is the power thereof, that
oft-times it forceth him to the ill he would not. In
which warfare, being oft overcome, he is so weary,
that he falleth out, with the Apostle in his lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24 crying, <hi>O miserable man that I am,
who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> and
while he searcheth how it cometh to passe, that such
a body of death lodgeth in the children of God,
and so powerfull relicts of sin remain in the justified
man, he cannot satisfie himself, considering, that
God doth hate sin, and maketh the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hate it also; which God could easily take away
in a moment, in the day of the converts reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and justification.</p>
                  <p>2. For answer to this question; if a reason of
Gods permission of the relicts of sin, to remain in
the Saints all the dayes of their life, be asked after;
a reason superiour to the most holy will of God to
permit it, can none be given, nor should it be sought
after. But to quiet our minds in this case, these
following considerations may suffice, 1. it is the
will of the Lord our God, our wise and loving
Physician, to renew and restore his image in his
children piece and piece, till it be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in all the lineaments, parts and degrees
thereof, and to heal our sinfull sicknesses and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
not in an instant, but by little and little, as
he seeth fit; this way of bringing his work to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
by degrees, he keeped in the creation of the
world, which he did not perfect in a moment, but
in six dayes: So also, the seed that is casten in the
ground every year, he doth not bring forth to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
for mens use, in lesse time then some moneths.
He doth not form infants in the womb and bring
them up to their appointed stature and strength, in
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:40880:270"/>
lesse time then a number of years. And for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts
of sin, how odious and loathsome soever they
are in themselves, yet he can, in his deep wisdom,
make use thereof in a most holy way for the good of
penitent converts: for, as it was fitting, that a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
should be put between the militant Church
on earth, and the triumphant in heaven, So it is the
Lords wise will to exercise his militant children, in
conflicting against sin and misery in this life, that the
next life and triumph over sin, death and hell, may
be the sweeter when it cometh, and more desired till
it come.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, as the Lord, after sub-duing of the
Canaanites, did not forthwith cast them altogether
out of the holy land, but suffered a multitude of them
to live, for the exercise of the Israelites with warfare,
and for teaching his people by their own experience,
that the victory which they had obtained over the
Canaanites was not purchased by their sword or
bow, but was given unto them from the Lord of
hostes, who led forth their armies and prospered them:
So doth he not abolish the relicts of sin in his Saints
in this life, after their conversion, that they may know
that the victory which they have received, over the
devil, the world and the flesh, in their conversion, is
not to be ascribed to the power of their own free-will,
but unto God only. For, if the renewed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
cannot over-come the relicts of the broken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his spiritual adversaries within him, which
his renewed will would most earnestly expell, how
can he give the glory of his victory over the devil
and the world in his conversion, unto the power of
his corrupt and unrenewed free-will?</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, it is required of all that come unto
Christ, that they deny themselves, take up their crosse
daily and follow him; and to make them so do,
strong motives are daily furnished from the feeling
of the relicts of sin in our selves: for, how can a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:40880:270"/>
convert look upon his own ignorance, errors,
folly and vanity of his mind, perversenesse of his will,
impotency to good and propension unto all sin, and
not loath himself, and so be forced to flye to Christ
the Redeemer for relief?</p>
                  <p>4. The remainder of sin being an adversary to all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
doth furnish work to all the habits infused by
God for the daily exercise thereof, according as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
sin doth put forth it self to the hinderance of
faith, love, hope, patience, temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in
special it serves to bear down pride and to foster hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility:
for, this doth the experience of the Apostle
shew, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. Least I should be exalted above
measure through the abundance of the revelation, there was
given to me a thorn in the flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Nothing doth more manifest the infirmity of the
strongest souldiers of Christ, then the power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
sin, brought forth in the conflict against the new
creature; No sharper spur to prayer and imploring
of Gods help, then the felt power of the remainder
of sin: this also doth the experience of the Apostle
teach us, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 8. For this thing I besought the Lord
thrice, that it might depart from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. How much the endurance of this conflict, with
the remainder of sin, doth serve to manifest the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Lords power, and largenesse of his grace
towards his weak souldiers, whom he upholdeth and
comforteth in this conflict, the answer which the Lord
giveth to the Apostles prayer, maketh manifest, 2 <hi>Cor.
12. 9. And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient for
thee; for my strength is made perfect in weaknesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. We are slow to believe, dull to apprehend and
learn that which the Word of God tells us of the
uglinesse of the body of sin, the perverse wickednesse
of corrupt nature, the filthinesse of the flesh, the wiles
and deceitfulnesse of the old man, and the enmity of
our corrupt nature against God. Therefore, in, and
by the frequent and renewed conflicts, now with one
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:40880:271"/>
lust, then with another, we are forced by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to learn the lesson more and more solidly, and
believe the truth of the Lords Word speaking of sin
that is in us, and to ingage our selves to prosecute the
mortification of sin unto the death.</p>
                  <p>8. The renewed experience of the power of sin in
our flesh, should make us so much the more vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
against it, and daily to put on the whole armour
of God: Because we must fight, not only with the
flesh, but also with principalities, powers and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
wickednesse, which take advantage of the sin
that naturally dwelleth in us, <hi>Ephes. 6. 11. 12. Put on
the whole armour of God, for we wrestle not with flesh and
blood,</hi> to wit, only.</p>
                  <p>9. The conscience of the remainder of sin dwelling
in us, serveth to move us to pity, and to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
on the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> and meekly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
our weak brethren, who are overtaken in any
offence, as the Apostle doth teach us, <hi>Tit. 3. 2. Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all meeknesse to all men. For we our selves also were
sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 6. 1.
<hi>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meeknesse, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thy self, lest thou also be tempted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. Last of all, the permission of the reliques or
sin, to remain in true converts all the dayes of their
life, doth serve to decide the great controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and men, concerning the way of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
For, by nature we cannot admit the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of God, which is by faith in Jesus Christ,
flying to his satisfaction of justice for us, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
imputed to us thereby: for, by nature, with
mis-believing <hi>Israel,</hi> we acknowledge no iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
save <hi>of,</hi> or <hi>for</hi> works, albeit it be impossible, <hi>Rom,</hi>
10. 3. And as <hi>they being ignorant of Gods righteousnesse,
and going about to establish their own righteousnesse,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousnesse of
God.</hi> So we, even after conversion, and after em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:40880:271"/>
of justification by faith, in our conversion,
do give oft-times evidence of our natural inclination
to seek after the righteousnesse of works, for after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of our selves, we shall find, that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
doth flow and eb as we are pleased or displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with our own carriage; and when we have most
need to make use of the righteousnesse by faith in
Christ, we forget it or slight it, do not flye to it, do
not adhere to it, do not comfort and strengthen our
selves in conflicts by it (as hath oft-times been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by us) what then would we do, if our going
about to establish our own righteousnesse did prosper?
or if the power of in born sin did not set up it self
against us, and force us, by the law, either to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
or flye to Christ? And this our natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even after conversion, to return and seek after
the righteousnesse of the law, may be seen in the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,
who having begun in the spiritual way of
justification by faith, sought to be perfected by the
fleshly way of justification by works, and did fall in
danger of falling from grace, and excluding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the blessing of the promise through Christ.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, our infinitly wise Physician Jesus Christ
taketh course, as we have said, for his own glory and
our good, not to repair at once the image of God in
us, not to heal our sinfull diseases all at once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
piece and piece, by degrees, that his righteousnesse,
bestowed on those that flye unto him for refuge, may
be in higher and higher estimation daily, that the
fountain opened up in him, for removing of sin
and uncleannesse, may daily be made use of, and
the benefit of justification may daily be looked
upon as a new gift, that vertue may daily be
sucked out of him for bearing of good fruits, and out
of his fulnesse we may receive daily grace for grace,
and may render thanks unto our God daily, and
blesse him for his grace given unto us, as did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Ps. 103. 1, 3. Blesse the Lord, O my soul, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:40880:272"/>
all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy infirmities;</hi>
And grow in the love of God, for the remission of so
many sins as escape us daily, as did the woman, <hi>Luk.
7. 47. who loved much because many sins were forgiven
her;</hi> And grow in holinesse, without putting confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in our works, as the Psalmist did, <hi>Ps. 71. 15.
16. My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousnesse—I will
go in the strength of the Lord God, and will make mention
of thy righteousnesse, even of thine only.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
giveth us his example, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, let the doubting convert make use of
these considerations, and long for the coming of Christ,
who shall abolish sin and misery altogether. To
whom, with the Father and holy Spirit, be glory for
ever.</p>
