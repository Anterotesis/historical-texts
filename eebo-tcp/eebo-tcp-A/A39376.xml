            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT would be a very great <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy</hi>
for any Man to
Attempt the Justification of All
the Actions of the most Innocent
of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> that ever
Sate upon a Throne, there being
such Innumerable Temptations
to <hi>Error,</hi> arising from the <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Interests, Opinions,</hi> and <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inclinations</hi> of Persons with
whom He is to Consult in Private,
or in Publick; and such Variety
of Enormities in the Lives of the
Multitude He is to Govern; and
so Many of the Laws of the best
Constituted Kingdome being lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to such Various Constructions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65561:3"/>
even in the Judgment of well-meaning
People, and so apt to be
Wrested by the Subtle Devices of
Ingenious Lawyers, led by their
<hi>Ambition, Avarice,</hi> or Desire of
Revenge, &amp;c. It is very easy to
conceive how the most Just Prince
in the World may be Expos'd to
the Obloquy of the <hi>Populace</hi> by
the Attempts of such Lawyers,
especially having fallen into some
Real Errors, through the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Infirmity of all Mankind
either Hearkning to Erroneous
Counsels, or taking some <hi>Unusual</hi>
measures in Opposition to the
Strange, Unexpected &amp; Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Proceedings of Seditious and
Unreasonable Men. Sometimes
the <hi>Appearance</hi> of Obligations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
from the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Severity, sometimes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Lenity and Compassion may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65561:3"/>
easily impose upon the Judgment
of the Best of Princes in opposition
to what is <hi>Really</hi> more Fit, and
Just. If a Prince take but such a
<hi>Liberty</hi> in respect of the <hi>Letter of
the Law,</hi> which Every Subject
takes to himself, He's presently
Exclaim'd against by the <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious:</hi>
as if a King in his Royal
Capacity might not now, and then
borrow a point of the Law, as the
<hi>Phrase is,</hi> as well as his Subjects
almost Every Day. When Kings
seem to Neglect even the <hi>Equity</hi>
of the Law, they ought not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to be Oppos'd in any other
way, but what the Law Approves.
I grant that King CHARLES the
First had not Deserv'd the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
that has been Given Him by
many Excellent Preachers in their
Sermons on the Thirtieth of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
(which LUDLOW most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently,

had Protected Bishop MOUNTAGUE
in such <hi>Practices</hi> as the <hi>Rebels</hi>

               <q>That he
impiously, and profanely scoffd
at Preaching, Lectures, Bibles,
and all shew of Religion, &amp;c.
That his Scope, and End in his
Books was to Encourage Popery,
&amp;c.</q> Letter <hi>p.</hi> 9. This Wonderful
Learned Man in his <hi>Appeal to</hi>
CAESAR (mention'd by <hi>Ludlow</hi> in
this same page) has these very
words <hi>p.</hi> 48. which if the Reader
shall Consider he will most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
acknowledge that what
<hi>Ludlow</hi> and his Brethren would
make the World believe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Excellent Person, is so
gross a LYE, that it could hardly
proceed but from the Mouths of
the most Impudent <hi>Traytors,</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65561:4"/>
               <hi>Regicides.</hi> 
               <q>I was bred a Member,
says He, of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>;
brought up a Member of
the Church of England; therein,
by the means, and Ministery of
that Church, I received that Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
of my Salvation, when by
Baptism I was inserted into
CHRIST. In the Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of that Church I have
lived not Divided with <hi>Papist,</hi>
nor Separated with <hi>Puritan.</hi>
Through the assistance of the
Grace of God's Spirit, which is
never wanting unto any that
seek Him, I hope to live and dye
in the Faith, and Confession of
that Church; than which I know
none, nor can any be nam'd in all
points more conformable unto
purest Antiquity in the best
times: which I trust to make
good against any, and all those
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65561:5"/>
                  <hi>Brethren</hi> in evil, <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi>

and running two several ways,
do like SAMPSON's Foxes joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

any writing, preaching, saying,
or thought of mine, any thing
Deliver'd or Published against

Letter <hi>p.</hi> 17. <q>Having
thus shew'd you, says He, that
the King, which I Abdicated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
I shall say no more in this Paper
but only to Vindicate the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this Admirable Exemplar of
all True Piety from the Malicious
Aspersion of this Monstrous <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi>
in what He calls a Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script.
<q>Though King CHARLES
the First hated nothing more
than to Govern by <hi>Precedent</hi> yet
he would not Pray without it;
and none of the Liturgies suiting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65561:6"/>
his Fancy, he had recourse to a
Romance, as you may here see.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Does this <hi>First-born of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
conceit that we have never
read a Book Entituled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>?
Dares any man that has read
that Book Deny but that the
King had a Clear Speculation of
All the Methods of Christian De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion?
I Challenge All the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
of our Liturgy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
one Argument to Disprove
any thing this Blessed Prince has
written <q>Upon the Ordinance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Common-prayer-book.</q>
I cannot give an Account how
this Prayer came to be publisht
with the King's Works; but 'tis a
sign that those who found it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with the King's own Hand
were not much conversant in Sr.
<hi>Philip Sidney</hi>'s ARCADIA, tho' it
be a Book not unworthy the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65561:6"/>
of the Greatest Monarch;
but there being in it a Mixture of
some <hi>Indecent Imaginations</hi> with
Many Noble, and Generous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of True Honor and
Vertue, 'tis pity some part of it
had not been <hi>Expung'd.</hi> But why
should the King Affect such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
as had been Addrest to
an <hi>Heathen Deity,</hi> as <hi>Ludlow</hi> tells
us! Let any man Judge what a
Blessed Reformer this Fellow
would be of our Church and State,
who Knows so little of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>True God,</hi> as to Despise
these Expressions of <hi>Devotion,</hi>
wheresoever he finds them. <q>O
All-seeing Light and Eternal
Life of All things, to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so great that it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
or so small that it is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
look upon my misery with
thine eye of mercy, and let thine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65561:7"/>
infinite power vouchsafe to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
out some proportion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
unto me, as to thee
shall seem most convenient. Let
not injury, O Lord, triumph
over me &amp;c.</q> I grant there may
be exceptions made against that
Expression, <hi>Eternal Life of all
things</hi> &amp;c. but it can never be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to an <hi>Heathen Deity:</hi> And by
<hi>Ludlow</hi>'s own Confession the King
did not use it, but these words in
the place of it, <hi>O Eternal God.</hi>
But why would the King have
such Regard to words in a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance?</hi>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Because He was
no <hi>Phanatick,</hi> but a <hi>Sincere Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Christian,</hi> who will be Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with <hi>Divine Sense</hi> Exprest
in the Words of any Person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
wheresoever he Finds
them. Every True Christian in
Time of Adversity pours out his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65561:7"/>
Soul before the LORD in the <hi>Sense</hi>
that is Exprest in these words of
the Prayer above-mention'd: <q>O
Lord, I yield unto thy will, and
joyfully embrace what sorrow
thou wilt have me suffer.</q> The
whole Prayer being so suitable to
the Condition of that Gracious
Prince in his greatest Sufferings,
'tis impossible but he should be
pleas'd with the words being so
plainly Expressive of such a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Mind, which 'twas both
His <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Priviledge</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
under all the pressures of the
heaviest of his Sufferings. That
the <hi>Book of Psalms,</hi> the <hi>Lord's
Prayer,</hi> and all the Devotional
part of the <hi>Holy-Scriptures</hi> were
the principal Instruments of this
Princes Devotion, is a Truth so
Evident that it cannot be Deny'd
without discovering the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65561:8"/>
of a DEVIL, or REGICIDE.</p>

            <p>3. <q>Reflections on Certain Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
In Dr. OWENS Book, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
A Discourse of the Work
of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in <hi>Prayer.</hi>

            <p>As to my <hi>Succinct</hi> way of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversial</hi>
Writing I have four
things to say for my self. First,
that Truth lies in a Narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>). 2. That
all the Truth I assert in Opposition
to the <hi>Sophisters</hi> of this Age, is Set
forth already in a multitude of
large Volumes like GOLD <hi>Beat to
an Ayerie Thinness.</hi> 3. That it is
therefore more Difficult for any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65561:9"/>
               <hi>Sophister</hi> to make a Shew of Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me, because it is so Easy for
the Reader to Remember the
very Words, in which I Express
my <hi>Irrefragable Assertions.</hi> 4.
Since I use so Few Words, all the
World may see I have no Design
either to <hi>Circumvent</hi> my Reader,
or to have any <hi>Evasion,</hi> if I should
be Assaulted with all the Force
that my Adversaries can raise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me. I Trust in the <hi>Father
of Lights</hi> so to Assist me by His
<hi>Holy Spirit</hi> that my Life may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be so Dear to Me, as a Stedfast
Resolution <hi>To bear Witness to
the Truth.</hi>
