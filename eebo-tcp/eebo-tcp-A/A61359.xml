            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THou art here presented with a piece of <hi>Statius</hi> metaphrased: The Authour was twice crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Laureate, in the most Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ticke, and best judging Times. It is not the least part of his glory, that he deserv'd <hi>Juvenals</hi> envy, as some judiciously suspect the applauding <hi>Satyrist.</hi> I intend to pick no quarrels with his Name or Country: but shall be well satisfied, if thy courtesie will allow him to be Naturaliz'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. For those Criticall pens which have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished their ingenious disputes, between <hi>Ursulus</hi> and <hi>Surculus,</hi> (although, I conceive, neither were of kin to our <hi>Statius</hi>) would have deserv'd better of the Common-wealth of Learning, if they had held a torch to the darke and mysterious places of the Poem: Which, I dare say, would not be so much neglected, but that it is so little understood. The subject matter of the worke, is the most ancient of any History recorded by the Poets: And were it not preserv'd in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, it had been, long since, worne out by Time: Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing now like old ruines, which preserve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a place, although the forme be wholly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The translation was meditated, midst all the clamour and imployments of a publike Schoole; and so, cannot be so accomplish'd, as might be expected from a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant retirednesse. And, when I shall tell thee, that it was intended for a help to my Scholars, for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Poet, thou wilt not wonder at my margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall explications of the Poetick story. Those grander proficients, who have digested that in their owne braines, may save themselves a labour of glancing on them: (I would provoke no man to looke asquint:) For others that want bladders, however in honour perhaps they had rather sinke, safety will perswade them to swim with this inferiour help.</p>
            <p>I know the common Fate of Translations, which are seldome read intire, but by snatches; and such pieces onely, as are pre-judg'd by the critick Reader, where the Translatour is sentenc'd, according as he jumps with the others fancy. Yet censure me as thou wilt: So I benefit any, I have my end: And if any thing here prove satisfactory to my candid, ingenuous Friends, it will incourage my progresse in that worke, which otherwise here receives its period. Farewell.</p>
