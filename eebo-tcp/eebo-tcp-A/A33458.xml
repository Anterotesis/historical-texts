            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
First Letter.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Had pass'd by the gross Scurrility of your last
Prologue with the same Contempt that I have
always had for the rest of your Scribling, had not
some of my Acquaintance suggested to me, that it
was unfit to suffer you any longer to go on without
Reproof. I will now therefore take you as much into
my consideration as so trifling a subject does deserve:
Not at all doubting but to kill this Tetter of yours
with the ordinary Remedy of a little Ink. The
Method I purpose to use, shall be, First to expose your
Faults, (I do not mean all) for that were as <hi>Diego</hi>
said of the Poor of his Parish, All the Parish. No—
you are too abundant and plentifull a Fop for any
man to mis-employ so much time upon, but enough
to satisfie any man of Judgment with the Abilities of
our <hi>Poet Laureat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And next I will detect your Thefts, letting the
World know how great a Plagiary you are; and
that for all your pretences to Wit and Judicious
Censure, you do live in as much Ignorance and
Darkness as you did in the Womb: That your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
are like a Jack of all Trades Shop, they have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64689:3"/>
Variety, but nothing of value. And that if thou art
not the dullest Plant-Animal that ever the Earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
all that I have convers'd with are strangely
mistaken in thee.</p>
            <q>
               <l>So dull thou art, as if thou'dst largely quaft</l>
               <l>All sleepy Iuyces for thy mornings draught;</l>
               <l>Henbane and Hemlock, which mans Soul benight,</l>
               <l>Mandrake and Poppy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>For this time farewel: Within two or three days
you shall hear further from me.</p>

            <head>THE
Second Letter.</head>
            <p>I Have written to you within the Time to which
I was by my promise engaged, and you may
perceive by this Letter with what care I have
read over your Conquest of <hi>Granada,</hi> a dull heavy
Task, which few but my self, except <hi>some Choice Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Spirits, and Peculiar Friends of yours at Court</hi>
(as your Brother <hi>Bayes</hi> has it in the <hi>Rehearsal</hi>) would
have undertaken. You have therefore, to use one of
your own Compliments, <hi>the more grand obligement</hi>
to me, for going through with a Work of that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
I must confess I did not make an end of it
without twenty Stops, forty Oaths, and at least an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64689:3"/>
hundred and fifty Resolutions at every Page to give
it over, and truly
<q>
                  <l>—I did dare</l>
                  <l>To be so impudent as to despair—<note place="margin">Alman. Page <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </l>
               </q>
that I should ever finish it. In this vexation of mind
I frequently threw the paltry Book to the ground, I
scratch'd my Head, I rubb'd my Forehead, put up my
Black Lead Pen, and exprest all the postures that men
use, when they are troubled with an Impertinent. Yet
after all this, with much strugling <hi>Opus exegi,</hi> and
send you the Fruits of my Labour, to whom of right
they are most due; <hi>being beforehand assured that you
will not be concern'd for any thing I say, since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               </note>
               <hi>and having swept the stakes, you can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to sit quietly, to hear your Fortune curs'd by some,
and your Faults arraigned by others.</hi> The plain and
natural construction of which words as they lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, is, that having received your Money from
the Door-keepers, having pick'd the Pockets of your
Auditors, you care not a Rush with what Contempt
and Nauseousness the Judicious speak of your Bauble;
yet you grant that <hi>a severe Critick is the greatest help
to a good Wit. He does the Office of a Friend, whilst he
designs that of an Enemy;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface.</note> 
               <hi>and his malice keeps a Poet
within those Bounds which the Luxuriancy of his Wit
and Fancy would tempt him to over-leap.</hi> How luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
your Wit and Fancy is, will presently appear
without any need of great severity in the Critick,
who has omitted at least a hundred good thumping
substantial Faults, for one he has taken notice of.</p>
            <p>To begin with your Character of <hi>Almanzor, which
you avow to have taken from the Achilles in Homer;</hi>

this Quotation, and you your avowing: For this
Character might as well have been borrowed from
some of the Stalls in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or any of your own
hair-brain'd Coxcombs, which you call <hi>Heroes,</hi> and
Persons of Honour. I remember just such another fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Achilles</hi> in <hi>Shakespear,</hi> one Ancient <hi>Pistol, whom
he qvows to be a man of so fiery a temper, and so
impatient of an injury, even from Sir Iohn Falstaff his
Captain, and a Knight, that he not onely disobeyed his
Commands about carrying a Letter to Mrs. Page, but
return'd him an answer</hi> as full of contumely, and in
as opprobrious terms as he could imagine.<note n="*" place="margin">Merry Wives of Windsor.</note>

<hi>Quickly</hi> (for I would not give a Rush for a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

they both aimed at her body, but <hi>Abencerrago</hi> Pistol
defies his Rival in these words:

Laureat had not pass'd for so Learned a man as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
his unlearned Admirers should esteem him.</p>
            <p>But I am strangely mistaken if I have not seen this
very <hi>Almanzor</hi> of yours in some disguise about this
Town, and passing under another Name. Prethee
tell me true, was not this Huff-cap once the Indian
Emperour, and at another time did not he call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>Maximine?</hi> Was not <hi>Lyndaraxa</hi> once called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria,</hi>
I mean under <hi>Montezuma</hi> the Indian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?
I protest and vow they are either the same, or
so alike, that I can't for my heart distinguish one
from the other. You are therefore a strange unconsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Thief, that art not content to steal from others,

            <p>I have thus far made bold with you out of meer Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;<note place="margin">Preface.</note>

               <hi>But pray give me leave without any offence, to
ask you why it was a Fault in</hi> Shakespear, <hi>that</hi> his Plays
were grounded upon Impossibilities, and so meanly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that the Comedy neither caused your Mirth, nor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64689:5"/>
the serious part your Concernment? <hi>This you say
in your Postscript, and in your Preface, you tell us,</hi>
that a Poet was not tied to a bare Representation of what
is possible, but might let himself loose: For he has only his
Fancy for his Guide, which sees farther in its own Empire,
and produces more satisfactory notions.</p>
            <p>I understand not well your meaning, but my dear

            <head>THE
Third Letter.</head>
            <p>WHen you have wiped off all former stains
from your Reputation, I shall think you
worthy to be called to another manner of
Account, but till then I will content my self to proceed
in this mild way of Correcting your Insolence which I
have begun, submitting it to the Judgment of all Men,
which of us two deserve best the Honourable Title of
a Railer.</p>
            <p>And now if you were not too peevish to endure a
Question, I would make bold to ask you the meaning
of this Simile:
<q>
                  <l>The Brave <hi>Almanzor</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Who like a Tempest that out-rides the Wind.<note place="margin">Almanz. <hi>Act. 2.</hi> pag. 13.</note>
                  </l>
               </q>
The sense of it to my weak and shallow Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is, a Tempest that out-rides it self: And if it be
so, pray resolve me<note n="*" place="margin">Preface.</note> 
               <hi>whether you be not cozen'd with
the sound, and never took the pains to examine the sense
of your own Verses,</hi> which is a Fault you object to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in your modest Preface.</p>
            <p>Another of the same.
<q>
                  <l>Great Souls discern not when the leap's too wide,<note place="margin">Act. 4.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Because they onely view the farther side.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64689:6"/>
Turn that into Prose, and then this is the Nonsense of
it; They do not discern the distance, because they
only view the distance. And if that be the best Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
it can bear, then answer me, <hi>Whether you</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Preface to <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>who
have undertaken to write Verse without being form'd by
Art or Nature for it, whether you who have written one
of the worst in it, could have written worse without it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think this Instance I am going to give you, would
have done every jot as well in Prose, as in Heroick
Verse.

                  <p>This is my Will, and this I will have done.</p>
               </q>

            <p>
Or this.

                  <l>None could be seen whilst <hi>Almahid</hi> was by,</l>

            </p>
            <p>Therefore to reprehend you in your own Lofty Stile,
by applying an ingenious Couplet.
<q>
                  <l>Either confess your Fault, or hold your Tongue;</l>
                  <l>For I am sure I am not now i'th' wrong.</l>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Dryden,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THere is one of your Virtues which I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to animadvert upon, which is your excess
of Modesty; When you tell us in your Postscript to <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi>
That <hi>Shakespear is below * the Dullest Writer of
Ours, or any precedent Age.</hi> In which by your favour,
You Recede as much from your own Right, as you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
<hi>Almanzor,</hi> because he is yours, in preferring
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64689:6"/>
               <hi>Ben. Iohnson's Cethegus</hi> before him; saying in your
Preface, that his Rodomontadoes are neither so irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
as the others, nor so impossible to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I'll give you so many instances to the contrary,
as shall convince you, and bring you over to my side.

            <p>You must not take it ill, Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> if I suspect
both those Verses to have a strong Tincture of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
but if you'l defend 'em, of all loves I beg of thee
that thou would'st construe them, and put them into
sense: for to me, as Parson <hi>Hugh</hi> says in <hi>Shakespear,</hi>
they seemed Lunacies, it is mad as a mad Dog, it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectatious.</p>
            <p>I once thought to have ended this Letter here with
a Distich of your own:
<q>
                  <l>Let us at length so many faults forget,</l>
                  <l>And lose the tale, and take 'em by the great.</l>
               </q>
But if I had so concluded; I should have omitted a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
conceit or two; the one is in a Speech of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor</hi>
to his Mothers Ghost.
<q>
                  <l>I'll rush into the Covert of thy Night,</l>
                  <l>And pull thee backward by thy Shroud to Light.</l>
                  <l>Or else I'll squeez thee like a Bladder there,</l>
                  <l>And make thee groan thy self away to air.</l>
               </q>
The second is a Speech of <hi>Porphyrius</hi> to <hi>Maximine,</hi> in
thy Tyrannick Love.
<q>
                  <l>Where'er thou stand'st, I'll level at thy face,</l>
                  <l>My gushing blood, and sprout it at that place.</l>

assure your self that after this Letter you shall hear

            </p>
            <p>I intended to have made no more Animadversions
upon the viciousness of your Style, till in reviewing the
several Pamphlets you have published, I found so much
good new matter of that kind, that I could not forbear
to return once more to the same subject, and reserve the
the other heads for the Press.</p>
            <p>My first observation shall be of the admirable facility
of your Muse in Similes, which allude to nothing.
This your Brother <hi>Bayes</hi> has before taken notice of in
the <hi>Rehearsal.</hi> But I think it not amiss to insist a little
longer on that point; referring it wholly to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those fair Ladys, who have hitherto been the
best strength of your party, hoping there will be no
need of further pains than just transcribing, and laying
them before them.</p>
            <p>The first I light upon is an excellent Illustration of
Grief.
<q>
                  <l>Then setting free a sigh from her fair Eyes</l>

Canst thou after this have the Confidence to say thy Plays
are written with more Flame than Art. I vow to thee, I
cannot perceive either Art, Flame, or the least Spark of fire
in thy Poetry. I must acknowledge it has all the qualities of
another Element, I mean the Earth, 'tis cold, dry, and so
heavy, that at the hearing of it, the judicious part of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
fall asleep, and one would have thought, thou had'st
done so too, at the writing. I foresee that this is labour ill bestow'd
upon you, for when thou art reprehended for producing a
Chymerical Ninny upon the Stage, thy defence runs thus.</p>
            <p>Who told my over wise Censors I intended him a perfect Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
or, indeed, what necessity was there that he should be so?

your Play go off more smartly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which Apology how it differs

            <p>Some will say,<note place="margin">Rehearsal.</note> this sense is not much to the purpose, why I
grant it, I meant it so, but then 'tis as full of Wit and Drollery
as ever it can hold, 'tis like an Orange stuck with Cloves.</p>
            <p>I thought to have rebuked thee for thy scattering of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
under another distinct and peculiar head, but if I had
enter'd upon that Theme, I should never have made an end.
Therefore I'll conclude with a word, or two, only of advice,
for the discharge of my Conscience, as a friend, and one that
wishes you well; though I know before hand, you are so
prejudiced against me, that you'l be deaf to all I can say;
yet notwithstanding your aversion I will take the liberty of
Counselling you to give over this way of mistaken Poetry,
and apply your self to some honest Calling, wherein you may,
(and truly hope will) thrive better, than at this domn'd Trade

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Present you have made me of the <hi>Hind
and Panther,</hi> is variously talked of here in the
Countrey. Some wonder what kind of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
the Roman Catholicks have now gotten: for
they have had divers ways of <hi>representing</hi> themselves;
but this of <hi>Rhiming</hi> us to death, is altogether new,
and unheard of, before Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> set about it. And
indeed he hath done it in the <hi>Sparkishest</hi> Poem that
ever was seen: 'Tis true, he hath written a great <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fine things;</hi> but he never had such <hi>pure Swiftness</hi>
of Thought, as in this Composition, nor such <hi>fiery
Flights</hi> of Fancy. Such hath always been his <hi>Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
and <hi>Scenical</hi> way of Scribling, that there was no
Post nor Pillar in the Town exempt from the pasting
up of the Titles of his Plays; Insomuch that the <hi>Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys,</hi>
for want of skill in Reading, do now (as we
hear) often bring away by mistake, the Title of a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64689:10"/>
new Book against the <hi>Church of England,</hi> instead of
taking down the <hi>Play</hi> for the Afternoon: yet if he
did it <hi>well or handsomly,</hi> he might deserve some Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
but alas! how ridiculously doth he appear in
Print for any Religion, who hath made it his business
to laugh at all! How can he stand up for any mode
of Worship, who hath been accustomed to bite, and
spit his Venom against the very Name thereof?</p>
            <p>Wherefore I cannot but wish our Adversaries Joy
in their New-converted <hi>Hero,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bayes;</hi> whose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
it is to fight single <hi>with whole Armies;</hi> and this
one quality he prefers before all the <hi>moral Vertues</hi> put
together: The Roman Catholicks may talk what they
will, of <hi>their Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Perrone,</hi> their <hi>Hector</hi> and
<hi>Achilles,</hi> and I know not who; but I desire them all,
to shew one such Champion for the Cause, as this
<hi>Drawcansir:</hi> For he is the Man, that kills whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at once; who, as he never wrote any thing, that
any one can imagin has ever been the practise of the
World, so in his late endeavours to pen Controversie,
you shall hardly find one word to the purpose: He is
that accomplished Person, who loves <hi>Reasoning so
much in Verse,</hi> and hath got a knack of writing it
smoothly. The Subject (he treats of in this Poem)
did in his Opinion, require more than ordinary <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Flame;</hi> therefore he supposed it to be too
great <hi>for Prose;</hi> for he is too proud, to creep servilly
after sense; so that in his <hi>Verse,</hi> he soares high above
the reach of it; to do this, there is no need of Brain;
'tis but scanning right; the labour is in the <hi>Finger,</hi>
not in the <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, if Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> would be pleased to abate
a little of the exuberancy of his Fancy and Wit; to
dispense with his Ornaments and Superfluencies of
<hi>Invention and Satyr,</hi> a Man might consider, whether
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64689:10"/>
he should submit to his Argument; but take away
the <hi>Railing,</hi> and no <hi>Argument remains;</hi> so that one
may beat the Bush a whole day, and after so much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
only spring a <hi>Butterfly,</hi> or start an <hi>Hedg-hog.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all this, is it not great pity to see a Man in the
flower of his <hi>Romantick</hi> Conceptions, in the full vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of his Studies on <hi>Love and Honour,</hi> to fall into
such a distraction, as to walk through the <hi>Thorns and
Briars</hi> of Controversie, unless his <hi>Confessor</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it, as a <hi>Penance</hi> for some past sins: that a
Man, who hath read <hi>Don Quixot</hi> for the greatest part
of his Life, should pretend to interpret the <hi>Bible,</hi> or
trace the Footsteps of <hi>Tradition,</hi> even in the darkest
Ages?</p>
            <p>But hold, we have a <hi>Battel</hi> just coming in; and
now Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> speaks as big, as if Ten Thousand Men
were really engaged; at the same time he sings in his
Verse, and puts himself into a Warlike posture; so
that our Ears are at once entertained <hi>with Musick and
good Language,</hi> and our Eye is also surprised with the
<hi>Garb</hi> and <hi>Accoutrements</hi> of a Controversial War: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
methinks this <hi>blustring Wight</hi> is hardly
strong and wise enough to demonstrate two such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
Points, as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and <hi>Infallibility;</hi>
I fancy, he is as able <hi>to Square the Circle.</hi> His Brains
indeed, have been a long time used to <hi>Chimera's, the
Raptures and Visions of Poetry, gaudy Scenes, unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
flights of Non-sense, and big Absurdities:</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
he may have a good head for the believing
of <hi>Legends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us see how he proves his several Positions;
which for brevity and distinction sake, I must denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
after this manner, and in this order.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64689:11"/>
               <item>1. Transubstantiation.</item>
               <item>2. Reformation.</item>
               <item>3. Infallibility.</item>
               <item>4. Novelty and Schism.</item>
               <item>5. The passive Church.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> he says, we must admit,
<q>
                  <l>—Because Man is to believe</l>
                  <l>Beyond what Sense and Reason can conceive.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> hath subdued his Understanding,
and laying aside his Sense and Reason, is become a
zealous Bigot for the <hi>Roman Faith.</hi> But God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is pleased to deal with us, as Rational Creatures;
therefore no Doctrine, that comes from him, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our Reason, neither are our Faculties to be
renounced for the sake of it; without the use where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we should not be able to know any thing, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the Worship of God, or our own Duty: Nay,
in the very planting of the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith by Miracles,
Appeals are always made to the Reason and Sense
of the Standers by: We may therefore very well sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that some Cheat is to be put upon us, when they
would have us receive a Doctrine of the <hi>Council of
Trent,</hi> without Sense and Reason. Thus to subdue
the Understanding to the Belief of Fictions, is to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that God doth not expect, that we should make
use of the Soul, which he hath given us in all its Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to pay him <hi>a Rational Service.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi>
hath not yet left off to expose Religion; for to feign
monstrous Opinions, and then fly to Omnipotence to
make them out, is the most unjustifiable Attempt, and
the highest Blasphemy, that can be thought on. But
our Poet is the same Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> still, as He was, when
he served the Stage: He did ever scorn to imitate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and was altogether given to elevate and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64689:11"/>
so now he would banish Sense and Reason
out of Religion, to which he was never a Friend;
but above all, his way of managing Controversies is
peculiar; 'tis indeed Elevating, Charming, Rhiming,
and every thing, but Thinking and Sense; as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>p.</hi> 15.
<q>
                  <l>The Smith Divine, as with a careless Beat,</l>
                  <l>Struck out the mute Creation at a Heat.</l>
               </q>
There's a <hi>Rant</hi> for you; That's a Flight of Fancy at
its full Range, without any Check and Controul of
Sense and Reason: Hence it is, that he hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
wont to shew such hideous, monstrous things in
his Plays, that every Man of Wit began to nauseate
his swelling Stuff; so now he labours to do the same
thing in Divinity; insomuch that his new Church will
find it necessary to spue him out.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Reformation</hi> he rallies at, as the <hi>Brat of
an old, obscene, and furious Lyon;</hi> that is, <hi>Henry the
8th's Lust:</hi> This is indeed a <hi>blustring</hi> Verse, and a <hi>bold</hi>
Stroke at the Memory of That King; for thus our
Hero will snub even Kings, baffle Armies, and do
what He will, without any regard to good Manners
or Justice: Nay, he shall win you above a Dozen
Battles by this sort of Impudence, one after another.
But now among Friends, was there ever any thing
spoken so falsly, so maliciously, so ignorantly? He
has Face enough to say or unsay any thing, and 'tis
his Priviledge, what the <hi>School-Divines</hi> deny to be
even within the Power of the Almighty, To make
Contradictions true; that an honest, necessary, and
well-grounded Reformation from gross Errors, <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as matters of Faith,</hi> should be the product of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64689:12"/>
and Adultery: Or that it should begin upon a
shameful Occasion, and from the Extravagance of a
private Passion: He will oppose <hi>King Henry</hi>'s <hi>Divorce</hi>
against what I say: But I am not startled at that, no
more than at the Fable of our Bishops <hi>Consecration at
the Nagg's-Head-Tavern,</hi> or at the <hi>Kentish</hi>-men's having
<hi>long Tailes</hi> for the Murder of <hi>Thomas Becket.</hi> Such fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
Arguments as these might have served well
enough in the <hi>Mouths of the Monks,</hi> Two Hundred
Years a-go; but they will not pass so easily in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
Age: In brief therefore, it is evident, that
King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. did never intend to proceed to a
much greater Distance from the <hi>Roman See,</hi> than the
<hi>Gallican Church</hi> maintains at this Day: There is no
Man of our Church, that looks on his <hi>Breach</hi> with the
Pope, to have been a Reformation: We only esteem
it to be of the nature of those Quarrels, which many
Princes in the most Catholick Countries have mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
against the <hi>Holy Chair:</hi> The Reformation, to
which we stand, is of a later Date: <hi>The Primitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
amongst us</hi> beheld the Reasons of Men tamely
subjected to one Man's Command, and the Sovereign
Powers of all <hi>Christendom</hi> still exposed to be check'd
and destroyed by the Resolutions of his private Will:
Upon this they arose to perform two of the greatest
Works in the World, at once to deliver the Minds of
<hi>Christians</hi> from Tyranny, and the Dignity of the
Throne from Spiritual Bondage: Whatever was the
Accidental, this was the real Cause of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of their Separation from us, not ours from
them: And this was an Event, which must needs have
come to pass near the time, in which it did, tho' King
<hi>Henry</hi> had never forsaken his Wise: Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> therefore
ought to know, that our Doctrine, as bad as he thinks
it is, was established by Christ and his Apostles; and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64689:12"/>
that the Ceremonies of our Worship were not set up
by Faction, or by popular Fancy, but by the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Counsels of Wise Men, and by the Authority
of that Power, which bears the immediate Image of
God. This may be enough to satisfie our idle Dreamer
on <hi>Parnassus,</hi> as to this Point; who prides himself in
the peculiar Virulency of his Pen, and so he may say
a tart thing concerning the <hi>Reformers,</hi> and give it the
Majestick Turn of Heroick Poesie; He cares not what
Obloquy he casts upon the History or the Profession of
Religion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Infalibility</hi> of the Pope and Council is the
next Subject, which is one of God's peculiar and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable
Attributes; and where is no Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
there must be Ignorance in part; and where Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
is, there may be Errour: And if Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi>
understood any thing beyond his <hi>Drama-common-place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book,</hi>
He would see, that the Doctrine of <hi>Infallibility</hi>
was not known in the Church for a Thousand Years;
and it hath been much disputed, ever since it was first
asserted, and will be so; let Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> affirm never so
confidently,
<q>
                  <l>—That this unfailing Guide,</l>
                  <l>In Pope and General Councils must reside.</l>
               </q>
But how can this be, when if <hi>Infallibility</hi> be placed in a
General Council, it was not in the Church for the first
320 Years, so it has not been in it this last 120 Years:
It is as certain, there was never a General Council of
all the Pastours of the Church; neither hath the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
set down any Rules, how this Assembly should be
called, who should have a right to Vote, or what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
must concur to make up an Infallible Judgment. If
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64689:13"/>
then the Pope be not Infallible, you have no other Judge
that can pretend to it: And in what place of Scripture is
the Pope named for our Guide? If our great Master
hath not done it, we must not say, he hath neglected
to do something, which He should have done: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
He is our most perfect Saviour, who
hath shewed us a sure way to Salvation: But still He
hath left us to the free use of our Faculties, and hath
not provided an Infallible Preservative against Errour;
no, not against Sin, which is much more mischievous.
But if our Eternal Safety did depend upon the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Direction of one Infallible Guide; 'tis very
strange, that neither Christ nor his Apostles should give
Mankind any Notice, whether this Infallibility was to
be found in One Man, or in a Body: And it is as strange,
that in all the Controversies the Apostles had, whilst
they lived, they should never make use of any such
Authority to put an end to them, as the Conclave of
Cardinals have found out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She whom ye seek am I,</hi> is not a sufficient Warrant for
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s claiming an Infallibity in all her
Decrees; no more than a <hi>Mountebank</hi> is to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
who after a deal of Scaffold-Pageantry to draw
Audience, entertains them by decrying all others with
a Panegyrick of his own <hi>Orvietan Balsom.</hi> And indeed
Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> seems to be but a raw Divine, and not to
understand well the case of Religion; for Jesus Christ
is the Sovereign of the Church; the Pastours are only
as Inferiour Judges in Civil Affairs; if they manifestly
oppose themselves to the Scripture, which is the <hi>Law
of the Christians,</hi> particular Persons may be supposed
as competent Judges of That, as in Civil Matters they
may be of the Rebellion of the Judges; and in that
Case they are bound still to maintain their Obedience
to Jesus Christ. In matters indifferent, doubtful, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64689:13"/>
of small Consequence, we are to acquiesce in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
of the Church; but if it is visible, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
teach other Doctrines, than what Christ taught,
the People may put in their Appeal to the great Judge,
<hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> the Sovereign of the Chruch.</p>
            <p>But this being a knotty Point, Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> laid his
Head close to it, with a <hi>Snuff-Box</hi> in his Hand no
doubt, when he conceived these Verses, <hi>p.</hi> 39.
<q>
                  <l>Who setting Councils, Pope, and Church aside,</l>
                  <l>Are every Man his own presuming Guide.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>However, the use of private Judgment is not so bad,
as the Effects of <hi>blind Zeal</hi> and <hi>ignorant Superstition;</hi>
witness the Wars for establishing the <hi>Worship of Images;</hi>
the <hi>Croissades</hi> against the <hi>Saracens; Princes</hi> deposed
by <hi>Popes,</hi> which <hi>lasted</hi> for many Ages; the <hi>Butcheries</hi>
of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> the <hi>Massacrees</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
A small Diversity of Opinion about indifferent
Matters was never the cause of such barbarous Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
therefore the present State of our <hi>Church</hi> is more
desireable, than the gross Ignorance and besotted Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I do here admonish you, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> not
to go on in your Censures of this kind, as the Author
of <hi>Pax Vobis</hi> hath done, your Brother in <hi>Scholastick
Duncery,</hi> before you have replyed to the learned and
ingenious Answerer of your <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> which you wrote
in Prose in the Case of the <hi>Duchess</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> Your slie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon Him in this Poem will not do the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in which you imitate the <hi>Hawking of the Magpye,</hi>
when she huffs her Train in token of Courage and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;
whilst, alass! 'tis her fear all, and another way
of crying the Hawk Mercy; and to the end, that the
Hawk finding nothing but Feathers to strike at, she may
so perhaps shelter her Body: It is very fit indeed, you
should have a <hi>Guide</hi> and a <hi>Keeper</hi> too; but Men in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64689:14"/>
their Wits do believe, that God made Man a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Creature, who feels as much Pleasure, when he
can give himself a good Account of his Actions, as one
that sees, does perceive, in comparison to a blind Man
who is led about; and therefore they think, that the
same merciful God would not contrive his Religion to
be dark, nor place it beyond the reach of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
when he designed it to perfect their Natures,
and to raise them to the utmost heights they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the next Charge is <hi>Novelty and Schism,</hi>
thus expressed, <hi>p.</hi> 66.
<q>
                  <l>We can point out each Period of the Time,</l>
                  <l>When they began, and who begat the Crime;</l>
                  <l>Can Calculate how long the Eclipse endur'd,</l>
                  <l>Who interpos'd, what Digits were obscur'd.</l>
               </q>
Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> you must know, was always good at <hi>Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
as when he made the Sun, Moon, and Earth act
one in a Dance: But I must say, that this is a new
way of writing Controversie, to run us down with
Whimsies instead of true Reasoning, as He hath been
used to astonish the Spectators in the Play-House with
<hi>Scenes, Clothes,</hi> and <hi>Dances;</hi> instead of giving Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
a Picture of themselves, and thereby making
Virtue belov'd, Vice abhor'd, and the little Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities
of Men's Tempers, call'd Humours, exposed
to Laughter.</p>
            <p>But seeing He is so exact at the Calculation of Time,
I would have him inform us, how old these following
Doctrines are; <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatory, the Merit
of Works, Invocation of Saints, the Supremacy of the
Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>the Authority of the Councils,</hi> and <hi>the
Infallibility of the Pope;</hi> these being the chief Causes,
for which we dissent from <hi>Rome.</hi> Surely in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
these things were not so: For according to our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64689:14"/>
Account, <hi>Infallibility</hi> goes no higher, than the <hi>Scholars</hi>
of <hi>Marcus</hi> in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> or the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius;
Purgatory</hi> comes from <hi>Origen,</hi> or at the furthest from <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
who had it from <hi>Montanus:</hi> The Denial of
Marriage to the Priesthood is derived from Pope <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus:
Transubstantiation</hi> is from the <hi>Lateran Council:</hi>
The Half-Communion is no older, than the time of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas:</hi>
Praying in an unknown Tongue may be fetcht
as far as from <hi>Gregory the Great:</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> denies the
Invocation of Saints departed to have been in his
Days; and the Supremacy of the Pope began in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface
the Third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against <hi>Transubstantiation Aquinas</hi> argues, <hi>Oper. Tom.</hi>
12. as a novel and an impossible thing, for one Body to
be <hi>locally</hi> in <hi>more places</hi> than <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>in all at once.</hi>
The witholding the <hi>Cup</hi> from the <hi>Laity</hi> is against our
Saviours Institution, who hath commanded all Men to
<hi>drink of this Cup,</hi> Matth. 26. 27. From the beginning
the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> were perused by the People; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the <hi>Traditores</hi> in the Persecution of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi>
who were called so from their delivering up of their
<hi>Bibles,</hi> which, before they were forced to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they made daily use of; therefore the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text
was read Weekly to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the <hi>New Testament</hi>
was written in <hi>Greek,</hi> because that Tongue was most
known to the <hi>Eastern World;</hi> and to pray in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Tongue, is against the plain Sense of the <hi>14th.</hi>
Chapter of the First Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Priests
also were permitted to have Wives both in the <hi>Old</hi>
and <hi>New Testaments,</hi> and many of the Blessed Apostles
were Married Men: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> asserts his Liberty
to carry a <hi>Wife</hi> along with him, as well as <hi>Cephas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These and many more Corruptions (which I could
mention) in point of Practice and Doctrine too, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd
the Christian World to look out for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64689:15"/>
to enquire for the <hi>old paths,</hi> and to walk
therein, and to reform, what was amiss, by what had
been the Belief and Practice of the Christian Church
from the beginning. In this Search are discovered the
Rise and Progress of all the new-invented Doctrines
in the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> by what Degrees her several
Errours have been brought in: For to go no further
back, than the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> we find new Articles
of Faith, such as the <hi>Sacrifice of the Mass,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine
of Purgatory,</hi> the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> the <hi>Worship of
Images,</hi> and the like, were enjoyned under the Pain of
Damnation: And in the Canon of the <hi>Fourth Session of
that Council</hi> Unwritten Traditions are decreed to be
of equal Authority with the Scriptures: Upon this our
first Reformers consulted the Scriptures, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Fathers of the Church, that they might see,
how things stood from the beginning, and only sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from them who had parted with the <hi>old</hi> and
the <hi>true Religion.</hi> Therefore it is in vain for Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi>
to scorn or to complain of us for leaving the <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> unless He can convince us, that we have forsaken
the Word of God, the Doctrine of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
the uncorrupted Primitive Church, the Four
First General Councils, or the Antient Creeds. This
is <hi>old Standard Faith,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> and <hi>these the first
plantations</hi> of the Truth of the Gospel; from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
whereof we are no <hi>Schismaticks:</hi> for <hi>Schism</hi>
must needs be <hi>theirs,</hi> who give the cause of Separation,
not <hi>theirs,</hi> who do but separate, when the Cause is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and we have departed from <hi>Rome</hi> for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
because she hath in many Instances departed from
the Faith of <hi>Christ:</hi> Nay, had not the Pope affected
a Supremacy over all other Churches, besides his own,
we never had cast off a Yoak, which had never been
put on our Necks; and so it is plain, that the <hi>Vsurper
did make the Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64689:15"/>
It is indeed a Glorious Design to reconcile all
Churches to one Doctrine and Communion; but then
it must not be done by such Tyranny, as the Popes
have practised to fetter Men streighter under the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of fictitious Articles of Faith; but Unity from this
kind of Force is rather to be prayed against, than
wish'd for: God only in his own time, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrutable
Methods of his Providence, is able to range
his whole Church scattered over the Face of the Earth,
into primitive Unity and Christian Order. In the mean
time Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> should lay aside his Projects of <hi>Pillories,
Rods, Gibbets</hi> and <hi>Inquisitions</hi> to make us acquiesce in
his Judgment, whatever be our private Opinion: In
some parts of <hi>his allegorical Poem,</hi> one would verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the <hi>Poet</hi> himself was turned into a <hi>Wolfe,</hi>
for his Speech is all howling, yelling, and barking, that
you would imagin, He would presently pull out the
Throats, and suck the Bloud of all the <hi>Protestant Sheep,</hi>
who are always ready to suffer, rather than commit
that Errour against their Consciences, which must ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them <hi>Hypocrites</hi> to God, and <hi>Knaves</hi> amongst Men.
Therefore, notwithstanding, Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> hath thought fit
to pass over from one perswasion of Religion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet he might forbear <hi>to spit</hi> thrice at every Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Religion, that he hath relinquished, or to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
his new Acquaintance, to trample upon his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Companions; these are Usages, that can only be
expected from a <hi>Renegado</hi> of <hi>Argier,</hi> or <hi>Tunis,</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
in Expiation, that he may gain better credence of
being a sincere <hi>Mussulman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. He Scoffs at the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in calling
her the <hi>Passive, Church:</hi> For Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> is resolved, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
she would not admit him into her Preferments,
that she shall know what a <hi>Satyrist</hi> he is; for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he hath made a <hi>Panther,</hi> a spotted Beast of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64689:16"/>
most innocent and blameless Church; he hath accused
of Pride, the humblest; of Rapacity and Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the most inoffensive and bountiful; of Ignorance
and want of Devotion, the most Learned and Pious;
of false Doctrine, the most Primitive; of ill Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
the most decent Church under Heaven. And
when nothing else could be said, he even upbraids it
with its <hi>Submission</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> Notwithstanding
all his impudent disgraces, there remains this one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> That the same Man
who now vilifies her so basely, was thought unworthy
of her Communion, for his vicious and ill life: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it is easie to conjecture at the cause of this his
harsh usage of our Church; he hath but lately Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized
from it, and is but just entred into the <hi>Romish
Faith;</hi> therefore he was resolved to give an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
proof of the Establishment thereof, by revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if any should still doubt
of the reality of his Conversion: And this I confess,
he hath prosecuted with all the <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Bigotry,</hi>
which commonly accompanies <hi>new Converts.</hi> Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
knew very well, the Church of <hi>England</hi> to
be a Body, that will never Rebell against the King;
therefore in derision, he calls her the <hi>Passive Church;</hi>
Thanks be to God, she is so; therefore she is the True
Church of Christ: So that, for distinction sake, we will
name <hi>yours,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bayes, Armarillis,</hi> because of her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
against all Princes that are not of her mind;
and this is now our Poets <hi>new Mistress;</hi> as a Friend
of his broke off his Match with <hi>Cloris,</hi> to marry <hi>Old
Ioan.</hi> But (Sir) you have not in the least hit the <hi>Rellish</hi>
of the Town by this Conceit; the choicest Spirits, you
may have a value for, do despise you for it; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your custom, in <hi>This you have done, what
was never done before;</hi> Traduce a Church for her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64689:16"/>
Loyalty, at the same time, that you would be
thought a Faithful Subject to the Crown. For this
reason, if a <hi>Test</hi> be of any use at all, it would be to
keep out such Zealots, as you are, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> from
being concerned in human Society; who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all that stand in their way, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of that <hi>fiery Order,</hi> whose vehement Principles
are distastful to <hi>Rome</hi> its self; who are uneasie, unless
they carry all before them: Our protection against
the <hi>heats</hi> of these Men, next under God, is wholly
placed in our <hi>most gracious King,</hi> who, as a <hi>true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of his Countrey, doth act in his Favour and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to his People, according to the temper of our
most holy Religion, which inspires Mankind with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Mercy: But we must needs have sad appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the designs of those, who have ever used
all the Arts of Craft and Violence to extirpate the
<hi>Northern Heresie,</hi> as they mis-call our Religion, and
to promote their own Interest in opposition to the
ends, and the <hi>true genius</hi> of Christianity: Our sole
fence against them is his <hi>Majesties promise;</hi> and to
Royal and Generous Minds, no Stipulations are so
binding, as their own voluntary promises; nor is it
to be wonder'd at, if they hold those Conditions, that
they put upon themselves, the most inviolable.</p>
            <p>Now I may Appeal to the common sense of any
Reader, whether this Poem be not one of the <hi>rankest</hi>
pieces of Folly and Malice blended together, among
all the <hi>impertinent, dull, phantastical things,</hi> the Town
is at this time tired with: Yet the Author would be
esteemed a solemn and a grave Person; and he may
observe in the Conversation he hath lately had with
the <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> that the gravest are the <hi>Owl</hi> and
the <hi>Ass.</hi> For sometimes this Mr. <hi>Bayes is not able to say
one good thing in a whole page, if it were to save his Life;</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:64689:17"/>
then he lays about him, as if he were <hi>running a Muck,</hi>
and had resolved to kill all that he met: At one time he
picks quarrels with the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and slights the
Readers of it with the most <hi>impertinent pratings:</hi> At
another time he <hi>Roars</hi> and <hi>Huffs</hi> against the <hi>Man in
Black,</hi> with the most <hi>rude and clownish deportment;</hi> so
that all Civil Company must needs loath his ill-breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more, than the <hi>Buffoonry of Hostlers and Porters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one place, he blames <hi>Protestants</hi> for having no
<hi>Treatise of Humility,</hi> but what they have borrowed
from Foreigners: So the <hi>Protestants Poets</hi> say, that Mr.
<hi>Bayes</hi> could never have been an Author, without steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Milton,</hi> and many others, that have been
<hi>helps for his Wit</hi> to furnish out the Stage: And how
many good thoughts hath he made his own, as <hi>he
phrases it in the Rehearsal,</hi> by <hi>Transprosing</hi> and <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing:</hi>
As now he hopes, these Arguments for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
may pass for his, because he hath put them into
an <hi>unusual dress,</hi> and hath tagg'd 'em with Rhimes.
And to speak the truth, there is very little <hi>of his own</hi>
in any Book that he hath published, but the Arrogance
and unparallel'd Censoriousness, which he exercises
over all other Writers.</p>
            <p>But if the Credit of all Men whatsoever, be, and
ought to be so well guarded, both by Nature, Law,
and Discretion, the <hi>Clergy</hi> certainly, of all others, ought
to be kept and preserved Sacred in their Reputation:
For they being Men of the same Spirit with others, and
no less subject to humane Passions, it is the <hi>most unmanly</hi>
as well as <hi>base thing,</hi> to treat them with <hi>open affronts;</hi>
to pelt them with <hi>Ribaldry,</hi> and <hi>Atheistical Drollery:</hi>
For all that, these Calumnies are the <hi>grand refinements</hi>
of Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his Poem; and without <hi>these Flowers</hi> he
thought his new Religion could not be enough em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belish'd
or set off: <hi>Ignorant and mistaken Proselyte!</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64689:17"/>
Who believes it necessary to part with any Virtue,
even common Civility, that he may cast Dirt upon the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> as if that did not require and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
more Sobriety, more <hi>Mortification,</hi> than ever
He could be guilty of: Whereas it hath always been
fruitful of Men, who together with Obedience to the
best Discipline, have lived to the Envy of the Papists
in their Conversation, and without such <hi>true Defenders
of the Christian Faith</hi> could never have baffled them so
shamefully, as they have done of late. Insomuch that
I fancy, they will make very few Converts by <hi>disputing,</hi>
unless they may pretend to have turned some (<hi>as in
the old</hi> Florentine <hi>Wars</hi>) by meer tiring them out, and
perfect weariness; or some such <hi>Libertines,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi>
who will be <hi>seemingly religious,</hi> when it is their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
but when 'tis not, then any thing is their Duty,
that contributes to their Security.</p>
            <p>For being <hi>influenc'd</hi> by this Principle, our Poet is
not only contented to leave our Church, but all of a
sudden he appears <hi>at the Head of the contrary Party;</hi>
which, supposing the Dispute to be just, yet in him
was so <hi>mercenary,</hi> that none would have descended to
<hi>act this part,</hi> but one, who could not get a Livelihood
<hi>from the Play-house:</hi> But so <hi>flippant</hi> He is, and forward
to write against <hi>Protestancy</hi> in general, that in despight
of Sense and good Manners,
<q>
                  <l>He huffs, he struts, looks big, and stares;</l>
                  <l>And all this he can do, because he dares.</l>
               </q>
And when he had <hi>cook'd up these musty Collections,</hi> he
recommends them with that <hi>high Sauce,</hi> the <hi>Magnificence
of Verse;</hi> but methinks he was out in his <hi>Politicks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath not recommended his <hi>Religion,</hi> as He
was wont to do <hi>his Plays,</hi> by Civility, Insinuation, good
Language, and all That; for the <hi>English</hi> being a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd
People, are sooner won by good Words than
Blows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64689:18"/>
It hath been an odious Task to me all along to pick
out the <hi>most noxious pieces</hi> of his Satyr; therefore I
shall leave many passages unsearcht, nor read any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon his <hi>Swallows</hi> and <hi>Pigeons,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi>
makes the <hi>bravest Work that ever Man saw;</hi> and This is
the <hi>Bane</hi> of all such kind of Writers; the Vulgar ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
understand them, and if they did, they would
<hi>not be one jot the better:</hi> No <hi>Romance</hi> can furnish us
with <hi>such pleasant and worshipful Tales;</hi> they want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of perfection, but that they do not begin <hi>with
once upon a time;</hi> which Mr. <hi>Bayes, according to his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy,</hi>
if he had thought on't, would never have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And more than this, by changing some Lines,
and bringing in a few People talking in the way of
Dialogue, this very <hi>Poem may serve for a Play,</hi> as
<hi>smiling</hi> and <hi>frowning</hi> are performed in the Face with
the <hi>same Muscles</hi> very little altered. But still I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagin the reason, why He should make use of these
<hi>tedious and impertinent Allegories,</hi> unless he thought,
that what was <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>argumentative,</hi> being imp'd with
something more <hi>light</hi> and <hi>airy,</hi> might carry further, and
pierce deeper: Unless in this time of Heat and Anger
the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> may think fit to employ him, as
being a <hi>spightful Creature,</hi> or the <hi>good Fathers</hi> may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
themselves awhile with an <hi>Animal,</hi> that is <hi>unlucky,
mimical,</hi> and <hi>gamesom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet let me tell you, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> your best Friends
declare you a more competent Judge of some sort of
Wit and Delight, than of Religion, or any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
about it; they say, you manage <hi>Rhythmes well;</hi>
and that you have a good Art in making <hi>high Idea's</hi> of
Honour, and in <hi>speaking noble things:</hi> In this Debate,
it had been more edifying, if you had wrote <hi>in Prose;</hi>
it would have rendred your Speech more natural, and
you would never have made so much Contention, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64689:18"/>
you have done, between the <hi>Rhythme</hi> and the <hi>Sense.</hi>
But I see, he is not in a condition of taking Counsel,
or of correcting his Vices; therefore he will continue
in defiance of all the means, that can be used to the
contrary, <hi>an endless Scribler, an empty Politician, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
Poet, and an idle pretender to Controversie;</hi> so that
he is resolved to Rave against us as so many <hi>vile Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
just as the <hi>Italians, French,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> have
had the Vanity to boast, that all Wit is to be sought
for, no where, but amongst themselves; it is their esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Rule, that good Sense has always kept near the
warm Sun, and scarce ever yet dared to come farther,
<hi>than the forty ninth degree Northward;</hi> This is a very
unaccountable Fancy; but they have the same Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Religion too, as if all <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> could not go
<hi>out of the Bounds,</hi> which they have set it.</p>
            <p>So Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his Controversial Writings, are <hi>unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable,</hi>
just as some places are <hi>impregnable,</hi> by reason
of the <hi>Dirt</hi> that lies about them; and to maintain a
conflict any longer with his Reasons, were to renew
the old way of fighting with <hi>Sand-bags,</hi> the true <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of his unjoynted, incoherent</hi> Stuff; For if he goes
on thus in making Volumes of Controversie, his best
Confuters, will be the <hi>Grocers</hi> and <hi>Haberdashers of
Small Wares,</hi> who will bind up their <hi>rotten Raisons,</hi> and
<hi>Mundungus</hi> in his Papers; and his <hi>Book-sellers</hi> will
dwell at the <hi>South-side</hi> of <hi>Paul's,</hi> where his Works
shall be bound up, as his <hi>Forefather William Prynnes</hi>
were, in Trunks, Hat-cases, and Bandboxes. I am</p>
