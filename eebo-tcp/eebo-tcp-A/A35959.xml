            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have sometimes appeared in publick, though not with the <hi>Gold of Ophir,</hi> and <hi>Tyrian Purpure,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Persians</hi> were accustomed to present their Princes, and Benefactors, in testimony of their Obeysance and Gratitude; yet with Oblations sutable to my Ability as now,
<pb facs="tcp:61596:3"/>
though unsutable to your Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Your unstained Reputation, Candour, and Ingenuity, by which you are guided in the Management of the weighty Affairs of the City. Your encouraging by your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and good example the holy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, Vertue and Learning in Schooles and Universities, within the <hi>Verge</hi> of your <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> The commemoration of Favours, which I have received from the <hi>Council,</hi> these many years bygone, have had no small In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon me, to make this publick, yet humble Address. And though I have done but little by way of Remuneration, yet <hi>Somewhat,</hi> to be a Remembrance of my hearty affection to the <hi>Good Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have made some small attempts, during the twelve years I taught <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> and <hi>Experimental Philosophy,</hi> and since, for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Learning among others, which have not wanted success, whereby the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath been encouraged; especially by the kind acceptance, his <hi>Writings</hi> have met with from the greatest <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians</hi> in this Age, in <hi>England, Holland, Germany</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> It is yet recent in the minds of many Noble and worthy Persons,
<pb facs="tcp:61596:3"/>
what esteem His <hi>Royal Highness</hi> had of my Observations, of the great <hi>Blazing Star,</hi> which appeared in <hi>December</hi> 1680, which since have been published. I do not mention this for applause, or out of vanity, but for some peculiar reasons hinted at below. But these studies being only <hi>Hand-maids,</hi> and <hi>Subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient</hi> to <hi>Divine Knowledge,</hi> and not so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally useful, I have now given them a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numission, unless I be animated by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign, and favourable aspect of those, who may and can. I move in a distinct Sphere from Masters of Universities. They teach in <hi>Philosophy, the Causes and Reasons of Things.</hi> What I write is but <hi>Practical</hi> and <hi>Mechanical,</hi> for the promoting of natural Knowledge and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as do the <hi>Virtuosi.</hi> But in stead of such I present your <hi>Honours</hi> with a small bundle of <hi>Orthodox Truths</hi> confirmed by plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Testimonies, wherewith the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church hath in all Ages scattered the swarms of dark Errors, and damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, Locusts from the bottomless pit.</p>
            <p>But least I seem too tedious upon one Subject, I shall beg your <hi>Lordships</hi> liberty, to interpose for your Divertisement, this pleasant <hi>Interlude,</hi> the contemplation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may recreate the mind, and have its own
<pb facs="tcp:61596:4"/>
usefulness. That brave <hi>Athenian Orator De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> writes, that there was a standing Ordinance among the <hi>Locrians</hi> a people in <hi>Greece,</hi> that whosoever desired a new Law to be made he should make an overture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the whole Assembly with a rope about his neck. If it was Judged profitable for the Publick-Good, the Author was assoild, and got the thanks of the house. If not, he was instantly strangled. By this means for the space of 200 years and more, no new Law was made, save this only that follows. It was a received custome there, that if any man should strick out his neighbours eye; his on the other part was to be stricken out likewise, in imitation of <hi>Lex Talionis.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this crime to be expiated by any sacrifice, nor redeemed by any summ of Money or Gold, how great soever. A certain man who had but one eye, was threatned by his Adversary with the loss of it. This man taking it grievously, and judging the want of his sight more bitter than death, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd with a halter about his neck to offer this new Law to the Senate, <hi>viz.</hi> that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should strick out his neighbours eye, who had but one, he should be requited with the lose of both his, as a just recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; that the one might share equally
<pb facs="tcp:61596:4"/>
with the other in the same calamity. The Law was approven and Ratified by the whole meeting. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> relates this, teaching that in a well ordered City; Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates should take special care that new Laws be not rashly made or changed. But I return thither whence the famous <hi>Orator</hi> hath led me aside by this digression.</p>
            <p>I cannot but now after these wieghty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasives, make my next application for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and seriously entreat, that this little Book, if not for the value of the thing offered, yet for its design, which is that <hi>Truth may have victory over Error,</hi> and for the ingenuity and affection it flows from<note n="*" place="margin">In mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse satest.</note>, may be received into the tuition of your favour, and get a full protection against the <hi>Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>uncircumcised Philistimes,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enlightned with the splendor of your <hi>Lordships</hi> name, and receiving the impression of the <hi>Councils</hi> Authority upon it, may by the Lords blessing, be useful to young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Religion, and others too.

            <head>TO THE HONEST HEARTED READER</head>
            <p>THE two great Pillars upon which the kingdom of Satan is erected, and by which it is upheld, are Ignorance and Errour. And the two great Pillars which support the Kingdom of Christ, are Knowledge and Truth. Therefore our blessed Saviour resolving to subvert the kingdom of Satan among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tells the Apostle in his first Commission, that he was about to send him <hi>to open their eyes</hi> (namely their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding) <hi>by the Preaching and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Gospel, and to turn them from darkness to light, from natural blindness and worldly ignorance, unto the right and true knowledge of GOD.</hi> This is the first step of our <hi>Manumission</hi> from that spiritual thraldom. The Understanding is the Guide, and Pilot of the whole man. It is that faculty which sits at the helme of the Soul. But as the most skilful Pilot
<pb facs="tcp:61596:6"/>
may mistake his course in the dark, so may the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding when it wants the light of Knowledge. This is an accomplishment so desirable, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil knew not a more alluring bate to tempt our first Parents in Paradise, <hi>Ye shall be as Gods</hi> (sayes he) <hi>knowing good and evil.</hi> When the Lord had refer'd it to <hi>Solomons</hi> option, what to choose, he choose Wisdom and Knowledge. When once the Devil understood, that by the Preaching of the Gospel, his kingdom was ruined, he invents two new stratagems to overthrow Religion, even in the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and beginning of it, to wit Persecution and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Open persecution began in <hi>Nero,</hi> a very imp and graff of the Devil. When this <hi>Hirricano,</hi> and many others of that kind were past, and when the Churches of Christ were once at rest, he sends in a Deluge of <hi>Arianism,</hi> which in a short time so prodigiously spread, and over-ran the Christian World, that it seemed to carry all before it, an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, that did not strike at the uppermost boughs of Religion, but at the Root and Beeing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. But this second proved more sad than the first; for, where Persecution kills one thousand, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie kills ten thousand. The one is the <hi>Wild-Boar</hi> of the Forrest, the other is the little <hi>Fox,</hi> that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the Grapes of the Lords Vineyard. The one kills the bodies of Men and Women, the other poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Souls of Christians.</p>
            <p>In times of greater Light, as these and former
<pb facs="tcp:61596:6"/>
times have been reputed to be, <hi>Satan</hi> comes not abroad usually to deceive with his gross forgeries, and cloven foot: for every one almost would discern his haltings, but with more mystical, yet strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delusions, and invincible chains of darkness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he binds his captives the faster to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day. And therefore the <hi>Watch word</hi> given in the bright and shining times of the <hi>Apostles was</hi> to try the <hi>Spirits, and believe not every Spirit, and take heed of Spirits,</hi> who indeed were only fleshly and corrupt men yet called Spirits, because they pretended to have much of the Spirit, and their doctrine seemed only to advance the Spirit, the fitest and fairest <hi>cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs</hi> to deceive and inveigle the world in these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning times, that possibly could be spun<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> out of the poysonful bowels of corrupt and fleshly men: for <hi>Heresie</hi> is a work of the flesh.</p>
            <p>The times are now come, wherein by the refined mystical divinity of the old <hi>Moncks,</hi> all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Christ in the <hi>New Testament</hi> are <hi>allegorized and spiritualized</hi> out of the world. They reject the outward word, because of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching. They reject the outward <hi>Baptism,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the inward <hi>Baptism.</hi> They reject the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> because of the spiritual bread from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Lord Jesus.</hi> They abolish the outward Sabbath, because of a spiritual and inward Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of rest in the bosome of Christ. This is very
<pb facs="tcp:61596:7"/>
consistent with the observing the outward Sabbath. But they wickedly sever, and separat what GOD hath joyned together.</p>
            <p>But as to what relates to the present <hi>Treatise,</hi> I am not ignorant, that many eminent and learned <hi>Divines,</hi> far beyond whatever I could profess, have beatten this path, and travelled round the world of <hi>Polemick Divinity.</hi> But their writings being so Voluminous and large, that he who desires to have a full sight at one look of the chief controversies, can no more have it, than a man from the Peak of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriff,</hi> can get a clear sight of the whole Globe of the Earth. Which things, though they be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally worth the knowing, nevertheless, for so much as their number, and variety are an impediment to themselves, and the multiplicity of matter, makes the mind abruptly flit from one thing to another. Therefore I have imitated <hi>Geographers,</hi> who after they have surveyed the whole Globe of the Earth, draw Universal descriptions thereof, and comprehend the the whole image of that great <hi>Terra-queous</hi> Body within a narrow circumference of a <hi>Card</hi> or <hi>Mapp.</hi> In so doing, I may perhaps contribute some what towards the satisfaction of some, who neither can nor are able, to trace the wearisome foot steps, of those eminent Divines, who have written fully.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Treatise</hi> being <hi>Historical,</hi> none can expect, but I must have consulted others, and gleaned off their writtings what things were needful. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:61596:7"/>
here, as in writing <hi>Philosophy,</hi> or any such like <hi>Science,</hi> set up new <hi>Theorems,</hi> or <hi>Axioms,</hi> which have not been heard of before. This were to make a new Religion, a new System, and Body of Divinity, such as some <hi>giddy-headed Hereticks</hi> are thinking upon. I must confine my self to the good old way, and follow the heatten path-road, wherein men of sound principles have walked before me.</p>
            <p>This Book is not designed for men of knowledge and learning, who are more conversant in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than I am, but for the unlearned and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beginners, who need to be instructed with the sound principles of the true <hi>Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope none will think I have done amiss in menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning so many Religions, which had been better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named (some may think) than named. This might have some weight, if there were no more Religions in the world at this time, but one only, <hi>to wit,</hi> the true <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi> But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I cannot name so many here, as there are this day owned and professed in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> I cannot be to blame.</p>
            <p>This Book will be useful for understanding the <hi>Confession,</hi> and knowing the design of it. For how many read it, and commend it, that never knew the nature of it. Though there be a multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of questions, and many in number, yet all of them
<pb facs="tcp:61596:8"/>
to my best remembrance, are taken word by word out of the <hi>Confession.</hi> The answers are by <hi>Yes,</hi> or <hi>No.</hi> To which are subjoyned immediately the proofs of the <hi>Confession.</hi> These words which are often repeated, <hi>Well then, do not the</hi> Papists <hi>err,</hi> are nothing els but sure Conclusions drawn from two manifest propositions.</p>
            <p>The design of this <hi>Treatise</hi> is good. The method is plain and easy. The order of the Questions, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the order of the purposes in the <hi>Confession.</hi> The probations are such, as are made use of in the <hi>Confession,</hi> and by the <hi>Orthodox Divines,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Adversaries. They are either the very words of the <hi>Scripture</hi> in <hi>Terminis,</hi> or such as by good and necessary consequence, are drawn from the Scripture. They pass reckoning for number. Let no man blame me for speaking somewhat for the Truth, because another man hath spoken better. If I have said little in defence if it, I am sure I have said nothing against it; as the <hi>Apostle</hi> says, <hi>We can do nothing against the truth, but for it.</hi> If I cannot please all men, I shall endeavour at least to please some. And if I can please none, I shall not displease my self. I hope my friends will censure favourably, if my enemies censure maliciously. I expect as many Adversaries of one sort, and of another upon my top, as a travelling man hath midges and wasps about his head in a warm summer even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There are escapes in Authors, whose know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:61596:8"/>
is far beyond any thing I can profess. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel then, if a malicious <hi>Critick,</hi> like a viper from the fire of contention fasten upon a mans hand. For the Author being intent upon all, cannot lay out his whole industry upon every line, which a snarling Cur will bark at. I shal take it as a favour to have Learned and Iudicious men to censure me. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove one</hi> (says <hi>Solomon) that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and he will understand know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Some perhaps may look awry upon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have medled with some ticklish Questions, and been too positive in my Iudgement. If any such Questions are, they have occur'd to me in the Road, which I could not pass by, without a Salutation. But as all of them have been weighed in the <hi>Ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> so these like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, which some may call ticklish. I durst not for a world have been positive, if I had not judged them consonant to Truth, Therefore let all men, whatever perswasions they be of, judge charitably: for I have said nothing upon the account of fead or favour, <hi>nor any thing which may cause divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or offence. For they that are such serve not our</hi> Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>but their own belly; and by good words, and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. Rom. 16. 18.</hi> But I wish all who profess themselves to own the true <hi>Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Religion,</hi> were owning the sound principles of the <hi>Confession,</hi> and were sutable and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential
<pb facs="tcp:61596:9"/>
to them in their opinions and practises, and had not given too just cause and occasion to others to reproach all honest hearted men, as being of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and disloyal principles.</p>
            <p>It is probable, I may be less noticed by the common Adversaries, than by some who are so vain that they glory in injuring the Merit of a Book. For as a Gentleman of great Parts and Learning says well in his reflections upon one of his late pieces, <hi>the meanest Rogue may burn a City, or kill an Hero, whereas he could never have built the one, or equaled the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the method is plain and easy, so is the stile. I use only the common and plain Arguments. Some perhaps might have expected a dilution, or answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Adversaries Reasons. It is hard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to their Palate. They complain their arguments are enervate and clipped. Neither is it expedient to bring forth from the Devils Armory and Magazin his fiery darts. In confuting the Adversaries, I use no worse language than <hi>Do not they err.</hi> Sometimes I treat the <hi>Quakers</hi> with such language, as they use against others. Though they look like Lambs, yet gall them but a little, and you will find them express the Matulent and Teen of their heart. And as <hi>Cacus</hi> spouted fire against <hi>Hercules,</hi> who persued him as a Theif, so will they against all who persue them as Hereticks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. I published a little Book intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:61596:9"/>
               <hi>Tyrocinia Mathematica,</hi> for the use of my <hi>Schollars,</hi> and young <hi>Students,</hi> which was dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to that great <hi>Hero, John Duke of Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dail. Anno</hi> 1669, I had a large Book printed in <hi>Holland</hi> dedicated to the <hi>Earle of Winton.</hi> In the year 1672, a third was published, intituled the <hi>Hydrostaticks.</hi> Though some endeavoured to ruin the reputation of my Writings at home, yet they were not able to do it abroad. But least this peece may meet with the like welcome into the world, I shall beg liberty to cite one passage of a letter from a most intelligent Gentleman, in vindication of that Book intituled <hi>Ars Nova &amp; Magna,</hi> against which so many flate contradictions were uttered, which the other two likewise met with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ostend,</hi> October 10. 1670. <hi>I must not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to tell you a passage anent your late peece. When we were at</hi> Breda, <hi>we had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to see</hi> Collonel Lauther, <hi>who fell in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grating that</hi> Scots Spirits <hi>were not encouraged. And told he had seen a Book lately published by one</hi> Sinclar, <hi>whereof he had a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, and that many others as well as he esteemed it highly. For example, he told of a</hi> Dutchman<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
               <hi>who is one of the</hi> French Virtuosi, <hi>that said he had seen nothing on that subject com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to it; and it was esteemed so in</hi> France. <hi>If you have any other thing to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61596:10"/>
               <hi>I pray you hasten it, for it will not want acceptance.</hi> This testimony was homologate after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by that famous <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> and <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, Christopher Sturmius,</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> in his Book intituled <hi>Collegium Curiosum<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi> which some here have seen. He hath gone thorow the Book diligently, and gleaned the finest purposes in it, and sent them abroad, not as his own Inventions, but as mine, which he would never have done, if the Experiments had been all of them either <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths</hi> and <hi>Lies,</hi> or not <hi>New,</hi> and <hi>unheard</hi> off. This testimony from a Stranger, vindicates suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. The rest of my writings are likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Mr. Boile, Sir Frances Hales, Doct. Glanvil,</hi> and others, men of eminent skill and knowledge in such matters, as I treat of.</p>
            <p>In going thorow this Book, you will find the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> confuted upon threescore and fourteen several heads. The <hi>Quakers</hi> upon thirty and two. The <hi>Socinians</hi> upon fourty and seven. The <hi>Lutheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> upon thirteen. The <hi>Antinomians</hi> upon as many. The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> upon thirty and two. The <hi>Arminians</hi> upon twenty and seven. The rest are confuted, some upon fewer; some upon more heads; and that only according to their chief and grand Errors. For a man to confute all and every one of their false and absurd Tenets, would be a task, like the cleanseing of <hi>Augeas</hi> King of <hi>Elis</hi> his <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall,</hi> which none but <hi>Hercules</hi> was able to do.
<pb facs="tcp:61596:10"/>
Neither would it be worth the while, seeing by the confutation of those mentioned, you may the more easily confute the rest. If any be too curious to inquire, why the Author hath touched so many controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in Religion, and yet hath medled nothing with the great controversie of the time. I answer, I had been both officious and impertinent to have touched matters, which lay not in my way. For in all the <hi>Confession,</hi> which is the onlie Road I walk in, there is not one Mum or Syllable of the one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of the other.</p>
            <p>The Book for <hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with many from abroad. The <hi>Printer</hi> a Person of special skill, hath done his dutie sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in correcting; so that I find it needless to prefix or subjoyn <hi>Errata Corrigenda.</hi> If there be any <hi>Literal faults,</hi> which the most skilful <hi>Author,</hi> and best of <hi>Printers</hi> cannot prevent, let the <hi>Reader</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them only to invincible necessity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our good Lord, whose Prerogative it is to teach, to profit, bless this little Book, that it may be to thee as a light shining in a dark place, untill the day dawn and the day star arise in thy heart, that thereby thou mayest grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi>

                  <p>Well then, do not the <hi>Socinians</hi> err, who mantain, <hi>That Men living according to the Law, and Light of Nature, may be saved?</hi> Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, none can be saved, unless they be born again, by the incorruptible seed of the Word. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. (2) Because, Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and no man cometh to the Father, but by the Son, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 6. (3) Because, there is none other Name under Heaven, given among men whereby we must be saved, but by the Name of Jesus, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. (4) Because, men cannot believe in Christ without <hi>supernatural revelation:</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61596:17"/>
and therefore cannot be sanctified or justified; because all Justification, Sanctification, and Remission of sins, are by GODS Grace, and Faith in Jesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. <hi>Acts.</hi> 26. 18. Neither can men be so saved, <hi>viz.</hi> by liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the light of Nature, because Salvation is promised onely to Believers in Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. (5.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, all that know not GOD, will be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eternally, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8. But men without supernatural Revelation cannot savingly know GOD, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 27. (6.) Men destitute of supernatural Revelation cannot know their own corruption and misery, by the first <hi>Adam,</hi> nor the remedy which is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ, the <hi>second Adam.</hi> They are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out GOD, without Hope, without the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, without the Church, and covenant of God: and the mysteries of Faith are hid, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them allanerly, that perish, and are lost, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 11, 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 25, 26, 27.</p>

                  <p>Well then, doth not the <hi>Popish Church</hi> err, that affirmes, the <hi>true Church to be infallible in</hi>

                     <hi>teaching and propounding Articles of Faith, both without, and against the Scripture:</hi> and that their <hi>unwritten Traditions are of Divine, and equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, with the Canon of the Scripture?</hi> Yes. Do not likewise the <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> err, affirming, that <hi>GOD doth teach, and guide the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect into all truth, by the alone instinct and light of the Spirit, without any written Word whatsoever?</hi> Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) Because, the Scriptures are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which the Church is built. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. (2.) Because, all things are to be examined, by the Rule of the Word; as the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11, 12. (3) Because, unwritten Traditions, are subject and lyable to many corruptions, and are soon, and quickly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. (4.) Because, we have Life Eternal in the Scriptures; therefore they must be most necessary to the Church, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 39. (5.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the Scriptures are given, that the Man of GOD, may be perfect, thorowly furnished to all good works, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. And the Scriptures are written, that men may believe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 31.</p>

                  </p>

Here it is evident, that the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> and the Scripture, are the same. (2.) Because, the predictions of the Prophets, are expresly called the <hi>Word of GOD.</hi> Now in the first year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of <hi>Persia,</hi> that the Word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> might be accomplished, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36. 22. Here we see it is evident, that the written Prophesies of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> which are a part of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are called the <hi>Word of GOD.</hi> (3.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, what Christ calls the commandement of GOD, He calls the <hi>Word of GOD, Mar.</hi> 7. 9, 10. compared with v: 13. (4.) Because, the Apostle calls the sword of the Spirit, the <hi>Word of God.</hi> This sword, is the sword of the Holy Spirit, which he doth, as it were, put into our hand, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist Satan, against all his temptations, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17. Therefore, by the sword of the Spirit, must be understood the Scripture, not the Spirit it self, as some <hi>Quakers</hi> affirm. It is evident also, from the fourth chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where Christ being tempted by the Devil, with three

different temptations; resists him with three different places of Scripture. And being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the Pharisees, why his Disciples did pluck the ears of Corn upon the Sabbath day; answered by Scripture. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3, 4.

Because, the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. This cannot be understood of Christ, because <hi>Paul</hi> in his other writings doth not call the Person of Christ by this name, and therefore must be understood of the word of the Gospel, the power whereof is described, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16.

                  <p>Well then, doth not the <hi>Popish Church</hi> err, who maintain their <hi>Unwritten Traditions to be the Rule of Faith?</hi> Yes.

                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) Because, the Scriptures are called a Rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. (2.)

Because, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is written, that we may believe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 31. (5.) Because, the Scripture is given for making the man of GOD perfect, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. (6.) Because, we must betake our selves in the whole of Religion to the <hi>Law,</hi> and to the <hi>Testimony, Isa.</hi> 8. 20. (7) Because, Christ himself, refers the greatest question, that ever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61596:21"/>
was, whether he be the Son of GOD, or not, to the Scriptures, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 38, 39. Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (says he) for they testify of me. (8) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> did never give such a designation to his own Word, as an <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rule,</hi> and <hi>dead Letter;</hi> or as some <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> call them, not the <hi>principal Fountain of Truth, and knowledge,</hi> nor the <hi>first rule of Faith and Manners,</hi> but the <hi>Regula secundaria,</hi> subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the <hi>Spirit;</hi> whence, as they affirm, <hi>the holy Scriptures have all their true worth, excellency, and certainty:</hi> whereas <hi>Paul</hi> sayes expresly, Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of <hi>GOD, Rom.</hi> 10. 14. (9.) Because, the spirits cannot be known, by any other Rule, than by the written Word. It is certain, that the Devil transforms himself into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. There is a spirit of the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.

The Angel says, he was <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> the son of <hi>Ananias.</hi> This was a manifest lie, which cannot be attributed to a good Angel; and therefore the Spirit of GOD, hath not dictated this History.

And it is said, <hi>Tobit</hi> 12. 15. by the Angel, I am <hi>Raphael,</hi> one of the seven <hi>holy Angels,</hi> that presents the prayers of the Saints. This is only proper to Christ. (3.)

Because, there can be no urgent necessity shown, why the Fountains are corrupted.

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because though there be a plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Persons mentioned in Scripture, yet it is ever God as One, as is evident from the first chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the last. For if that one God have in himself all perfections, there can be no perfection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side him, and so no God, but this one true God: for if there were; He should not be God, because not infinite in perfection. And if God be infinite in perfection, then surely there cannot be a multiplicity of Gods, seing that which is infinite, in that respect, cannot be multiplied. (2) It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>Deut:</hi> 32: 39: where the Lord speaketh of himself, <hi>I, even I am he,</hi> and there is no God with me. (3) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, God is Omnipotent, and so cannot be hindred by any other, in his working. <hi>Rev:</hi> 15: 3: (4) It is evident from Christs words to the young man of the Gospel, <hi>there is none good but one, that is God.</hi> (5) From the Words of <hi>Hanna</hi> in her Song, for there is none beside thee (O Lord) neither is there any Rock;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61596:27"/>
beside our God. (6) From the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8: 6: to us, says he, there is but one God. (7) From what Christ said to one of the <hi>Scribes, viz: the Lord our God is one Lord: Mark</hi> 12: 29: (8) Because, God is a most absolute, and most perfect Beeing, and so beyond all other things, One: <hi>Iohn</hi> 10: 29. <hi>Psalm</hi> 145: 3: 147: 5: (9) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, this one blessed God, is most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely sufficient, and furnished with infinite Power, and Wisdom, for the production, conservation, and ruleing all things in Heaven and in Earth. (10) Because, he is of all things without himself, the first and supream cause, from which all the Creatures visible, or invisible, have their rise and beginning. (11) It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, lastly, from the testimonies of the most wise <hi>Heathens,</hi> who have been necessitated to acknowledge, but one God only.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) From the places of Scripture already cited. (2) From the Apostolical Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in which the three Persons of the God-head, are called upon expresly: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14. (3) From, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. Where the three Persons, are named <hi>Spirit, Lord, God.</hi> And from <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 26. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth.

                  <p>It is evident also, that the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are really distinct from one another, and are three <hi>Persons.</hi> They are indeed in respect of their Essence, which is indivisibly communicable to them, One and the same GOD; but considered Personally, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer really, for the <hi>Father</hi> is not the <hi>Son,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he, that sits upon the Throne, the <hi>Lamb.</hi> Neither the <hi>Father,</hi> nor the <hi>Spirit</hi>

were <hi>incarnate,</hi> but the <hi>Son,</hi> who died, and was buried, which can be said of none, but of a <hi>Person.</hi> It cannot be said that the <hi>Father</hi> died, or that the <hi>Spirit</hi> died. Next, is not the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of GOD, as the <hi>Son</hi> is the <hi>Son</hi> of GOD? And if that, suppose, a real di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct personality, this must do it also. Now if the Father be God, and the Son be God, and the Spirit God also, who have one, and the same divine nature, and essence indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly communicated to them; and so, if there be but one God, and yet these three really distinct, then they must be distinct <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> in respect of their Personal properties, seing they are <hi>Persons,</hi> and distinct. The Son, (as was said) is called the <hi>express Image of the Fathers Person,</hi> which evidently shews, that the <hi>Father,</hi> considered as distinct from the <hi>Son,</hi> is a <hi>Person,</hi> and subsists. If then, thus it be, must not the <hi>Son,</hi> as distinct from the <hi>Father,</hi> and so lively and expresly representing his <hi>person,</hi> be a <hi>person</hi> also, having this from the <hi>Father?</hi> The same must be true likewise, of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> who is GOD equal with both, yet different from both; for he who proceedeth from the <hi>Father,</hi> and from the <hi>Son,</hi> must differ from the <hi>Father,</hi> and from the <hi>Son;</hi> as he who is begotten, must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from him that begat him.</p>

of working in time: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. whence it is evident, that God worketh effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually, and immediately in time all things which are done: but he worketh by his will those things, which he will have to be in time (after that manner, and in that time, how, and when they come to pass) <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 3.

                  <p>(1.) Because, Christ thanked his Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because he had hid those things from the wise and prudent,

but the manifestation of Gods Justice. Lastly, sin is the effect of mans free will, and condemnation is the effect of Justice, but the Decree of God is the cause of neither.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yes. <hi>Heb:</hi> 8, 9, 10, chapters; <hi>Rom:</hi> 4: 11: <hi>Col:</hi> 2: 11, 12: 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5: 7:</p>
                  <p>Well then, do not the <hi>Socinians</hi> err, who maintain, <hi>that the Legal Sacrifices did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signifie the expiatory Sacrifice of Christ, neither were Types nor Figures of it; but that those Sacrifices, which the</hi> Jews <hi>offered for sin, did really, and in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed, purge away all the sins for which they were offered?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are here two parts to be considered; First, the <hi>Negative, That the Legal Sacrifices did not foresignifie.</hi> The second, the <hi>Affirmative, that they did truely make a real expiation and</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61596:42"/>
                     <hi>atonement.</hi> The first is evidently confuted from Scripture Testimonies; for the Law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things, can never with those Sacrifices which they offered year by year, continually, make the Comers thereunto perfect; <hi>Heb:</hi> 10: 4. The Apostle calls here, these Legal Sacrifices, <hi>a Shadow:</hi> and <hi>Heb:</hi> 9: 9: he calls them <hi>a Figure:</hi> and verse 24, he calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Exemplaria verorum,</hi> the Figures of the <hi>True;</hi> and <hi>Col:</hi> 2: 17: he calls them <hi>a shadow of things to come,</hi> but the Body is of Christ, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but that the thing signified is of Christ: that is to say, fulfilled in Christ. For all the <hi>shadows</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> had a respect to Christ, and his Benefits; by whose coming they also have an end. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 17. it is said, <hi>That the Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Iesus Christ.</hi> By Grace, understand the Grace of Redemption, from the curse of the Law; <hi>Gal:</hi> 3. 13. and of Adoption for Children; <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Rom:</hi> 8. 15. By Truth, understand the fulfilling both of the Promises, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1. 20. and of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and Types; <hi>Col:</hi> 2. 17. For this cause the Apostles have alwayes pressed, the Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Legal Rites, and Ceremonies; because the Truth being exhibited, by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61596:43"/>
coming of the <hi>Anti-type,</hi> the shadows of the Type, ought deservedly to cease, and be no more: according to that of <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 27.</p>
                  <p>The second part is likewise evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed; namely, <hi>that the Legal Sacrifices did truely and really purge away all the sins, for which they were offered.</hi> (1) Because, the Apostle sayes, <hi>the blood of Bulls, and Goats, cannot take away sin; Heb:</hi> 10: 4. (2) Because, those <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were not able to make him that did the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice perfect; Heb:</hi> 9: 9. (3) Because, these Legal Sacrifices did leave the sins of such as offered, unexpiated, until they were purged away by the death, and blood of Christ; <hi>Heb:</hi> 9. 15. (4) Because, the sins of Believers, under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> were forgiven and pardoned after the same manner, that our sins under the <hi>New Testament</hi> are pardoned; <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 11.</p>

                  <p>Well then, do not the <hi>Nestorians</hi> err, who maintain, <hi>the Union between the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, not to be</hi> Hypostatical, <hi>but only by way of Assistence: and that, as there are two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Christ, so there are two Persons, one proper to the Divine Nature, another proper to the Humane Nature?</hi>

                  <p>Yes.</p>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, unless <hi>Christ-God-Man</hi> were but one Person, the Merit of his Death, would not be of so great value, as to redeem the Elect from infinite, and eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: seeing hence cometh, all the value, and worth of his death, that the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who was God, did suffer, and die for us. (2) Because, otherwise, Christ had been swallowed up, and devoured by the wrath of God, against the sins of the Elect, which he himself undertook. (3) Because, Christ, if he had not been both God and Man, in one Person, he could not have been a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: for a Mediator must be One; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</p>

                     <hi>IS the Godhead, and Man-hood in Christ, united without Conversion, Composition, or Confusion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>Well then, do not those old <hi>Hereticks,</hi> the <hi>Eutichians</hi> err, who maintain, <hi>that as the Person of Christ is One, so his Nature is made One, by a composition, or Confusion of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, such a <hi>Composition,</hi> is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, seing the Divine Nature, is most perfect, and cannot lose any, of its own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, unless we would affirm, the Divine Nature, to be mutable, and changeable. (2) Because, that same Christ, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Flesh descended of the <hi>Iews,</hi> is over all, <hi>God blessed for ever; Rom.</hi> 9. 5. (3) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, this doctrine takes away all means of Mediation: for, by taking away the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Natures, they take away the Natures themselves: and so neither could Christ have suffered in our place, because not Man: neither could he have given any vertue, value, or worth, to his sufferings, because not God.</p>

                  <p>Yes.</p>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Scripture testifies, that his soul was sad unto death; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 37. (2) Because, the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> testifies, that when Christ saw <hi>Mary</hi> weeping for her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he groaned in Spirit, and was troubled; <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 33. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 27.

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Active disobedience of the first <hi>Adam</hi> made us all sinners: therefore we must be made Righteous, by the Active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the second <hi>Adam; Rom.</hi> 5. 19. (2) Because, Christ not only offered himself to the death for us, but for their sakes (that is, for the Elects sake) he sanctified himself (that is, he gave up himself, as a holy sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 19. (3) Because, it behoved Christ to fulfil all righteousness; <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15. (4) Because, we stood in need; not only of the expiation of sin, for saving us from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, but of the gift of righteousness, for obtaining eternal life, according to that precept and demand of the Law, <hi>Do this, and thou shalt live.</hi> And therefore Christ is not only called our <hi>Ransom,</hi> but the end and perfection of the Law, to every one, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61596:47"/>
believeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. That is, the aim of giving the Law by <hi>Moses,</hi> is that, thereby men being brought to the knowledge of their sin, should flie for refuge unto Christ, and his righteousness, as he that hath perfectly fulfilled the Law for us. (5) Because, the passive obedience of Christ, was not in it self meerly and purely passive, but his active obedience did challenge the chief, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part in it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 7. Then said I, <hi>lo, I come,: in the volume of the book, it is written of Me.</hi> With these words, our Saviour Christ declareth his willing Obedience, to accept of, undergo, and execute the <hi>Mediatorship,</hi> by GOD imposed upon him.

(6) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, <hi>whole Christ</hi> was given to us, with all his benefits: otherwise, if onely his passive Obedience were imputed to us, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that <hi>half Christ</hi> onely were given; to wit, <hi>Christ suffering,</hi> but not <hi>Christ doing</hi> those things which pleased the <hi>Father;</hi> taking away our sin, and saving from death onely, but not bringing Righteousness.

suffering for us, what we could not suffer.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>Well then, do not the <hi>Papists</hi> err, who maintain, <hi>that Christ is a Mediator only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his humane Nature?</hi>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, it was needful, for perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of the Mediator, that Christ should overcome death; which could not otherwise be done, than by his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. Where it is said, he was put to death in the Flesh, but quickned by the Spirit. (2) Because, there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny properties of the Mediator, which cannot in any wise agree to the humane Nature of Christ, <hi>as undertaking, and promising, that he will raise up all at the last day, whom the Father has given him; Iohn</hi> 6. 39. Again, he could not lay down his life, and take it up again, by the alone strength of his humane Nature: but all these are works proper to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; as is clear from the tenth chapter of <hi>Iohn</hi> v. 18. And (3) the application of those good things, which he hath merited, is the proper work of the Mediator, which can

expresses it by <hi>Hamartian Echein, peccatum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere,</hi> which signifies, <hi>to have sin.</hi> In the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Text,</hi> he means of sin, not only dwelling, but reigning in us, and made a trade of, and gone about, with the full and hearty consent of the will, and is expressed by the words <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martian poiein,</hi> to work sin, and to make a trade of it, as men do in any employment, they take delight in.

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, if inherent righteousness, did justify us, then good Works would justify us, but the Scripture denys that; <hi>Rom:</hi> 3: 20: Therefore, (says the Text) <hi>by the deeds of the Law, shall no flesh be justifyed in his sight:</hi> And <hi>verse</hi> 28: therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by Faith without the deeds of the Law. See <hi>Rom:</hi> 4: 6: <hi>Gal:</hi> 2: 16: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2: 8, 9, <hi>Titus</hi> 3: 5: In all which places, works are secluded expresly from our justification. (2) Because, the Righteousness, whereby we are justified, is not our proper own; 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5: 21: For he (to wit God) hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him; <hi>Phil:</hi> 3: 8, 9: and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by Faith. (3) Because, we are not justified by the Law; <hi>Acts</hi> 13: 38, 39. (4) Because,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61596:56"/>
our Justification, is given to us freely; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. (5) Because, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousness, is imperfect, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8: 46: For this Scripture says, there is no man that sinneth not. See that parallel place; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1: 8: <hi>Where it is said,</hi> if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us. (6) Because, if we were justified by inherent righteousness, we would have matter to boast of, which is contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2: 9: Not of works, least any man should boast. (7) Because, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of a Christian man, is the justifying of the ungodly. <hi>Rom:</hi> 4: 5.</p>

                  <p>(1) Because, if this be all, that Christ hath purchased by his death, that GOD might save fallen man, upon condition he believe; then Christ might attain his end in dying, and yet not one soul be saved by his death. (2) Because, it makes Christ a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Saviour onely, purchasing salvation to all, without any full and certain intention of

applying it to any.

                  <p>Well then, do not the <hi>Papists</hi> err, who maintain, <hi>Faith to be nothing, but a naked assent, to the truth revealed in the Word; it being placed by them, in the understanding onely?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, to believe, is to receive Christ, which is an Act of the Will; <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12.

(namely by Repentance) out of the sight, and sense, not only of the danger, but also of the filthiness, and odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his sins, as contrary to the holy Nature, and righteous law of God, and upon the apprehension of his mercy in Christ, to such as are penitent, so grieve for, and hate his sins, as to turn from them all unto God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36, 31. <hi>Isai.</hi> 30. 22. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 18, 19. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 12, 13. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Psalm</hi> 119. 6. 59. 106.</p>
                  <p>Well then, do not the <hi>Antinomians</hi> err, who maintain, <hi>we ought not by Repentance, to hate our sins, to mourn for them, and turn from them to God: but only to believe, that Christ in our stead and for us, hath Repented?</hi> Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Repentance, being a turning from our sins, and evil ways, and a turning to God, and Christ being without sin, could not be capable to repent in our stead; 1 <hi>King.</hi>

8. 35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26, 27. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 12, 13. (2) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, they that repent, confess their sins, and are grieved for them; <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 72. They hate their sins; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. They are ashamed, and confounded for them; <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 19. (3) Because, Repentance, is a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after a Godly manner, in the same very Persons, that Repent, wrought by God, by the preaching of the Word; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. (4) Because, Repentance, is called a renting of the heart; <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 12. And they that Repent, hate and loath themselves for their abominations; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 31. They are ashamed, and confounded; <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 19. They are grieved, and pricked in their Reins; <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 21 (5) Because, God promising Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to the people of the Jews, being converted to Christ, after their backsliding, says, I will pour out upon the house of <hi>David,</hi> and upon the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, and they shall look upon me, whom they have peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only Son; <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10, And shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness, for his first born. But is any man so foolish as to affirm, that when a man doth mourn, for his first born, he believes only, that another man, hath mourned in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61596:67"/>
his stead? (6) Because, Faith is one thing, and Repentance specially so called, is another thing; <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. In which places, Faith and Repentance, are numbred two diverse things. And it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident likewise, that Faith is the cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but nothing can be the cause of it self.</p>
                  <p>Do not likewise, the <hi>Papists</hi> err, who maintain, <hi>that we are not by Repentance converted from our sins to God; which they only make an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dument, or quality fitting, and disposing us for conversion, and meriting it: which (say they) consists in</hi> heart contrition, mouth confession, absolution, and satisfaction. <hi>By the first, They have heart sorrow for sin. By the second, They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their sins to the Preist. By the third, (Which can be no part of Repentance; seeing it is not a thing done by the sinner) they are absolved by the Priest, from theirsins. By the fourth<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> they make satisfaction for former sins, in performing some good work willingly undertaken, or enjoyned by the Priest after absolution; as Fastings, Chastising of their own bodies, Pilgrimages, and hearing of many Masses</hi> Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Word of God asserts no meritorious Work in us, to go before our conversion. Not by Works of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nss,, which we have done, but according
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61596:68"/>
to his mercy, he saved us; <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. (2) Because, the only merit of Christ, is the meritorious cause of our Conversion; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. (3) Because, true Repentance, is the infallible Antecedent, and forerunner of life; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. And they who truely Repent have all their sins pardoned; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. Nay, Repentance is a peice of the exercise of the life of Grace here, and worketh unto life, and salvation hereafter. But of no fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going disposition, or qualification previous to Repentance, can these forecited places of Scripture be understood. (4) Because, Repentance, and turning to God, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put, for the same thing: and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, while they study to excite, and stir up the people to Repentance, they signifie it, by the word <hi>Conversion</hi> and <hi>turning to GOD; Acts</hi> 11. 15, 16, 17, 18, 21. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 12, 13, <hi>Esek.</hi> 18. 31, 32. (5) Because, Whatsoever goes before our conversion to God, it cannot be of Faith; and therefore, it must displease God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 8: <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. But true Repentance is of Faith, and God delighteth in it; <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 18, 19, 20. (6) Because, in very many places of Scripture, Repentance is described, by a departing from evil, and a turning to God. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 16, 17. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. 7.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61596:68"/>
                     <hi>Psalm</hi> 34. 14. <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 1. (7) Because, heart contrition, mouth (confession, and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for) former sins which they call <hi>Pennance,</hi> as they are explained by the <hi>Papists,</hi> may be found in Hypocritical Repentance, as is evident from the example of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Abah; Matth.</hi> 27. 4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 27. There may be true Evangelical Repentance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Confession of the mouth made to a Priest, and without <hi>Pennance.</hi> If the mouth and heart confess to God only, it is sufficient, unless their be a publick scandal, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against the Church of God. As for <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,</hi> it can be no part of Repentance, for it is not a thing done by the Sinner, but (as I said) conferred by the Priest.</p>

                  <p>Yes.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because; Christ did satisfy the justice of God to the full: and it is his blood only,

that purgeth us from all sin; <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 4, 5, 6, 8. 11. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7.

                     <hi>ARE those, who are offended, bound to be reconcilled to the offending party<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> he declaring his Repentance, and ought they in love to receive him?</hi>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Christ says, if they Brother trespasse against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him, and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day, turn again to thee, saying I repent thou shalt forgive him; <hi>Luke:</hi> 17. 3. 4. (2) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, for a <hi>Heathen,</hi> and <hi>Publican</hi> (that is one casten out from the communion of the Church) he only is to be esteemed, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecteth to hear the Church; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. (3) Because, such as have offended the Church, after submission, to the churches censure, ought to be comforted; the Church ought to make their love known to them; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them again into communion, least happly their grief, and sorrow increasing, they be swallowed up; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 8. (4) Because, if a man be overtaken in a fault, they who are Spiritual, ought to restore such an one, in the Spirit of meekness; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves, least they also be tempted;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61596:72"/>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. (5) Because, if men, repenting of their faults committed against their Brethren, and fellow Christians, be not received into the communion of the Church, both they and the Church are in hazard, lest Satan by his devices, gain an advantage of them; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. 11. (6) Because, <hi>Miriam,</hi> who for her sedition, against <hi>Moses,</hi> was shut out from the <hi>Camp</hi> seven days, was brought in again; <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 15. So was the incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person, received into the communion of the Church; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8.</p>

And that those also are good Works, which are done out of a good intention, to advance GODS Glory, or to perform Worship to Him, though they be not commanded by GOD?</hi>

                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, <hi>Good works</hi> are described by the <hi>Apostle</hi> to be such, as GOD before hath ordained, that we should walk in them; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. (2) Because, GOD expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that every man must not do that, which seems good in his own eyes, but onely such works, as he hath commanded, and must neither add thereto, nor diminish from it; <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 8, 32. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18. (3) Because, the Lord openly testifies
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61596:73"/>
that in vain they do worship Him, teaching for Doctrines, the commandments of men, not requiring that Will-worship, which Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick men would give him; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. (4) Because, the Scribes and Pharisees are severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuked by Christ, that made the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of GOD of no effect, by their Traditions; <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 6. And it is often mentioned in the Books of the <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> as a fault in the Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> that the High-places were not taken away. And how severely were the <hi>Israelites</hi> punished, for their worshipping of the <hi>Golden-Calf? Exod.</hi> 32. And for worshipping the <hi>Calves,</hi> which <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> set up at <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> all know; 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12. 28. (5) Because, the Law of God, is the perfect Rule and Square of good works; To the Law, and to the Testimony: if they speak not according to this Word, it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no light in them; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 8. 20.

                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:61596:74"/>Well then, do not the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and <hi>Libertines</hi> err, who deny, <hi>That Believers, ought to make evident to themselves, and others, the truth of their Iustification, by good works, as fruits of a true, and lively Faith?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Christ sayes, by their fruits, ye shall know them: for a good tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good fruit; <hi>Matth:</hi> 7. 16, 17, 18. (2) Because, we are commanded, to make sure our Calling and Election by good Works, as by the fruits of Faith; 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1: 5, 6, 10, 11. (3) Because, in Scripture there are delivered many undoubted, and sure marks of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, taken from the fruits of Faith, and good Works; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1: 6, 7: and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2: 3: and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3: 9, 10, 14.</p>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Holy Ghost forbiddeth us, to be slow in performing such duties: nay, commands us to stir up the gift, which is in us, and use all diligence to perform duties commanded by himself; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Iude verse</hi> 20. (2) Because, the Prophet confesseth that, as the great sin, of the Lords people, that there is none that calleth upon his name, that stirreth up himself, to take hold of him; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 64. 7. (3) Because, to neglect the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of GOD, is an evident sign, and token of an Atheist; <hi>Ps:</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Ps.</hi> 53. 4. (4) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the Lord hath threatned to pour out his fury upon the Heathen, that know him not, and upon the Families that call not on his Name; <hi>Ierem.</hi> 10. 25. (5) Because, the twelve Tribes, which hoped to come to the promise made to the Fathers, instantly served GOD day and night; <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 6, 7. And
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61596:75"/>
the Apostles gave themselves continually to Prayer, and to the Ministry of the Word; <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 4. (6) Because, Christ himself who had always the Spirit, was very frequent, in all those Exercises and Duties, as all the Histories, of the four Evangelists do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie. Those <hi>Fanatick Recusants,</hi> either have the Spirit of God in them; or they want it. This last they will not grant. If then they have it, why do they refuse to perform duties of Religion, more then our blessed Saviour did, when opportunitie, and occasion, did call him. They have the Spirit but want the Impulse. But contrarywise, this impulse; is never wanting when there is a call. But the Spirits call is never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when opportunity is offered. (7) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, Christ will have the Gospel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every creature; <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. And hath commanded the administration of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> even to his <hi>second</hi> coming; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. And will have the work of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry to continue in his Church, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61596:76"/>
(9) Because, we are commanded, to trust in him at all times; <hi>Psalm</hi> 62. 8. (10) if we shall forbear outward duties, as prayer, and such like, then ought we to forbear inward exercises, as Acts of Faith, Love, and Fear, till we be moved thereunto, which is most absurd, for we are commanded (as was cited) to trust in him alwayes. (11) What assurance can men have, the next hour, or to morrow, more than in the present time, of the Spirits motion on their souls: or that they shall be thus, at a greater advantage, by putting off the duty, till they have some inward motion, and impulse thereunto, than by waiting on the ordinary call of the Word, or of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, no man living, is able to fulfil the Law of God; <hi>Psalm</hi> 143. 2. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 64. 6. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 8.

Works, can deserve any favour from God, or oblige him, to give any thing as due. And according to the order of Gods justice, he can receive no favor from us; nor can any creature, confer any benefit on him; <hi>Ps.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 2, 3. Truely, where there is no favour done, there can be no Merit: for merit presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth a benefit accepted. (4) Because, our works are imperfect, as well, as to <hi>Parts,</hi> as to <hi>Degrees; Gal.</hi> 5. 17; <hi>Is.</hi> 64. 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. A <hi>Perfection of parts</hi> is, when we have a <hi>Part</hi> of every Grace, and are renewed in some measure in every power, and faculty of the whole man, though we be not come to the just and due measure in any of them. A <hi>perfection of Degrees,</hi> consists in the compleat measure of our conformity, and our exact correspondence to the Law of God, in respect of all whatsoever it requires. (5) Because, Christ says, so likewise ye, when ye shal have done all those things which are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, say we are unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do; <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10. (6) Because, the Good Works, which we do, are not ours, but it is God that worketh in us, both to will, and to do; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. (7) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, that heavenly blessedness, to be given to the saints, is expresly attributed to the mercy
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61596:78"/>
and pity of God; <hi>Plalm</hi> 103. 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. (8) Because, when the Apostle proclaims death to be the wages of sin, he doth not affirm life eternal to be the reward of Good Works, but the free, and gracious gift of God, which we obtain by Christ, even in our sanctification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle here; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Which free Gift hath for its end, eternal life. Not that it merits this (for then it should not be a gracious gift) but because Christ, hath merited this for us, and shal of free Grace give it to us, as the following words, <hi>through Iesus Christ our Lord</hi> shew. (9) Because, God will have us to buy without money or price, <hi>Wine, Milk, Honey:</hi> that is, to receive all things requisite, and necessary for our spiritual life, for <hi>Nothing;</hi> and eternal life it self; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. 1, 2, 3. (10) Because, Christ should not be a perfect Saviour, if any thing from us were to be added, to the righteousness of his Merit. But Christ is a perfect Saviour; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. (11) Because, our best works, have such a mixture of corruption, and sin in them, that they deserve his curse, and wrath, so far are they from meriting; <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. But we are all, <hi>saith the Prophet,</hi> as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses, are like
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61596:78"/>
filthy raggs. (12) If the works of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men, did deserve eternal life, then should the whole contrivance of the Gospel be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and the same very way of Life layed down, which was in the Covenant of works, as is clear from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. The Gospel is so contrived, by the infinite Wisdom, and Goodness of God, that there is a judicial transferring of our sin, as a debt on Christ, the Cautioner, and a translation of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and merit, to be imputed to us, for our justification, without the least respect to our works.</p>

                  <p>(1) Because; the <hi>Apostle Peter</hi> argues the contrary way, and infers a far other conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; namely, because Believers know, they

                     <hi>ARE true Believers, when they fall into some special sin which woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Conscience, and grieveth the Spirit, desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the seed of GOD, and life of Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No. 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3: 9: <hi>Luke</hi> 22: 32:</p>
                  <p>Well then, <hi>do not the</hi> Quakers <hi>and others err, who maintain, That true Believers falling into some special sin, can have nothing of the life of faith, and seed of GOD in them?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 9. <hi>For his seed remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him;</hi> that is, doth not totally perish, but abideth thenceforeward; work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruits of regeneration, once begun in them; <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6.

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) From those places of Scripture, where
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61596:86"/>
the righteousness of the Law is described; <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 11. 13. Whosoever, therefore keepeth my Statutes and Judgements, saith the Lord, shall live in them. And to whom life is promised for ever, upon their perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and continuance in all things, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of the Law. And from those places, in which death is threatned to them, that in the least transgress the Law of God; <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 4. (2) From the words of our Saviour, who spoke to the <hi>Young man,</hi> according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, in which the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth life eternal, to such as shall fulfil the Law; <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 28. Observe, that Christ answereth here, according to the question, and opinion of this <hi>young man,</hi> who thought he was able to obtain salvation, by his own good works: and therefore Christ directs him to the Law, thereby to bring him to the acknowledgement, of his own imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and afterwards to Faith, in himself. (3) Because, man was created by God, in righteousness, holiness, and immortality, according to the similitude, and image of God; <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 9, 10. And received from him, the Law of Nature, naturally ingraven
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61596:86"/>
upon his heart; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. 15. And besides this Law, a positive Law was superadded to it, that <hi>Adam</hi> should not eat of the <hi>Tree,</hi> of the <hi>Knowledge of Good,</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> that by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, he might give a <hi>Specimen,</hi> or proof of his obedience to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the perfect obedience whereof, so long as he should continue, he should live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For the Lord threatned death to him only, if he should sin: and death is the wages of sin, which by sin entered into the world; <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. 13. (4) From those places of Scripture, in which it is denyed, that believers, under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, are justified by the Law; but by Faith, and the righteousness of Christ, manifested in the Gospel. For that the Law is weak, powerless, or impotent, through the corruption of our Nature, to justifie us, and give us life; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 21, 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2, 3.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the two first Precepts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand diverse things. The one teacheth us, who is to be worshipped, to wit, the true and living God, and no other. The second instructs us, how he is to be worshipped, namely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own appointment, and not according to the appointment, and pleasure of men, as by Images and such like.

                  <p>Well then, <hi>do not the</hi> Judaisers <hi>err,</hi> who maintain, <hi>that all the Ceremonial Laws remain in their former strength, and vigour, and are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Believers under the Gospel, and not abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or disanulled by Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Christ hath abolished the Law of Commandments, contained in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that he might gather together, both <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> into one new man; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. Note, that the Apostle here speaks of all Believers, both of <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as of one man: because, they being all under Christ the Head, as members of one spiritual Body, are made up, as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed man. (2) Because, the Apostle sayes, let no man judge you, in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new Moon, or of the sabbath dayes: all which are shaddows of things to come, but the body is of Christ; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. This ver. is a conclusion of the Apostles foregoing discourse, against Ceremonies, and things
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61596:88"/>
commanded by the Ceremonial Law, which by the coming of Christ are abolished. He calls them in the 17 verse, a shaddow of things to come, but the body (says he) is of Christ. That is, the thing signified is of Christ: for all the shaddows of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> had respect to Christ, and his benefites, by whose coming they also have an end; <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. (3) Because, the Apostle says, Believers are dead with Christ, from the <hi>Rudiments of the World:</hi> that is, from the Ceremonial Commands; as is evident from the Context. Why says he, as though liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World, are ye subject to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? That is, as if your life, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, consisted in these outward worldly principles: but suffer your selves to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, by such Teachers, with humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, and ordinances. The Apostle indeed; in these last words, is reasoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the institutions, and ordinances of men, from this <hi>Medium,</hi> which is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the greater, to the lesser: if ye be dead with Christ from the Ceremonies of the Law instituted in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> by God himself, much more are ye free, from the institutions, and ordinances of men, which are only grounded upon their own good pleasure; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20, 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10, 11.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61596:88"/>
(4) Because, the Apostle affirms, that the Observation, and useing of Circumcision, cannot consist, with true Faith in Christ, now after the Gospel is fully published. And he exhorts the <hi>Galatians</hi> to abide in their liberty purchased by Christ, and not to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves, to the yoke of Mosaical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1, 2. (5) Because, those Teachers, who pressed the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be circumcised, and to observe the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> (I mean the Ceremonial Law,) were condemned by the Council of Apostles; <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24. (6) Because, Ceremonial Commands, are neither of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor are they injoyned to Believers under the Gospel as things Moral. (7) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, these appointed Ceremonies, were figures only of things to come, imposed on the <hi>Iewes,</hi> until the time of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but taken away by Christ; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9, 10, 11, 12. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. Where it is said, he taketh away the first, namely all sorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Offerings which were used in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> to settle the second, namely his obedience to the will of his Father. (8) Because, they were given to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to foresignifie, and represent Christ, and his death, and to be marks of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and the unbelieving Nations;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61596:89"/>

                  <p>(1) Because, by the Law is the knowledge of sin; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. (2) Because, for as many, as are of the works of the Law, are under the curse; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.

Christ is become of no effect, to them, that are justified by the Law: they are fallen from Grace; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4, (7) Because, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ought to wait, through the Spirit, for the hope of righteousness by Faith; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5.

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, are for this end delivered to the Ministers of the Church, that with Censures, they may pursue Scandalous, and offending Persons, who will not obey admonition; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 17, 18. But such also are Hereticks; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 10. 12. (2) Because an Heretick after the first and second admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to be rejected, avoided, or shuned. That is, let him not remain in the external Communion, of the Church; <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10. (3) Because, <hi>Paul</hi> did excommunicat <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had made ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of the Faith; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19, 20.

And Christ in that same chapter, accuses the Pastors of the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> and threatneth them, because they had suffered Hereticks to be in the Church.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> Lutherians, Anabaptists, Arminians, <hi>and other</hi> Sectaries <hi>are confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, it is evident, from many examples of Godly Magistrats, who did extirpat Idolatry, and inflict punishment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Idolaters, as did <hi>Iacob</hi> the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> who at least purged his family of strange Gods; <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Moses</hi> likewise took pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment with the sword, upon those, who did worship the <hi>Golden-Calf; Exod.</hi> 32. 26, 27, 28. We have (2) the examples of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sekia;</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. Of <hi>Iosia;</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. Of <hi>Asa,</hi> who decreed that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of <hi>Israel</hi> (according to the law of God; <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 9.) should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man, or woman; 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 13. Of <hi>Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat;</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 6. Of <hi>Nehemia</hi> 13. 15, 17. (3) Were not good kings reproved, and was it not imputed to them, as a fault, that they did not take away the High-places? 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 3. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 4. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 4. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 17. Far more is it a fault to suffer Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. (4) It is evident from the office of the Magistrat, who is the Minister of God against them, that do evil, and beareth not the sword in vain: <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4. (5) Because, it is expresly commanded in Scripture, that punishment be inflicted upon Idolaters, even
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61596:97"/>
by the nearest Relations. If then, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may kill the Son, may kill the Daughter, the Husband the Wife of his bosom: and if one brother may stone another brother with stones, that he die, for being Idolaters; much more may the Civil Magistrat do this; <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6. to the 13 verse; <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 2. to the 7 verse; <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 16. (6) Because, it is foretold, that under the New <hi>Testament,</hi> Kings shall be nursing Fathers to the Church, and Queens nursing Mothers, and that Hereticks, that were about to be hurtful, to the Church, shall be removed, and taken away; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 49. 23. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 2, 3. And it shall come to pass, in that day saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the Idols, out of the land (that is, all Idolatry whatsoever, so that the same shall not be so much as named, any more among you) and they shall no more be remembred. And I will also cause the Prophets, (the false Prophets) and the unclean Spirit, to pass out of the Land: that is, the false Teachers who teach impure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, through the inspiration of the unclean Spirit the Devil. Compare with this 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. For confirmation, consider what is foretold by <hi>Iohn; Rev.</hi> 17. 12, 16, 17. That the Kings of the Earth, shall eat the flesh of the Whore, and burn her with fire. All
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61596:97"/>
which are foretold, as blessings to be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Church. (7) It is evident from the Epithets, whereby the pernicious, and destructive nature of Hereticks, is set forth in Scripture. They are called Wolfes, not sparing the flock, Thieves, Robers, Troublers of the Church, and Seducers, or Beguilers of poor souls. They are like unto a Gangren, or Canker in the body. They are as leaven, or soure dough, which leaveneth the whole lump; <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 9. (8) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, <hi>Ezra</hi> did esteem it, a great favour and blessing of God, conferred upon the Church; for which he thanked God, that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the heart of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to publish a Decree, for the punishment of those, that did not observe the Law, whether it be, (saith the Text) unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to impris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onment; <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 23, 25, 28. (9) Because, we ought to pray for Kings, and all in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that under them, we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all Godliness, and in Honesty, which end cannot be attained, unless the Civil Magistrat bridle and ty up Hereticks; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. These words, <hi>in all Godliness,</hi> concerns Religion. or the first Table of the Moral Law, as the following
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61596:98"/>
word <hi>honesty,</hi> or <hi>civility,</hi> hath a respect to the commands of the second Table, and the duties which we owe to our neighbour, and to one another. For true Magistrates, are keepers and defenders of both Tables of the ten Commandments. (10) Because, the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereticks, as we may read of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germany, Thomas Muntzer, Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leidden,</hi> and their followers, first by rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling against the Ministry, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, and raging against Magistracy, brought both Church and State into confusion, put the country into burning flames, wherein them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at length were consumed to Ashes.</p>

                  <p>Do not secondly, <hi>the</hi> Vaninians, <hi>and many of the</hi> Cartesians <hi>err, who under the pretext of maintaining a God-head, have in effect taught men to deny, there is a God?</hi>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood, by the things which are made, even his eternal power, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: so that they are without excuse; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. (2) Because, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy work. That is, they give us matter and occasion to speak and discourse of his Omnipotency, Wisdom, and Goodness; <hi>Psalm</hi> 19: 1, 2, 3. (3) Because, the knowledge of the Law of Nature, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally implanted in the minds of all men; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. Therefore, some knowledge of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61596:99"/>
the law-giver, must be implanted in the minds of all men. (4) Because, in the most wick ed, and ungodly there are terrors and tortures of conscience, wherewith, nil they, will they, they are haunted and possessed: whence it is evident, that in the minds of all men, there is some lively knowledge of God. (5) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, men had rather worship a stock, or a stone, than they should think, there were no God; <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23. (6) What a brave order, and comliness, shines forth, with so much wisdom, and power, in the government and preservation of things above and below; that no man can be in doubt, but there must be a God, who rules and preserves all those things. (7) Because, nothing can be the cause of it self: because then, it should be both the Cause, and the Effect, both before and after it self: therefore all things have their beginning, from one first and supream Cause, which is God. (8) Because, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of a God-head, may be evinced from the foretelling of things to come; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 41. 23. And as <hi>Cicero</hi> says, <hi>si est divinatio, sunt Dii,</hi> if there be a foretelling, there must be also a God that foretelleth. (9) From the assaults, and suggestions of Satan, we find there is a devil, may we not then certainly conclude that there is a God? The Devil
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61596:99"/>
labours by all means to extinguish the light of the Gospel, to lead men on in ignorance, error, and prophanness, and to turn them out of the path of holiness. Now, why should Satan thus warr against God, his word, and his Saints? Why should he seek Gods dishonour, and mans destruction, if there were not a God, a Law, and an everlasting life? (10) Because, the mind of man is not satisfied with the knowledge of all things; nor the will of man, with the enjoyment of all things in this world, but still they seek and thirst earnestly, after some higher good. There is therefore, a soveraign<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Truth, and Chief Good, which being perfectly known, and enjoyed, will give contentment, and satisfaction, to the Soul. In vain should the Powers, and Faculties of the Soul, be capable of happiness, or of the Chief Good; if there were not a Chief Good to be possessed, and enjoyed. (11) From the wonders, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which have been wrought, visible, and apparent works, extraordinarly wrought, not only above the ordinary course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but simply above the power of Nature. These effects do convince, that there is an infinite power, which is above, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleth all things. For every principal, and primary cause, is more excellent, than the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61596:100"/>
effects thereof. (12) From the beeing of man, the curious workmanship of his body in the womb, which is wrought most artificially; namely with sinews, veins, arteries, muscels<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and other parts of the body, even as an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiderer sitteth, and joyneth many parcels<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> stuff, and dyed work of various colours, very artificially, and curiously together, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till there cometh forth some goodly Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture, or other dainty workmanship; <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 15. <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 10.

These, and all the works, which our eye doth see, or the mind doth apprehend do prove, that there is a God, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Beeing to them, and continueth them therein. (13) Because, seeing God is the the first cause, there cannot be any thing <hi>Prior</hi> to him, by which, as a cause, his exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can be Demonstrated.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Lord our God, and he only is to be worshipped; <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Deut</hi> 6. 13. (2) Because, the Object of invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and religious Adoration, is he only who is Omnipotent, Omniscient, and searcher of the heart. For there is none that knows our necessities and wants, but he that is Omnis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: and none can succour and help us, but he that is Omnipotent. But Angels are not Omniscient; <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 12. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61596:102"/>
are the Saints departed Omniscient, as is clear from <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 16. <hi>Abraham</hi> is ignorant of us. (3) Because, they that are dead, know nothing of our condition; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 5. (4) Because, no man ought to call upon him, in whom he doth not believe; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. But no man ought to believe in Saints, or Angels, but in God alone; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 26. 4. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 5. (5) Because, neither Saints alive, nor Angels would suffer adoration, and worship to be given to themselves; <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 8, 9. (6) Because, the worshipping of Angels doth derogate from the honour of Christ, in whom we have boldness, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess with confidence by the faith of him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 12. (7) Because, the worshipping of Saints and Angels, is like a <hi>Polytheismus,</hi> the having of many Gods.

(2) Because, no man cometh to the Father, but by Christ; <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 6. And by him, we have access to the Father; <hi>Eph:</hi> 2. 18.

Would ever the Lord have bestowed such qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if he had not appointed some for such an Office? Though gifts as gifts do not alone invest into such an office, yet when they are strictly required, they argue, that there is an

And the Apostle in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the difficulty of this employment, cryeth out, <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.

(5) Because, Christ requires peculiar distinct duties in the people, in reference to their Ministers; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the office of the Ministry must be of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

To pray for them; 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 1. (6) Because, GOD hath made peculiar promises to his Ministers; as, <hi>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world; Matth.</hi> 28. 20. The promise of special assistance; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. 6. Of protection and defence in all aslaults; <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the power of the keyes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was not limited to the Apostles, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, but was given to the Apostles, as Ministers of the Gospel, as is evident from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17, 18. The promise of special sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with them; <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 40. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 20. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 8. Now, would ever the Lord have promised to keep up, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that office in his Church which he had not set up and instituted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other thing to be made out, is that the office of the Ministry, is perpetually necessary?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the ordinances are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually necessary, by divine institution: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the office of the Ministry, to dispense these ordinances, is perpetually necessary, by divine institution. For if God had only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61596:107"/>
the ordinances, to continue in his Church, then would preaching, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments fail: because, that which is every mans work, is usually and effectually no mans work. The Lord doth not immediatly administer them himself: neither are Angels employed for this work. But he hath committed this service to men, who are Stewards, and dispensers of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of God. It is evident that the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, shall continue to the end of the world, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 11, 12, 13. It is evident of Baptism, and the Lords Supper, which are conjoyned in the institution of Christ, with the Ministery of the Word. For to whom, he gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to preach, to them also he gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to administer the Sacraments. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is an ordinance of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God himself. For <hi>Iohn</hi> was sent to baptize. God was the Author, <hi>Iohn</hi> was only the Minister. This was to continue perpetually, as is evident from Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and his precept; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28, 20. The ends for which Baptism was ordained, are not temporary, but moral, and so perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Do not all Christians, now need these means as the Christians during the age of the Apostles? Are not Christians to be baptized into his death, buried with him by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61596:108"/>
Baptism, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. It is called by the holy Ghost, a saving Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and is unto believers, and their seed in the New Testament, as the <hi>Ark</hi> was to <hi>Noah,</hi> and his family in the <hi>old World,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Ark,</hi> was saved from perishing in the waters, when the rest were drowned: so Baptism doth now save us, not only or mainly, the outward part of it, the putting away the filth of the flesh, (which is yet an Ordinance to further our salvation) but when the Spirit of Regeneration effectually concurs, so that we find there is a renewing of the holy Ghost, and thereby the <hi>answer of a good conscience towards God;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. It is evident, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is to continue to the end of the world. It was not only appointed for Apostles, to whom it was first administred, but unto all believers, both <hi>Iews,</hi> and Gentiles. And not only for that age, but for all generations succeeding, for Believers, are commanded, to shew forth the Lords death till he come, by eating this bread, and drinking this cup. Therefore, if these ordinances, be appointed by God, to continue to the end, it follows evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that he hath designed the office of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61596:108"/>
the Ministry to hold up, and hold forth his Ordinances to the end of the world. (2) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the promises, which Christ hath made to uphold the Ministry, are perpetual; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the office must be perpetual; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. Go teach, and baptize all Nations, and <hi>lo I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> This promise cannot be limited to the particular age, during the lives of the Apostles; because the Holy Ghost, useth three expressions, to declare the perpetuity of this promise, <hi>Aion,</hi> that this promise, shall continue so long as the world continues. Secondly, <hi>Synteleia; Heos tes synteleias tu Aionos,</hi> that this promise shall have no end, till the world be consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat, or brought to a Period. Thirdly, <hi>Pasas tas Hemeras,</hi> all days, and successions of times. Not only <hi>Meth hymon hemeras hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> not only with you, during your own dayes, but all the dayes of the Gospel, till time shall be no more, And this promise was made not to the Apostles, as Apostles, nor to the Apostles as Believers, but to the Apostles, as ministers and Stewards, of the Mysteries of God. (3) Because, the Elect require, the office of the Ministry perpetually. Our Natures are as bad, as <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans; Eph.</hi> 2: 3. Our judgements full of darkness, and ignorance; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Our wills
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61596:109"/>
stuborn and rebellious, and so alienated, that we rebel against the light. The delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Satan are strong. The multitude of false Teachers are very numerous, so that they are ready to seduce the Elect themselves, if it were possible. (4) Because, the ends for which Christ, hath appointed a ministry are perpetually necessary. The Elect must be called and gathered, for there will be some still in every age, to be added to the Church, of them that shall be saved. There are many sheep, which are not yet brought into his fold: many who belong to the Election, who are not yet effectually called, them also will Christ bring in, both <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that there may be one fold, as there is one shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers. Now, God hath revealed no other ordinary way to convert, and bring these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fold, but the Ministry of his word; for how shall they believe without a Preacher? Therefore, if there be some Elect, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be brought into fellowship with Christ, and this end not fully attained, till the end of the World, then the Ministry assigned to this end, must be perpetually necessary.</p>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) From the practise of Christ, and his Apostles; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 30. From the example of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas; Acts</hi> 16. 25. From <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Israelites; Exod.</hi> 15. (2) Because, the singing of <hi>Psalms</hi> was commanded under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and that, not as a Type of any substance to come, nor for any cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial cause. Neither is it abrogated under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> but confirmed; <hi>Psalm</hi> 30. 4. <hi>Psalm</hi> 149. 1. (3) From the general and universal commands in the <hi>New Testament; Eph.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. (4) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> says, is any man afflicted, let him pray, is any man merry, let him sing <hi>Psalms; Chap.</hi> 5. 13. The meaning is not, that none should sing, but such as are merry: for then none should pray but such as are afflicted. (5) Because, by singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> we glorifie God, we make his praise glorious. We edify others with whom we sing, as well, as we edify our selves. So the end to be proposed in singing, is teaching and admonishing one another, in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61596:110"/>
                     <hi>Psalms,</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> and spiritual songs; <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. Lastly, we chear and refresh our selves, by making melody in our hearts to the Lord; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. Which ariseth first from our consciencious going about it, as a piece of worship to God, and in so doing we are accepted in that. Secondly from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of Scripture, appointed for his praise, whether it agree with our case or not. That being the end wherefore it was designed to be sung, is a sufficient warrand for our joyning in the singing thereof.</p>

                     <hi>HAth GOD in his Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual Commandment, binding all men in all ages, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly appointed, one day in seven, for a Sabbath to be kept holy unto himself?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8, 10, 11. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 56. 2, 4, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Well then, <hi>do not some men err,</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61596:111"/>
                     <hi>that God hath not under the Gospel determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any certain day, for his own worship, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath commanded, that some</hi> indefinite time, <hi>be destined for publick worship, which time (say they) is left to be determined, by the Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the determining of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and sufficient time, for divine worship, and as a Sabbath, belongs to God only, and not to man. For we do not read, that any such power or authority, is granted to man, either by the Law of Nature, or Scripture. Is it not a thing of very great moment? Is it likely, that the wisdom of God, would leave it uncertain? This might accuse the Scripture of imperfection. It is not sutable to the love of God, and his care towards his Church. By such mens doctrine, the Church Universal, and all Oecumenick Councils, should be guilty of a dreadful sin, which for so many ages, have been deficient in their duty. Therefore, it behoveth that there be one day of seven by virtue of the fourth Command, seeing no where els another ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary day, is appointed, or prescribed in the Word. (2) Because, it is just and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table (as the adversaries grant) that one day should be set apart for GOD, who hath
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61596:111"/>
freely given us six. (3) Because, in six dayes, God made the Heavens, and the Earth, and rested on the seventh: not out of necessity, but to give us an example, to do the like. (4) Because, one day of ten, twenty, or thirty, cannot be thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. Neither is such a thing commanded, in any place of Scripture. And would it not argue a neglect of divine worship, &amp; the care of souls, if one day of twenty, thirty, or fourty were appointed? Neither, can the fifth, fourth, or sixth day be appointed, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath commanded us to work six dayes. This would make our yoke more heavy than the <hi>Iewish</hi> yoke, which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries will not grant. (5) Because, it is the principal, and chief scope of the fourth Command, that one day of seven, in respect of us, be set apart, and consecrated to divine worship. Not truely that some <hi>indefinite time,</hi> be set apart. If this were true, the fourth Command, should differ substantially, from the other Precepts of the Decalogue; and so there behoved to be an useless Precept, or at least a Tautology ought to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Do not likewise the</hi> Anabaptists, Socinians, <hi>and</hi> Libertins <hi>err, with whom we may take in the</hi> Quakers, (<hi>and other</hi> Antisabbatarians, that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61596:112"/>
disown <hi>the Sabbath, as being carnal, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Letter) who teach, that whatever is contained in the fourth Command, is Ceremonial, and so properly, as to the matter, and substance, which it holds out, abrogated wholly. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (say they) by virtue of this fourth Command there is no day to be set a part, for publick divine worship?</hi> Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the fourth Command, which appoints one day of seven to be set apart for God, is a positive, and moral Command, as to substance; seeing it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity, before ever there was need of any Types, and Ceremonies shaddowing forth Christ; <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. (2) Because, it was repeated, before the promulgation of the Ceremonial Law; <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. Thirdly, because it was written, with Gods own hand, and inserted into the midst of the rest of the moral precepts, and was put into the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Testimony,</hi> with the other nine, which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, was never conferred upon any precept meerly Ceremonial. (4) Because, all the reasons of this Command, are intirely Moral. He rested after six days, and allowed us six days to work, therefore in all equity we ought to rest after so many days work, and give God a seventh. (5) Because, Christ
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61596:112"/>
confirms this Command, in saying, pray that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day, where the Lord insinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that as travelling is troublesome to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in winter, so would it be to the minds of the Godly to travel on that day, specially and solemnly set apart for Gods worship. Now, if there were no sabbath to continue after Christs ascension, or if it were not to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, there would be no occasion of this grief and trouble, that they behoved to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel on the Sabbath, and durst not tary till that day were by-past; and so no cause to put up this prayer which yet by our Lords exhortation seemeth to infer that the Sabbath was to be as certain in its time, as the Winter. And doubtless this cannot be meaned of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sabbath; for that was to be abolished shortly. Next, travelling on the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sabbath was to be no cause of grief unto them, if indeed all days were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, neither would it be scroupled in such a case by the Apostles to whom he is now speaking.</p>

                  <p>(1) Because, the fourth Command standing, wherein one day of seven is appointed, the numbering is left free to God himself, that the right, and power may be reserved to Christ the Law-giver, and to his Spirit, for the change of the day, and continuing the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, prescribed in the fourth Command. (2) From the name it self; for our Sabbath is called the <hi>Lords Day, Rev.</hi> 1. 10. I was in the Spirit on the <hi>Lords Day:</hi> or on <hi>that Lords</hi>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:61596:113"/>
                     <hi>Day,</hi> or <hi>Dominick Day,</hi> or day which is the Lords; pointing out a day singularly, and a day, which in a particular, &amp; special manner is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>His</hi> day; even as the Lords prayer and the Lords Supper are so called, because appointed by Christ the Lord. (3) Because, God only can abrogate the Lords day (the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries granting so much) therefore, he that hath power to rescind hath power likewise to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish. (4) Because, there is an implicit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, concerning the observation of the Lords day; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. As I have (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) given order to the churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> even so do ye the first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him. From which place, we reason thus; that not the seventh, but the first day, is the chief solemn day for worship after Christs Resurrection, because, the Apostles did pitch particularly and eminently upon that day, and that in diverse Churches, as the fittest time, for expressing their Charity. He doth not think it indifferent, what day it be done on, nor that all dayes are alike, but pitcheth on the first day, not in one Church only, but in many. Next, this command, supposeth them to be already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with some special priviledges of the first day beyond others; and that there must be some peculiar thing in this day making
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61596:114"/>
it fit, yea more fit for such a purpose, rather than any other day. (5) Because, as the seventh day, was instituted, in remembrance of the works of Creation, so the first day, after the work of redemption was finished, succeeded as most convenient, for collating, and comparing both Mercies together. (6) Because, Christ on the first day of the week, appeared most frequently to his Disciples, and blessed it with his presence; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 19, 26. (7) Because, on that day, the holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles. And on the same day <hi>Peter</hi> baptized three thousand; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 41. (8) Because, the Church, in the time of the Apostles did observe the first day of the week, as holy; <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. But the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Apostles, approven in Scripture, is equivalent to a Divine Institution. (9) Because, Christ was seen of his Apostles fourty dayes after his Resurrection, and spoke to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, during which time he hath taught them all things needful to be known, and among the rest (it is probable) the change of the Sabbath, and the institution of the first day of the week, and that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after his resurrection: he hath either immediatly by himself institute that day, or
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61596:114"/>
hath inspired his Apostles to observe it, from that same very time. (10) Because, the Lord hath remarkably owned this Christian Sabbath, in being remarkably avenged, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the breakers, and profanners thereof, as it is clear from several Histories.</p>

                     <hi>IS this Sabbath then kept holy unto the Lord, when men after a due preparation, of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs before hand, do not only observe an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rest, all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts, about their worldly employments, and recreations, but are also taken up the whole time, in the publick and private exercises of his own worship, except what is spent in the duties of necessity and mercy?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Lord says in the fourth

                     <hi>IS an Oath warranted by the word of GOD, under the New Testament, as well, as under the Old, in matters of weight, and moment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 65. 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. 23. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 19. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 6.</p>

                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Do not likewise the</hi> Papists <hi>err,</hi> who make <hi>it a degree of perfection, to abstain from all Oaths?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) From <hi>Isaiah</hi> 65. 16. where it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, under the time of the Gospel, that the Nations to be converted to Christ, shall swear by the name of God, as is clear also from <hi>Ierem.</hi> 4. 2. (2) Because, the calling upon the name of God with due fear and reverence in swearing, is commanded in the third Command, as the profanation of his name is forbidden: but Christ came not to abolish the moral Law. (3) From the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61596:116"/>
examples of the Saints, which occurr in the New Testament; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 6. (4) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the end of an Oath, is approven by God, and is in all ages, necessary to all men, being the end of all controversie; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. (5) Because, an oath rightly taken, is an Act of Religion, whereby we glorifie God, and adore his attributes. We thereby, first, solemnly acknowledge his <hi>Beeing</hi> and <hi>Existence.</hi> Secondly, his <hi>Ubiquity</hi> that he is present in all places, and at all times, and within our hearing; <hi>Psalm</hi> 139. 7. His <hi>Omniscience,</hi> that he is the searcher of the heart. The Apostle calls him <hi>Kardiognostes;</hi> Acts 15. 8. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, fourthly, his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Veracity:</hi> he is a witness brought into the Court, that cannot lie, nor be impos'd upon, as saith the Apostle, <hi>be not deceived God is not mocked; Gal.</hi> 6. 7. Fifthly, his <hi>Supremacy</hi> over all creatures, for verily men swear by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. We acknowledge, sixthly, his <hi>vindictive justice,</hi> as he is a Revenger of Perjury. Seventhly, we acknowledge his <hi>Providence,</hi> and Fatherly care of the concerns of mankind, owning the cause of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
                  <p>(6) Because, there being an express law for swearing (to wit rightly; <hi>Deut.</hi> 10 20.)
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61596:117"/>
it must either belong to the Moral Law, to the Judicial Law, or Ceremonial Law. The Adversaries will not call it, a part of the Judicial Law, which was given to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as a Body Politick, which expired together with the state of that People. It is no part of the Ceremonial Law: for what was purely Ceremonial, was purely Typical: but the Law concerning an oath was not a Type of any thing to come. And if it was a Type, where will you find its Antitype in all the Gospel, or the thing represented by it? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it must be a part of the Moral Law; <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 2, and consequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, which Christ came not to destroy. It is confirmed hence, that it was of Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick use, and held sacred among the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, before the delivery of the Levitical Law, as it is clear from <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful, and <hi>Abimelech; Gen.</hi> 21. 23, 24, 31. Consider also that other instance in <hi>Abraham; Gen.</hi> 24. 2, 3, 9. who would not give his servant an oath rashly, nor exercise his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to impose on his conscience. It is evident also from the example of <hi>Isaac,</hi> who made a Covenant, and swore to <hi>Abimelech; Gen.</hi> 26. 28, 31, And from the example of <hi>Iacob,</hi> who made a Covenant with, and swore to his Uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> by the fear of his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61596:117"/>
Father <hi>Isaac; Gen.</hi> 31. 53. That is, by God, who is called <hi>our fear,</hi> by reason of the filial awe, and fear we ought to stand in before him; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 8. 13. (7) Because, the reasons and usefulness of Oaths, are perpetual, and the same to us under the Gospel, as they were to them under the Law. There is as much need of oaths for ending of strife in this litigious age, as there could be in former times. (8) Because, oaths were once lawful, therefore they are lawful still; unless the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries prove them repealled; which they must do, not by stealing out of the Scripture single words by themselves, making one part contradict another. (9) Because, we need not fear to imitate any thing, which is done in Heaven. Our Lord has taught us to pray, <hi>thy will be done in Earth, as it is done in Heaven.</hi> But the Angel (says <hi>Iohn; Rev.</hi> 10. 5, 6.) which I saw stand upon the Sea, and upon the Earth, lifted up his hand to Heaven, <hi>and swore by him that liveth for ever and ever.</hi> That Angel, calls himself our fellow-servant, and of our brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this Book; <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 9. And therefore the Angels being of the same fraternity with us, do not act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different dispensations from us.</p>

                  <p>Yes. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 2.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Scripture requires from all men in their common dealing one with another, in their discourse, and conferences, Verity, and Simplicity; <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 37. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 25. Much more are these things required in Swearing, wherein God is called to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the truth of those things, which are asserted. (2) Because, the Lord threatneth such as use guile, and deceit in their words; <hi>Psalm</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Psalm</hi> 24. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. (3) Because, the Lord requires in every Oath, <hi>truth, righteousness, and judgement; Ier.</hi> 4. 2.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61596:118"/>
an approven Oath; which is to put an end to all debate, and controversie. (5) Because, if Equivocations, and Mental Reservations were lawful, in vain should the Lord have made laws against lying: for a lie may be excused by Mental Reservation. (6) If E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations, and Mental Reservations were allowed, they would take away all commerce among men, and would make Bonds, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and Charter-parties of none effect.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, GOD hath expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that transgressing Idolaters be put to death; <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 21.

                     <hi>IS it the duty of the Civil Magistrate, to take order, that all Blasphemies, and Heresies be suppressed, all the ordinances of God,</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:61596:121"/>
                     <hi>duely settled, administred, and observed; all abuses in worship, and discipline reformed, all Idolaters, Gainsayers, and other obstinate dissenters, be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forced to quite their tenets and opinions, and conform themselves to the true worship, and service of God, according to his Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 49. 23. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 12, 13. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 34. 33. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 1, to the 26 verse. <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 23, 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 16.</p>
                  <p>Well then, <hi>do not the</hi> Quakers, <hi>and other</hi> Sectaries <hi>err,</hi> who judge <hi>it Antichristian, and the practise of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Supream Magistrate, with the assistance of the Church, and her Censures, should by his coactive power, force, and oblige all his subjects, to a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion, and to a conformity to the true worship, sound doctrine, and discipline, of the Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, it is foretold by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> that in the dayes of the Gospel, Kings shall be nursing Fathers, and Queens nursing Mothers, to the Church of God; <hi>Chap.</hi> 49. 23. (2) Because, <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who was but a Heathen King, was very careful to make a decree, that whatsoever was commanded by the God of Heaven, should be diligently
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61596:121"/>
done for the house of the God of Heaven. And that whosoever would not obey the Law of GOD, and the King, judgement was to be executed speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, whether by death, banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment. For which singular mercy, <hi>Ezra</hi> blessed the Lord GOD of his Fathers, who had put such a thing in the Kings heart; <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 23, 25, 26, 27, 28. So did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> make a decree, that if any People, Nation, or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, should speak any thing amiss against the GOD of Heaven, they should be cut in pieces, and their houses made a dunghill; <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 29. The like we read of <hi>Darius,</hi> who made a Decree, that all men should tremble and fear before the GOD of <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 6. 26. (3) From the example of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen Serpent, to which the <hi>Israelites</hi> did burn incense; 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. (4) From the example of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> who made a through reformation; and made all <hi>Israel</hi> to serve the LORD their GOD. The word in the Original importeth, that he in a manner forced, and compelled them to the pure worship, and service of God, as a servant is forced, and compelled to his work.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61596:122"/>
He by his Royal Power, and Authority kept them in order, forbidding Idolatry, and commanding them to serve God no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than according to his Word; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 33. and 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 12, 13. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a Covenant, to seek the Lord of their Fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soul: that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of <hi>Israel should be put to death,</hi> whether great or small, man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. (5) Because, whosoever blasphemed the name of the Lord, was surely put to death; <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 16. This blaspheming, was a peircing through, or stabbing the name of the Lord, as the original word properly signifies: which may be done not only after this manner, but by maintaining blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous errors, and heresies. (6) Because, the supream Magistrate is <hi>Custos utriusque Tabulae,</hi> a Keeper of both Tables of the Law of God. As well of the first Table, which relates to Religion, and our duty to God; as of the second which relates to righteousness, and our duty to our neighbour. If then, he may punish evil doers, who offend against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, and force and compel them to obedience, by the sword of justice, which God hath put into his hand, much more may he punish Idolaters, and blasphemers, who
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61596:122"/>
offend against the first Table, and force and compell them to obedience: seeing there are many<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> sins against the first Table, which are more hainous, and odious, than the sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the second Table. And though it be the sinful practise of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to force men, and women, to be of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is superstitious, and Idolatrous, yet it is not so to others, who have the true religion among them. And though our blessed Saviour, and his Apostles did not use such means for propagating the Gospel, reserving the Glory of conquering of souls, to himself, and the power of his Spirit; yet he has taught nothing to the contrary, but that Kings and Magistrates, whom he has made nursing Fathers to his Church, may according to the laudable examples of the good Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> improve their power for Reformation, and maintainance of his own Religion. And though Religion, hath been much advanced by suffering, yet it will not infer, that a Christian Prince has not power to reform his own subjects, or extirpate blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, and Hereticks.</p>

                  <p>(1) Because, there is no power but of God, and the powers, which are, are ordained of GOD; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, GOD appointed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded lawful war; <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 2. For it is said, the Spirit of the Lord came upon <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> when he was to fight the battles of the Lord, against the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and <hi>Amalekites; Iudges</hi> 6. 34.

All which are in no wise abrogated, and taken away, under the <hi>New Testament.</hi> (2) Because, the <hi>Centurion,</hi> that was converted to the Faith, did not lay down his office of a Captain of a hundred; which surely, he would have done, if to war under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> had been unlawful; <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 1, 2, 47.

                     <hi>MAY the Civil Magistrate, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to himself, the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Word, and Sacraments, or the power of the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Christ hath given no such power to Magistrates: as evidently appears, from all those places of Scripture, where mention is made of the keyes. There is not in them, one syllabe, of the Civil Magistrate; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Matth</hi> 16. 19.

as a Magistrate is not a Minister of the Church, as is evident, from all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues of the Ministers of the Church.

And Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed the Penitent from this Censure. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Synod, and stigmatized Hereticks; <hi>Acts</hi> 15.

                  <p>(1) Because, we are commanded to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our selves to every ordinance of man; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 13. Namely in all that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us, if it be not contrary to God and his command; otherwise, (according to <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19.) it is better to obey GOD than man. And it is said, for the <hi>Lords sake,</hi> that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is GODS will to govern us by them. (2) Because, the Christians, which were at <hi>Rome,</hi> were commanded by the Apostle to subject themselves to the higher powers, and that without exception of Religion and Piety, and even to that heathen the <hi>Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; Rom.</hi> 13. 1. (3) Because, the same Apostle writing to <hi>Titus,</hi> bids him exhort the Cretians his hearers, to obey Magistrates, what manner of ones soever they be, not only believing ones, but also those, that are unbelieving, as then, they were yet most of them; <hi>Titus.</hi> 3. 1. (4) Because, when the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was persued for his life, and charged with matters criminal, he appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto <hi>Cesar; Acts</hi> 25. 10, 11. (5) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> did own the power of <hi>Zedekia,</hi> who had turned aside to a false worship, and had despised the oath,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61596:126"/>
which he had made to the King of <hi>Babylon; Ezek</hi> 17. 16, 17. Now hear I pray thee, (says the Prophet) O my Lord the King, let my Supplication I pray thee be accepted before thee; <hi>Ierem.</hi> 27. 20. (6) Because, Christ himself payed tribute to <hi>Cesar,</hi> though he was free, being both the Son of GOD by nature, and the Son of <hi>David</hi> by birth; <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 26. And he commanded and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed others to pay; <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. (7) Because, <hi>Paul</hi> did own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the power of King <hi>Agrippa; Acts</hi> 26. 2.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, <hi>Samuel</hi> at the request of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom he knew the Lord had rejected, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again after him, and honoured him before the people; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 31. (2) Because, the Lord having appointed Magistrates to administer justice and judgement in his name, is so far pleased to honour them, as to call them Gods, and the Children of the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61596:126"/>
high; <hi>Psalm</hi> 82. 1, 6. (3) Because, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Peter</hi> says, fear God and honour the King, parallel to what <hi>Paul</hi> says, render to all men their dues; honour to whom honour is due; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7.</p>
                  <p>(4) Because, even heathen Magistrates, are called the Lords anointed; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 45. 1. And the Lord calls <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; <hi>Ierem.</hi> 27. 6.

(7) Because, the Prophet, the man of God, besought the Lord in behalf of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and prayed for him, a man that had made Apostacy from the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and had made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 3. (8) Because, our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our says, render to <hi>Cesar,</hi> the things that are <hi>Cesars; Matth.</hi> 22. 21. But prayers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications are as due to <hi>Cesar,</hi> as custom and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61596:127"/>
tribute; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. (9) Because, the Apostle commands us to pray for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life; which is the cause wherefore we must pray for Magistrates. For in the Apostles times, and long after, Magistrates were persecutors of the Church of GOD, and hindred the members of Christ to live in peace and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. (9) Because, <hi>Moses</hi> cryed unto the Lord in behalf of <hi>Pharoah; Exod.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed unto God for <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech; Gen.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>Iacob</hi> blessed <hi>Pharoah; Gen.</hi> 47. 7, 10.

                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:61596:127"/>(1) Because, all sort of murder is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden in the sixth command, <hi>thou shalt not kill; Exod.</hi> 20. 13. Where there is a clear distinction made by <hi>Thou,</hi> between a private man and a publick Magistrate, that doth it by divine authority. (2) Because, though <hi>Saul</hi> was a man rejected of God (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26.) yet <hi>David</hi> says to the <hi>Amalekite,</hi> how wast thou not affrayed to stretch forth thine hand, to destroy the Lords anointed; 2 <hi>Sa.</hi> 1. 14. see 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 9.

to the utter ruine of all Societies, if every man at his own hand might execute vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive justice upon offenders, who deserve it, or upon pretence they do deserve it, which is to fight against God, who is the God of order politick, as well, as Ecclesiastick, and not of confusion. (5) Because, the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God; <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. 20. (6) Because, it is a contempt of publick laws, and publick order. It is an usurpation of the Magistrates sword, which God hath put into his hand for punishing and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, It is an invasion of Gods right and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of executing vengeance, which he hath so expresly reserved to himself; <hi>Psalm</hi> 94. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 35. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 21, 22.

The sin of murder may be many wayes aggravated. First by the quality of the person murdered, whether he be a superiour, as a Magistrate, or Minister, or parent, or whether he be of

a near relation, as a brother, or near kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

                  </list>
                  <p>To which we answer, that it is not in the power of any creature to dispense (that is to say, to suffer that to be used, which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Law of God) with any of these Laws in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> which forbid <hi>incestuous mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</hi>

                  <p>(1) Because, such a power of dispensing, is not to be found in all the Scripture. (2) Because, the Lord sayes expresly, what thing soever I command you, observe to do it:

                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This absurd tenet is confuted from Rom.</hi> 7. 2, 3. <hi>and from</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39.</p>

                     <hi>that after divorce, second marriages are permitted to Christians?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But here by two distinctions they explain their mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>They distinguish between</hi> Cohabitation, <hi>the</hi> Bed, <hi>and the</hi> Ty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The first is, the dwelling together of man and woman, in one family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The second is, the right of giving, and requiring due benevolence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third is that, whereby both are made one: whereby the one cannot but be the others while they are both living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They distinguish next, between persons that are believers, and that are unbelievers. If then both parties, or one of them be unbelievers, they grant that the marriage is valide, both as to</hi> Cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>to the</hi> marriage bed; <hi>and to the</hi> Ty, <hi>or</hi> Bond.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if both parties be Christians, they think that the marriage may be dissolved, as to</hi> bedding together, <hi>and</hi> Cohabitation, <hi>yet the</hi> Bond <hi>standeth sure, and abideth unloosable: especially, if the marriage be contracted after Baptism: and therefore a second marriage after divorce is unlawful to any of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this is easily confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Christ permitted marriage
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61596:133"/>
after divorce; <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 31, 32. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 9. Here Christ forbidding a man to put away his wife, and to marry another, in express words, excepts the case of <hi>Fornication.</hi> Therefore he suffers a man to put away his wife in the case of <hi>Fornication,</hi> and to marry another. (2) Because, the Apostle says, but if the unbelieving depart, let him depart: for a brother, or sister, is not under bondage in such cases; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. Therefore, if a brother or sister, when there is such a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obstinate desertion, be not under bondage, then surely the <hi>Bond</hi> is dissolved: and all remedies being tryed in vain, for bringing back the obstinate party, I doubt not, but the innocent party may marry another without blame. If this be, then much more may the innocent party marry another, when a Divorce is obtained.</p>

                     <hi>IS nothing but Adultery, or such wilful desertion, as can no way be remedied, by the Church, or Civil Magistrate, a sufficient cause of dissolving the bond of Marriage?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Well then, <hi>do not the</hi> Enthusiasts, <hi>and</hi> Familists <hi>err, who maintain, that it is free to a man, to put away his wife when he pleaseth?</hi>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the God of <hi>Israel</hi> hatteth putting away; <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 16. (2) Because, whosoever putteth away his wife, except in case of Fornication, he causeth her to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery; <hi>Matth.</hi> 5, 32. (3) Because, the Apostle says, art thou bound to a wife, seek not to be loosed; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 27.</p>

                  <p>Yes.</p>

                     <hi>They first tell us, that marriage contracted, but not consummated, may be dissolved; to wit, by a Monastick Vow of a perpetual single life.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>They tell us secondly, that infidelity, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie are just causes of divorce. So say the</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thirdly, they tell us that murder committed upon the hope of getting such a Match, is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause of divorce.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That coldness, perpetual impotency, and such like fancies are causes?</hi>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Christ says, what God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 6. But marriage contracted, and ratified, though not consummated, is made

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, in very many places of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> the word <hi>Church</hi> (to wit <hi>Visible</hi>) is so largely taken, that it cannot be restricted, to any particular Congregational Church; <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 47. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.

                  </p>
                  <p>Yes. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Psalm</hi> 2. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.</p>
                  <p>Well then, <hi>do not the</hi> Donatists, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, <hi>and</hi> Puritans <hi>of old so truely named, err, who affirm the visible Church to consist of those only, that are pious and holy?</hi>

                     <hi>Do not likewise the</hi> Independents <hi>err, who think, none ought to be members of the Visible Church, save those, who in the judgement of men very spiritual, and discerning are esteemed true believers, and saints: who have given sufficient proof of their knowledge in the fundamentals of Religion: who have reported in order, and given a good account of the experimental work of their conversion, and effectual calling; who have shewed their conversation in the world, to have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the omission of any known duty, or commission of any known fault, and that for a considerable length of time.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the visible Church, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Garner, in which there is not only Wheat, but Chaff mixed with it. To a Field, in which Tares, and Darnel are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the good Corn. To a Net, in which both good Fishes, and bad are taken; <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. chapter. To a great House, wherein are not only vessels of Gold, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61596:137"/>
Silver, but of Wood, and of Earth; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20. (2) Because, Christ will answer some at the last day; who will say to him, Lord, have not we Prophesied in thy name, and in thy name casten out Devils, and have we not eaten and drunken at thy table, <hi>I know you not.</hi> This evidently shews, that many have been members of the Visible Church, whom Christ will not own at the last day; <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. (3) From the Parable of the ten <hi>Virgins,</hi> five whereof were foolish, five wise; <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 1. (4) From the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Banquet, where one was found at the Table, without a Wedding Garment; <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 11. (5) Because, many are of the Visible Church, who are not of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 19. (6) Because the Apostle, calls the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Church of Christ, notwithstanding of their gross enormities; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. (7) Because, <hi>Moses</hi> did acknowledge, even those then to be members of the Visible Church, to whom yet he knew, the Lord had not given ears to hear, nor eyes to see, nor a heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, the great and wonderful miracles which he wrought in their sight; <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12, 13. compared with the verses 2, 3, 4. (8) Because, <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> did admit
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61596:138"/>
many thousands into the communion of the Visible Church, without making a narrow search of their true grace, and conversion; <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. (9) Because, the Apostles did instantly, and without the delay of one day, baptise all those that professed the Christian Religion; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 41. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 26. (10) Because, the preaching of the Gospel, is appointed by God, as an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mean, no less for the Conversion of men, and women, than for the advancement of those in grace that are converted; <hi>Prov.</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 3, 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19. 20, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25 (11) Because, we are forbidden by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, to judge the spiritual state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our neighbour; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. (12) Because, Christ did acknowledge <hi>Iudas</hi> the Theif, and Traitor, as a member of his Visible Church, whom yet he foresaw to be the son of perdition; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 23. (13) Because, Christ had a visible church on earth many hundered of years before ever there were such cattle as <hi>Quakers</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi> Unless they will alledge that the primitive Christians and all the Saints, since the Apostles dayes, have been their Predecessors, and claime kin to them, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did to <hi>Iacob,</hi> who were truely descended of the heathen; who were brought thither out of <hi>Assyria,</hi> as
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61596:138"/>
the <hi>Quakers</hi> are descended from the <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asts</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> about 160 years since, as <hi>Nicolas Strokins, Iohn Matthias, and Iohn of Leyden,</hi> notorious Hereticks, blasphemers, and bloody Murderers.</p>
                  <p>But how quite different, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are to the primitive christians, and holy men of God then, and since, will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hence, that they did not contemn these two great ordinances of the Gospel instituted by Christ, to wit, <hi>Baptism and the Lords Supper.</hi> They had Bishops and Deacons to govern, and instruct them, who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to their functions by prayer and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, whom they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, with the ugly names of dumb dogs, and hirelings. These primitive christians, had not in their assemblies Women-preachers as the <hi>Quakers</hi> have, which is down right contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> injunctions; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. Neither were silent meetings ever heard of among the primitive christians. Nor did they ever out of contempt call churches, places appointed for the publick worship of God, Steeple-houses, but resorted to them for performing their devotions, and service to God, as did our blessed Saviour, and his Apostles; <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 5.</p>

                     <hi>Do not likewise the</hi> Papists <hi>and</hi> Lutherians <hi>err, who will have none members of the visible Church that are unbaptized?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Do not lastly the</hi> Anabaptists <hi>err, who will have no infants members of the visible church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, that God commanded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and little ones, should stand before him; should enter into covenant with him; <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11. (2) Because, infants are called the people of God, no less than men and women come to age; <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 11, 12, 13. (3) Because, the promise of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to children as well as to the parents; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. (4) If children be not members of the visible church, they must be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the visible kingdom of the devil, for there can be no midst; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12, 13. And so there shall be no difference between the children of <hi>Believers,</hi> and the children of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi> (5) Because, infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> had right unto the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace; <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 12. And children of Believers under the <hi>New Testament</hi> have lost no right to that covenant of Grace, which children under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> had; seeing the covenant of Grace, now under
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61596:139"/>
the Gospel, is not more strickly, and sparingly administred, than long since under the law; <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. (6) Because, infants are commanded to joyn themselves to Gods ordinances; <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 16. (7) Because, if Christ, while an infant, was head of the visible church; then infants may be his members. But the first is true, from <hi>Isaiah</hi> 9. 6. Therefore the second must be true also. (8) Because, they whom the false Apostles would have to be circumcised, after the manner of <hi>Moses</hi> (and therefore infants) were called <hi>Disciples; Acts</hi> 15. 10.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Lord <hi>IEHOVAH,</hi> in his visible Church (ordinarly) commands the blessing, even life for evermore; <hi>Psalm</hi> 133. 3. (2) Because, the visible church, is the mother of all Believers; <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. By

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, as not many husbands, but one only, is head of the wife, so Christ only is head of the Church; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23. (2) Because, the Church is espoused to one only namely to Christ; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. (3) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the Church is the body of Christ only; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. (4) Because, among all the Ecclesiastick orders instituted, and appointed by Christ, we do not read of such a creature, as an <hi>Universal Vicar<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of Christ; Eph.</hi> 4. 11. (5) Because, the Church is one body only
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61596:144"/>
(unless it be a monster) but one body, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have two heads; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4, 5.

                  <p>(8) If the <hi>Pope</hi> be not so much as a Bishop of a particular Church, he cannot be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Bishop. The first is true, because he doth not perform the office of a Bishop, which is set down; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 2, <hi>Titus</hi> 1, 7. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Do not likewise the</hi> Erastians, <hi>and others as</hi> Arminians <hi>err, who make the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate head of the Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Protestant Religion, as it is contained in the Harmony of Confessions, especially in the Confession of Faith, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the first Parliament of King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth, laitly ratified, and confirmed, doth not acknowledge any Supream Head, or Governor in the Church, neither <hi>Angel, Man, Pope, Prince,</hi> nor <hi>Potentate,</hi> save the Lord Christ, from whom alone, all subordinate power
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61596:144"/>
and authority is derived, to the officers, of his own Church. (2) Because, if the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magistrate be a church officer he must derive his power from Christ, and must be a Spiritual, and Ecclesiastick head and Governour, and not a civil only. And if such then Christ hath devolved his own place and office upon him, which is without Scripture proof. (3) Because, if the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magistrate be head of the church, he must have a right to this Title, either by humane Law, or by a divine warrant. Laws of a Nation, cannot make him head of the church, because such laws cannot make him an Ecclesiastick, and Spiritual officer. There is no divine warrant, or commission from Christ, as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. From the Epistles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> From <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 7, 8. And from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28.</p>

                     <hi>ARE the Saints bound by profession, to maintain an holy fellowship, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the worship of GOD, in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such other spiritual duties, as tend to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual edification?</hi>

                  <p>Well then, <hi>did not the</hi> Donatists <hi>of old, and</hi> Separatists <hi>now err, who maintain, that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and wicked men, do pollute, and defile the worship of God, not only to themselves, but also to others that worship with them: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we must separate from Communion in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, because of them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Church of the <hi>Iews</hi> in Christs time was very corrupt; <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 7.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61596:146"/>
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 6, 7, 8. And yet both by his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, and his command, he would not have his hearers to separate from it. For he both observed the feasts, and preached in their Synagogues; <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 22. And he commands his hearers to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> bad them do; <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 2, 3. (2) Because, the Apostle is so far from commanding separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that he praises their meetings; (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23.) notwithstanding of the many gross scandals, which were among them; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12, 13. (3) Because, the Apostles calls the <hi>Galatians, the Church of Christ, brethren, and the children of God,</hi> who were yet in some measure removed from GOD, to another Gospel. Nay, says <hi>Paul,</hi> O foolish, (or senseless) <hi>Galatians,</hi> who hath bewitched you, (that is, so blinded the eyes of your understanding, that ye cannot see the right truth; as the <hi>Iuglars</hi> bewitch the outward eyes, that men think they see that which they see not) that ye should not obey the truth; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. And yet since it was a constitute true Church, it was his judgement, there should be no separation from it, notwithstanding of all the foresaid
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61596:146"/>
faults. (4) Because, the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was a true Church, though they made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from their first love. So was the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> though there were in it who held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam.</hi> So was the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> notwithstanding that they suffered <hi>Iesebel,</hi> that called her self a prophetess, and taught the servants of Christ to commit Fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to Idols. (5) If we must separate from the Communion of the Church in things lawful, for the faults of others, of for the faults of Ministers, and if their sins pollute the worship of God to others, than, we must not keep communion with any Church: seeing there can hardly be a Church where there are not some hidden Hypocrites. Nay, where there are not some, who are known to be such by the Minister. Yet such are not to be excluded, as Christ himself teaches; <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 24. to 31. See the 47. and 48. verses of that same chapter. (6) If the worship be polluted to some, for the faults of others, with whom they worship, then must the Word and Sacraments, have their efficacy and worth from the Persons, that worship, and from the dispensers of them, which is absurd. (7) Because, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and evil men, do not pollute the worship
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61596:147"/>
to others, but to themselves only; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the man, that wanted the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment; <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 11. And from those who did eat and drink unworthily at the Lords Table. Such do not eat and drink damnation to others, but to themselves; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27, 29.<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the personal union is given to none, but to Christ only; <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14. The Word was made Flesh, that is, a true man like unto us in all things, yet without sin. (2) Because, in him dwelleth all the fulness of the God-head bodily. Namely by an essential inhabitation of the Son of God in the humane nature, by the uniting of his Divine Nature with the Humane, in the unity of his Person. <hi>Bodily,</hi> that is Personally, Essentially, and Truely. (3) Because, the union of the Saints with Christ is by Faith, not indeed by a personal Union; <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. (4). Because, there is no man that sinneth not; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 8, 10. (5) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, Gods Essence, is most simple, and single, and infinitely above and beyond all creatures; <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 14.

the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have builded to thy Name; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 27.

to all men, supposeth a distinction, and propriety of Goods. For if all Goods were common, it were impossible to steal.

Now, if Circumcision was a seal, and sign; why ought not Baptism, and the Lords Supper to be signs, and seals also?

the bread is the communion of the body of Christ; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.

(2) Because, the efficacy of the Word, doth not depend upon the piety, goodness, worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or good intention of the Instrument; <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 16: Therefore, neither doth the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of a Sacrament depend upon the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, that doth administer it. (3) If the efficacy of Baptism depended upon the good intention of the Minister, then no Christian could be sure, that he is baptized: seeing no man can be sure of, or know the Ministers intention.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61596:151"/>
most damnable Idolatry in worshipping that which is neither GOD, nor any divine thing. I say, they cannot be sure, because the Priests intention, may be deficient, while he is consecrating the Bread.</p>

But the power of preaching is not given to all men; <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4.

                  <p>(1) Because, the Apostle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3.) expresly says, that the Cloud, and the passing thorow the Red-Sea, did signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie these same things to the <hi>Iews,</hi> which Baptism signifies to us.

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Christ taking his fare-well of his Disciples, gave them this Commission, <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, Baptising them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> Or according to the Original Word, <hi>make all Nations Disciples,</hi> by your Doctrine, <hi>Baptising them, in the Name of, &amp;c.</hi> All which words are spoken with one breath. Whence it is clear, that the same very persons that were commanded to make all Nations Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by their Doctrine, were commanded to baptise them. But it was not in their power to administer the <hi>Inward Baptism;</hi> that is, to baptise with the holy Ghost, and with fire. Men may well administer the Water, or external sign; but it is Christ that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes the inward Grace, and thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. where <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> sayes, I indeed baptise you with Water unto Repentance, but he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after me, shall baptise you with the holy Ghost, and with fire. If any man had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this power of Baptising with the Holy Ghost, then surely <hi>Iohn</hi> should have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, whom Jesus so highly commends, as, that <hi>there was not a greater than he born of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; Matth.</hi> 11. 11. And though our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour subjoyns, he that is least in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61596:154"/>
of Heaven, is greater than he, yet this will not infer, that any among the Teachers of the Gospel, had the power of baptising with the holy Ghost, which he had not; but only, that they did shew Christ more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as having most perfectly accomplished whatsoever was requisite to our salvation; and did publish this, not only to the <hi>Iews,</hi> but also to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And so Christ as the Master employed only the Disciples, as his servants to dispense and act ministerially in his service, reserving the blessing of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments to himself. Now, baptizing with the holy Ghost, is the greatest blessing of the Gospel, and so cannot flow but from Christ himself. (2) Because, the Disciples of Christ acted only ministerially under him in working of miracles: therefore they could not administer baptism, with the holy Ghost, seing this is a greater power, than the other. The cureing of the soul is a far greater work, than to cure miraculously the body. The work of Conversion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, is a work beyond the creating of heaven and earth. There was only here, the introducing of a new Form, but no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Form, or quality to be expelled. But in this, the <hi>heart of stone</hi> must not onely be taken away, but a <hi>heart of flesh</hi> must be given.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61596:154"/>
That they acted only Ministerially under Christ, it is evident from what <hi>Peter</hi> sayes, ye men of <hi>Israel,</hi> why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power and godliness, we made this man to walk; <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 12. And the same <hi>Peter</hi> says, <hi>Eneas,</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ maketh thee whole; <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 34 See <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10. (3) Because, if this commission, empowred the Apostles to baptise onely with the Holy Ghost, and not with water; then they in the exercise of this Commission, would onely have baptized men and women with the holy Ghost, and not with water, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is manifest. (<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38.) where <hi>Peter</hi> makes a distinction between being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the name of Jesus Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the gift of the holy Ghost: namely the gifts and graces of the holy Spirit, which are common to all believers, and necessary to salvation. (4) Because, if baptism with the holy Ghost be here meant, then all whom the Apostles did baptize, were baptised with the holy Ghost, which is false: for <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> could not have been Hypocrites, if they had been baptized with the holy Ghost. And <hi>Simon</hi> was baptized and yet not with the holy Ghost, as appears by <hi>Peters</hi> answer to him verse 21, 22. of the fifth chapter.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61596:155"/>
(5) Because, if Christs commission carry not a warrant for baptizing with water, whence then had the Apostles a warrant for baptizing with Water?

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the <hi>Greek</hi> word in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal signifies, as well to <hi>poure,</hi> and <hi>sprinkle wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as it signifies to <hi>dip; Mark</hi> 7. 4. Where it is said, and when they come from the mercat, unless they <hi>wash,</hi> or be <hi>Baptised,</hi> they eat not.

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, to covenanted ones (of which number the Infants of Believers are no less than their Parents; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 22.) that seal of the covenant, of which they are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is not to be denyed; <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 10, 11.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61596:156"/>
(2) Because, the outward <hi>Sacrament of Water,</hi> cannot be denyed to such, as have received the Spirit of Christ, and to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> sealed up in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> do belong; <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 15, 16, 17. But to some Infants of Believers, as well as to others come to Age, the Spirit of Christ hath been given; <hi>Ierem.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 13, 14. And to them do the promises belong; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. (3) Because the Infants of Believers are members of the Church, which is sanctified and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, with the washing of water by the Word; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. (4) Because, Infants no less than others come to Age, were Baptised, in the <hi>Cloud</hi> and in the <hi>Sea;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. (5) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, Christ commanded that all Nations should be baptised, a great part whereof were Infants; <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. (6) Because, Christ commanded Baptism to be administred to Disciples, (Infants also are here to be taken in; <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10.) <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. The word in the Original is <hi>Matheteusate,</hi> Teach, Instruct, or make Disciples all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or make Disciples among all Nations, baptising them. The signification of this <hi>Greek</hi> word may be gathered from <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1. where it is said, that the Pharisees had heard, that Jesus
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61596:156"/>
                     <hi>made Disciples.</hi> So that <hi>Matheteuein</hi> and <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas poiein,</hi> are both one thing. (7) Because, the children of Believers, were by a Divine right circumcised, under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: therefore, the children of Believers under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> ought to be baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; because the one hath succeeded to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That Baptism succeeds to Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is evident first, because, they both seal up, the same very thing. Next, as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision was the initiating Seal, under the Old Testament, so is Baptism under the New: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostles did administer it so early to the Disciples at the first appearing of their new birth, and interest in the Covenant. Moreover, because by Baptism, we are said to put on Christ; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. That they both seal up the same thing, is evident by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 11: <hi>with Mar:</hi> 1: 4: <hi>Acts</hi> 2: 28. Where <hi>Circumcision</hi> is declared to be a seal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of Faith, and Baptism is held forth to be a pledge of the remission of sins, as also may be seen; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. see <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. 12. Where the Apostle teaches, that our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buried with Christ in Baptism, is our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision in Christ; which shews that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism hath succeeded to us in the room of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision. (8) Because, the Apostle sayes, that the Infants but of one believing Parent
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61596:157"/>
are holy; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. that is, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the outward Covenant of GOD, and have access to the Signs, and Scals of GODS Grace as well as they are, that are born of both believing Parents.</p>

                  <p>No. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 13, 23.</p>
                  <p>Well then, <hi>do not the</hi> Papists <hi>and</hi> Lutheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>err, who maintain, that Baptism is simply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation; and that all, and those onely, who are baptised, are most surely regenerated, in that same very moment of time, wherein Baptism is administred?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Thief upon the Cross, and others were saved, that were never bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised; <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43. (2) Because, persons unbaptised have had saving Faith; <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 22, 44. (3) Because, Infants that are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated unto life, though they die in their mothers belly, yet they cannot perish;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61596:157"/>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 14. (4) Because, some children before their Baptism, have been beloved of GOD, whose love is unchangeable; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 11, 13. Others have been Regenerated by the Holy Ghost; <hi>Luke</hi> chap: 1: ver: 15: and some have also been comprehended within the Covenant of Grace; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. (5) Because, that Baptism, without faith, and the inward operation of the holy Spirit, hath no efficacy to Salvation; <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 21. (6) Because, the Baptism of the Spirit, at one time goes before, at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time follows Baptism with water; <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 37. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. (7) Because, very many that are baptized within the visible Church, are damned; <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 13, 14. (8) Because, in those that are come to age, Faith, and Repentance, are pre-required to Baptism; and therefore before they be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, they have the beginning of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. (9) Because, not all that are baptized are elected; <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 16. But all that are elected by GOD, are in time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 2. (10) Because, the Holy Ghost, is a most Free Agent, and Worker: and therefore his operation (whence the efficacy of Baptism depends) whereby we are regenerated, is not tyed to any one moment of time; <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8. (11)
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:61596:158"/>
Because, Baptism is not a converting, but a confirming Ordinance, even as the Lords Supper is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Papists <hi>do otherwise contradict the second part, in affirming, that the vertue and efficacy of Baptism (as to the abolishing, and sealing up the remission of more grievous sins and faillings, which they call</hi> Mortal) <hi>doth not extend it self, to the time to come, but to the time past: so that if the person baptized, fall into some deadly and dangerous sin, which wounds the conscience, there is need of another Sacrament, to wit,</hi> Pennance, <hi>whereby the remission of that</hi> Mortal sin, <hi>as they call it, is sealed up unto him?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Sacrament of Baptism, after the administration thereof doth not cease to be a Sacrament, of the blood of Christ which purgeth us from all our sins; <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7. (2) Because, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith (which is sealed up to us by Baptism; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12.) is for all sins committed before and after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 36. (3) Because, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our says, he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. (4) Because, not onely the beginning of our Salvation, is referred to baptism, but also salvation it self, and eternal life; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 21. (5)
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61596:158"/>
Because, the Scripture bringeth Arguments from the use and remembrance of baptism, by which we that have been baptized, are stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to holiness, and newness of life, and to put off the <hi>old man,</hi> and consequently all those sins, which the Adversaries call <hi>Mortal; Rom.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. 12.</p>

                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:61596:159"/>Yes. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25, 26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17, 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>Well then, <hi>do not the</hi> Quakers <hi>err, who maintain, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to be no Gospel Ordinance, and that there is no Gospel precept, for the administration thereof, until his second coming?</hi>

                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>They look upon this Ordinance, as a Type onely and Figure, or shadow of Christs Body and Blood, which was commanded for that time, and for some time to come, but not unto his <hi>second coming.</hi> Thus they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that most precious Ordinance of <hi>taking and eating the Bread and drinking the Wine,</hi> as they do baptism with Water, and all other Ordinances, to the introducing of black Atheism into the World. They pervert the true meaning of the Scripture for the defence of their damnable Tenets, as by this one instance <hi>Till he come,</hi> which is meant (say they) not of his second coming at the last day, but of his coming to dwell in his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Apostles, as if Christ had not been in them, both before, and after his ascension; even as they deny <hi>baptism,</hi> in Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission (<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.) to his Disciples, to be meant of <hi>Baptism with Water,</hi> because <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is not exprest; they deny either wilfully,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61596:160"/>
as their Ring-leaders do, or ignorantly, or by a delusion from the Devll, as the most part do, the most sure and evident Truths in Scripture, pratling and gagling in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, sense, and nonsense, being oftner out of purpose, than in a purpose, skipping from one subject to another, to save themselves from the strength of reason, like <hi>subtile Foxes,</hi> which when they are beaten from one hole, flie into another. But while they are obstinate, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious, in maintaining Lies, and Untruths, they ought to be confuted, as the man was, that <hi>denyed Snow to be white.</hi> For it is not so much a blindness of mind, or a weakness of judgement, as many well meaning people are misled by, as a wilful, obstinate resisting of the Truth, as the perverse <hi>Iews</hi> did, or as, <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> withstood <hi>Moses.</hi> They that are against commanded Gospel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the Ministers of Christ, whom they look upon as the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> would (if they durst) shake off the very Scripture, and Word of GOD.

                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:61596:161"/>
                     <hi>Dead, to obtain remission of sins?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the sacrificing and offering up of Christ, is a part of his own Priesthood; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. But the Priesthood of Christ cannot be transferred from himself to any other; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24. Therefore, no Priest can offer him up under the forms of <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> unto GOD. (2) Because, the offering of the Body of Christ, <hi>is once for all.</hi> It is but one single offering, and cannot be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10, 12, 14. (3) Because, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing and offering up of Christ, is one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of a most perfect Merit, and Efficacy; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 14. But the repeating of the same Sacrifice, and the multitude of Priests, are a token of an imperfect Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 25, 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10, 11. (4) If Christ be <hi>often offered,</hi> he must <hi>often die and suffer; Heb.</hi> 9. 25, 26. But Christ being now raised from the Dead, cannot any more suffer and die; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9. (5) Because, that one and most perfect Sacrifice of Christ, did abrogate and take away all those external Sacrifices, and caused them to cease; <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 27. (6) Because, there can be no <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> for sin, without shedding of blood; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. Neither doth he die any more, but is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61596:161"/>
now in Heaven to appear in the presence of GOD for us, and to interceed in our behalf; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 12. (7) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, in every Sacrifice there is required (and really is) a dying, and destruction of the thing sacrificed. But Christ still liveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9. (8) Because, no man can offer Jesus up to GOD, but Christ himself; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. (9) Because, in all external sacrifices, properly so called, there is necessarly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a visible external Host, or thing sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as the Adversaries grant. But the thing which is said to be offered up by the <hi>Mass-Priest,</hi> namely the Body of Christ, is neither external nor visible here, it being in Heaven and not on Earth with man; <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21.</p>

                  <p>Well then, <hi>do not the</hi> Papists <hi>err, who maintain, that the Bredd and Wine, by the power of the words of consecration</hi> This is my Body, <hi>are truely Transubstantiat into the very body and blood of Christ; nothing remaining but the outward forms, and Accidents of the Bread and wine?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> makes Christs body every where present, invisible, that cannot be handled, without shape, and figure, without humane quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is contrary to <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 6.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61596:165"/>
where. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 17. (2) Because, before and after consecration, the bread is called the communion of the body of Christ: but nothing is said, or can be the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of its own self; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. (3) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, afrer consecration, the Apostle calls not the bread, <hi>a Species or form of Bread;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26, 27, 28. And after consecration, Christ calls the wine the fruit of the vine; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 29. (4) Because, Christ did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the Supper to be a <hi>memorial</hi> of himself until he come again. But a memorial, is not of things corporally present, but of things absent; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. (5) Because, that which is properly broken, is not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, but the bread is properly broken, therefore the bread is not the body of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. (6) Because, Christ went up to heaven bodily, and is to tarry there until the end of the world; <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. (7) <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> destroys the very <hi>Essence,</hi> and being of the Lords Supper. First, It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes the sign, because it takes away the substance of the <hi>bread and wine;</hi> the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and outward Forms only remaining. Secondly, It destroys the thing signified, for it robes and spoils the body of Christ, of its true quantity and dimensions (for according to that infallible <hi>Philosophical Maxim, sublatis</hi>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:61596:165"/>
                     <hi>dimensionibus corporis, tollitur ipsum corpus.</hi> That is, by taking away the <hi>length, breadth,</hi> and <hi>thickness</hi> of any Physical or Natural body, you destroy consequentially the very essence and being of that body) and introduces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of one body, many bodies. (8) Because, <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> takes away the <hi>Sacramental Analogie:</hi> and so, when the sign is turned into the thing signified, all similitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them is gone, and ceaseth. (9) From this doctrine do follow many great Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities inconsistent with Religion, Sense, and Reason. As first, that Christ in the Supper, did both eat and drink himself: that he was wholly in his own mouth: that he had a <hi>double and twofold body;</hi> one Visible, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Invisible: That a Mouse, or Rat, may <hi>eat Christs Body:</hi> That his body being reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and laid up into a Cupboard, in a short time may <hi>turn into Vermine.</hi> Must not <hi>Christs body be in many places at once?</hi> Must not <hi>his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and all the parts thereof, his <hi>head, hands</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> be in the smallest, and least crumb of the <hi>Host?</hi> Must not Christs body, having now that bigness in Heaven, which he had upon Earth, be biger, than it self; longer, and thicker?</p>
                  <p>If Christs <hi>Body</hi> may be in diverse places at once, why may not a mans body be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61596:166"/>
places at once? this is granted by the Adversaries) but a man cannot be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse places at once.</p>
                  <p>Can <hi>Peter,</hi> for example, be both at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> in the same moment of time? He may then be both a man and not a man, at the same time: he may be a man, because living at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and not a man, because dead at <hi>London.</hi> May not <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> go to <hi>York,</hi> and meet <hi>Peter</hi> there from <hi>London?</hi> And what a mirry meeting must it be, when <hi>Peter</hi> shakes hands with <hi>Peter,</hi> and takes a glass of Wine from him? May not <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>London</hi> be killed there at <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> be left alive? May not <hi>Peter</hi> alive be re-produced in a thousand Cities at once, and <hi>marry</hi> there a thousand <hi>wives,</hi> and beget in one night a thousand <hi>Sons,</hi> and <hi>Daughters?</hi> May not <hi>Peter</hi> be so many times re-produced, till he make up an hundred thousand fighting men? May not one <hi>candle</hi> by re-production be made as many; as may give light to the whole <hi>Universe?</hi> May not one bottle of <hi>water</hi> be made so many, as may serve an <hi>Army</hi> of an hundred thousand? May not one <hi>Guiney</hi> be reproduced as many times as may amount to five and twenty hundred thousand pounds sterling? A brave invention for paying five
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61596:166"/>
or six hundred thousand merks of debt: Next, as the Adversaries are engaged to maintaine that one body may be in many places a, once, so are they under a necessity to affirm that many bodies may be in one place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by way of <hi>Penetration,</hi> for in every crumb of the <hi>Host,</hi> is Christs <hi>Body.</hi> From which position, it follows that a mans body may be contained within a <hi>Nut-shel.</hi> That a <hi>Snuff-box</hi> may contain <hi>Athurs Seat:</hi> the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of an <hi>Ox eye,</hi> the whole <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> That a <hi>Sparrow</hi> may swallow, one by one, the seven <hi>Planets,</hi> seeing each one of them, may occupy no more bounds, or space, than a grain of <hi>barly corn</hi> doth: and yet the <hi>Sun</hi> which is swallowed, will be as big as at present: for Christs body in the <hi>Host,</hi> is as big and tall, as when he was on the Cross, as the Adversaries confess. (10) We never read of a miracle wrought by GOD, but what was evident, and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to all, and evidently seen to be such. As when <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>rod</hi> was turned into a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and became a <hi>rod</hi> again; <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 2, 3. Such were the wonders of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Such was the dividing of the <hi>Red Sea:</hi> the stricking of the <hi>Rock:</hi> and the flowing out of the <hi>waters; Numb.</hi> 20. 11. The destruction of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> was evident to all the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61596:167"/>
                     <hi>Israelites; Numb.</hi> 16. 31, 32. So were the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which were wrought by the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, such were the <hi>miracles</hi> which Christ and his Apostles wrought. Was not the water most evidently turned into wine; <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9. But after the Words of <hi>consecrationn</hi> uttered by the <hi>Mass Priest,</hi> the bread as to sense, is the same thing it was. The bread hath the same taste, th√® same smell, that same touch, that same outward form, and figure, that same colour, that same weight. It occupies that same space and bounds, and hath the same quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in all its dimensions. But the <hi>rod</hi> was seen a <hi>serpent,</hi> and the <hi>serpent</hi> was seen a <hi>rod.</hi> The water was seen wine: it was known to be wine by the <hi>taste,</hi> by the <hi>smell,</hi> by the <hi>colour.</hi> Christ never wrought such a miracle as the miracle of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> In all his miracles he appealed to our outward Senses. And was it ever heard that Christ wrought miracles without a necessity?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Christ was sitting with his body at the Table. (2) Because, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did eat of the bread, and drink of the wine. (3) Because, he took bread from the Table: he took not his own body: he break bread, and did distribute it, he break not his own body: so he took the Cup, and not his own blood. (4) Because, Christ said, the Cup was the New Testament in his blood: but the Cup is not <hi>in, with,</hi> and <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Wine.</hi> (5) Because Christ said, the <hi>bread was his body, which was broken; the Wine was his blood, which was shed.</hi> But neither was his <hi>body broken under the bread,</hi> nor his <hi>blood shed under the Wine,</hi> seing Christ as yet, was not betrayed, crucified, and dead.</p>

                  <p>It brings with it many and great absurdities; as that the <hi>body of Christ, Non habeat partem extra partem; hath not one part of it without another;</hi> but as if all the <hi>parts of his Body,</hi> were in one part, which is contrary to the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real Quantum,</hi> which consists essentially in three <hi>dimensions, length, breadth,</hi> and <hi>thickness.</hi> It makes in effect <hi>his Body</hi> to be no body.

                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Lord Jesus Christ hath delivered to the Ministers of his Church, as to his own <hi>Delegates</hi> and <hi>Ambassadours</hi> (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to his own laws) the whole power of Governing the Church, which he himself received from the Father, to be

managed, and put in execution in his own name and authority; <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7, 8, 11.

And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26, 40. (3) Because, the Lord Jesus Christ, hath looked to the good of his Church, no less under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> than under the <hi>Old.</hi> Therefore, since the Church under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> had a most perfect form of Government prescribed to it: and since there is as great need and necessity of Church order, and discipline, under the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as was under the <hi>Old,</hi> it must follow, that there is a Patern and Form of Church <hi>government</hi> no less set down, and prescribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>New Testament,</hi> than was under the <hi>Old; Heb.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20.

But nothing that's meerly of humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, can reach this end; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. (5) Because, all the parts of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

are particularly set down in Scripture. As first, those things which concern the key of doctrine, as publick prayer, and giving of thanks; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. 1 <hi>cor.</hi> 14. 14, 15, 16. Singing of <hi>Psalms; Eph.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16.

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, Christ hath committed the keyes of the kingdom of Heaven to the Officers of his Church which are Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours distinct from the civil Magistrate; <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18, 19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23. (2) Because, Church power, and civil power differ specifically. The church, and the common-wealth are Polities formally, and essentially different. They are not, as such, powers subordinate, at least in a right line, but co-ordinate; <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19, 20. 2 <hi>chron.</hi> 26. 18. Next, God the Creator and Governour of the World; is the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the power of the civil Magistrate; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 4. But God-Christ, our blessed Mediator, and Lord of his church, is the Efficient of the church particularly, and of its Government. The matter (<hi>materia ex qua</hi>) of the civil Government, is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sword: but the matter of the church Government, are the keyes of the kingdom of Heaven.

The matter of the <hi>civil Government (materia circa quam)</hi> are men and women, as members of the <hi>common-wealth,</hi> without, as well as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>church:</hi> but as <hi>christians</hi> and <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>church,</hi> they are not such; 1 <hi>cor.</hi> 5. 13. The formal causes of both are distinct; the one inflicts <hi>punishments</hi> meerly <hi>spiritual;</hi> the other inflicts <hi>punishments</hi> meerly <hi>civil.</hi> Lastly, the end of this, is the <hi>corporal</hi> and <hi>external</hi> good of a <hi>society;</hi> but the end of that, is the <hi>spiritual good of the church</hi> and its <hi>edification; Matth.</hi> 14. 15. 1 <hi>cor.</hi> 5. 5. 2 <hi>cor.</hi> 10. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Do not likewise the</hi> Socinians, Anabaptists, Quakers, <hi>many</hi> Independents, <hi>and others err, who maintain, that the key of Doctrine, or the publick preaching of the Word, is proper to any man furnished with sutable gifts, though not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and sent to that employment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, no man can believe in Christ of whom he hath not heard, and how shal he hear without a Preacher; and how shal he preach unless he be sent; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. (2) Because, Women may have sutable, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61596:173"/>
competent gifts for Preaching, and yet they are forbidden to speak in the Church; 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2. 12. (3) Because, the Scripture blames such, as have run, and yet have not been sent; <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. 21, 32. (4) Because, no man taketh this honour to himself (that is, he ought not to take it) but he that is called of GOD, as was <hi>Aaron; Heb.</hi> 5. 4. (5) Because, the Scripture mentioneth, <hi>that GOD hath set apart certain peculiar Ministers, for the preaching of the Word; Rom.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Ephes:</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 3. (6) Because, no man can take the office of a <hi>civil Magistrate,</hi> or of a <hi>Deacon</hi> of the <hi>church</hi> upon him, unless he be called thereunto; <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10. And therefore no man ought to take upon him the <hi>publick preaching of the Word,</hi> unless he be called thereunto likewise. (7) Because, he that taketh upon him this office, without a call, he <hi>usurpeth Authority</hi> in the <hi>church,</hi> seing Preaching is an <hi>Act of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12.

without a <hi>call;</hi> and therefore seing it is not done in Faith, it must be Sin. Must every Fellow that takes a <hi>laxit</hi> in his tongue, go up to the Pulpit and ease himself?

                     <hi>Do not likewise the</hi> Independents, Brunists, <hi>and</hi> Anabaptists <hi>err, who maintain, that the Right and Power of Governing the church, belongs no less to the multitude and community of Believers, than to the Officers of the church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons are they confuted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Scripture expresly teaches, that GOD hath committed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his church, and the care of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to certain chosen Persons, and not to all, and every one; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. 12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. (2) Because, if the power of the keyes were given to believers, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; either they are given to them as believers, or as they are gifted by GOD, with gifts, and qualifications above others, for Governing the church, and chosen out of the rest, for performing that office. If
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61596:174"/>
the last part be affirmed, it follows, that the power, and right of the keyes, is committed not to a community of believers, but to some select persons, which we own, and maintain: but the <hi>Independents deny.</hi> If the first be asserted, then it follows first, that the care of <hi>Governing the church</hi> is committed to <hi>Women,</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> being believers; and so they must necessarly have the power of <hi>seeing,</hi> as being <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>watch men</hi> to the church: the power of <hi>hearing,</hi> as being the <hi>ears</hi> of the church: and the body of the church must be deformed; because the whole body is the <hi>eye,</hi> and the whole body is the <hi>ear,</hi> and whose many members are made one member; 1 <hi>cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. (2) It follows, that the power of the keyes, it not only given to all, but to Believers only: but it is evident by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and other <hi>Reprobates,</hi> that many in Christs name have preached, who were not Believers; <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. (3) Because, to whom Christ has given the power of <hi>Governing the church;</hi> to them also, he hath promised to give gifts, and enduments largely for performing that office; <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6, 7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. But to a <hi>community</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> God has never promised a <hi>Spirit</hi>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:61596:174"/>
for the <hi>Ministry,</hi> nor gifts for that <hi>employment.</hi> Nor did he ever bestow, or <hi>confer</hi> any such <hi>enduments.</hi> (4) Because, Christ our <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> appointed <hi>Ecclesiastical Officers</hi> and <hi>Church-Governours,</hi> before ever there was a <hi>formal church,</hi> under the <hi>New Testament</hi> gathered, and set up; <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. This was all done before <hi>his death.</hi> And before <hi>his ascension</hi> he did the like; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 8. 11, 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. Now it is evident, that there was no <hi>formal gathering together</hi> of a <hi>church,</hi> before the <hi>Feast</hi> of <hi>Pentecost; Acts</hi> 2. <hi>Ecclesiastick Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for <hi>calling in,</hi> and <hi>gathering together</hi> the <hi>Mystical body of Christ,</hi> to wit, his <hi>Members:</hi> therefore it was needful, that <hi>Ministers bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,</hi> ought to be before <hi>Persons baptized.</hi> That <hi>Gatherers</hi> of the <hi>church</hi> ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Persons gathered.</hi> That <hi>callers</hi> and <hi>inviters</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> ought to be before <hi>Persons called</hi> and <hi>invited.</hi> (5) This <hi>Democracy</hi> or <hi>popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> cannot but bring in <hi>great confusion,</hi> whence many absurdities will follow. As the <hi>church of GOD</hi> should not be an <hi>organical body.</hi> That <hi>Women</hi> who are forbidden to speak in the <hi>church,</hi> most have the <hi>keyes of the kingdom of Heaven hanging at their Belt, forsooth.</hi> All must <hi>govern,</hi> and none must be <hi>governed.</hi> All must
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61596:175"/>
attend the <hi>government</hi> of the <hi>church.</hi> All must be rendred <hi>uncapable</hi> for going about their <hi>particular callings,</hi> which <hi>God calls</hi> them to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. Therefore seing this sort <hi>of Government,</hi> brings so much <hi>confusion</hi> with it, it is most <hi>probable,</hi> that it is not <hi>of God</hi> who is a <hi>God of Order,</hi> and not <hi>of confusion;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the <hi>Apostolick church</hi> referred all weightier matters, which did equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern many Congregations, to the free suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and votes of the Apostles, Pastors, and select Brethren, and not to the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any <hi>one particular church,</hi> or <hi>congregation; Acts</hi> 15. 23, 24, 25. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2, 3. (2) Because, it is evident from Scripture, that there have been many <hi>particular churches,</hi> and <hi>congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons subordinate to one Presbytrie.</hi> For, in the <hi>church of Ierusalem,</hi> it is manifest, that there were more than <hi>one congregation.</hi> First, from
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61596:177"/>
the multitude of Believers, who were of a greater number than could be of one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>for hearing the Word, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating; Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 20. (3) From the multitude of <hi>Pastors,</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> whose pains and labours many <hi>churches</hi> required; <hi>Acts</hi> 1: 12. 13, 14, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1, 14, 37, 42. <hi>Acts</hi> 4: 31, 34, 35, 37. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 8: 14: (4) From the diversity of <hi>Tongues among the Disciples</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which were given, not only for the edification of those that were of that Church; but also <hi>for signs and wonders to others,</hi> who were without, and not of that Church. (5) It is manifest from this, <hi>that in those dayes,</hi> they had no churches, or meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houses built, <hi>but only met and conveened in private houses, and upper rooms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same is also true of the church of <hi>Antioch, Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> from the <hi>Acts of the Apostles;</hi> and other places of Scripture. But all these congregations were ruled and governed by one <hi>Colledge of Pastors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Because, all these particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, are called but one church; <hi>Acts</hi> 18: 22: <hi>Acts</hi> 12, 5: (2) Because, in that one church, there were church <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who were called <hi>Governours,</hi> not of any one particular congregation, but of the church, which was
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:61596:177"/>
made up of many <hi>particular churches; Acts</hi> 20. 17: <hi>Acts</hi> 15: 2: 3: <hi>Acts</hi> 13: 1, 2, 3: (3) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, these <hi>Presbyters</hi> did meet together for governing the <hi>church,</hi> and performed <hi>Acts of Iurisdiction,</hi> which concerned the whole <hi>church in common; Acts</hi> 11: 30: compared with chapter 4: 35, 37: And <hi>Acts</hi> 21: 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25: and <hi>Acts</hi> 13: 1, 2, 3: (4) Because, there is a <hi>particular example of a Synod,</hi> which had the <hi>power of Iurisdiction,</hi> and which consisted, and was made up of <hi>members,</hi> out of diverse <hi>Classical Conventions:</hi> For when the Question about <hi>circumcision,</hi> and the keeping of <hi>Moses Law,</hi> which troubled the <hi>Churches of Syria, Cilicia, Antioch, and Ierusalem,</hi> could not be <hi>determined</hi> in their own <hi>particular churches,</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> was <hi>referred</hi> to a <hi>Synod of Apostles</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who met at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, which decided the controversy, and appointed</hi> their <hi>decrees</hi> to be <hi>obligatory,</hi> and binding to all these foresaid <hi>churches; Acts</hi> 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 25. (5) Because, the <hi>Iewish church,</hi> which was a <hi>politick body,</hi> had in every <hi>city Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues</hi> subordinate to one <hi>supream council,</hi> or great <hi>Synagogue</hi> which was at <hi>Ierusalem<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Deut.</hi> 17. 8, 12. 2 <hi>chron.</hi> 19. 8. 11. <hi>Exod:</hi> 18. 22, 26.

                     <hi>church</hi> such a <hi>government,</hi> may be as great, if not greater in his <hi>church,</hi> under the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> than was then: and seeing the Lord has no less consulted the <hi>good of his church now,</hi> than he did of old; it follows, that there must be <hi>councils,</hi> no less under the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> than under the <hi>old,</hi> to which, particular <hi>churches</hi> ought to be <hi>subordinate.</hi> (6) From the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and <hi>right Reason:</hi> for the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> directs to a <hi>diversity of courts;</hi> namely, where there is any Rule or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a <hi>city</hi> or <hi>common-wealth,</hi> and orders the <hi>inferiour courts</hi> to be subordinate to the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,</hi> the lesser to the greater, and Appeals to be made from them to the greater. And in bodies both <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Politick</hi> the <hi>parts</hi> ought to be subject to the <hi>whole,</hi> for the good of both. Besides there are, and will be very many <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick affairs</hi> which will concern many <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi> equally and alike, which cannot be determined by any one. (2) Because, the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will stand in need each one of anothers help, and assistance mutually. (3) Because, cases and difficulties may occur, more intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and intricate, than can be settled and composed by the <hi>Governours</hi> of any one <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> (4) Seing particular <hi>Congregations</hi> which ly nigh one to another, ought to shun
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61596:178"/>
divisions, and differences, and to live in <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>unity,</hi> it follows manifestly, that there ought to be <hi>Synods or Councils,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of many <hi>particular congregations,</hi> which ought to be <hi>subordinate,</hi> to these <hi>Councils,</hi> and <hi>Synods.</hi> (5) From Christs own precept, and command, <hi>Tell the Church; Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. For if our <hi>blessed Lord</hi> appointed, that for a single bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>offence,</hi> (he trespassing against <hi>GOD,</hi> or his <hi>brother,</hi> for gaining of him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the <hi>Scandal</hi>) he be brought before the <hi>church,</hi> it follows by <hi>consequence,</hi> that the same course ought to be taken, when any one <hi>particular Congregation,</hi> offends against another, and remains obstinate in their <hi>scandalous Opinion,</hi> and <hi>Practise.</hi> For our <hi>blessed Lord,</hi> hath sufficiently prescribed a <hi>Remedy</hi> in this place, for removing of all <hi>Scandals,</hi> and <hi>Offences,</hi> whether of one <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> against <hi>another,</hi> or of <hi>one Congregation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>another.</hi> Nay, surely, since Christ hath consulted so much the conversion of one <hi>brother,</hi> that hath sinned, and gone astray; much more will he look to the good, and conversion of a <hi>whole Congregation.</hi> (6) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, any one single <hi>congregation,</hi> with one <hi>Pastor</hi> only, hath not the power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> an instance whereof cannot be given, either
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61596:179"/>
from <hi>Precept,</hi> or <hi>Practise,</hi> in all the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Ministers,</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> was alwayes performed by a <hi>Colledge of Pastors associate</hi> together; <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. (7) Because, from this doctrine of the <hi>Independents</hi> these and the like absurdities will follow.</p>
                  <p>First, that the <hi>Prophets</hi> must be <hi>censured,</hi> and <hi>judged</hi> by way of <hi>authority,</hi> not by other <hi>Prophets,</hi> but by the <hi>multitude:</hi> and <hi>vulgar of the Congregation,</hi> which is contrary to 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14. 32.</p>
                  <p>(2) That all the <hi>Councils,</hi> in the times of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which were <hi>convocated</hi> upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary occasions for <hi>matters</hi> which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many <hi>churches alike,</hi> were but <hi>during the time,</hi> and extraordinary, and so not <hi>oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing succeeding churches,</hi> though the occasions, and causes, why these <hi>Councils</hi> were <hi>convocated</hi> then, are, and will be to the end of the world. (3) That private <hi>Believers,</hi> must be the <hi>Bishops</hi> of their own <hi>Bishops, Watch-men</hi> of their own <hi>Watch-men.</hi> No communion or fellowship among <hi>Ecclesiastick Ministers.</hi> That single and <hi>particular churches,</hi> though they have defiled, and pudled themselves, with the most black, and ugly <hi>Heresies,</hi> with the most abominable faults, and vices, yet are not lyable to any <hi>Ecclesiastick Censure,</hi> but

                  <p>
                     <hi>The third is a most pleasant</hi> Meadow, <hi>in which as in a Royal prison, the Souls that are in it, want happiness, yet suffer no punishment of</hi> Sense, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what ariseth from the delay of happiness, but only of</hi> Loss.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth place is called</hi> Purgatory, <hi>which is a middle place between heaven and hell, in which are the Saints, who have departed from this life, without making satisfaction by temporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for their</hi> venial sins, <hi>yet have gone thither for the guilt of their punishment, the fault whereof is pardoned in this life: that when they have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and are well purged from every spot and blemish, they may be admitted to that blessed Vision in seeing GOD for ever.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>By what reasons do you confute</hi> Limbus patrum?</p>
                  <p>(1) Because, the Souls of the <hi>Faithful</hi> that departed before <hi>Christs passion,</hi> were made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the same <hi>Heavenly Ierusalem,</hi> with
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61596:184"/>
the Angels; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23. (2) Because, the Spirits and Souls of the <hi>Faithful</hi> that died before <hi>Christ suffered, returned to GOD</hi> who gave them; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 21. (3) Because, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Christs sacrifice</hi> did no less extend it self to <hi>Believers</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> than to <hi>Believers</hi> under the <hi>New; Rev.</hi> 13. 8.

(2) Because, Christ said, that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven belonged to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children,</hi> though not <hi>baptised; Matth.</hi> 19. 14. (3) Because, the <hi>Infants</hi> of the <hi>Israelites</hi> dying before the eight day, were not shut up in <hi>Limbus Infantum,</hi> as the Adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confess. But the Nature and Essence of <hi>Baptism</hi> under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and the Nature and Essence of <hi>Circumcision</hi> under the <hi>Old,</hi> are the same; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. (4) All the Arguments which are brought against the absolute necessity of <hi>Baptism,</hi> do clearly overturn this fiction of <hi>Limbus Infantum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is no such place, as a <hi>most</hi>

                     <hi>pleasant meadow,</hi> in which, as in a <hi>Senatorian prison,</hi> the Souls that are in it want Felicity; yet suffer no punishment of <hi>Sense.</hi> This was made evident in the First Question. Lastly, there is no such place as <hi>Purgatory.</hi> (1) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, there is no such thing as <hi>Venial sin,</hi> as it is explained by the <hi>Popish-church,</hi> upon which false Foundation, is built this fancy of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; Rom.</hi> 6. 23. (2) Because, <hi>temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments</hi> do not extend themselves beyond this life; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 10. For in this life onely, the Godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their <hi>evil things,</hi> as the Wicked receive their <hi>good things; Luke</hi> 16. 25. (3) Because, after the fault is pardoned, there remains no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to be undergone; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 22. <hi>Psalm</hi> 32. 1, 2. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 33. (4) Because, the Thief upon the Cross, that was converted, did not suffer afterwards any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in <hi>Purgatory; Luke</hi> 23. 43. Neither could his death, and confession upon the Cross, be accounted a perfect satisfaction (as the Adversaries affirm) because he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, he had <hi>received the due reward of his deeds; Luke</hi> 23. 41. He that suffers as a Murderer, or as a Thief, or as an evi doer, his punishment cannot be accounted a satisfaction; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4. 15. (5) Because, they that <hi>die in the Lord, rest from all their labours;</hi>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:61596:185"/>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. (6) Because, Christs satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the sins of Believers, is most full, compleat, and perfect, and doth not need our imperfect satisfactions, whether for the Fault or the Punishment; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 53. chapter; <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 14. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1: 7: <hi>Heb:</hi> 10: 14: <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 20, 21, 22. Neither by our sufferings in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> is <hi>Christs satisfaction applyed to us.</hi> First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our sufferings there cannot be an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument for applying Christs Merits to us.</hi> For on GODS part, we have the Word, Sacraments, and the Spirit as means, for applying <hi>his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> to us. On our part we have <hi>Faith.</hi> Was it ever heard of in the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> that the Lord made use of <hi>exquisite torments for applying his Grace?</hi> To apply Mercy by the execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Justice: Is forgiving debt, applyed by exacting the debt? Shall pardon be applyed to by the punishing of us?</p>

(2) Because, the Apostle says (as was cited) <hi>we shal not all sleep but be changed:</hi> which place of Scripture is not to be read, <hi>we shall all therefore sleep,</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> say, putting in the <hi>Greek particle oun,</hi> for <hi>ou, therefore</hi> for <hi>not.</hi> Because this <hi>illative particle oun,</hi> cannot agree sufficiently with the Apostles Preface, <hi>Behold, I shew you a mystery:</hi> This <hi>Mysterie</hi> is not death it self, but a <hi>change</hi> in place of <hi>death,</hi> which is a great <hi>Mystery</hi> indeed.

(2) Because, the <hi>Apostle sayes,</hi> He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies (<hi>and therefore not bodies made of Air</hi>) by his Spirit, that dwelleth in you; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11.
