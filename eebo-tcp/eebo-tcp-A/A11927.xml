         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all Ages and</hi> times, there haue bene some godly and well disposed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that imployed theyr tyme and trauayle in descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byng the State of Christes Churche and of the common wealth of the Lordes Israell: As for example, In the tyme of the law before Christ, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Samuel, Esras, Nehemiah, and others: After the law, since Christ, S. Luk, Theodoret, Sozomenus, Epiphanius, Nicepho rus, Iohn Sleidan, and in our time Maister Iohn Foxe oure Countrey man, (whose godly labour hath deserued great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.) As these fathers and godly learned men, in their times, by occasion haue labored and trauailed to benefite the Church of Christ, which through ignorance hath bene much endamaged: euen so that notable, graue, godly learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Petrus Ramus, the Authour of these Commentaries of the state of the Common wealth and Religion of Fraunce (whereof this booke is but the first part) hath taken no lesse paines to the same ende: and shall profitte in deede no lesse than the trauaile and paine of others, taken that way. For in his Commentaries (beside the godly lessons both concerning doctrine and manners, and otherwise) are conteined manye notable examples of Gods great mercyes, in defending and preseruing the Christian professors of his name in Fraunce in extreme perils, and also diuers experimentes of his seuere iudgements in ouerthrowing the cruel tyrants, and in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing

the persecuters. In consideration wherof, I thought is good to translate the same into our English toung, both for that I thought it should generally profit our countreymen, (and not those alone which vnderstand the Latin toung, as your worship doth:) and also for that I thoughte it a meete occasion, wherby I might testifie my good will and meaning towardes your worship, for the freendly inclination and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse to benefit me, that I haue heretofore found in you. Desiring you to accept the dedicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof, though not for the worthinesse of the thing giuen, yet as a sure testimonie of such a well willing mynd, as by this which he here presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, declareth what he would do, if he had any thing of more price to giue: and also to suffer my trauaile to passe forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your fauourable protection and garde, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profitte of our countreymen, and the glory of God, who send you long life, increase of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the perfect felicitie of the life to come.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat a great businesse and much adoe there was of late yeares for Religion; &amp; that in the Kingdome of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> there is no man but he knoweth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea all men sée the same to be such that it ought with diligence to be Cronicled for euer: and to be sent to the borderers of the vtmost part of the earth for all posterities. But he which hath taken this labour in hand of good will, desireth earnestly that it may generally take effect and turne to the profit of all men. For (so farre as I know) there is nothing extant to be read, but certaine writings which were put forth and set abrode, as the matter required, and certaine Commentaries in the French to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>gue: and if there be any thing, it is so obscurely written that the same of all men can not be vnderstoode.</p>
                  <p>And truly there are certaine reasons which stayed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my men of great wisedome and experience in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from that publique writing. For who, not knowing as yet what would come to passe, dare take vppon him to set foorth openly a whole Tragedie or Comedie, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest daunger to loose his labour, or at the least to séeme to lose it? Furthermore, who séeth not, that it is a thing at this time full of perill, and procuring enuie and displeasure? And beside all this, such laboure at this time séemeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most vnprofitable. For those matters are as yet freshe in memorie, and more sensibly felt of a great manie, than were to be wished, and are noysed abroade by others in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Nations. To conclude, this thing séemeth almost hurt full.</p>
                  <p>For when as these controuersies haue ben stirred vp tho rough diuers opinions of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which controuersies burst
<pb facs="tcp:27102:4"/>
forth into so great perturbations and troubles, the rehersall now of these thinges, shall not only séeme pernicieus, but also vntimely and out of order. The which also séeme to bée other causes which haue discouraged learned men (who no doubt did diligently note and marke the reasons and falling out of those matters, which wonderfully hapned in these our dayes) from labouring to set forth this history. For either the hast is vnprofitable, or else the vntimely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth ridiculous, of this so spéedie &amp; vnseasonable labor</p>
                  <p>Therfore least any man should thinke that it is our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to write and sette foorthe a iust and true Historie of the state of the Churche of Fraunce: wée giue to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that it is neyther our purpose, nor yet agréeing to the time. Howbeit, hereafter more copions and plentifull woorkes of better learned menne, so soone as the troubles and lettes of these times bée taken awaye, will come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade: and will also committe to those that shall come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a perfecte and full memoriall and Chronicle of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>Let this now bée our beginning and entrance, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine declaration of a greater worke: that we may shewe some part of that large and ample argument: and that we may reduce into these Commentaries a certaine Uiew of the seuerall times of our Churches, both that we may stirre vp such of greater learning and experience, as may happily hereafter take this matter in hand more fully to handle the same: and also that in the meane time wee may giue some fast of the greatest matters to Christian men, desirous to know the truth of this thing, and to men of forreine nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bewayling our estate and condition.</p>
                  <p>And in these thrée first Bookes of our Commentaries, we set forth vnto the reader, the first beginnings of the Church of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> béeing as yet but of tender yeares as it were, and in the fire, or at least wise, euen now by little and little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <pb facs="tcp:27102:4"/>Let the causes of the hatred and debate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by these very few things be considered, with the which the Bishop of Romes men so outragiously &amp; vniustly are inflamed against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith full, &amp; against the cause of the faithfull. We must not looke here to haue a description of the faithfull and professours of Christ, in armes, (as our aduersaries doe nowe obiect vnto vs) but rather of the vnarmed &amp; naked members of Christ most cruelly afflicted, onely for this cause, bicause they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the true and pure doctrin of the Gospell now a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before the auncient customes &amp; traditions of men. The naked Church in time past was vexed, and the Gospell dyd run as it were through the sides of poore men, and broughte them to death: then Christians were accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted as lyers, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led heretikes, and by al maner of meanes vexed &amp; oppressed, then were they cast in prisons and in bonds, then were they whipped, then suffered they proscriptions and banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, yea and cruell deathes, without fauour.</p>
                  <p>But nowe when it pleased the omnipotent God to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynte vnto his Church a more clears and beautiful estate, and to qualifie and quenche those fierce fyres, Sathan not forgetting hys olde subtilties and sleightes, deuiseth a new accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whispering into the eares of kings, that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell will plucke their Scepters out of their handes: and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the faithfull throughout the whole kingdom of <hi>France</hi> defende their libertie graunted vnto them by the Kings E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictes, and by all lawfull causes, with force of armes, a new crime is nowe layde to their charge, namely Sedition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and treason to the king and country: &amp; these crimes are obiected agaynste the godly, by those which (abusing the Kings name and authoritie to exercise their own tirannie) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>By these beginnings it shall euidently appéere how obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

the Faithful haue bene alwayes to their Princes and Magistrates: that this thing béeyng layde as it were the foundation, it may plainly be séene who they be, which are the true authours of so many troubles as haue flowed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough this whole kingdome.</p>
                  <p>God truely hath armed and fortified his Churche at thys daye with many externall helpes and fortresses: yet for all that, the cause is not chaunged: Christe is the selfe same Christe still, the Gospell is not chaunged, but it is the selfe same Gospell, whiche was vnreuerently handled and dealt withall in the persons of the Faithfull, by the sharpe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishementes of the wicked. The Faithfull are the same men still in obeying their Magistrates, and in reuerencing their Princes that they were before. But they are rebells whiche abusing the name and authoritie of Princes, and disloyally violating all Lawe persecute the Churche, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to extinguish the Gospel, and as if they were Giants, furiously fight with God.</p>
                  <p>And by the reading of these Commentaries, the Fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full shall finde many things which they maye applye vnto themselues, to stay and comfort themselues in the middest of these troubles.</p>
                  <p>In these lamentable tymes, manye daungers of moste greuous calamities do compasse vs on euery side, many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and newe troubles do dayly burst forth also: But if we consider &amp; weigh the times paste, we shall in very déede haue a gesse nowe, what wil come to passe hereafter in our tyme. For séeing God hath afore time sette and placed hys Churche in a straunge and wonderfull order: We maye gather, that the same God being a perpetuall keper and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of his seruauntes, will applie his power and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to dispatche vs out of these our troubles: the whiche is a most firme and inuincible argument.</p>
                  <p>Let vs call to remembrance the thicke mistes and darke cloudes of the former night: let vs sette before oure eyes in
<pb facs="tcp:27102:5"/>
what state the Church was in the dayes of <hi>Francis,</hi> the first, <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and <hi>Francis</hi> the second. All thinges were then full of feare. Infinite kindes of punnishmentes, and paynes were layde vppon the Church, as banishmentes, proscriptions, and burninges: Then no man durst so much as name the Gospell, without he would be counted a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest heritike: Fewe men or none, and that of the meaner sort, when they were in their secret corners, durst not once mutter of the Gospell: men coulde not then enioy the libertie of the Gospell, except they woulde willinglye ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe themselues their countrey, and wander into foreine Nations.</p>
                  <p>But who will not merueile herevppon at the issue and end of those afflictions? Looke what thinges were then harde of a fewe, did openly ringe in the eares of all men: Looke what things were reiected in some places, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished, were publikely receiued of the greatest part of men: yea there were many of the Nobles which sealed that doctrine with their bloud.</p>
                  <p>By the deathes of Kyngs, the Gospell had passage, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was gotten, Triumphe was made, and within fewe dayes, the Gospell went through the greatest parte of the Kyngdome, by open sermons, by publique Disputations, where most men were assembled together, so that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell had gotten many and singular witnesses.</p>
                  <p>The places which had séene the tormenting fyres and ashes of the Faithfull before, sawe now great assemblies and multitudes of the Faythfull gathered together to heare the worde of God: and the Kynges Edictes which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together made for the hurt and destruction of the faythfull, were at the last, for all that the aduersaries could doe, made to preserue the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>To be short, these Commentaries did bring to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce and consideration, such wonderfull and straunge matters (the like wherof wée our selues haue not
<pb facs="tcp:27102:6"/>
safely séene) that by the prosperous and happye issue and ende of these perturbations, we oughte to conceyue a sure and vndoubted hope. The matter was then tryed by fyre: but now by force of armes: he which quenched the flamyng fires by the death and destruction of those whiche were fully purposed vtterly to ouerthrow and destroy the Churche, the same Lord of hostes &amp; graund Captain of battailes shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and order these warres to the libertie and peace of his seruants. Therfore the examples of those things which wer done in time past, do plentifully shew, that whatsoeuer shall happen at the length (which in déede is not to be measured by humane reason) shall fall out for our health and welfare: and that bicause God will not leaue his worke vnperfected. Wherefore I truste it is euident by the consideration of the things which are set foorth in this Booke, what great profite shal come to those whom the boisterous waues of these tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests haue touched. And bicause this is not a priuate matter neither appertaineth to euery one man, but common to the whole Church of God dispersed throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world, we think also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the manifest &amp; true knowlege of these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is loked for of many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of forein nations, &amp; that the first beginnings of those things in these our Commentaries shal not be read of them without some frute. Neither do we dout but that many when they haue gotten peace and tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie after troubles, will behold our miseries, not as thoughe thei themselues were quite out of danger of the like, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued with the féeling of our afflictions, will truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile our estate. For whose sake also we haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these things in Latin, that they by some means at the least, may be generally vnderstoode of all those which séeke the glorye of God, and the preseruation of his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherfore we trust if we be accused of rashnes, as though we had vnaduisedly set forth these things which should haue bin deferred till more conuenient and better occasions, wée haue to answere for our selues, and to make vs cleare from that faulte. For if in a matter commendable and deseruing

It shal be no reproch or shame to vs at all, that there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers of a learned &amp; perfect story. But this is the summe of our whole desire, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very truth of those things which were done in Fraunce for religion, might be knowne to all men, as, what is the goodnesse of the cause of the Faithfull and true churches, and what is the iniquitie and iniustice of their aduersaries.</p>
                  <p>Let al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know for a suretie that the Churches of France are not guiltie of sedition and rebellion, but are so called by the enimies of the truth and pure doctrine, for defending the libertie of the Gospell. Let all men know, that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes of faithfull Christians, being spoyled of their goodes, haue, like banished me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, forsaken their houses and countrey: let them knowe that by warre, and by other meanes, they haue become true martyrs, and by the fraude and deceyte of the Antichristian Guyses, are dayly martyred, who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating and breaking the moste strayte lawe and faith of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, haue abused the kings name and authoritie to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their tirannie and wickednesse. To be shorte, let al men know that Fraunce is falne into these ciuil wars through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wickednesse of aliens, not through the fault of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer (gentle Reader, whiche desirest to be satisfyed in the truth) we testifie and affirme thus muche for our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, that we haue written all things truly, simply, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, without anye manner of parcialitie: not gathering any thing by rumours or reportes, but by certaine and vndoubted arguments: in so much that we are not afrayde to appeale to those that are yet alyue, as too eye witnesses, yea and to the very time it selfe.

what other persecutions there were also: among which<note place="margin">The tumult of Ambaxian.</note> persecutions, how the tumult of <hi>Ambaxian</hi> chaunced, the causes and effectes whereof shall be declared.

                  <p>But while the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was straitly imprisoned, and his death a preparing, we will shew, howe the sodeine death of king <hi>Fraunces</hi> the seconde happened, to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masing<note place="margin">Sodeine alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the death of king Fraunces.</note> and grieuance of the <hi>Guises.</hi>

But these first beginnings are particularly touched in other bookes, in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27102:11"/>
which the noble and excellent triumphes of Martyrs are described.</p>
                  <p>I will therfore begin at that yeare since the which, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion being more ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly set forth, and more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently againe resisted, haue more happily and euidently appeared. And then, this was the state of the kingdome.</p>
                  <p>After sundrie and long warres betwéene <hi>Henrie</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde King of Fraunce, and <hi>Charles</hi> the fyfth Emperour, at the length both their Legates, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they could not by peace ende the controuersies, which were betwéene them, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a truce or peace for fyue yeares, the which being shortly after broken by the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> the warre began a freshe betwene the two kings. And <hi>Fraunces</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> taketh his iourney into <hi>Italie</hi> with a great armye. And <hi>Philip</hi> king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and sonne of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> goeth into <hi>Picardie:</hi> who making hast to the towne of <hi>Sanquintine,</hi> gaue the Constable (which came out to mete him) a great ouerthrow, and toke him with a great number of Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>This ouerthrowe and great slaughter of men was called <hi>Laurence day,</hi> bicause it chaunced at the feast of S. <hi>Laurence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> After this, <hi>Sanquintine</hi> was taken, and certaine cities nere vnto the same. So that what with the rumor of the sodeine slaughter, &amp; what with the feare of the enimie which now approched to <hi>Paris</hi> the chiefe citie of the kingdome, all men were wonderfully afrayde.</p>
                  <p>While these things were thus a working, there began to be a great fame and rumor of the increase of the <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> by reason whereof there followed a notable persecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, which by the popular and vulgar name is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The winning of S.

in prison. For théeues and murtherers, and such as by the lawe deserued to die, were taken out of their colde and noysome prisons, and these men put into the same in their steade, all men forbidden to haue any recourse vnto them. Notwithstanding, it was brought to passe by the singular prouidence of God, bicause euery man could not haue a priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by himself, that some of them were thrust togither into one priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; so it came to passe that one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiued comfort of another, in somuch that the prison in the which they were, sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with the prayers &amp; Psalmes vttered &amp; song by them.</p>
                  <p>But to make these men the more to be hated, diuers ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors were euery where spred, namely that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Lutherans</hi> did assemble themselues togither in the night, and being on a heape togither without candle light, did fulfill their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring lusts one with another, killed their yong infants, and committed other wickednesses. The Monkes, they made exclamation of this thing in euery place, to inflame the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to reuenge the same. And not only the common sort of people were stayed with these rumors, but the same also of these things came eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the eares of the Péeres of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm,<note place="margin">Wicked slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders deuised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the faithfull.</note> in so much that one of the Inquisitors, or Commissioners, durst auouch before the King, that Tables spred, and great prouision of daintie cheare was founde in that place, where the faythfull had assembled themselues. The which report, so inflamed the Kings minde, that he sought nothing more than the destruction of the faithfull: yea, and the mindes of all men did so boyle in hatred against them, that he thought himselfe to excell that coulde best conspire the death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>At the last a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement was giuen by the king, that some méete man should be chosen to knowe &amp; consider their causes which were taken. Nowe at <hi>Paris</hi> there was a Magistrate, a Citizen called <hi>Munerius,</hi> a man (as it was commonlye reported) verye apt for all maner of fraude and deceyte. At thys time this <hi>Munerius</hi> was as a Batte

Notwithstanding, to this man this office was committed. And bicause by this meanes he hoped to haue pardon, and shoulde be restored to his former dignitie he was so forward in his businesse, that within fewe dayes, many of their causes which were taken prisoners, were brought to haue sentence and iudgement. In the meane time, those reliques which remayned behinde of that vaste and great shipwracke of the faithfull, were cast into great distresse and sorrowe, notwithstanding, they thought it not good to faynt or quayle in those extremities. For they which were the chiefe gouernours of the Church, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout euery mans house, exhorted euery one to be of good chéere, &amp; perswaded that nothing had happened without the singuler prouidence of God, by which also it came to passe, that many escaped that daunger: moreouer, they sayd that they remained to defende the other partes of the Church which were left: and that this calamitie shoulde not be the ruine and quite ouerthrow of the Church: and on the other side, that the same is the waye to increase and inlarge the Church, which God both by his word hath shewed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by experience approued, for the gathering togither of the Church. And thus when they had exhorted and comforted one another, and had committed themselues and all things else to the prouidence of God, first of al they appoynted that in euery house there should be extraordinary praiers made, and that those fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Therefore they write letters vnto the king, and bring to passe, to haue them caried secretly into the Kings chamber,

by which they ment to pacifie the kings minde, to remooue the same from the euill opinion which it had conceyued of<note place="margin">An apologie for the faithful captiues.</note> them, and to obtaine the hearing of their cause. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in their letters that they are falsly accused and slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with such slaunders as are not newly deuised, <q>but with such as long before had bene obiected agaynst the Church, by which Satan went about to make Kinges and Princes to hate the same: and are now againe put forth by those only which desire to haue the truth oppressed, to the ende they may fréely enioy the riches and goods which they haue vsurped and wrongfully gotten by wicked deceit. And that be ought to séeke to haue sure and vndoubted proues of euery matter, specially in businesse of so great weight. For if it were sufficient to condemnation to accuse, who shoulde then escape an innocent? Wherfore, if he would vouchsafe diligently to search out the truth of this matter, it shoulde well appeare that they assembled themselues togither for no other ende and purpose, than to praye vnto God for his prosperitie and the peace of the kingdome. Also that their doctrine did not maintaine sedition, neyther was an enimye to the obedience of Magistrates: the which thing they had alway hitherto shewed, neuer refusing to obey, although they were many in number, when they were euill intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, onely for following the worde of God. And that thys was their onely desire, that Christ might appeare to be the chiefe and heade alone: and that the inuentions of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abrogated, God might be obeyed and serued according to his prescript will. Wherefore, if it woulde please him to vnderstande their cause, he might, if he woulde, make some publike disputation betwéene some one of those that were in prison, and the Sorbonistes or others which might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of those things now in controuersie. In the ende, they doe pray and humbly beséech him that he woulde not suffer the innocencie of good men, their cause not being hearde, to be condemned, séeing that wicked men, and such as do most

                  <p>After this, there was yet another letter sent to the king, the effect wherof was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men did confesse that these cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which the christian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth was vexed, procéeded of the iust iudgement of God, being offended that so many he resies and corruptions shoulde take place: But the greatest offence to consist in this thing, namely, that none of those, to whome the care and charge of the Common welth was committed, had any regarde at all, to discerne heretiques, by the worde of God, from Christian maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the truth.

To what end went the armie of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> when he had serued Gods enimie for hire? went he not to this ende, that when he returned home againe; he might vtterly destroy the Churches of the valleys of <hi>Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monte,</hi> and might so offer and dedicate his victories vnto God?

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus after the repeating of many examples, in the which the iudgements of God did appeare against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduersaries of his truth (whose memory also was yet fresh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heads of al men) this letter at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth: that afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s cannot abolish &amp; destroy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of God, séeing that (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> sayth) <hi>The bloud of Martyrs is the seede of the Church:</hi> and that it is the office of a King to take vpon him the care of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which all men might sée by diuers ways to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated and neglected, &amp; that this might lawfully be done by calling a Councell. In the meane time, that their cause as yet being vnknowne, &amp; not certaine, they may be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, &amp; not cruelly intreated, which protest that they follow Gods truth: and that so holy a name cannot in such wise be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned, but some inquisition must be made: also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be had, not from the deuises of men, but from the worde of God, the only and most certaine rule of truth. Therfore (say they) if we be not conuinced by Gods word, it is neither fire, nor sworde, nor any maner of punishment that can terrifie vs. These shall be the triumph and victorie of our faith, that by being ouercome, we shall be ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers at the last: by this Chariote, we shall come at the length to the hauen of euerlasting lyfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:27102:15"/>But that Edict which was made at <hi>Cast ellobrian</hi> (of the which we haue made mention before) was very straite and cruell against Religion, in the which, among many things these were the speciall sentences: <q>First, that all former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictes concerning the putting of heretiques to death, should be confirmed: That no man shoulde be admitted to anye publike office, before he had made his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession agréeable to the Catholike and Romishe faith: That in euery Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the thirde moneth also, there shoulde be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies made, which are commonly called <hi>Mercuriales:</hi> and that first of all, matters concerning Religion shoulde be handled, and that there shoulde be speciall regarde and eye had to the assembly of the Parliament, least some corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or heresie might secretly créepe in.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was also another Apologie set forth for all men to vse, so written, that the auncient forme and state of the Church being represented, and compared to that which is at this day, the auncient fathers themselues also by their own wordes and writings, might defend and maintaine the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye selfe and same cause which they nowe defended: and in such wise, that they which sayde, that they reuerenced and embraced antiquitie, might heare antiquitie defending and supporting the cause of the reformed Church (so called.)</p>
                  <p>These things truly, are plentifully set forth in this wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but the summe is this: <q>That it was against right, that the faithfull shoulde be accused for well doing: but more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious, that they should be condemned, their cause not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard. Notwithstanding, that the Church of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time long since, had felt the same iniuries: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no maruaile, if they, whose cause was like, were made equall to them in trouble: Howbeit, that Sathan and his Ministers shoulde so little preuaile, that for all their force, the Church shoulde arriue through the midst of their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to the safe and quiet hauen: and the thicke and dark Clowdes being blowne ouer, the light of innocencie should

appeare, and the enimies of the same be founde lyers.</q> After this, those slaunders and reproches which were obiected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, being particularly examined and considered by them, were also fully aunswered altogither out of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers, that their Apologie or defence myght plainly appeare to be true and sounde. Furthermore, many letters were written to the brethren which were in prison, yea, and Churches of farre Countries, bewayling their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, did comfort them with their letters: so that hereby they were wondefrully confirmed. And among other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or congregations, the congregation of <hi>Geneua</hi> shewed the dutie of the faithfull brethren, insomuch that they did not let, by all meanes possible, to doe them good.</p>
                  <p>While those things were prouided for of the faithful, the aduersaries on the contrarie part sought by all meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to worke the death of the faithfull which were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so soone as they coulde: and in this matter <hi>Munerius</hi> the ciuill Magistrate was not a little diligent, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for their part gréedily gaped, and continually looked for the same. Now, there came forth a commaundement from the King, that all other matters set apart, for a time the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate shoulde wholy applye themselues to vnderstande the cause of the faithfull, and to iudge of them according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence that shoulde be brought against them by <hi>Munerius</hi> the eiuill <hi>Praetor.</hi> Notwithstanding, the Kings commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement herein, the whole Senate or assembly of the Court refusing and reiecting this <hi>Munerius,</hi> both for that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode the auncient custome of the Court, and also bicause (as is before sayde) he was accused of falshoode, concluded that by the relation and report of anye one man which shoulde come forth and giue euidence, the iudgement and sentence of those Iudges that were put in trust, shoulde be ordered.

The which thinges, bicause they be specially touched in another Booke, it shall not be néedefull here to speake any more of them.</p>
                  <p>Many deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues from death by diuers meanes and wayes that were not lawfull.

This thing for a time stayed the rage of the persecution. Notwithstanding, the king being certified hereof, sendeth letters, by which he declaring those refusals to be nothing, commaundeth that all other things set apart, they giue their diligence only to intende vpon this thing: and that the Nobles which were in authoritie, should choose out, according as they thought good, Counsellours to supplie the places of those that were absent: and that in the <hi>

These letters did againe displease and anger the mindes of those iudges, which tooke it heynously y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were refused. So that choller was then set on fire against many: &amp; for this cause séemed as though it would rage and burne in the new yeare following. For the aduersaries went about of late to<note place="margin">Anno domini. 1558.</note> establish &amp; bring in the like inquisition that was in Spain,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27102:16"/>
(which they thought was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only way vtterly to ouerthrow the gospel) &amp; letters at the last being obtained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope, by which thrée Cardinals were appointed chief inquisitors, they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about all that they could to set forward this deuise. The king for his part consented. Notwithstanding, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> hauing better consideration of the matter, greatlye withstode this new practise, &amp; alleaged these causes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of their withstanding and prohibition, saying: If this thing should be brought to passe, looke how much the power of the ecclesiasticall Iudges and Inquisitors should be enlarged, so much should y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supreme authoritie of the king be diminished: Secondly, that it was a matter of great weight, for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall subiects of the king, to be made destitute, and after a sort, depriued of their King, and to be brought to the power of forreine Iudges, and to be made subiect to an Offy<hi rend="sup">•</hi>ciall or Inquisitor: Thirdlye, that it shoulde be a defrauding of the kingdome, but specially of the subiectes, to be spoyled of the helpe &amp; safegarde of the king, and to be themselues, and all their goodes, iudged &amp; disposed, after the supreme iudgement of an ecclesiasticall Iudge: Fourthly, that it would come to passe, that when they had gotten infinite power, and the greatest part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings authoritie, that is to say, when they had gotten power to iudge of life &amp; death as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> listed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further appeale to any higher Court, they might easily abuse their offices. For (say they) the libertie to appeale, is the onely sanctuarie and defence of innocencie: Fiftly and last of all, they say that the King to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the appeale should be made, is the reuenger, and the defender of violated and wronged innocencie, and that, iniurie shoulde be done, if this thing went forward, not only to the people, but also to Princes, to Dukes, to Nobles, yea, and to the Kings nere kinsemen, who also shoulde be bounde with this bonde.</p>
                  <p>By this prohibition and resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the matter was delayed for a time: at the length, when the Kings Court was at <hi>Paris,</hi> the verye same aduersaries of the truth brought to

passe that those letters were confirmed of the King, as he went to the Senate or Parliament, for this cause.</p>
                  <p>Thus when they had gotten the lawe into their owne handes, and had written new Edictes, appointing mortall punishments for the faithfull, (whome they called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, Sectaries, and such lyke) euery man looking now for grieuous persecutions, it pleased God for a time to disappoint those cruell practises and threatenings, by trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the kingdome with warre and other businesse.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it to be buried in silence, by what meanes God shewed his vengeaunce vpon many of those persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors<note place="margin">Certayne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance shewed vppon diuers persecutors of the Church.</note> which were the chiefe Capitaynes in S. <hi>Iames</hi> slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That <hi>Munerius</hi> the <hi>Praetor</hi> which was the first that delt with the causes of the faithfull, and had many wayes cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated them: being afterwarde at the length condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of falshoode in the cause of the Countesse of <hi>Senigana,</hi> suffered by the decrée of the Senate punishment openly in diuers places: and being thus ledde from place to place to be made an open spectacle for all men to behold to his great infamie and reproch, was also banished his countrie. This man while be was kept in prison, sayde, that he knew that the punishments which he suffered, were a iust reward and recompence to him for his euill intreating of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes:</hi> and that he woulde neuer after séeke to do them any harme. In like maner one of the Counsellers which were appoynted to vnderstande and iudge of the causes of the faithfull, not long after died by sodaine death. Another of them likewise being sodenly striken with a most grieuous sickenesse, and being also at the poynt of death, sayde, <hi>I see plainly that I haue grieuously sinned against the Lutheranes, which so godly pray vnto the Lorde.</hi> In lyke maner, two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whiche were very cruell against the faithfull in the slaughter that was made on S. <hi>Iames</hi> daye, sodenly dyed in the sight of all men.

                  <p>There was then present a certaine noble man, who was appoynted by the Kings commaundement to presse and muster men for the warre: this man admonisheth the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop into what perils he may bring the Citie, the Englishe

men their enimies approching neare, who, if they had knowledge of these troubles, might easily obtaine the Cuie: but his perswasion preuailed so little, that he was also in daunger of his life, and hardly deliuered himselfe from the mad rage of the common people. Therefore the franticke people through euery corner of the Citie, are as it were drunken mad by the guidance and leading of the Bishop: and doe besiege and forciblye set vpon the houses, in the which there were ninetéene of the faithfull congregated to make their prayers vnto God. But the faithfull earnestlye beseech the people to be quiet, and if there were any thing to be obiected against them, they were ready to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into the hands of the magistrate: The Bishop aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth that the cause of their comming was onely to haue the Minister, which they knewe to be among them. The faithfull intreate that the Magistrate of the Citie might be called forth, and he shoulde vnderstande the truth of the matter. When the <hi>Praetor</hi> or Magistrate of the Citie had entred the houses, and made diligent search through the same, he declareth that the Minister is not there. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Bishop commaundeth the souldiers to set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and assault the houses: the which thing the people did with all the force they were able to make, seeking also to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the houses. But all in vaine: for the faithfull that were in the houses, affirmed that vnlesse they woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, they would driue them away. And thus they being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dismayed or troubled, commended themselues vnto God in Psalmes and songs. The Bishop hereat being more angry, commaundeth them to yéelde themselues: the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full refused not to come forth to him, if the people might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, saying that they were ready to make answere to those thinges whereof they were accused. But for all this the gunnes and other instrumentes of warre were set to, and bent against the houses. The faythfull séeing into what straytes and extremities they were brought, thought nowe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27102:18"/>
within themselues, that there was no remedie but that they must defende themselues: but bicause it coulde not be done without great slaughter of the people, if they did rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye fall to offer strypes, they thought it good not so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende themselues vntill the verye extremitie came. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, when the people ranne with haste into the houses through the holes of the walles which they had made with Gunnes and other weapons, the faythfull shotte at them with Crossebowes, by force whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them being stayne, the myndes of the other were so discouraged, that by and by the whole multitude ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, and great quietnesse was made throughout the whole Citie.</p>
                  <p>They therefore being thus miraculouslye deliuered, came forth singing the hundreth and foure and twentye Psalme, as they went through the middest of the Citie, and so escaped. The next daye following, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered togither againe, ouerthrewe those houses in the which the faythfull had bene, yea, and their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses also whome they suspected to bée fauourers of their cause. The Bishoppe vnderstanding that the Senate of <hi>Paris</hi> dislyked of this his facte, went to the King, and brought it so to passe by the meanes of them that were companiens and confederates wyth him in the same hys wicked furo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, that the King allowed all that he had done. So lyttle was the equitie of the cause of the faythfull estéemed.</p>
                  <p>And very neare about this time also there séemed to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a newe occasion to scirre vp affliction. For at <hi>Paris</hi> in a medowe or fielde nere adioyning to the same, commonly called the Clearks field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many of the faithfull, when others were busie at their sport and playe, began to sing Psalmes, little thinking that others would be stirred vp to do the like by their ensample. Notwithstanding, at the length it grewe to this, that when this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exercise had bene vsed certayne
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27102:19"/>
dayes, many, and men also of great estimation and fame, came togither to heare the swéete and pleasant harmonie of the singing multitude. They which coulde not sing, and which had not as yet the knowledge of God, went into the most conuenient places of the fielde, to heare that which was soong: and hearing the same, confessed that it was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly done to forbid the singing of so honest &amp; godlie songs. But while this went forwarde, the aduersaries, as though they were vtterly spoyled, went to the king, and declared to him that the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> had mooued sedition at <hi>Paris:</hi> that they were ready to thrust his maiestie out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: that a great number of them were gathered togither in armour to conspire against him: and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested him to prouide for this mischiefe: for (say they) the Catholike Church, and your whole kingdome is in great daunger. When the King heard this, he commaundeth that there be prohibition and stay made by a publike Edict, that men sing no more in that place, nor in that companie: and also that there shoulde be inquirie made of those which had soo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They which were the chiefe of the reformed Church, séeing into what suspitious those companies were brought, giue admonition to their friendes, that they neuer againe gather themselues togither in that place to sing as they did before: if they woulde sing, to sing at h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At the last, when the Bishops preachers saw that the king did fauour them, they perswaded with the people, that it was an atteptable thing vnto God, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious worke (as they call in) for a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:27102:19"/>On a certaine day, after a Sermon, it so fell out, that two men contended togither by wordes in the Churchyarde of S. Innocentes, the one of them, to the ende he might stirre and procure hatred to the other, by a reprochfull and odious name, cried that the people might heare, which were nowe going out of the Church, a <hi>Lutherane,</hi> a <hi>Lutherane:</hi> when the people hearde this, they fell streight way vpon him, and pursued him into the temple, whither at the length he fled as to a sanctuarie and place of refuge. A certaine Noble man by chaunce passing through the Church, with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, who was a Priest, and hearing that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were about to kill a man, ranne in all the haste vnto them, and sought by gentle wordes to turne the mindes of the people from their wicked purpose, that therby he might deliuer the man out of their handes. But a certaine Masse priest crieth out, saying, that he was the man whome they sought for, being one that durst take vpon him to defend a <hi>Lutherane,</hi> at the hearing whereof, the people run vpon the Noble man, vsing violence, and at the first beating him with their fists. The Noble mans brother, which was with him, began to intreate for him: but the people were more vehement and madde, by his intreatie, insomuch that they bring them both violently out of the temple, least it shoulde be defiled with bloude, or prophaned. One of these two, namely the Noble man, being stronger and better able to shift for himselfe than the other, escaped their handes, and fled into the Curates or Parishe Priestes house harde by. The other, which was (as we saide before) a Priest, was not so soone out of the Church, but he was thrust through with a dagger: of the which, he being nowe lyke to die, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vpon Saints, and desireth to be confessed of his sinnes, (whereby it might haue appeared of what religion he was) and at the length being wounded with other strokes, he was quite dispatched of lyse. And yet this stayed not their rage and madnesse: for when he was starke deade, they did
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27102:20"/>
all to bemangle and cut his deade carcas: yea, and some of them thrusting their handes into the gréene woundes, did afterwardes bragge that they had dipped their handes in the bloude. This man being thus dispatched, they beset the house of the Parishe Priest rounde about, least the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brother shoulde escape awaye, being fledde thither (as is sayde before) for succour and defence: saying that they woulde offer the like violence to the Magistrate, yea, and to the King himselfe, if so be he woulde helpe a <hi>Lutherane.</hi> But at the length the night comming, they forsooke their siege, and so the noble man escaped.</p>
                  <p>Not long before this tyme, there happened another thing, which also I thought good here to insert. There was a certayne Sorboniste, or Popishe Doctor, whome men called the <hi>Soule of Picardie:</hi> This fellowe was a famous blower forth and moouer of sedition: being oftentimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye vehement to inflame the people against the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes,</hi> perswading them that it was a verye good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable worke before God, to shedde the bloude of the <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> and that they shoulde no lesse deserue at his handes thereby, than did the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in slaying the Idolatr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>us <hi>Cananaeans:</hi> adding moreouer, that in so doing, the handes of the godly Catholikes should be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and hallowed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as this man on a time, was preaching to the people, a certaine deuout man which canie to heate his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, vpon some occasion, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceite that he had in his mind, laughed vnto his fellow that late next vnto him.

                     </gap>d that there was a <hi>Lutherane</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, which did deride &amp; laugh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preacher to scorne. When the multitude that were there assembled, hearde this, they sodenly start vp, &amp; reasoning no further of the matter, they drew the man out of the temple, &amp; putting forth his eyes, and pashing forth his braynes, most cruelly flew him. These were the fruits of these seditious sermons

preached by the Sorbonistes and Papisticall Doctors. The<note place="margin">The fruites of the sermons of the Papistes.</note> faithfull being thus miserably handled, were accused to the King, and to all the people, of sedition, and were accounted and taken for seditious persons.</p>
                  <p>About this time also, <hi>Andelotius</hi> the brother of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall <hi>Castillion,</hi> or <hi>Sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>e</hi> to <hi>Henrie</hi> King of Fraunce: and <hi>Fraunces</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> going with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to <hi>Thionuilla,</hi> sayde vnto the King, that he did not looke to haue prosperous successe of his armie, if <hi>Andelotius</hi> were Generall of the footemen, which charge in déede was before committed vnto him. When the King hearde this, being desirous to retayne the friendship of the Constable, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth the Admiral <hi>Castillio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> brother to <hi>Andelotius,</hi> and <hi>Marescallus Momorencius,</hi> to perswade <hi>Andelotius,</hi> that he shoulde giue vnto him a reuerent aunswere concerning the Masse. The King (as hée was instructed by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Loraine</hi>) demandeth of <hi>Andelotius,</hi> what he thought of the Masse. To the which question, he answereth fréely, saying: Wheras the Masse is called a sacrifice for the quick &amp; the dead, which only belongeth to the sacrifice of Christ (being once offred for all, and neuer to be offered againe) I think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a detestable Idol fained by the brain &amp; inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men. The King hearing this aunswere, tooke it in very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill part, and being angrye, forbad him his presence, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27102:21"/>
commaunded that he shoulde be put in warde: and another to be made Generall of the footemen in his steade. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the returne home againe of the Constable, <hi>Andelotius</hi> was restored to his former office, and reconciled into the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the King againe.</p>
                  <p>At the length the peace before spoken of, was concluded, betwéene the two Kings, the chiefe and speciall point of the which peace was, that the two Kings should procure forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a generall Councell to be holden, to the rooting vppe and destroying of heresies. It was reported among the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of people, that the Kings made a peace to this end, that they might ioyne in force togither to warre against the <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> who mightilye increased dailye in both their Realmes. They were greatly confirmed in these opinions, by the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and also by <hi>Granuellus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Atrebatensis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly called <hi>Artois</hi> who within a while after was made a Cardinall by the Pope. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the number of the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> newly increased from day to daye, the blame and fault of the which increase was layde vpon the Iudges, and specially vpon the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> as though they had bene to fauourable in their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For the which cause it was apointed that there should be a newe assembly made to consider of the Edict of <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobrian:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Paris.</note> (of the which we haue spoken before, and that they shoulde first of all deale with matters concerning religion. The company therfore being asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bled &amp; called togither, the Kings Solicitor propounded vnto them these matters: First, that there were diuers opinions in matters that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Religion, founde lately in the Senate, disagréeing and contrarie one to another: as, when lome condemned heretikes to be burnt, other some woulde not haue them to be burnt, but mittigated the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ne by banishment: the which woulde redounde to the reproche and shame of the Senate: Wherefore he required that their sentences and iudgements might be conformable and agréeing euer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27102:21"/>
with the prescript and tenure of the Edictes which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the punishments of death. The which in déede was the most speedie and readie way to detect those Iudges that were suspected of religion, as after truly it came to passe. For when euery man fréely vttred his minde and opinion, as the custome is, there were diuers iudgementes: some woulde haue no punishment by death, but banishment: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some, before any thing was determined, woulde haue it knowne whether they were heretikes in déede, which were counted heretikes. Also he sayd that it was the Kings will that heretikes shoulde be punished: and the office of the Senate to sée and finde out who they were that were guiltye of heresie. And for this cause he willed them to make supplication vnto the King, that according to the first article of the peace concluded, he woulde cause a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Councell to be assembled, to iudge of these contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies: and that they shoulde in the meane time leaue off to punishe. But some sayde that it coulde not be hidde, but was apparant for all men to beholde what greate corruptions had inuaded the Church, and howe néedefull and requisite it was, a reformation to be had, and that by the worde of God, which is the onely rule of veritie, and not custome, antiquitie, or the opinions of men. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they added, that there was daunger, and therefore great héede to be taken, least while they (whome they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lutheranes</hi>) were condemned, Innocentes also shoulde be put to death. For (say they) the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> (as we terme them) haue probable reasons to defend their doctrine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: whose life is irreprouable, and without blame, vsing themselues oftentimes to praye deuoutly and zealously to God, as it hath well appeared to the Senate: to be short, such is their constancie, that thereby they shew themselues not to be such maner of men as they are sayde to be, among the common sort of people. Thus at this time, some spake one thing, some another: howbeit, the greatest part, would
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27102:22"/>
haue either the punishment to be mittigated, or else the men to be quite discharged. Many feared least this sentence and determination of those that spake in the behalfe of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theranes,</hi> shoulde take place: wherevpon two of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell (as it is credibly reported) namely <hi>Egidius</hi> and <hi>Minar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> went to the King, and declared the matter wholy vnto him, before the Court had concluded what shoulde be done (against both lawe and auncient custome) saying vnto him that the matter was nowe come to such a straite, that great remedie must be prouided for the same, otherwise great perturbations and trouble would ensue: adding moreouer, that the boldenesse of some was such, that they durst arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly deride the auncient religion, and as for the Edicts of the King, they made no account of them at all.</p>
                  <p>The King being inflamed and greatly stirred with this newes, came the next day into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> senate: where he declared that he hauing now obtained at the handes of God, the most excellent benefit of peace, &amp; confirmed the same with the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie &amp; sure knot of matrimonie, there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted yet one thing which he greatly desired, namely, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> setting of matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning religion, in a good &amp; vniforme order: &amp; for this cause he said that he came into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, namely to vnderstand, both in what state the matter stoode, &amp; also to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort &amp; incourage them by his presence. And so he signified by the kéeper of the seales, that he would haue them to follow that order which they had begon, in shewing their opinions. Therefore of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which resisted, some were more colde, fearing some subtill practise to be in hand, other som notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> spake their fantasies and opinions, with no lesse boldnesse than they did before, especially concerning the lawfull calling of a Cru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel or Parliament.

                  <p>But now when the most excellent and famous Princes Protestantes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> vnderstoode of the great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and intollerable afflictions layde vpon the faithfull for the Gospels sake: they sent their Ambassadours wyth their charge and letters vnto the King, beséeching him that he woulde inhibite and staye those grieuous persecutions: of the which their letters, this was the effect and summe as followeth.</p>
                  <p>When they vnderstoode and weyed with themselues,<note place="margin">The summe of the letters of the Princes of Germanie sent to the King.</note> that men in all ages, estates, and times, suffered imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bondes for professing the doctrine of the Gospell, which is contrarie to those superstitions which are of the most part obserued: and that for the same cause onely, they were extréemely punished both in body and goodes: <q>they also knowing themselues to be members of the same heade Christ with them, whome they hearde to be so cruelly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27102:23"/>
and being perswaded, that they were bounde in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to helpe them so much as they might: they thought good for these causes to sende their Ambassadours vnto the King with those letters.</q> 
                  </p>
                  <q>And that the King might not thinke that the matter is not throughly considered off of them, they signifie vnto him that they knowe for a suretie, that those men which were restrained from their libertie, did maintaine or defende no seditious opinions, nor any thing else that is contrary to the true and Apostolicall articles of the Christian faith. And bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they themselues did take no lesse labour and paine than the King himselfe, to roote out and abolishe all those things which were against the glorie of God, and did onely desire to defende the true inuocation of his holy name, and the syncere doctrine of the Catholike Church, contained in the writings of the Prophetes, Apostles, and Fathers: and also did seuerely punishe the maintainers of false doctrine, and men of impure and vnhonest lyfe: and to be short, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they themselues did acknowledge and worship one God, as the hyest and Lorde of all: these were the causes which had moued them to write those letters of intreatie, for the releasing of those captiues out of miserie, whose do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they knewe to be farre from all falshoode, heresie, and sebitious opinions: the which thing might euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their confession, the which they sent vnto the King to that ende: There is no man but he will confesse that many corruptions are crept into the Church, and haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled, partly by error, and partly by couetousnesse, to roote out the which (saye they) that diuers good and godly men haue taken great paine of late: and that not long since also, certaine vertuous and singular learned men in the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>VVilliam</hi> of <hi>
                        <hi>Paris,</hi> Gersone, VVestelus,</hi> and others, had done the like: and also that they themselues haue reformed errours in their dominions, for the which, they are not a little ioyfull: Moreouer, that his father king
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27102:24"/>
                     <hi>Frances</hi> of happie memorie, a Prince of singular wisedome and vertue, purposed to haue made the like reformation, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing herein the examples of his auncelors the Kings of Fraunce, who woulde oftentimes themselues finde out the controuersies that happened in the Church: The which waye he ought to followe in ending these matters, rather than to suffer the crueltie of manye against their brethren and his subiectes: assuring himselfe of this, that he shoulde so smallye preuayle in suppressing the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, by those sharpe and cruell punishments, that contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the bloude which was shed for the same, shoulde be the séede more and more dailye to increase the number of christians: and furthermore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by this meanes, namely, by shedding of bloude, he shoulde haue the greatest part of his faithfull subiectes cut from him. Eeside all this, that God doth threaten to take vengeaunce of the bloude of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentes vniustly shedde, and will seuerely punishe those which shall reiect the perfect knowledge of his doctryne and truth. Moreouer, they signifie vnto the King in their letters, that they did of late sue vnto him, and require the selfe same thing of him that they doe nowe, by their letters then, and Ambassadours also, and were almost perswaded by his aunswere againe that he woulde neuer more suffer the miserable Christians so to be afflicted and appressed with those iniuries: Notwithstanding, that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode that the same affliction, by all maner of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was as great in his kingdome, as euer it had bene before. Insomuch, that in this poynt they did greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle, (so much as Christian Charitie required) the state and condition of his good and faythfull subiectes, who for this cause were onely afflicted, for that they followed that doctrine which they retayned sure and firme in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and in the which they grounded their fayth: The which wonderfully grieued them, not onely bicause they sawe that it was preiudiciall and hurtfull to them, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27102:24"/>
chiefly bicause they perceyued the glorie of the most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God to be defaced, and as it were derided. And bicause Charitie with the which his subiects were beloued of men, did prouoke them also to wishe their peace and tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and aboue all things to desire that the King might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue himselfe in that thing which appertained to the glorye of God and soules health, that he might not prouoke the wrath of God against him: they most hartily beseech hym that he woulde prudentlye expende and weigh all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of this facte: and specially that he woulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the causes why his miserable subiectes shoulde be so greatly troubled: and that he woulde endeuour himselfe that the Church of God might be pourged from all these corruptions with the which it had bene a long time conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and infected: in so doing he shoulde satisfie the honest desire of a great number in this poynt. And bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he coulde not come to the knowledge of those things which were of so great weyght, without the hearing of the iudgementes of godlye learned men, they perswaded him so call vnto hym out of hande, men expert in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and desirous of Gods glorie, after the ensample of his Elders, by whome the matters nowe in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie might be vprightlye and peaceably decided and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the rule of holye Scripture. Also, that whyle these thinges were in hande, and vntill it were fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of the matters in controuersie, his subiectes which followe the doctrine agréeing to their confession which latelye they defended, might go vntroubled, and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned to doe anye thyng agaynste their conscience: that nothing myght bée deuysed to put them in peryll of lyfe and goodes: and that they whiche were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, myght bée sette at libertie. To conclude, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that they perceyue that their earnest requestes shall no lesse preuayle with him, than the cryings and importunitie of the aduersaries of the truth hath done.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27102:25"/>
The which, if it come to passe according to their expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he shall fulfill the commaundement of the sonne of God, who specially committeth his Church, which he hath redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his most precious bloude to Princes: &amp; also shall shewe great mercie and compassion, and be very beneficiall towardes his subiectes, if so be he woulde giue them leaue to inuocate and worship God aright. In reknowledging whereof, they testifie themselues to be ready, and vpon this condicion, will constantly avide for euer the Kinges friendes.</q>

But notwithstanding, the Ambassadours of the Princes were as yet scarcely departed, but that the fire of persecution, which séemed to be extinguished before, by their comming, burned the faithfull a freshe, Moreouer, the<note place="margin">Annas Burgae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us examined, condemned, and iudged to dye.</note> causes of those Counsellers, who (as we sayd before) were taken in the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> came now in question.

And among others, the Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Demochares</hi> the Inquisitor were chosen for this purpose: the which Iudges when <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeus</hi> refused, desiring that he might be iudged of the whole felowship and assemblie of the Senate, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and accustomed lawe of the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> he was commaunded by the Kings letters patents to aunswere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those iudges. The which letters when he had hearde them red, he affirmed, that for obedience sake to the King, he woulde aunswere, otherwise he woulde haue made no
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27102:25"/>
aunswere at all: therefore, they demaunding of him, he made aunswere to all those principall points of Popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which are at this day in controuersis: as to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Church, to inuocation of Saints, to Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to the Masse, and to the rest. All the which he dislyking and gaynsaying, was at the last condemned by the Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> for an heretike: and bicause he had taken certayne orders (as they call them) the same Bishop giueth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement that he shoulde be disgraded, and so giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the secular power.</p>
                  <p>The which sentence as it was falslye giuen, so <hi>Burgaeus</hi> appealed from the same to the celestiall Iudge.</p>
                  <p>And nowe at this time those outragious stormes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution did seeme to beate vpon euery corner of the church of Christ. The King sent new letters to euery Parliament, in the which he commaundeth that the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> shoulde be most seuerely persecuted. Heretofore (sayth he) in the troublesome time of warres, the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> greatly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: but now that he had inioyed and gotten peace, he wold wholy bende himselfe and all his force vtterlye to race and destroy them: wherefore he exhorteth them to vse the same diligence in doing the like.

In any wise he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them not to be colde in their businesse, as some began to be, for if they were, he woulde first begin with them, and make them féele the smart of punishment prepared for others.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all the Courtes, Senates, and Assemblies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this general commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of the King mooued, they thunder out, and shake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both heauen and earth with newe threatnings and Edicts. In the middest of this great distresse and troubles of the faithfull, there was great ioye, triumph, solemnitie, and feasting, for the peace confirmed betweene the two Kinges by the knot of matrimonie: all

which ioy and pleasure, was by and by, sodenly turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great sorrowe and wo. For King Henrie to solemnise the matrimonie, willed a Iusting or running at Tylt to be prepared, the which being done, and diuers of his Péeres and Nobles armed in a readinesse, he himselfe desired, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all others, to runne against <hi>Momgomerie</hi> Captaine of his garde: who being very loth and vnwilling so to doe, was commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded earnestly of the King to run against him, the King himselfe putting a speare into <hi>Momgomeries</hi> hande: and running togither in a broade way that leadeth to S.

But afterwarde he was brought to the knowledge of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:27102:26"/>
the truth, &amp; became a very profitable member of the Church of Christ. And thus king <hi>Henrie</hi> being weary of his mortall life, through extreme griefe and paine, surrendred the same againe to him that gaue it, in the yeare of our Lorde God. <hi>M. D. LIX.</hi> the. x. day of August.</p>
                  <p>By this sodaine chaunce, the ioy and mirth was turned into sorrowe and beauinesse, all men woondring to beholde so sodeyne an alteration and chaunge. The Court which was séeled, pergitted, sumptuouslye decked, and prepared for dauncing, leaping, and other pastyme, to make a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and ioyfull mariage, was nowe conuerted to another vse: namely, to kéepe the Kings deade bodie. There, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waylings were made, with dolefull and lamentable songs in blacke and mourning garments, the space of fortie days, and fortie nightes.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding this time of mourning and sorow, the afflictions moued against the Church, which séemed by that wonderfull chaunce of the King to cease, coulde not be asswaged by any meanes: neither did the aduersaries cease to prosecute and follow the law against these two Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Therfore when <hi>Burgaeus</hi> had oftentimes appealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, his appeales being pronounced by the Court to bée nothing and of no force, he was at the length condemned by the Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> from whome before he had appealed: and was also disgraded. The which he taking in very good part, as might appeare by his cherefull countenance, spáke these wordes: To daye (sayth he) it is brought to passe by the singular goodnesse of God towardes me, that to the ende I might neuer more haue to doe with Antichrist, the badges and markes of that great beast are taken from me.</p>
                  <p>Diuers thought <hi>Burgaeus</hi> vsed many appeals to put of his aduersaries, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thereby he might delay the time &amp; prolong his life: notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, he writing letters to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of <hi>Paris,</hi> affirmed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did it not to preserue or prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his life, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he wold willingly bestow for the gospels sake, but rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:27102:27"/>
he might séeme not to pretermit any thing which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to defende his right. And therfore thinking that he had not done sufficiently by his plaine and manifest answeres, he writeth also a confession, in the which he professeth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and plainly what he thought of euery speciall point of religion.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, afterwarde by the earnest perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and importunitie of his friends, he was brought to that poynt, that he propounded and deliuered to the Iudges a certaine ambiguous and doubtfull confession: in so much that then there was great hope that he shoulde be set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Of the which thing when the heads &amp; gouernours of the reformed Church had intelligence, being very carefull for <hi>Burgaeus,</hi> notwithstanding, being sorie that he should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that maner be deliuered out of prison, and from death, commaunded one of the Ministers, to put <hi>Burgaeus</hi> in mind of his dutie. And certainely their friendly admonitions did so much preuayle with <hi>Burgaeus,</hi> that he by and by earnestly acknowledging his sault, desired at the handes of God, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the same: and quite altereth that which before hée had done. Therefore he offereth to his Iudges againe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suppliant booke, by which he reueketh his doubtfull and last confession, affirming that he standeth to his first confession, and requireth that he maye haue iudgement of his cause thereby, and that the last sentence eyther of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation or deliuerance may stande therevpon.</p>
                  <p>That confession is truly more large, notwithstanding, so well deseruing to be remembred, that I thought good here<note place="margin">The summe of the confession of Burgens.</note> to insert the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And first of all in that confession, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himselfe to be a Christian, that is to saye, such a one as embraceth the doctrine of God the father, and his true sonne Iesus Christ, of one substance and coeternal with the father, and also of the holy ghost, who is all one with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the sonne, being the very power of the father and the sonne. Secondly, that God created man after his owne
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27102:27"/>
Image and similitude: who notwithstanding by the sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Serpent, that is to say, of Sathan, fell from God, and made not only himselfe, but also al his posteritie parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of grieuous punishmentes, sinne also cleauing to hys séede vnto the ende of the worlde. Thirdly, that there is but one waye to saluation, namely Iesus Christ, who being the very sonne of God, became perfect man, and tooke vpon him all our infirmities, sinne only excepted. This seconde <hi>Adam</hi> hath fulfilled the lawe for vs, and made vs thereby partakers of euerlasting righteousnesse: he liued here a time on earth, died, and was buried, and after he had ouercome death, he rose againe the thirde daye: ascended into heauen, and sitteth at the right hande of the Father, making inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for vs daily to him, vntill he shall come to iudge the quicke and the deade. Fourthly, that he doth leane and stay himselfe onely vpon Gods worde (that is to saye, vpon the bookes of the olde and newe Testament) penned, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and vttered by the holy ghost, the Prophetes and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles being only instruments. And that this is the only and euerlasting rule of truth: to adde vnto the which, or to take any thing therefro, is great wickednesse. Therefore all the lawes and Ceremonies which Popes and others haue made, cannot binde the consciences of men.

God permitteth vnto vs the vse of all meates with giuing of thankes: but the Pope forbiddeth the same. Our Sauiour Christ commaundeth that they which haue not the gift of

God forbiddeth Images to be set in chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but the Pope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth the contrarie. And therfore he concludeth that he is very Antichrist, and very liuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed of the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> so to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After this, be answereth<note place="margin">2.

I therefore (sayeth he) acknowledging by what su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions and errours I haue bene hytherto ledde and blinded, doe nowe affirme, that I doe vnfeynedlye ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure and abhorre them all, euen from the bottome of my heart, as things contrarie to the doctrine of my Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ, which is the worde reuealed by the holy spirite of God, and written by the Prophetes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. The which worde, I receyue and embrace as the rule of my whole lyfe, euen as in olde time, the fierie piller led the children of Israell through the Desert to the lande of promise. I protest that I will direct and frame my whole life according to the prescript rule of that word, by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Gods holy spirit, which shall be with me, &amp; order all my wayes: without the which I can do nothing, and by which all things are possible vnto me. Insomuch that I am perswaded that all things shall happen to the glorye of the Lord, to the enlarging of the kingdome of his sonne, to the building of his Church, and to my soules health, which I commende vnto him: to whome I giue most harty thanks: whom I most humbly pray in the name of Iesus Christ his welbeloued sonne, that he will strengthen and slablishe me by his holy spirite in this fayth vnto the ende: and that it will please him to graunt me-strength, for his mercies sake with my heart and mouth boldly to confesse his holy name, both before the faithfull, and also before Infidels, tyrants, and murthering butchers of Antichrist, euen to the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:27102:28"/>
of the vtmost drop of my bloud. All my desire is to liue and dye in this sayth, being fully perswaded that the same is grounded vpon the worde of God alone, and that all the Saintes, Patriarkes, Prophetes, and Apostles, did lyue and dye therein. This is the only true knowledge of God, in the which the vndoubted and eternall felicitie of men is placed. This I saye, is the fayth in the which I will both liue and die. To this confession I haue subscribed with my owne hande, being readye also to seale the same with my bloude, for the defence of the doctrine of the sonne of God: whom I pray to open the eyes of your heartes, that at the length (if it be his will) ye maye knowe and vnderstande the truth.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when he had wholye confirmed that confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and had with his owne mouth plainely testified the same before his Iudges, then was there no hope left that <hi>Burgaeus</hi> shoulde be deliuered. For he had great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aduersaries, among whome, his chiefe and principall enimie was the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> who left nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done that might by any maner of meanes hasten his death. For he feared, least at the length he shoulde bée deliuered by the King. For many Noble men, as <hi>Fredericke</hi> Earle of <hi>Palatine</hi> Prince <hi>Elector,</hi> and others, had very earnestly written to the King for him.</p>
                  <p>All things therefore being so appoynted, as wée haue shewed, hys aduersaries thought that they had manye iust reasons, by which they might condemne him to dye. And therefore on the twentie day of December, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the sentence of death agaynst him: namely, <hi>That</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of death against Burgaus.</note>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:27102:29"/>
who had iudged him according to their owne conscience and knowledge, but not according to the true knowledge and wisedome of God. Many wordes be vttered vnto them at that time, which were so rhetoricall, weightie, and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, with vehemencie vttred, that it might well appeare, the holy ghost rather to speak than he: the which his words here to repeare, shall be nothing from our purpose.</p>
                  <p>Hath (sayth he) that fraudulent message of hell full of all guile and deceyte, and an abhominable lie, with deadly hatred, still striuing against the truth, so preuayled, that being accused vnto you falslye for those men which we are not, shall so be condemned? We, I saye, are the sonnes of God, whome we knowe to be our father, with whom there is no respect of persons: with whome we are able to doe all thinges, and without whome, nothing: he it is, whome you ought to heare, speaking nowe vnto you, otherwise he threateneth vnto you death and destruction.

                  <p>Shall we suffer our redemption, and the bloude so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullye shed for our sinnes, to be troden vnder foote?

Is this the part of a traitor and Rebell, to praye vnto God for the preseruation and prosperitie of the King and the kingdome, and that he and his Ministers, Counsellers, and Magistrates, maye truly and faithfully doe their dutie, that all false worship being taken away, God may be glorified alone, and of all men purely worshipped? Is not this rather, rebellion, to deface Gods glorie, and to giue that honor due vnto him to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to followe the deuises and fantasies of men in worshipping him, to count it a vertue, to rent and teare the name of God with blasphemous othes, to suffer brothell houses and common stewes, and an infinite number of wickednesses mo?

                  <p>Howe many wickednesses doe ye commit, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of that ruddie purpuled <hi>Phalaris,</hi> (canst thou<note place="margin">By the tyrant Phalaris he meaneth the Cardinall of Loraine.</note> O cruel tyrant, by the cruel death cease our sobbing sighes?) who at his owne pleasure, for his proper aduauntage and gayne, aduanced the authoritie of certaine rulers, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the King and the whole kingdome. At his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement ye so racke and torment our bodies, that ye your selues are constreyned to pitie the same. Howe great is your crueltie? But me thinketh I sée teares fall from your eyes. Why wéepe you? Can you hide the burthen of your consciences. Feare not, hardly, the iudgement of God, although ye be constreyned to tremble thereat. They which are condemned of you to die, reioyce, accounting death to be vnto them life: they are nothing abashed or dismayed at your crueltie, they regard not the iniuries offered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and as for death, they count it a sléepe, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe: <hi>The conquerour dieth, and he that is conquered, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth.</hi> What should it grieue me to be hanged? I know Lorde, that if euer any wickednesse deserued punishment and payne, the wickednesse of those deserueth it euen to the full, which reiect and contemne the benefite of thy sonne Christ. I imbrace (O Lorde God) that saying which thou hast put into the mouths of certaine of thy Martyrs, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he is worthy of double punishment which receiueth not the offered redemption of our Sauiour. No man shall separate vs from Christ, what snares of trappes soeuer are layde for vs, and with what paynes soeuer our bodies shall be tormented, I knowe that we were appointed long ago as shéepe to the slaughter. Let them therefore kill vs, let them grinde vs to pouder and ashes: yet notwithstanding, they which dye to the Lorde liue still, and shall so ryse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne at the resurrection of the iust. Whatsoeuer come to passe, I am a Christian, &amp; a Christian will I be. Uerye ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly will I crie, that I may be hearde, dying for my Lorde
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27102:30"/>
and sauiour Iesu Christ. Since the matter standeth thus, why do I stay? take me hangman &amp; carie me to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gallowes. And repeating these wordes againe, and that with such ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie, that he made the teares to come out of the eyes of his aduersaries, he spake these words to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senators which were then present, namely, that he suffred death, bicause he woulde not acknowledge, iustification, grace, sanctification, merites, intercession, satisfaction &amp; saluation to be in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than in Christ: &amp; that therfore he died for the doctrine of the Gospel. And after many other words concerning this matter, at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> length he concluded with these words: Put out, put out one day those your flaming fires, come vnto the lord in newnesse of life, that your sinnes may be done away, let the wicked man forsake his ways, &amp; the wicked cogitations of his heart, and then the Lorde will haue mercie. In the meane time, meditate and consider these thinges in your mindes. Beholde, I go now vnto the death.</p>
                  <p>When he had thus vttered his minde, the hangman tied his handes, and bounde him to the Cart, in the which he was caried to the strete commonly called <hi>San-Iani Greuaei,</hi> aboue foure hundred armed men garding him: beside this, the whole Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> as though it bene at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of their enimies, was furnished with armed men: the wayes that led to the place of execution were stopt vp, &amp; the freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places kept. Yet for all this, this godly Martyr, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abashed, but abode couragious and constant. When he came to the place of execution, he put off his clothes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and being stripte naked, fetching great and déepe sighes, he looked vp stedfastly into heauen. And at the length vttered these few words only to the people: <hi>I am not come hither, either for theft nor murther, but to suffer only for the Gospels sake.</hi> For he had the libertie of his tongue grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto him (which libertie other of the faithfull had not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came to suffer, hauing their to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues first cut out of their heads) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this condition, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he should not speak to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27102:31"/>
The which he promised to obserue, that he might the better praye vnto God. Therefore when he had made his prayers to God, and shoulde nowe be sacrifised, he oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated these words with a loude voyce: <hi>O my God, forsake me not, least I forsake thee.</hi> And being strangled, he was cast into the fire, sealing that with his bloude, and death, which before he had subscribed with his hande.</p>
                  <p>This was the ende of that good and godlye man being of great fame among the learned, both for his witte, and also his learning, and being also of honorable calling and great welth: who had no doubt in short time attayned to greater honor and dignitie in this lyfe, had not God reserued him, by the pure knowledge of his name, to this greatest prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and dignitie of professing his truth, which the world counteth reproch. For <hi>Burgeus</hi> came of an honest familie and stocke, being borne in <hi>Rionssius,</hi> a towne in <hi>Auergne,</hi> and brought vp in good letters, who had so giuen himselfe to the studie of the lawe, that he became famous in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thereof. Afterwardes, being chosen to be one of the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> he left great fame of wit and learning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, among the most noble men. Being therefore in the waye to come to greater honor and preferrement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, God indueth him with more pure knowledge of hys worde, whereby he fearing no perils of times, ioyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the reformed Church, and woulde be present at the sermons which were then secretly made: and thus dailye he was feruent more and more in godlye zeale: Insomuch, that he had not bene partaker of the Lordes supper passing once or twise, when he spake his mind so fréely before king <hi>Henrie</hi> in the Senate house in the defence of the Gospell: by whose commaundement he was cast in prison, and from thence (as ye haue hearde) caried to execution. A singular example of the efficacie and force of the knowledge of God, and also of godlye constancie in so worthie a man, at the which, the godly hereafter shall iustly maruaile. His bloude
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27102:31"/>
truly was the séede wherby the Church of Christ in Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did greatly increase and growe, as may plainly appeare by those things which followe.</p>
                  <p>Touching the other Counsellers, whom we sayd before were taken togither with <hi>Burgaeus,</hi> this was the ende: after a while, they had diuers iudgementes giuen of them, by which they were deliuered. And the causes why these so es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped are these: namely, either the new Iudges, who to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande their causes, examined them after another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than the other was examined: eyther the diuersitie of times, in which chaunced many troubles: or else truly the very inconstancie of the captiued Counsellers themselues, relenting somewhat to their aduersaries.</p>
                  <p>About this time, <hi>Nicolaus Durandus,</hi> (who altering his name, called himselfe <hi>Villegagno,</hi> that is to say, a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Cities, as though he had bene a newe conquering <hi>Vlysses</hi>) obtained of the King a nauie of shippes with men and vittaile accordingly, to sayle to the South Indians, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him many men which professed the reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: to the ende (as he sayde) that the Gospell might to them be preached, and there planted. And when he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued into <hi>America,</hi> he sent to <hi>Geneua,</hi> that Ministers might be sent vnto him from thence: the which his desire was graunted, insomuch that he obtained two, namely, <hi>Peter Richerius,</hi> and <hi>George Charterius.</hi> who came vnto him with a great number of those faithfull Protestantes that fled out of Fraunce in the hote time of persecution. These men when they were come, began to preach the worde of God, and to appoint an order of discipline. There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so among the rest, a certaine man called <hi>Ianus Contachus,</hi> not long before, a Sorbonist or Papist, who came thither after <hi>Villegagno.</hi> This man being ambitions, desired great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be made a Bishop. Therefore he thought this a verye good way to obtaine his purpose: namely vpon the daye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ministration of the Lordes supper, to mooue
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:27102:32"/>
certaine questions: as, whether Copes, and Surplesies, and such Priest like garments were necessary to be vsed in that ministration: also, whether vnleauened breade and the mixing of water with win<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, shoulde not in the same be vsed. The which he did in déede. Howbeit, for all this contention mooued by him, the Supper of the Lord was then purely ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated. But the controuersies increasing daily more and more among them, it was tolde vnto <hi>Villegagno,</hi> that there was a fame and report in Fraunce, that many <hi>Lutheranes</hi> were come into <hi>America,</hi> by his meanes and guidance. At the hearing whereof <hi>Durandus Villegagno</hi> being made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searde, quite altered and chaunged his former minde and purpose, concerning the bringing in and establishing of the Gospell in those regions. And when as on a time <hi>Richeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ministred Baptisme, and sayd that all those things which were by the Papistes ioyned to Baptisme, after the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostles, were depraued and corrupted addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Villegagno</hi> made open proclamation, saying that <hi>Richerius</hi> lyed, and streight way affirmed that he had rather followe the ancient rites and customes of the Church made a thousande yeares ago, than the new opinions of <hi>Caluin,</hi> and other newfangled persons: adding also to this, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>woulde neuer more haue to doe with them. At the last, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long controuersie, it was concluded among them, that the articles which were in question, shoulde be sent to the Churches of Fraunce and Germanie, to iudge of them, whose iudgement and opinion they agréed to followe. For this cause <hi>Charterius</hi> was sent into Fraunce. But when <hi>Villegagno</hi> vnderstoode by rumors that great persecution continued still in Fraunce, he plainly vttereth his minde, and declareth that he would stand to none of all their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and opinions, but woulde imbrace the doctrine of the Romishe Church, and forbiddeth <hi>Richeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fraunce, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, the lets and impediments which <hi>Villegagno</hi> obiected vnto them: who in déede went about to bring to passe, that so soone as they came into Fraunce, they both might be deliuered into the handes of the magistrate. Many in like maner of the faithfull which abode in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> were very euil intreated for religion, some for this cause being drowned, left a signe and remembrance to the vtmost partes of the world, of their sufferance for the Gospel. And this truly was the issue and ende of the rashe and vndiscrete zeale of <hi>Villegagno,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now let vs here bring in that, which we left behind vnspoken, concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of king <hi>Henrie.</hi> After that he was buried, &amp; his funerals celebrated according to custome, &amp; the new king <hi>Frances</hi> set in his roome, the <hi>Guises</hi> (hauing gotten authoritie and fauour with the King, by the meanes of the Quéene of Scottes his wife) left nothing vndone to aduaunce them to dignitie: séeking all they could to remoue others, to whom the gouernement of things appertained, but specially in this time of the Kings nonage, and at their pleasure placing whome it pleased them, to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, losse, &amp; reproch of those Princes that were the Kings neare kinsemen, being of the same familie and lyne that he himselfe was of. But this their authoritie &amp; power hapned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chiefly, to the destruction of the Church.

                  <p>Then was there newe Edicts deuised and set forth more cruell than the other that were before, with newe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes added to the same.

The first of these two, which was the Goldsmith, being for his wickednesse and euill life excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:27102:33"/>
from the Church, came to <hi>Democharis</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor, and tolde him that he knewe many things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> and that he for sooke their companie for this cause, that he might so much as lay in him, worke their destruction. And so whatsoeuer he knewe might be hurtful to the faithfull, the same he declared to the Inquisitor: gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto him the names of such as were chief of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, and burdening them with grieuous crimes. To be short, he left nothing vntold, that might serue any maner of way to be hurtfull vnto them. To this fellowe, the Inquisitor gaue diligent eare, and encouraged him with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to procéede in his well doing, promising vnto him great things: and to the ende he might not séeme to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, he gaue vnto him a summe of money for an earnest pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and for the newes he brought him, he called him Saint <hi>Paule</hi> the Conuert. To be short, this fellowe perceyuing some fruite and profite to come vnto him for his treacherie and playing the <hi>Iudas</hi> part, added yet to his former wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse another mischiefe. So many as he knew to be weak, and not fully se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>led in the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profession, he perswaded to go to the Inquisitor, and to desire his friendship, that they might be absolued and discharged of the punishment ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Also he caried with him Catchpoles to so many of the houses of the faithfull, as he knew, that by them they might be apprehended. By this his secrete treason he made all the chiefe of the Church to flée. Nowe the other, which was the Painters seruant, enuying his maister for due correction ministred vnto his deserts, went and tolde the Iudges that he had frequented the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> companie by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement and will of his maister. Whome the Judges séeing to be so readye to accuse, inticed him by many faire promises, to bewraye such as he knewe to be <hi>Lutheranes:</hi> The which request of theirs he satisfied to the vttermost, saying that the common report was true, namely, that they satisfied their filthie lustes one with another: and saying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:27102:34"/>
that he himselfe had to doe with diuers yong maydens, whome he named. For the which cause he required that those Maidens with their mothers might be brought before the Judge face to face, and the matter throughly examined. The which matter at the length being manifestly proued false, this wicked accuser was constrayned to confesse that he was procured by <hi>Democharis</hi> the Inquisitor, and one of the chiefe of the Senate, to forge these things. Howbeit, this slaunderous rumor did much harme, for it was noysed abroade, that all maner of wickednesse was committed by the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> when they came togither. The same wherof being brought to the eares of the yong King, made him more cruell against the faithfull. And so persecution waxed hote and vehement againe, the Iudges Flyes (for so were the Inquisitors called) flying abrode in euery corner. Insomuch that for the space of nyne monethes the faithfull were cast<note place="margin">Grieuous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> in prison, banished, murthered, and their houses and goodes confiscate. Notwithstanding all these things, God preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the remnant of his Church: and suffered not, for all this, the preaching of his worde to be taken away. Manye therefore were then burned for the Gospels sake, whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancie wan many to the same. And among the rest which suffered for the testimonie of the Gospell, there was one<note place="margin">Margaret Riche.</note> woman, called <hi>Margaret Riche,</hi> a booke sellers wife, of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull constancie. This woman by the falshoode &amp; deceit of hir husband was betrayed into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of the Judges, who notwithstanding was the first that instructed hir in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, &amp; brought hir to know &amp; reiect hir former errors. <hi>Annas Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeus</hi> affirmed that he was much encouraged by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> constancy of this woman, which was kept in bonds when he liued.</p>
                  <p>Thus, the Kingdome of the yong King <hi>Frances</hi> being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned as it pleased the <hi>Guises,</hi> who hauing gotten the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie, thought and deuised nowe howe to bring two things to passe, which séemed to be so necessary for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that without the obtaining of them, they could not get their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:27102:35"/>
notable viage to <hi>Naples,</hi> by which the one was minded to make himselfe Pope, and the other purposed to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe King: and also by the sundrie exactions with the which the people were oppressed, when they shoulde rather haue bene eased, considering the great warres and charge that they had bene at before, being charged with warre a freshe, carying the souldiers that were wearied in the former warres into Seotlande, and all vnder the pretence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And here for examples sake, the dealings of those were brought in, who vnder the colour of custodie, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and wardship, had inuaded the kingdomes of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes.</hi> These were the contents of those libels dispersed abrode, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding also that it was no offence at all, but well done, with the sworde to resist the tirannie of the <hi>Guises.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While these things were published abrode, and on both sides writings of defence dispersed, manye rumors were brought from farre Countries to the <hi>Guises,</hi> but among the rest, this in especiall, namely, that manye had made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie to set vpon them euen in the Kinges house. The <hi>Guises</hi> therefore being moued with these writings and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, layde the cause of all these things to the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> charge, and went about to perswade the King that the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theranes</hi> disdaining to be so greatlye afflicted, had made a conspiracie to destroy him. And for the more safetie of the<note place="margin">The descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the tumult of Ambaxia.</note> King, they caried him to <hi>Ambaxia,</hi> being a litle towne, and fortified with a Castell: appointing watch and warde to be in euery place through which the King should passe to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baxia,</hi> commaunding also to take so manye as they founde armed, or by any maner of meanes suspected. This done, the Kings power and authoritie was committed to <hi>Frances</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> to supplie the Kings roome, for confirmation whereof, he receyued the Kings letters patentes. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, the <hi>Guises</hi> as yet were vncertaine of the reported conspiracie, as, from whence, after what maner, by what waye they woulde come, and who the conspirators
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:27102:35"/>
were, vntill the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> was plainly certified thereof by a certaine lawyer of <hi>Paris:</hi> to whome were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for his rewarde in reuealing this matter, ten thousande French Crownes, out of the Kings treasurie.</p>
                  <p>But nowe, what maner of conspiracie or practise this was, ye shall heare: There were verie manye which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and repined at the authoritie committed vnto the <hi>Guises,</hi> but specially the Noblemen, which tooke it in euill part, that the libertie of Fraunce shoulde be defaced by the tirannie of straungers. Againe, many of those which were of the reformed Churches, being wearied with sharpe and grieuous afflictions, and laying the burthen and blame of all these cruelties vpon the <hi>Guiles,</hi> as the chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall enimies of religion, thought if they might be repressed and put downe, they shoulde finde the King more mercifull and readie to heare their petitions: and they should defend their cause before the Magistrates, if they were there vnto lawfully called. Yea, the matter came so farre, that they thought they had iuste causes to put downe the <hi>Guises,</hi> the which shoulde turne to the profite both of the King and countrie. And this counsell and practise was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised at <hi>Nameta,</hi> which is a towne in the lower <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,</hi> by certaine which came thither, vnder the colour of méeting togither at a mariage. The chiefe perswaders and procurers of which matter, were <hi>Godfridus, Barreus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naudius,</hi> and <hi>Garreus,</hi> being Noble men. Whose determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and purpose was to compell the <hi>Guises</hi> to giue an account bowe they had discharged their offices: and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue them from that dignitie, which (they sayde) they had vsurped, and to place the Princes which were the Kinges neare kinsemen in the same. To bring the which thing to passe, they determined, if néede shoulde require, to take the sworde in hande. And thus they concluded their purpose, the summe whereof was: <hi>That nothing shoulde be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, against the Kings kinsemen, and against the</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:27102:36"/>
                     <hi>state of the Realme: and that their dignitie, and the libertie of the countrie shoulde bee defended so much as might bee from the violence of straungers.</hi> And to bring this thing to passe, <hi>Renaudius</hi> was chosen Captaine, to whome they ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sixe other, whose counsell he might vse in any matter: and thirtie men also very skilfull in feates of armes, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende vpon him in seruice of warre. The time and place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of méeting was appointed. And so euery man diligentlye went about the thing concluded: they prouided money and artillerie, and appointed souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, the manifolde rumors of their doings, and the exquisite diligence of the <hi>Guises</hi> (or rather the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God which had a greater worke to finishe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed their counsels &amp; deuises. At that time the Earle of <hi>Sansserrensis</hi> was lieutenant of <hi>Turon:</hi> who hearing that the Lord <hi>Castelnouan</hi> and certaine valiant captaines with him, abode there certaine dayes, came to them, &amp; séeing the Lord <hi>Castelnouan,</hi> whom he knew, very earnestly inquired of the matter, but at the last they fell togither by the eares. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, they escaped, and fled to the castle called <hi>Nozeus,</hi> to the which, they had before determined to come: &amp; there, by the industrie of <hi>Renaudius,</hi> were gathered togither the number of fiue hundred horsmen. But the Earle of <hi>Sansserreus</hi> went without delay to <hi>Ambaxia,</hi> &amp; told there al the whole matter. Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captaine <hi>Nemorosius</hi> was sent to <hi>Nozeus</hi> with prepared souldiers, to take a view, &amp; also to knowe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning. Whither, when he was come, he desired to talke with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The which being graunted, he demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what cause they had so to deale, asking also, if they by their disloyall disobedience woulde bring infamie &amp; reproch to all their countrymen, who were wel knowne to be euer faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true to their Kings. To this they answere by Baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Castelnouan,</hi> that they ment nothing against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, but were armed to defend the King, &amp; the state of the Realme, &amp; intended to shew his Maiestie the fraude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27102:36"/>
of the <hi>Guises,</hi> which they practise to destroy the King and the kingdome: and that they were therfore gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with a great companie of Nobles, to resist the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the <hi>Guises,</hi> their manifest violence &amp; oppression both of lawes and auncient institutions: Affirming also that they woulde retaine the name of faithfull subiectes in the middest of these troubles, whatsoeuer they were thought off. To this <hi>Nemorosius</hi> replyed, saying that it became not Subiectes to come vnto their Prince with weapons and armour. They on the contrarie part sayde: that they did not beare armour against their Prince, but against the <hi>Guises,</hi> his vndoubted enimies, who will suffer none of his subiectes to haue recourse vnto the King. And therfore they sayde they were armed, that they might haue accesse vnto the Kings maiestie: to whome they knewe and woulde giue due honor and reuerence.</p>
                  <p>This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication passing betwene them, <hi>Nemorosius</hi> at the last fel to intreating &amp; beseching them, promising that if they would vpon trust yéelde themselues into his hands, and go vnto the king without armor, they should sustain no harm. Who at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> length being perswaded, yéelded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues into his handes, counting it a great good turne, if so be they might haue frée accesse vnto the King, without the vse of weapons and armour. Notwithstanding, so soone as they were come to <hi>Ambaxia,</hi> they were cast into prison, &amp; hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, euen as they had bene traytors to the kings Maiestie. The day folowing, the band of footmen, not knowing what had happened, went through the woods to <hi>Ambaxia</hi> &amp; being euery one of them inclosed and taken by an hoste of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were the same daye put to death, some being hanged, and some drowned in the riuer. The thirde day, the bande of horsemen (among whome came <hi>Renaudius</hi>) hauing tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed all the night, by the conducting and skill of <hi>Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus,</hi> a Noble man, came by the breake of the daye, to the Castell gates of <hi>Ambaxia.</hi> But béeynge betrayed,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27102:37"/>
they fled away, &amp; were scattered here &amp; there. And this was the ende of this enterprise, &amp; thus it was stayed. They who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Nemorosius</hi> had persuaded to yéelde, which were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were diuersly put to death, some had their heades chopt off, some were hanged out of the Castell windowes, and some cast into the riuer. And among others that were taken, <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouanus</hi> was one, of whome we spake before, being a man of great fame, both for his birth, and also for his bringing vp. This man hearing himselfe to be pronounced giltie of treason against the Kings maiestie, cried out, that he was giltie in no respect of that crime, neyther that he coulde so be proued by any meanes.</p>
                  <p>This one thing he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed to be true, that he went about to resist the tyrannie of the <hi>Guises,</hi> with a great number of the Nobilitie of Fraunce: if this were to offende the Kings maiestie (sayde he) they must be called Kings, before I and they can iustly be condemned of treason. And séeing they might not haue libertie to appeale to mortall Iudges, he sayde that he appealed to the celestiall Iudge for so vniust iudgement giuen vpon him, the which ere it be long, will take vengeance on innocent bloude so vniustly shed. The like also many others affirming, and committing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie to God, caused manye to lament their state with teares. And among the rest, one whose name was <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Villemongius</note> bathing his handes in the bloude of his fellowes which were newlye slayne, lifted vp his handes imbrued with bloude to heauen, crying: <hi>Lord this is the bloud of thy seruants: thou shalt take vengeance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe therefore these horrible slaughters, a man woulde thinke had bene sufficient to make <hi>Renaudius</hi> forsake his former purpose, but he notwithstanding continued in the same. Wherefore he went about to gather togither againe his men which were dispersed, as you haue heard eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now: the which while he assayed, he met with a horseman of hys enimies side, who shot of at <hi>Renaudius</hi> his dag, but missing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27102:37"/>
him, was at the last by <hi>Renaudius</hi> slayne. But <hi>Renaudius</hi> by a souldiour standing by, being the seruaunt of the horseman that was slaine, was also wounded to death with the shot of a Dagge: whome notwithstanding, before he died, <hi>Renau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> also manfully slue. But streight after by the grieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the wounde he dyed. Whose deade carcas being brought to <hi>Ambaxia,</hi> was hanged vp with this title: <hi>RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAVDIVS captaine of Rebels, and Author of Sedition.</hi> After this, it was deuided or quartered into foure partes, and set vp in diuers places, and his heade set vpon a forke. A wonderfull and straunge thing it was, that so many men should come togither from all parts of the Realme, and yet be séene of none. But this was not the ende of this tumult. The <hi>Guises,</hi> against whome this conspiracie was made, made great search and inquiry for those that were suspected to be guiltie of this conspiracie. Moreouer, the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre:</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> in this contention tooke part against the <hi>Guises,</hi> as hereafter shall be declared. The <hi>Constable,</hi> at the commaundement of the King, went to the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> and there opened the whole matter concerning the tumulte of <hi>Ambaxia,</hi> commending the great diligence of the <hi>Guises</hi> in pacifying of the same: But bicause he sayde, that this conspiracie was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that were in chiefe authoritie about the King, the <hi>Guises</hi> tooke the same in very euil part, who would haue had all men perswaded, that it was made for the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King and the whole Realme, that all good order being taken away, euery man might rule and gouerne as him lysted.</p>
                  <p>At this time, <hi>Oliuarius</hi> the Kinges high Chauncelour, who had condemned those that were taken in the tumult of <hi>Ambaxia,</hi> was grieuously taken with sickenesse: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very extréemely handled therewith, sayde that he had iustly deserued the same, for that those whome he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, had great iniurie done vnto them. Moreouer, hée
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:27102:38"/>
made exclamation against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cardinal of <hi>Loraine,</hi> (who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his extreme sicknesse, came to sée him) saying: <hi>Thou (O Cardinall) art he that bringeth destruction to vs all:</hi> And so fetching déepe sighes &amp; grieuous grones, be ended his life.</p>

Of which, she sayde, no man coulde better satisfie hir than he. Who, when he coulde by no excuse shift off or denie this request, at the last affirmed that for his obedience sake, he woulde take this thing vpon him, and so farre as he coulde satisfie hir request. First, therefore he began thus, saying: there are two sortes of them, who hauing their names altered, were no more called <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> but <hi>Huguenotes.</hi> I saye of<note place="margin">Spirituall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Of the whiche two factions, the first for their afflicted Religion, the other, for that the gouernement of the Realme was put into the handes of the <hi>Guises</hi> (the Princes, the Kings neare kinsemen beyng defrauded of the same) were greatlye displeased. These were the verye causes of these troubles: to remedie the which, there is no waye, but to satisfie both their wylles. The first, namely, the religious persons may easilye be perswaded, if so be, godly and learned men were gathered togither, and disputation made of those arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles nowe in controuersie. But the others, which were of the Temporaltie, can not be so easilye pacified, bicause they thinke that they haue iust occasion to put themselues in armour, and to resist. This therefore is the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, if the Princes the Kings neare kinsemen be kept and set in their owne proper degrée and dignitye: and the <hi>Guises</hi> by some faire and gentle meanes remooued from gouerning the Kingdome. For the Nobilitie will not suffer the Princes which are the Kings neare kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to bée in lesse estimation than Straungers. And althoughe the Princes throughe their humanitie and great modestie woulde suffer them selues to bée so aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yet notwithstanding, the Nobles woulde not beare
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27102:39"/>
it, nor abyde the gouernement of Straungers. And to confirme this which he had spoken, he brought in manye examples, that the <hi>Guises</hi> being Straungers, were neyther in the number of Princes, nor at anye time so accounted:<note place="margin">The names of Princes did not appertaine to the Guises, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note> and that therefore it was not lawfull for the <hi>Guises,</hi> to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate vnto themselues the titles and authoritie of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which onely appertained to the Kings bloude, as the auncient custome of the kingdome woulde declare. This (sayth he) to pacifie those of the temporaltie, whose do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were the more to bée feared, for that the greater part of the Nobilitie was of that side, sauing such as were woonne and procured awaye by the <hi>Guiles</hi> for the Kings money.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Planchaeus</hi> largely and fréely vttered his mynde.

Who, when <hi>Planchaeus</hi> had leaue of the Quéene to depart, came forth, and talking with the Quéene, appointed that <hi>Planchaeus</hi> shoulde be called agayne, and commaunded to procéede in his former declaration, and to shewe who they were that were the authors and Captaynes of she late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie: the which, except he woulde promise to doe, that he might be caried to prison. Therefore <hi>Planchaeus</hi> being called againe, began to vtter his minde as fréely as he had done before, shewing the parentage and stocke of the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and also howe they were Straungers, and nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to Fraunce: adding moreouer, that it was very euill done to commit the gouernement of the Realme to Straungers, and speciallye to such, as did contende ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouslye for the Kingdome, and thought it shoulde apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to them. The Quéene being offended with his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and speciallye, séeing he affirmed that he knewe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the conspiracie, commaunded that he should be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to prison.</p>

                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:27102:39"/>All which <hi>Planchaeus</hi> spake, was euen as it were the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people speaking by the mouth of one man.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Michael Hospitall</hi> the Kings Chauncelour, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Oliuarius,</hi> of whom we spake before, a man verye well learned and wyse, was sent to the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> to consult with them about many matters that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the gouernement of the Realme, and among the rest, concerning the prouiding such remedies as might take away the tumults alredie begon. And thus afflictions wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Afflictions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sort cease.</note> more easie than they wers before: and remedies were prouided for so generall a mischiefe. But the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the increasing of the multitude of the faithfull day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, was in euery place of the Realme: and bicause great troubles séemed to be at hande, all men had regarde vnto them, more than to the report of the increase of the faithful, the most part endeuouring themselues to staye and pacifie these troubles.</p>
                  <p>And at this time, this was the state of France: the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<note place="margin">A description of the Scotres warre for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> sent the same prouision of warre, with the which they withstoode the religion in Fraunce, into Scotland, ouer the sea, to the intent they might there deface and put downe the religion newly begon. For the Nobles of Scotland with a great multitude of the people beside, had cast off the Popes yoke from of their neckes, &amp; had plucked downe their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, their altars, and abolished the ceremonies of the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall seruice: causing the Quéene to get hir into a little towne by hirselfe, for that she was sore offended at that which they had done. Therefore lacking helpe, the <hi>Guises</hi> brought to passe to haue an hoste of men sent out of France, to the number of foure thousande. Of this bande of men, <hi>Brossaeus</hi> was Generall, with whome was ioyned the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Ambianensis,</hi> to the ende, the one might fight with the sword, and the other with Papisticall power. Therfore they toke their iourney with these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, namely, that they should seuerely punish the Rebels, and the chiefe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:27102:40"/>
authors of sedition: and that they shoulde restore the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and vsuall obedience of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, so sone as they were come into Scotland, they made proclamation that euery one should go to Masse, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and forsake the new religion. The Bishop wrote vnto the King, that he woulde bring all the people within fewe dayes to the catholike faith. <hi>Brossaeus</hi> wrote, that he woulde destroy all within sixe moneths which woulde not come to the auncient Religion. But it came otherwise to passe.</p>
                  <p>For after the death of <hi>Marie</hi> Quéene of England, the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> made claime and title to the Crowne of Englande, for their Néece the Quéene of Scottes, as though she had bene the lawfull heire. Whereat the moste gracious Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hauing great disdaine, sent worde to the King of Fraunce, of this great iniurie done to hir Grace by the <hi>Guises,</hi> and biddeth battaile.</p>
                  <p>Nowe the Scottés to the ende they might abide the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren power of the Frenchmen, féeling also that they stoode in néede of helpe and ayde from some other place, went to the Quéene of England, beséeching hir that although they were hir olde enimies, yet that she woulde vouchsafe to ayde them in so iust a cause of Religion, saying that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to abide any extremitie, than the tyrannie of the Pope. To whom the Quéenes maiestie willingly and gladly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and graunted helpe. The Scottes therefore being encouraged by this ayde, did so withstande the French power, that they made great slaughter of the French men, and draue them to such a strayte, that except the matter had bene taken vp by peace, it shoulde séeme that they had bene all vtterly destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Peace therfore was concluded, and the reformed Religion there established. And so that tumult was turned to the peace and quietnesse of the Church, notwithstanding, the subtill practises and cruell threatnings of the aduersaries.</p>
                  <p>There were also at that time grieuous afflictions layde
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:27102:40"/>
vpon the Church in another place.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the Kingdome of Fraunce also in diuers places, as at <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Rhoane,</hi> many of the faythfull were murthered, vpon the solemne feast daye of the Bishops deambulation.

for the worship of God and our saluation, we saye that it is not méete, neither for men, nor yet for Angels to adde or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any thing from the same word, or to alter any thing in the same.

For some are not better than other some, vntill God make the one to be knowne from the other, by that his euerlasting purpose, which he determined in Jesus Christ, before the foundation of the world: neyther can any man by his owne strength attaine vnto that blessednesse, since that by nature we haue no good motion, neither are we able to thinke a good thought, vntill God by grace assist vs and guideth vs vnto that which is right and good.</p>

the ceremoniall obseruation of certaine dayes, Auricular confession, Iuduigences, and suche like abhominations, by which, some thinke, that they merit grace and saluation. All which things we do reiecte, not onely for the false opinion conceyued of meriting adioyned vnto them, but also bicause they be the inuentions of men, and a yoake layde vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences by the authoritie of men.</p>
                     <p n="25">25 We beléeue, bicause we can not obtaine Christ, but by the Gospell, that the holy and inuiolable discipline establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticall discipline.</note> by his authoritie in the Churche ought to be obserued: and that therefore Pastours ought to be in the Church, to whom appertaineth the office of preaching the worde, and the ministration of the Sacramentes, whom men ought to honor and reuerently heare, if they beyng lawfully called discharge their dutie: not that God of necessitie néedeth such inferior helpes, but rather bycause it thus seemeth good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to rule vs, as it were with a bridle. And therfore we do detest all those fanaticall persons, which so muche as in them lyeth séeke to abolishe the holy ministerye, that is to say, the preaching of the worde, and the administration of Sacraments.</p>
                     <p n="26">26 We beléeue therefore that it is lawfull for no man to<note place="margin">The vnitie of the Church.</note> withdrawe himselfe from the Congregation, and to trust in himselfe: but is rather the duetie of all men to defende and kéepe the Unitie of the Churche, submitting them selues to the common Institution and yoake of Christe wheresoeuer God hath appointed the true and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call discipline, althoughe the Edictes of Magistrates be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same: from the which order, whosoeuer separate them selues, they resist the ordinance of God.</p>
                     <p n="27">27 We beléeue that with great diligence and discretion the<note place="margin">What the Church is.</note> true Church must be discerned, by the name whereof many are too much abused. Therfore we affirme out of the worde of God, that the Churche is a company or congregation of the faithfull, which do agrée in following the word of God,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:27102:45"/>
and in imbracing true Religion, in the which also they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profite and go forward, grounding and confirming one another in the feare of God, who although they receiue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so great profite, yet must they daylie of necessitie seeke for remission of sinnes. And yet for all this will not denie but that manye hipocrites and reprobates are mixed with the faithfull, but yet their wickednesse can not take awaye the name the Church.</p>
                     <p n="28">28 Therfore in beléeuing of this thing, we also openly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that where the worde of God is not receiued, nor no profession of that obedience shewed that belongeth thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor no vse of the Sacraments, there (to speake properly) we can Iudge no Church to be. We therfore condemne the Papisticall Church bicause the pure truth of God is bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed out of the same, in the which the Sacramentes of faith are corrupted, falsified, or else quite abolished: in the which all superstition &amp; Idolatry is to be founde. And therfore we thinke that all they which do ioyne themselues to such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and do communicate with them, doe separate them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues from the body of Christ. Nothwithstanding bicause in the Papacy remaineth some Imitacion of the true church,<note place="margin">The Papacy.</note> and specially the substance of Baptisme, the efficacie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of dependeth not vpon him that ministreth the same, we graunt that they which are baptized in the same Popishe Church, haue no néede to be baptized againe: howbeit, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the corruptions with the which Baptime is there mixed, no man can offer his childe to be of them baptized but he must pollute him selfe.</p>
                     <p n="29">29 We do beléeue that the true Churche oughte to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned with that discipline, which our Lorde Iesus Christ<note place="margin">Discipline of the Church.</note> appointed, and to haue in the same, Pastors, Ministers, and Deacons, that the pure doctrine of the Gospell may be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, vice bridled, and poore &amp; afflicted persons (so far as nede shall require) comforted.</p>
                     <p n="30">30 We do beléeue that all true Pastors, wheresoeuer they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27102:46"/>
be placed, haue power and authoritie all a like, vnder that onely head, and chiefe vniuersall Bishop Iesus Christ: And therfore that it is lawfull for no Church to chalenge vnto it selfe imperie or rule ouer another.</p>
                     <p n="31">31 We do beleue that it is vnlawfull for anye man of his owne authoritie to presume to take vpon him the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, but ought rather to be chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the same by lawfull election, if so be the same may be had. We adde<note place="margin">The lawful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of mi nisters.</note> this <hi>(<hi>if</hi>)</hi> bicause sometime (as in oure time also) when the Church hath bene troubled and persecuted, many haue béen constrayned without ordinarie callyng, by the motion of Gods holye spirite, to take vpon them to repaire the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnesse of the decayed Church: notwithstanding howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the matter be, we doe beléeue that this rule ought to be followed, that all pastors and ministers maye haue suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent testimonie of their calling.</p>
                     <p n="32">32 We doe beléeue it to be necessarie that they which are chosen to be the chiefe ouerséers of some one Churche, doe diligently waye and consider among them selues, by what waye or meanes, the whole body of the same Churche may be best gouerned. Notwithstanding so that they swerue in no poynt from that which our Lorde Iesus Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And this letteth not but that certaine places maye haue their peculiar and speciall institutions to them apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining as it shall séeme best.</p>
                     <p n="33">33 And we doe exclude all humane inuentions and lawes whiche vnder the pretence of the worshippe of God doe bynde the consciences of men, and we doe onely admit and alow those which tend to the maintaining of concord, &amp; the keping of euerye one in due obedience, in the which thing we thinke it méete, to follow that which our Lord &amp; sauiour<note place="margin">Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> Christ appointed, concerning excommunication, the which with the circumstances also we allow &amp; thinke necessarye.</p>
                     <p n="34">34 We doe beléeue that there are Sacramentes ioyned to the woorde, for further confirmations sake, as pledges and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:27102:46"/>
seales of the grace of God, by which our infyrme and weake faith may be stayed and holpen. For we confesse these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall<note place="margin">Sacraments.</note> signes to be such, that God by them worketh, with the power of his holy spirit, that nothing there might be set before vs in vaine. Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we doe thinke that al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substance &amp; veritie of them resteth in Christ Iesu, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they be separated, they are nothing but vayne shadowes.</p>
                     <p n="35">35 We doe confesse that there belong onely two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to the whole Church, of the which the first is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,<note place="margin">Baptisme.</note> giuen vnto vs to testifie our adoption, bycause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are grafted into the body of Christ, as beyng washed with his bloud, and are also renewed to holynesse of life, by his spirite. This also we affirme, that although we are but once baptized, yet notwithstanding the fruite of Baptisme doth appertaine to the race of our whole life, to the ende that this promise mighte be sealed in vs by a sure and certaine seale, namely, that Christ will be alway our sanctification, righteousnesse, and redemption. Furthermore, althoughe Baptisme be a Sacramente of fayth and repentaunce, yet notwithstanding seyng God doth recken and accounte the children wyth the parentes to be of his Church, we affirme that infantes borne of holy and godly parents, ought, by the authoritie of Christ to be baptized.</p>
                     <p n="36">36 We affirme that the holy Supper of the Lord, which is the other Sacrament, is a testimony vnto vs of our vnion<note place="margin">The Lords Supper.</note> with our Lorde Iesus Christ, bicause he did not thinke it sufficient for vs, onely to dye, and to be raysed agayne the third day, for our sinnes, but also féedeth vs still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth vs with his fleshe and bloude, that being made one with him, we maye be partakers of life with him. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be now in heauen, and shall abide there vntill he come to iudge the worlde, yet notwithstanding we beleue that he doth by the secrete and incomprehensible power of his spirite nouryshe and quicken vs wyth the substance of hys fleshe and bloude, apprehended by faithe.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:27102:47"/>
And we saye that this is done spiritually, not that we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to put fantasie and imagination in steade of efficacie and veritie, but bicause this misterie of our vnion, and knot made betwene Christ and vs, is sodaine and far paste our reache, that by no meanes we are able to comprehende it. To be shorte, séeing it is a thing so diuine and heauenly, it can not be by any meanes apprehended but by faith onely.</p>
                     <p n="37">37 We beléeue (as it is saide before) that the Lord as well in the Supper as in Baptisme, doth giue vnto vs in verye déede, that is to saye, truely and effectually, whatsoeuer is therin figured Sacramentally, and therfore we ioyne with signes the true possession and fruition of that thing, which is so offered vnto vs. Therfore we affirme that they which bring a pure fayth as a vessell, with them, to the holy table of the Lorde, doe verily receiue that which the signes doe there testifie: for the body and bloude of Iesus Christ is no lesse meate and drinke to the soule, than bread and wine is the sustenance of the body.</p>
                     <p n="38">38 In like maner we saye that the element of water, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be corruptible doth truely testifie vnto vs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward washing of our soule in the bloude of Iesus Christ by the efficacie of the holy Ghost. And therefore we reiecte all those fanaticall persons, which reiect these outward signes, when as our Sauiour Christ him selfe spake these wordes saying: <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This Cup is my Bloud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="39">39 We beléeue that it is Gods will that the world shoulde be ruled and gouerned, by lawes and politique gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there may be some meanes by which the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate<note place="margin">Magistrates.</note> desires of the worlde may be bridled and restrained: and that therefore he hath appointed kingdomes, common weales, and other kindes of dignities, whither they come by inheritance or otherwise? and not onely that, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer pertaineth to right and equitie, the author whereof he himselfe woulde be counted. Therefore also he hath put the swerde into the hands of Magistrates, to punishe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:27102:47"/>
not onely against the seconde table, but also against the first. Wherefore we must for his sake which is the author of this order, not onely suffer that they may rule whome he hath set ouer vs, but also honour and reuerence them as his Ministers appointed by him to take that lawfull and holy office vpon them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we affirme that lawes and statutes ought to be obeyed, tribute and taxes payed, and all other burthens discharged, and voluntary subiection yelded to magistrates, yea although they be infidels, so that God be not dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Therefore we detest all those that denie rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and refuse to obey, desiring a confusion and to haue all things common, and going about to ouerthrow all lawe and good order. This therefore was the plaine and simple confession of the faythfull Christians of the reformed Churches of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and a plaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that Doctrine for the which they were so greatly persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Popishe Bishops.</p>

those which before were assembled, came together againe into the same place. And then the Chauncelor declared that it was the kings pleasure that euerye man shoulde freelye vtter his minde, but firste of all they of the priuie counsell, that by their example and beginning the reste might more boldely and cheerefully goe forwarde. Then <hi>Ianus Monlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Valentia,</hi> the last cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seller being commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded first of all to vtter his minde: <hi>Gasper Castillon</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall strait way stepte vp, came to the king, and when he had reuerently saluted him, he deliuereed vnto hym two supplications, written in their name, which called themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,<note place="margin">The supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the faithfull deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the Admiral to the King.</note> 
                     <hi>The faithfull Christians dispersed through diuers places of Fraunce.</hi> Both the whiche supplications at the Kyngs commaundement were read, the summe and effecte wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was: that they had good occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offered them by this their assemblye to offer their supplications and their humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes to the King, praying and beséeching him that he woulde haue regarde to the greatest parte of his subiectes, who were euill intreated euen vntill that present time, and that for this cause onelye: for that they mynded to frame their lyues according to the prescript rule of the pure word of God. Affyrming also that they soughte for nothing else than to haue their doctrine examyned by the same rule of Gods worde, and that their cause might throughly be way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and considered: that all men mighte knowe for certaine howe greatly they did hate and abhorre those seditious and heretical opinions with the which hitherto they were false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burthened.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:27102:49"/>
their owne fantasie, lust, and desire, had shed the blood of poore men vndeseruedly and most vniustly, &amp; had brought to passe to make a stay, that their requests and supplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s might at no time come to the kings eares. Wherefore they humbly beséeche his grace that he would maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende his poore subiects against the wicked crueltie of these men: for which cause, they acknowledge him to be their King, and will render vnto him, according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, all due and seruisable obedience: and doe commit them selues wholy with all theirs, vnder his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trociny and safegarde, and also doe account him, their bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, refuge and staye. Protesting before God and hys Maiestie, that they neuer intended any thing against hym, or to omit that loyall duetie and obedience, which they owe vnto him, for whose prosperitie, they daylie make their prayers vnto God. Adding moreouer that they sought for no euill libertie, or to haue sinne vnpunished: but rather that they might haue libertie to liue so néere as they coulde, according to the Gospell which they professed: and that in this thing they might not feare the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest aduersaries. Againe therefore they beséech and praye his Maiestie that it would please him to graunt them leaue to heare the worde of God, and to receiue his Sacraments, vntill the matter were more fully wayed and considered of the Counsell: and that to this end and vse, they might haue Churches graunted vnto them, least their congregation or assembly being priuate and secrete, might come into false and euill suspicion.</p>
                  <p>This libell being red, the Admiral desired the King that he would take it in good part, bringing in diuers testimonies of his faithfulnesse towardes the kings Maiestie: As, when he was in <hi>Normandy</hi> to prouide things necessarye for the Scottishe warre, and was appoynted by the Quéenes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement diligently to inquire out the dealings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of those which were called <hi>Faithfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that they rendred certaine reasons of their doings, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised vnto them to offer their supplications vnto the Kings maiestie. To this the King aunswered, that he had diuers good and notable testimonies of him, and of his deserts, and also that he did take all things that he had done in very good part. And then the King commaunded againe the Bishop of <hi>Valentia</hi> to speake his iudgement. Who in effect vttered this which followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>DIOCLESIAN</hi> was wont to say, that the state and<note place="margin">The sentence of the Bishop of Valentia.</note> condition of those Princes was miserable, which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deceyued by those, in whome onely they reposed their trust: bicause they forsaking the gouernement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and being as it were, drowned in their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, might so be easily deceyued.

The which being appeased, the King did wisely foresée howe to prouide for the like to come, and that for this cause he had caused this assembly to be made, in the which there were so manye good men that sought the Kings quietnesse and profite, that it coulde not be but that his Maiesties desires should be satisfied in euery poynt.

And thus the eyes of the Churches, that is to saye, the Bishops, were blynded, and the pyllers of the Church cast downe to the grounde. The Ministers therefore of this and that sect, vsing the occasion of these perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and troubles, haue omitted nothing to winne the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto them. And as for Curates, they are couetous,<note place="margin">Curates.</note> vnlearned, and conuersant in all things sauing in doing of their dutie: and as the most part of them haue gotten their Priesthoode by wicked meanes, so doe they most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily retaine the same still: for Cardinals and Bishops let not to make their seruaunts, their Cookes, and horsekée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Priestes, whereby Ecclesiasticall persons, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ieast and laughing stocke to euery man.

                  <p>And you (sayth he) O Quéenes, graunt me this one thing,<note place="margin">He speaketh to Queenes, namely to the Kings mother and the Kings wife.</note> I beséech you (if I maye be bolde to beséech you) that you woulde bring to passe, that in steade of prophane and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semely songs, all your traine and retinue maye sing godlye and vertuous Psalmes to the prayse of God: Knowe ye for a suretie, that God doth allowe or like of no companie or congregation, in the which he is not praysed and extolled. To this he added much more, by which he proued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was against reason, that the singing of Psalmes shoulde be<note place="margin">The singing of Psalmes.</note> forbidden, if the interpretation of them, which was noted about them, were not allowed, he sayde, it was better that the errors were noted, than that the whole worke shoulde be so reiected. And he shewed also that the Psalmes were made, not only for the publike vse of Churches, but also to be daily and priuately vsed. And therfore in forbidding the singing of Psalmes, there is iust occasion offered to sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons to calumniate and speake euill: For nowe in this we striue not against men, but against God, whose<note place="margin">The seconde remedie to appease trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> prayses are so hindered and let. The seconde remedie is a generall Councell, the which the Fathers alwayes vsed as a remedie to pacifie and appease the dissentions of the Church. I sée not howe the Popes conscience can be quiet, nor to be in rest the space of one houre, séeing he séeth so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny soules to perishe through the diuersitie of opinions, and

yet for all that séeketh no meanes how to remedie the same. But if it shoulde come to passe, that the Generall Councell shoulde be let or hindered, then the King shall doe his dutie in calling a Councell of his owne Nation, after the ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his auncetors, the Kings of this Realme, as of <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>

Nowe, they must be called to be of this Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, which are counted to be the best learned men among them of that sect: and learned men of the contrarie part also, that they maye dispute togither of the principall groundes of Religion nowe in controuersie. Thus did <hi>Theodotius</hi> the Emperour at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> although they were iustly condemned by the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> and others: and afterwardes the Emperour woulde haue the actes of the Councell handled before him, to be openlye publyshed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade.</p>
                  <p>But concerning the paines and punishments which were<note place="margin">The Gospell of diuers men diuersly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued.</note> hitherto appointed, this (he sayde) was his opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and iudgement: That doctrine, for the which, all this trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth, is of diuers men; diuersly receyued. Some, so soone as they hearde of the same perfecte and approued doctrine, and had in no poynt imbraced &amp; receyued the same, thought it sufficient to knowe this one thing, namely, that no man ought to heare Masse: and that it was lawfull to eate fleshe in Lent: that men were not bounde to Auricular confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and that it was lawfull to speake euill of Priestes. These men vndiscretely went about to defend that doctrine by force of armes: but to be short, these men vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, were mere seditious, and are by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be excused. For if these kinde of men were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or by any maner of meanes true receyuers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, they ought to remember, that the Apostle commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to praye for Kings, and to render all obedience vnto them, yea, though they were cruell and wicked: also they ought to call to minde, that neuer in the Church, specially
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:27102:52"/>
in the time of the twelue great persecutions, in the which an infinite number of Christians were put to death, there was any one man founde, which went about to defend his cause by force of armes: but rather ouercame the crueltie of their Emperours, with their pacience. Another sort of men there are also, which imbrace this doctrine, and retain the same, with such zeale, loue, and obedience towardes God and the King, that they woulde in nothing offende them. By the life and death of these men, it is manifest, that they haue a desire to attayne saluation, and to finde the way that leadeth to the same: and when they haue founde that way, they neither feare losse of lyfe and goods, nor any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of punishment, but to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vtmost of their power prosecute that way. Wherfore, they are not to be counted among the number of those wicked professors before spoken off, nor to be numbred in the companie of seditious persons. As yet we see it playne inough that those punishmentes which haue bene deuised, haue done no good: but on the contrarie part, their patience which they manifestly shewed in the middest of the fierie flames, hath stirred vp many to haue a liking, and to fauour their cause. Herevpon it came to passe, that they which neuer hearde of the same doctrine for the which they suffer, were desirous to vnderstande what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it was, and at the length hauing intelligence of the same, they did receiue it with no lesse affection &amp; zeale, than others had done, being ready by the ensample of others, to suffer death for it.

                  <p>Although that matter which is propounded vnto vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate<note place="margin">The oration of the Bishop of Vienna.</note> vpon, is very hard &amp; long: bicause it is left at large, and is general, &amp; therfore the more vneasie to be concluded, séeing we must come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is generall, to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities: in discussing wherof, the diuersitie of Iudges will bring (as it is likely) great varietie of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, we must hold this as a sure &amp; certaine rule in the discussing of all matters: namely, that after long consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; debating of things, some certaintie at the length must be concluded: &amp; that there cannot be a more pestilent mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, &amp; mortal plague in the gouernment of common wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, than to wander among the diuersitie of opinions, &amp; to appoint and retaine no certaine thing. And if this rule, so greatly commended of wise men, &amp; so prudently obserued of Kings, of common weales, &amp; of Princes, which euer at any time florished, ought to stirre vs vp to follow the same way and rule: truly, the necessitie &amp; the extremitie in the which we are, hath brought vs into such a strayt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we cannot do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise though we would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as all men of sound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wil confesse, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter cannot abide in that state, in the which it is now, any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. But lest I be tedious vnto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will come to the matter. The tumults which of late haue hapned, the feare of newe things, the complaintes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of many men, and the feare also and dreade that is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27102:53"/>
among men, ought to stirre vs vp to séeke and prouide for remedies in time, which may defende vs from these great troubles, which else wil make a great alteration of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> state. And that I may briefly conclude this matter, I thinke that there are two things, as it were two pillers, by which, the<note place="margin">Two pillers of the kingdome</note> state of the kingdome may be fortified and borne vp: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the integritie of Religion, and the good will of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The which, if they were stable and firme, we néede not doubt the safetie of things: but if they be once cast downe (as it is to be scared) there must néedes followe great ruine and destruction of that hie and notable building. These two things therfore must be stablished and confirmed to prelient that ruine which is like to come: and to this ende (as both common profite and necessitie requireth) all our Councels, reasons, deuises and deliberations ought to tende: séeing herevpon both the due obedience to the King, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the people dependeth. The which things are so ioyned togither, that the one of them by anye meanes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stande without the other. As concerning necessitie, we must measure and wey the same by hauing a respect and consideration of the King, and of his principall members or ministers, which vnder him gouerne the people, and of others also who ought to obey. First of all therfore, it is the<note place="margin">The office of a King</note> Kings duty to wey &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider whervnto he is called, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath giuen vnto him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of so great a people. In so doing, he shal find that the Lord hath chosen him to be a King to this ende, that he might kéepe the people vnder the knowledge, feare, and obedience of God, that he might gouerne them by good and wholesome lawes, and also to saue and defende them from the enimie: and in all thinges to shewe himselfe so studious and carefull for the common wealth, that he may be honoured and be beloued as a father of the people. For this is the onely difference betwéene a King &amp; a Tyrant: The King reigneth and ruleth with the<note place="margin">A Tyrant.</note> good will, loue, and consent of the people: but the tyrant
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:27102:53"/>
ruleth by violence and force. In a King therefore a man may behold the ordinance of God, the author and preseruer of Common welthes and humaine societie: In the tyrant the force and violence of the Diuel, who goeth about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert that ende to the which God hath ordeyned Kings and Potentates. Herevpon it commeth, that as the King is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all men, and hated of none, but of wicked men and Rebels: so the tyrant is feared of all men without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore hated of all, according to the olde Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, <hi>Quem metuunt, oderunt,</hi> him whome men feare, they hate. Therefore if the King will be loued, and obey the commaundement of God, and retaine the obedience and loue of his subiectes, he must of necessitie stablishe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he must heare the complaintes of the people, and must prouide for them remedies, as a father prouideth for his children: séeing that he is set in the kingdome to that ende, neyther can he doe otherwise, except he will make himselfe vnworthy of the grace of God, by which he confesseth that he doth reigne: as both examples of holy Scripture, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall examples also do plentifully declare.</p>
                  <p>The first bond therfore which confirmeth, knitteth, and<note place="margin">Religion.</note> retaineth the obedience of kings, is Religion: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else than to know God, as it becommeth vs, that is to say, according to his prescript wil. And now séeing we ought to acknowledge him, to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creator, author, &amp; preseruer of all things, it must néedes folow, that al our actions ought to tende to the setting forth of his glory. Whervpon it cometh to passe, that Religion, which is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> most assured bonde of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions, and of the true obedience of subiects towards their Kings, ought to be reformed, preserued, &amp; maintained. But bicause that bonde is dissolued and broken in these our dayes, both by the malice &amp; wickednesse of some, and also by the doting madnesse and folly of other some, and by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our time: it is no doubt, an euident demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and token of the wrath of God, which threateneth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:27102:54"/>
vnto vs great destruction, not farre hence, vnlesse it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for out of hande. For besides the varietie of doctrines, who euer sawe the ancient discipline of the Church so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably abused, contemned, and deiected: errors so dispersed and rooted euery where, offences and stumbling blockes so common, the life of Priests so corrupt, and so much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and also so many and great tumultes among the people. The way to remedie this great euill and mischiefe, is a generall Councell, the only ancient &amp; vsuall meane: but as it plainely appeareth, that is not to be hoped for, and that<note place="margin">Why a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell is not to be looked for.</note> for two causes: The one is, It is not in our power to bring to passe, that the Pope, the Emperour, the Kings, and the Germanes, shoulde by &amp; by agree, of the time, the place, and maner of holding of a Councell: in which things there are oftentimes great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies. The other cause is this, Such is the disease and mischief, &amp; it so grieueth euery part of the kingdome, that there is small hope of any remedie: Like as if a man troubled with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall feuer, or with some other grieuous disease, which requireth letting of bloude, or some other present remedie, cannot tarie to haue the Phisitions help which dwelleth farre of, bicause of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great vncertainty of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. Therfore we must bring to passe to call a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel<note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> of our Nation, as it was before concluded, the which also the King hath alredy openly promised: And this parliament must of necessitie be called, both for the necessitie which so vrgeth the miserable Church, being brought to so great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, &amp; also for the kings estimation and credit, who by his owne letters hath openly giuen forth &amp; declared y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same: but specially bicause there hath nothing happened since that time which might let or hinder the same: but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part, there grow new things &amp; occasions daily, which do vrge and driue vs to séeke to call a Parliament, vnlesse we could be contented to lose all that we haue.

The Pope vehemently withstode this thing, affirming that there was no néede to call a Councell, neither for doctrine, séeing that al new opinions are refuted &amp; condemned of the ancient Councels, neither yet for Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall discipline, which was so wel appointed, that it was sufficient only to obserue &amp; kepe the decrées written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the same. But the Emperour being not satisfied with this answere, replied againe, that it coulde not be, but that the great assembly of the generall Councell, shoulde bring great profit, &amp; doe much good, both to cut off that euill which daily increased more and more: and also to repaire and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme those things which were very well already receyued and allowed, &amp; to hinder &amp; cut off that which might abolishe them by discontinuance and want of vse. And in this minde concerning the procuring of a Councel he continued, so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as he liued: In the which matter he founde no greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries than those, who shoulde haue set him forwarde in so commendable an enterprise.</p>
                  <p>Our auncetours were woont euery fiue yeares to call ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels, as it is to be séene in the decrees. But as touching priuate Councels, or Councels assembled out of our owne Nation, we shall find in the histories of the Kings of Fraunce, that they were called in euerye Kings tyme, beginning at the raigne of <hi>Clodouaeus,</hi> vntill the tyme of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and so forth, vntill we come to <hi>Charles</hi> the feue uth his dayes. The which Parliamentes, or assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, were sometimes gathered togither from euery part of the whole kingdome, sometimes from one halfe of the Realme, sometimes but out of certaine Prouinces onely. By which Parliaments it was sildome séene but that there ensued great fruite and profite to the reformation both of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and maners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:27102:55"/>Let vs not staye therefore any longer at the matter, but followe the examples and wayes of our elders: and let vs not be afrayde to be accused to be bringers in of newe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, séeing that we haue so many examples to followe: but let vs assure our selues, that there must néedes follows thereof prosperous successe, séeing that God is alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with those which assemble themselues togither in hys feare and name. Neither let vs defer the time any more, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that necessitie doth so vrge vs, and séeing spéedie reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<note place="margin">Forewarnings of delolation to come.</note> is so greatly required. We haue many sorowful and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable examples to set before our eyes, which are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings vnto vs of great desolation to come, as the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable state and condition of the Churches of the Jewes, of the Greekes, of the Egyptians and Africans, the which in time past florished, but at this day they scarsly retain a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian name. For these causes I conclude that we must defer the time no lenger to call a Parliament, to remedie these things, without hauing any consideration or respect to those things which the Pope maye obiect as lettes against the same: séeing that both it is lawfull for vs so to doe, and also bicause our conseruation &amp; safetie is now in hazarde. For if any one part of the kingdome were lost, it is not in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes power to restore the same vnto vs againe. Whatsoeuer my happen or befall, we must not perish to fulfil the Popes minde: but must rather follow (at this time specially) that rule which God hath giuen vnto vs, and which our elders haue so oftentimes folowed. But yet truly while this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament shall be a preparing, I think it shall serue very wel for the purpose, if we prouide thre or foure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remedies, which may greatly further this our enterprise. The first is, of the Churches that Prelates maye remaine and abide in their Diocesses: and in this point let no man be borne withall. And here I think it good to put you in mind of the Italians, who enioying and occupying the thirde part of the benefites &amp; spirituall promotions of this kingdome, draw vnto <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

selues great profit, &amp; like horseleaches suck out our bloude, hauing no care at al to dwel vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their benefices. And laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs to scrone, we are so blinde that we cannot sée it: And if we chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to espie it, we are pacified againe by their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering words. If the King should hire a great multitude of souldiers, and giue them wages, and if they should abide stil at home, &amp; haue no care of their martiall affaires in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> war, had not then (think you) the King iust occasion to depryue them of their wages, &amp; to dismisse them? And thus truly doe our Prelates behaue themselues, who in the troublesome time of the Church, when heresies &amp; such like wickednesses were in diuers places sowne abrode (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which in dede is the greatest warre of the Church, being so much greater than the earthly warre, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helth of the soule surpasseth &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the helth of the body) sate notwithstanding in the midst of their pleasures, voyde of all care of their flockes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to their charge. The second remedie is, to shew &amp; declare by some notable &amp; manifest act, that we are fully perswaded, &amp; bent seriously to séeke a reformation, least the aduersaries should cauil &amp; say, that we call a Councel, not to reforme the Church, but to séeke our owne aduantage, &amp; to stablishe and confirme our owne prerogatiues &amp; priueledges. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which matter nothing séemeth to me more méete &amp; conuenient for vs, to declare that we haue an earnest care for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, than if we looke diligently about that nothing be done in the Church for money and bribes: to the ende that Babilonicall beast Couetousnesse, which hath<note place="margin">Couetousnes the Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call beast.</note> brought so many euils &amp; corruptions into the Church, may at the length vtterly be ouerthrowne. And so we shall finde a more easie waye to controuersies: and shall also stop the mouths of those that slaunder &amp; backbite vs. If any man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect &amp; say, that so great a matter cannot be brought to passe by so small a number of men as we are, without the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Generall Councell, we make vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this answere: namely, that there is no new or vnwanted thing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:27102:56"/>
brought in by vs, but we séeke to bring those things to passe which Christ hath plainly commanded, Councels determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; Kings the executors of Councels confirmed, &amp; which in our time also they which haue ben the best learned in the Romish Church, by their iudgementes haue allowed.

Herevpon they are called Simoniakes, which take vnto<note place="margin">Symoniakes.</note> themselues that vnlawful and forbidden game: of the which simonie or forbidden gaine, we haue so many examples both in the scriptures, &amp; also in the historie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ancient Church, that we shall not néede at this time, to make any longer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the same. And to say somwhat of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, how oftentimes was this forbidden, namely, that not onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, but also suspition of corruption, should be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye? Inso much that they which distributed &amp; gaue the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, were forbidden to giue it in the time of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, least they should séeme to giue their almes for the receiuing of the sacraments, as ye may reade in the Councel of <hi>Ancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane,</hi> and others. In like maner king <hi>Lodoicus,</hi> séeing that confusion créeping by little and little into the Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the Clergie shoulde abide and dwell in their Diocesses, and that no money euer after should be caried to Rome: shewing how greatly this chopping and chaunging did displease him: &amp; yet there was neuer any man that was counted a greater Catholike than he. Also Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the<note place="margin">Pope Paulus the thirde.</note> third, himselfe, in our time, séeing that many departed &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke the Church of Rome, and fearing that this mischiefe wold grow more &amp; more, was constrained by the continuall cries of the Protestantes, to confesse that there were many errors got into the Church, &amp; therfore commaunded certain men that were cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted notable in learning, to note diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what things were worthie of reformation, &amp; swore them
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:27102:56"/>
to hide nothing thereof from him: threatning them, that if they did not discharge their office throughly, they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the penaltie of excommunication. Among the rest to whome this charge was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, were these, <hi>Contarenus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contarenus.</note> who was made Cardinal in Germanie, for his dealing in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> notable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie: cardinal <hi>Theatinus,</hi> who after the same <hi>Paule</hi> the third was made Pope: Cardinall <hi>Sadoletus,</hi> &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall<note place="margin">Sadoletus.</note> 
                     <hi>Poole</hi> the Englishman: &amp; fiue others also, which for<note place="margin">Cardinall Poole.</note> their great learning were chosen to this office.

Neither would Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the fourth his successor, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was yet but Cardinal, establish that which he thought to be mete &amp; necessary. I omit that which <hi>Bernard</hi> &amp; other learned fathers haue said: only this I say, except we aply our minds, &amp; put our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to the tearing vp of this roote of al euil, Jesus Christ will descend from heauen with a whip in his hand to<note place="margin">Math. 27.

The third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie shal be, to confesse our faults, the which in dede is the first step to helth, &amp; to make the same manifest by publike &amp; generall fastings: the which maner was alwayes obserued in the olde Church, whensoeuer any great perill or daunger was like to come vpon the Church, as plague, famine, or warre: the which thrée euils in these our dayes inuade the realme togither.

Of the one part we saw the tumult of <hi>Ambaxia:</hi> on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other part, there were certain Preachers, which stirred vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to tumult, &amp; violently to set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to destroy &amp; banish those protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, vnder a pretence of godly seditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as though that Religion coulde or ought to be established by sedition. And thus there was greate offence committed on both parts, insomuch that many were slaine, which were thought to be Protestants. Moreouer, those protestants did greatly offend, enterprising many things rashly, to put away these iniuries offred vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, taking armes, therby violating the law of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> magistrate, which belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to no priuate perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> For the end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law is, to liue according vnto Gods wil, to hurt

no man, and to obey the lawe of Armes. Therfore the king is the maintainer of Gods law, and the moderator of wars, the which he may and ought to vse to the authoritie of the lawe, and to the punishing of rebelles and traitours. To be shorte, he counteth him selfe a king, who, although he be not ordained of God, yet of his owne will and authoritie moueth warre. And truely herevpon it followeth that he ought to be counted of all men as an enimy, and to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed as a breaker of Gods ordinance and publique power. For this cause I thinke it good that commaundement be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to inferior Magistrates, that they diligently attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their charge and offices, least some newe thing happen by their carelesse negligence. Hereby therefore it euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appéereth that the first bonde to preserue the kings estate is, so to establishe Religion, that no man may abuse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same at his owne pleasure, against the authoritie of the law, and the ende thereof, which is, that both God and the king maye be obeyed.</p>

                  <p>And to the ende it may euidentlye appéere that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes are such y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ought to be heard and examined of the assembly of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> States, I will shewe vnto you a generall reason, namely this: The extraordinarie taxes, tallages, &amp; <note place="margin">Tributes.</note> tributes haue so increased, that now the subiectes not onely are not able to beare this great burthen, but also not able to satisfie &amp; discharge those old duties which were before time accustomed to be payde. Is not this a complaint to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered &amp; talked of in the assembly of States? Seing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people complaineth of the same, and are by no maner of meanes any thing disburthened: but specially se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to heare the afflicted &amp; oppressed, is the beginning of consolation, &amp; to declare a readinesse and good will to ease the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is the greatest &amp; principall point to heale: the which at the least may stay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> least dispayring they shoulde séeke an alteration &amp; remedy. If on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary part, the king aledge for him self, the calamitie and trouble of the long continued warres, the diuers and manifolde charges and costes that grewe thereof, the scarsitie and emptinesse of his Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and also the greate arrerages and debte in the which he founde the Crowne when he came first to the same: Is not this a complaint to be considered and talked of in the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of States?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:27102:58"/>If the people alledge that the King oughte to maintaine himselfe and his traine by his yeerely reuenewes, and that he ought to hold and maintaine warres with his subsidies, and to set forth armies with his customes and tributes, the which things were for this cause graunted in time paste.</p>
                  <p>If in like maner the king declare that he found almost al his demeines distracted, deuided, and conueyed awaye, the greatest part of the subsidies taken vp before hande, and yet he himselfe, greatly burthened and indebted, to the ende he might obtaine by the consent of the people, that those bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens being somewhat eased, mighte remaine as yet for a time, vntil meanes and wayes, which are dayly deuised to recouer againe his demeines, may be brought to effect.</p>
                  <p>But is there no other better waye to be had to bring things to passe than by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> assembly of the States? To speake briefely, if there be anye maner of complaint whatsoeuer, pretenced or otherwise, where can it be better put forth tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the generall assembly of the States? and if it be a iuste<note place="margin">The comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>There is also another consideration of necessitie, wherof there arise great daungers, seing in these straites and ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, there is no ordinary remedie vsed. First of all, the King is scarcely obeyed in his <hi>Edictes</hi> and statutes: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is one of the greatest signes of sedition. For when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not heard in those things wherof they do complaine, it commeth therevpon that they cast away all hope to haue redresse, and so they fall into such desperation, that they dare enterprise to ease and vnburden them selues, without the hauing of any consideration of the kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement or his officers: yea they arme &amp; prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues against all perils, as though nothing were more sharpe &amp; intollerable.</p>
                  <p>On y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other part, they which say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are greued, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously take this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, &amp; increase y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same: &amp; do al
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:27102:59"/>
that they can, to amplifie and enlarge that with newe lyes which they haue once falsely tolde and reported for a truth. Herevpon commeth the vnhonest publishing and casting<note place="margin">Slaunderous bookes.</note> abrode of slaunderous bookes and publique writings. And the people being exulcerated and vexed with their owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, willingly receiueth that which appertaineth to their disease, and by the ignorance of the kings matters, doe flyde and fall into these sinister and wrong opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Of the which things to haue so great and manifolde destructions arise, is great daunger, many examples whereof we see dayly. To auoide which destructions, it séemeth most necessarie to call an assembly of the states. And although the causes hytherto spoken of shewe no necessitie, yet not withstanding the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the assembly of these men is such, that it ought to be wished for of all men. For what is more to be desired, &amp; méete for a yong King to gouerne his kingdome, than to be taught the things that concerne his kingdome, that he may know the maners of his people, and those things also which<note place="margin">A lesson for Kinges and Queenes.</note> belong to the order and gouerning them. Therefore let him learne to spende as he may and not to excéede: and let hym play the part of a good shepherd, who in shearing of his shepe doth not flea and pull of skin and all, but leaueth the skinne that he maye receiue the fléece at another time againe, and let him consider that whatsoeuer he spendeth more than his ordinarie reuenewes, tribute, custome and tallage, is as it were the substance and bloud of the people whome he is set to gouerne by Gods appointment.</p>
                  <p>Herevpon shall come honest and godly education: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon shall come, both good beginnings and happie successe of all things: and at the last the king shal get vnto him that Magnificent name with great glorye, as, to be called, <hi>
                        <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> The father of the countrey,</hi> as <hi>King Lodowic</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twelth<note place="margin">Lodouicus. xii. pater pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae.</note> was, which leaueth a notable memorie behinde to all the posteritie, &amp; is more to be desired than the Laureat crowne for victorie in warre. Another commoditie also will ensue
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27102:59"/>
and that is this. The people of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> being chéered vp and comforted by this demonstration, they will séeke all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be able to ease those burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: for they once vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their kings businesse and néede, will imploye all that euer they haue to doe their king seruice. But we must take héede least that prompte willingnesse, being to often styrred, doe not turne at the laste to impacient and brutishe madnesse.</p>
                  <p>And these commodities are ioyned with great honestie, for that the king, if it please him, maye in the beginning of his raigne, examine olde customes and lawes, the which is the onely waye to correct and amende matters that are out of order. For althoughe the king alone be the author of the law, &amp; he onely can rule, yet notwithstanding those things which he hath constituted and ordained by this assembly of the states, are of greater force and efficacie: and those will the people more willingly obey and kéepe, bicause they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande that they were confirmed by many mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Judgements: wheras otherwise, onely a fewe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assembled together, they Judge that the matter was done according to the mind and phantasie of a fewe, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not examined &amp; wayed which might haue bene brought against the same. For by these meanes the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue preserued them selues and the kingdome vnto this daye: neither is there anye well ordered kingdome, in the which this order of assemblies is not obserued: the which ought to be of great waight and highly estemed.</p>
                  <p>For seing so many kings do confesse that they féele and perceiue so many commodities to spring and growe of thys good order, and that they doe counte the same the staye and strength of their scepter, we can not certainely well and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly departe from so ancient &amp; commendable a custome. And as for the contrarie reasons which were wonte to be broughte to hinder these assemblies, they can preuaile no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, seing the perill of those things which happened
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:27102:60"/>
at another time are by no meanes to be feared, the Kings authoritie at this day being so firmely established, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the counsell of the Quéene, and by so many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents of Princes and Nobles, that if these reasons might be receiued and take place, there is no doubt but that all their practises would be voide and frustrate which thinke it good and persuade themselues that it is necessary to haue a new alteration of the common weale, and shoulde be a most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die remedy to mittigate &amp; take away al perturbations. The<note place="margin">The ende of this oration.</note> which one thing we muste with all diligence possible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for.</p>
                  <p>And thus he made an end of his oration: In the repeating whereof we haue béene some what long, but yet for all that the matter is worthy of repetition, and not disagreing from our purpose.</p>
                  <p>The day following the rest declared their Judgementes, and first began the Admirall, and the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Admirall.</note> made an ende. But this was the sentence of the Admirall <hi>Shatillion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> namely: that he would haue had that those sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications which he had offered to the king, shoulde be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed of those in whose name they were put forthe: who answered, that they were readye either in a small or great number to subscribe those supplications which they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited: yea, they sayde that they would assemble themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues together to the number of fiftie thousand before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings Maiestie, if so it pleased him. But there can nothing be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised more pestilent, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prince to stand in feare of his subiectes, &amp; to be in perill of them: &amp; in like maner the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to haue an euill opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Prince, and to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of their king. Also he saide that it was ill prouided to bring vp a yong prince in that feare, &amp; also to giue those oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> subiects of fearing. At the last he concluded that his sentence was, that the errors of the Church shoulde be taken awaye, that the garde lately giuen to the king should be remoued, and that there shoulde be called forthwith an
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:27102:60"/>
assembly of the States.</p>
                  <p>Thus when the Admirall had made an ende, the Duke of Guise taking occasion vpon that which he had spoken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus, saying, that it was not wel saide of some that the<note place="margin">The sentence of the Duke of Guise.</note> king ought not to be so &amp; so brought vp, when as he is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ordered, &amp; specially by the Queene his mother by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is indued, as it were with a certaine fulnesse of all vertues. And as touching that which was spoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the increasing of the Garde, he said that he himself did mislike alwayes of the same, vntill certaine did moue a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition &amp; put them selues in armes, which seemed to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended altogether against the kings maiestie. But wheras it is commonly reported that this sedition was not moued against the king, but against manye of his ministers &amp; offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that is a vaine cloake, &amp; nothing answering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For there is not any one of vs that euer hurt one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by priuate offences, or harmes. But they beare all that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred against vs for the executing of our offices, which we haue by the kings authoritie and leaue: and therefore to speake more truely, they hate not vs but the king.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore he said, he sawe no reason, why that number which was newly added to the Garde shoulde be remoued and taken away.</p>
                  <p>And as touching Religion, he saide, that he stoode to the Judgement of more learned men tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he him self was: how beit this one thing he would protest &amp; professe, that no cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels at any time should so preuaile with him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should bring him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ancient Religion of his elders, &amp; specially fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his beliefe of the holy sacrament of the Altar. Finally, he said concerning the assembly of the States, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the same to the kings maiesties will and pleasure, &amp; to like or dislike of the same with him.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his sentence vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which were offred to the king by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admiral, saying, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were nothing lesse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obedient &amp; faithful, howsoeuer
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:27102:61"/>
they boasted them selues. For so long as the King will like<note place="margin">The sentence of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Lorain.</note> of their opinions and sects, or at least wise suffer them, they will shewe them selues obedient to the king.</p>
                  <p>But I appeale (sayth he) to the Judgements of all men in this matter, whether it be more méete to follow the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of these Jolly fellowes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the authoritie of the king. To graunt them Churches, were to allowe their Idolatry, which the king could not doe without manifest perill of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. And as concerning a generall Councell, or a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell assembled together out of our owne Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not sée (saith he) by any meanes how it should be necessarie, seing that it should be called onely to reforme the maners of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ecclesiasticall persons, the which might be done with lesse businesse a great deale, namely by particular admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And as touching that which else appertained to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he saide that the same had bene so oftentimes esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished and confyrmed, that he wished that onely to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed which had béene hitherto obserued and appointed, for so much as all assemblies of Councels whatsoeuer, can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynte no more than the obseruation of those things that haue béene kept alreadie. And where as it was sayde that they which should subscribe their names to those supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they had put forth, would assemble them selues together to the number of fiftie thousand, to that he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the king might set against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ten thousand me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Religion. But it is manifest (saith he) of what minde they are, by their railing libels which they scatter abroade in all places against euery man. Among which great number of<note place="margin">The Cardinall of Loraine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth to get ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor &amp; fame by keeping libels that were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroade.</note> libels, he saide, that he had in his handes fiue and twentie, which he diligently kept, as a testimonie of great honour, bycause he was euill spoken of by those villanous knaues, trusting that they should be Monuments of his eternal and euerlasting praise. Therefore he wished that those sedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; troublesome persons mighte be most seuerely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and specially they which woulde put them selues in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:27102:61"/>
armes as many had begon. But, he said he thought it good that they should sustaine no punishment which frequented those sermons withoute armour, and onely for consciencs sake of Religion, which sang psalmes, &amp; went not to Masse, and such like: Adding moreouer that he was very sorie for the sharpnesse and crueltie of those punishments which had béen hitherto vsed, protesting that he would most willingly spende his owne life, if it might doe any good, to bring them into the right way. Affirming also that Bishops and other learned men oughte to indeuour them selues to bring this thing to passe, according to the commaundement of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ in the Gospell, saying <hi>Reproue thy brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene</hi>

For it is verye profitable to call and assemble all the states together, that all men may perceiue and sée how wel the Realme is gouerned. And thus he made an ende.</p>
                  <p>When they had thus vttered their sentences and minds, the King and Quéene gaue thankes to the whole assembly, whose Counsell they saide they were readye to followe, graunting vnto them that, whereupon they had concluded, namely, <hi>That all the states of the Realme, should be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled togither, and that if there coulde not be a generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, there shoulde be with all speede a Nationall Councell.</hi> Therefore they determined and concluded that the states of the Realme should be at <hi>Meldis,</hi> the tenth day of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moneth of December nexte comming, excepte it shoulde please the

And that the States belonging to euerye prouince should make in their prouince, an assembly and consultation particular before that time, to the ende that those things which should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated of in the general assemblies, might be vnderstoode. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that bycause it was in a maner agréed, of a generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, betwéene the Pope, the Emperour, and the Christian princes, the Bishops should come the tenth day of Ianuary next comming to the king, that they might agrée &amp; conclude of the sending to the generall Councel, or else of the hauing of a particular and Nationall Councell.</p>
                  <p>And that in the meane time the Bishops should get them to their Diocesses, both to prepare them selues, and also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to note and marke those things which lacke refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

                  <p>This was the conclusion of that consultation, the which shall appéere wonderfull if we consider the state of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times.

                  <p>The Magistrates were ready to take &amp; receiue hir &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the prison dores to bring hir in. Straight after this also was <hi>Hieroine Grostotius</hi> the Gouernour of <hi>Aurelias</hi> taken, in whose house the king lodged, being accused of negligence and stouth in searching out the heretikes: Howbeit he was quit and discharged of this matter by the decrée &amp; Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Senate of <hi>Paris.</hi> But the <hi>Andelote,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had saluted the King and the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> &amp; had excused himselfe by

the disobedience of the French hoast of footemen, departed in very good time, otherwise as the most likly report went, he should haue bene taken with the Prince.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time there were subtile deuises and craftie meanes inuented to assault and trouble the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> And when Iudges were chosen oute of the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>Fagus,</hi> and <hi>Viollaeus,</hi> &amp; the Lieutenant of <hi>Thou,</hi> the kings Solicitour was commaunded to open the cace now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, and to procede with the same. But the Prince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging for himselfe his noble bloud &amp; princely state, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with them vpon this point, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ought not to be iudged of them, but rather of the king him selfe &amp; of no other, in the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Peeres and Nobles of the Realme beyng assembled together. Therfore he saide that he appealed to the King. Then the appeale was brought vnto the Priuye Counsell, the which appeale, they said was nothing, and of no force: And this was done often times. But at the laste they concluded, that excepte the Prince woulde answere before those Iudges, he should be condemned of hie treason.</p>
                  <p>Then the Prince of <hi>Condes</hi> wife desired of the King that so much libertie might be graunted to hir husband, as to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> learned counsell.

The Prince also required y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it might be lawful for him, beside these two counsellers, to consult &amp; confer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his two brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> &amp; the Cardinal of <hi>Burbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp; also with his wife, &amp; to ioyne with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what vmpires &amp; witnesses soeuer it shoulde please y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, affirming y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was very loth to doe any thing without his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, specially in a matter of so great waite. The which request notwithstanding was denied him: only he obtained leaue to write vnto them his minde.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27102:65"/>
At the length being come to the matter in controuersie, he said to his counsellers that were present, that the affliction which he now suffered, was not laid vpon him by God, for that he had gone about to worke any thing against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings maiestie, but rather that by this affliction he might trye his constancie. Also he said that he did not thinke him selfe to be Captiue, seing that he inioyed the fredome of minde, and a pure and sound conscience: but rather that he thought those to be captiues which had their mindes &amp; consciences bound and clogged with the burthen of their sinnes and wickednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in a body set at libertie.</p>
                  <p>When he had thus spoken he gaue certaine notes of the defence of his cause vnto his Counsellers. For king Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the subtill meanes and false persuasions of the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> was fully persuaded that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> conspired his death, and that therefore he was giltie of treason and worthy to suffer condigne punishment for the same.</p>
                  <p>Therefore while the bloudy slaughter was a preparing, and whilest all men loked to sée great things come to passe, beholde sodaine and vnloked for alterations happen. For the king had a ceataine paine and disease in his eares: Of the which after he had bene sicke a while he dyed, the fifth<note place="margin">The death of king Frances the seconde.</note> day of December in the yeare of Lorde God. M. D. LX. At the which sodaine alteration the Guyses were not a little dismayde.</p>
                  <p>When King <hi>Fraunces</hi> was deade, the Quéene his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sent vnto the Constable, (who had detracted the time to come to <hi>Aurelias</hi>) assuring him of hir friendship, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto him that neuer hereafter none should intrude him selfe into an other mans office, and praying him also that he would come vnto hir with all spéede. There the Constable came to hir to <hi>Aurelias,</hi> without delay with Martiall <hi>Momo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencius</hi> his sonne, and saluted the newe King. Neuerthelesse the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was kept in holde still, but not without greate reuerence of his kéepers shewed towardes him, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27102:65"/>
continusd in prison after the death of the King by the space of ten dayes, denying to go out of prison, vntill he knewe his aduersarie in this matter layde to his charge. But all the matter was layde vpon the King deceased. Therfore by a wonderfull and straunge way or meane, as by the death of the King, the subtill practises of the aduersaries were brought to naught: whose funerall was so slenderlye cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, that he was depriued of that vsuall pompe which Kings commonly haue at their buriall, all men wondering that the <hi>Guises</hi> woulde suffer the same: the which also was very wel noted by a publike Epigram or libel sent abrode.</p>
                  <p>There were truly, within a short time, wonderfull &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest signes of Gods iust iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t against many Princes: the which al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at that time did plainly sée &amp; acknowledge.

Then the Quéene being somewhat appeased, plainly saide, that she knew nowe the causes of all the troubles past, namely, that all the Princes which were of the Kings blouds, were displeased, that they were not accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted off, according to their worthinesse, which thing, she said, she woulde sée reformed euer afterward. By this occasion the stomacking and taking of parts betwéene them, séemed somewhat to be repressed.</p>
                  <p>There folowed therfore a wonderful alteration &amp; chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge: and all men began to talke one to another, &amp; to say, that the companies of armed me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were prepared &amp; gathered togither to some other vse &amp; purpose, than for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> safetie of the King: &amp; that their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sels and meanings were otherwise, which had arrogated vnto themselues authoritie: also that their<note place="margin">The peace of the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> practises shoulde not so easily haue successe nowe. But the churches now, which before were in great perplexity &amp; fear, obtained peace: and all men hoped nowe for a better state.</p>
                  <p>For amidst those sundrie troubles and manifolde affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which happened vnder the raigne of king <hi>Frances,</hi> the administration of the sacraments, &amp; the preaching of Gods worde neuer ceased in the reformed Churches, although the number that were assembled, were but small, &amp; though also the same was not done without great daunger &amp; warinesse. For at that time there were cruell conspiracies against the Church, which woulde haue done great harme to the same, had not the Lorde by his prouidence tourned them away. Then did the reformed Churches co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde solemne pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with fasting to be vsed: and they which were the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors and chiefe of the congregation, exhorted their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to be of good chéere, and comforted them, willing them paciently to looke for helpe from the Lorde. So that after so great afflictions and feare, there followed excéeding ioye, and the sodennesse of the chaunce made the matter to seeme more wonderfull.</p>
                  <p>Then was there newes brought of the death of Monsieur

                     <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Carnutum,</hi> who was kept at <hi>Paris</hi> in holde for<note place="margin">The death of Monsieur Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame.</note> those causes whereof we haue spoken before. Whose death many of the Nobles tooke very heinously.</p>
                  <p>Then were certaine thinges appointed and determined, concerning the gouernment of the kingdome: &amp; the imperie and rule was deuided betwéene the Quéene and the King of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> and that in such order, that the chiefest authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to gouerne the Realme, was giuen to the Quéene, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all law and auncient custome of France. Wherfore by reason of this sodaine chaunge, the assemblye of States were interrupted and brake vp for a certaine space.</p>
                  <p>But they were assembled togither againe in the same<note place="margin">A conuocation of States, or of a Parliament in king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the. ix. days</note> place, the. xiii. daye of December, <hi>Charles</hi> the King, the Quéene, and the Princes, according to the maner accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them. Then the Chancelour at the commaundement of the King declared, that there was no lesse willingnesse in the King, than there was in his brother before him, to<note place="margin">The oration made by the Chauncelour.</note> haue an assemblie of States: and that the rather bicause the King himselfe was newlye come vnto the Kingdome. And he procéeded speaking very seriously and plentifully, of the cause, ende, and vse of calling an assemblie of States: and why the same being omitted for the space of eight and twentie yeres, shoulde nowe againe be brought in vse. And when he had shewed the King and the Subiectes also their duties, he came to speake of those causes more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which brought to passe, that there should be an assembly of States: that is to say, of the Seditions, which he wished might be taken quite away, for that they were like to bring so great troubles to the whole Realme. And to finde out spéedye and profitable Remedies for the same, he sayde, the causes of so great euill must first of all bée noted and knowne.</p>
                  <p>We must (sayth he) in euery respect and condicion, disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe<note place="margin">Sedition what it is, and wher of it commeth</note> and vtterlye condemne sedition, the which is nothing else but a separation, and a pulling awaye of the subiectes

from the Kingdome and Common wealth. And it sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of diuers causes: First, of feare of some imminent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill which may come by iniurie and oppression: and also of the expectation of great things, to put awaye penurie and scarcenesse. But the speciall cause is Religion. And this is very straunge, and most wonderfull: bicause God the only true author and preseruer of Religion, as he is an enimy to dissention, so is he the defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der and preseruer of peace. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion néedeth not the defence of Armes: neither doth the beginning, or conseruation therof stand vpon force of armes. Neither is their aunswere to be allowed, which say, That they take not armes and force in hande, to offend any man, but to defende themselues. For by no meanes is it lawfull for the subiect to ryse against the Prince, yea, it is no lesse vnlawfull for him so to doe, than for the children to resist their parents, whether they be good and courteous, or sharpe and cruell. Thus did the godly Christians in tyme past set forth and maintaine Christian Religion, namely, by long sufferance and pacience, &amp; also by deuout prayer for wicked Emperors, which ouercame their crueltie. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ethnikes truly praysed &amp; highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended those, which had suffered iniuries and reproches for their countrie. But we which are Christians, ought not to allowe the opinions of the Gréekes and Romaynes, concerning the killyng of tyrantes.</p>
                  <p>If men were such as they ought to be, there should neuer come any strife or contention for Religion. But it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that there is no greater force than the first conceyued opinion of Religion, whether y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same be good or euill.

There is nothing that doth more violently assaile the hearts of men, and that doth more inuade them: there is no affection that is of greater power, and more violent, either to bring friendship, or to bring hatred, than Religion. The Jewes hated all other Nations as prophane: And all other
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:27102:68"/>
Nations hated the Jewes. But wherefore? for Religion. What and howe great hatred was there in time past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fathers, and the <hi>Arrians?</hi> But I omit such ancient examples, and I will come nearer, euen to our selues Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and France, embracing al one Religion, shall be more surely linked and knit in frendship and loue one towardes another, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they which disagréeing in Religion, are of one Countrie, kinred, and name. Diuersitie of Religion dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all the bondes of loue: it setteth the father against the children, and the children against the father: brother against brother, the man against the wife, and the wife against hir husbande: according to this place of Scripture, <hi>I came not to sende peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a sworde.</hi> Herevpon it commeth to passe, that in all Realmes there are oftentimes grieuous sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Herevpon commeth that olde Prouerbe, <hi>Vna Fides, vna Lex, vnus Rex,</hi> that is to say, One fayth, one Lawe, and one King. Among these diuisions and discordes, howe can it be that violence and force of armes shoulde not be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? For warre followeth alwayes discorde and dissention, according to these verses.</p>

let vs shewe our due obedience vnto the yong King. Let vs not, for Gods sake, receyue newe opinions according to our owne fantasie. Let vs in time with wisedome consider of the matter, and let vs diligently seeke to vnderstande the same. It is no trifle that we haue in hande, but it is the saluation of our soules that is in question. If it maye be lawfull for euery man at his owne discretion to receyue what Religion him lysteth, take héede that there bée not so many Religions as there be men. Thou sayest that thy Religion is better than mine, and I defende that which I embrace, whether is it more meete that I followe thy opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or thou mine? Who shall ende our controuersies, but the holy Councell? In the meane time let vs not alter any thing rashlye, least by seditions we bring warre into our Kingdome, and so there followe a confusion. The King and the Queene will leaue nothing vndone that may procure a Councell, and if this remedie maye not be had, they will séeke other remedies. And nowe our Prelates and Ecclesiasticall persons (if they well consider the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse of the matter) will looke better vnto their office and duetie than they haue done heretofore. Let vs knowe, that the dissolution of our Church, was the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of heresies: but it is to bée thought, that a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will take them away againe. This victorie must not be sought for by violence, or by force of armes, but by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye exhortations, and by godlynesse of lyfe. Wyth these weapons, the Heretikes in tymes past, were ouercome. We must not hate the menne, but the vyces and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesses that are in men: and wée must goe aboute, all that wée maye, to bring them into the waye that are in errour. Let vs therefore put awaye all factious and seditious names, as the names of <hi>Lutheranes, Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes,</hi>

desiring tumult and confusion, enimies to peace and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welth (and as it appeareth) contemners of God and Religion: the King which otherwise of himselfe is gentle and long suffering, hitherto hath vene constrayned, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture shall be hereafter vrged, to indeuour himselfe to punishe the frowarde obstinate. It may seeme a very sharp remedy, but if we looke well vpon the disease and mischiefe yet a growing, we shall find it very necessary for the same. Notwithstanding, it is so come to passe as yet, by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, and the clemencie of the Prince, that there hath bene no greater punishment layde vpon any man, nor no greater destruction followed, as the subuersion of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the burning of houses, the disfraunchizing of Cities of<note place="margin">The accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of forreine Princes.</note> their priuiledges, and the restraint of their liberties: the which, other Princes that dwell about vs, haue oftentimes vsed, euen within the compasse of our remembrance, for the punishing of seditious persons. And bicause it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, least the armies of souldiers being dismist, the seditious will begin to practise and conspire a freshe, of two things the one is to be done, namely, that either the armies be kept and maintained still (which cannot be done without the great cost and charge of the Subiectes) or else that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of euery Citie, endeuour themselues to punishe such seditious and seditious persons: and he that shall be first founde to go about to alter the state of the common welth, let him by his seuere punishment be an example to all the rest. The King to this ende and purpose will giue you a power of armed men. Consider with your selues which of these wayes is most for your profite, either that you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine garrisons of souldiers to kéepe the cities for the king, or that you your selues in your owne persons, do it at your owne costes and charges. As for all other things the King will prouide and sée vnto them by his officers.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, let such as are Ecclesiastical persons, doe their dutie by prayers, by Sermons, and by diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:27102:69"/>
of the people. And so it will come to passe that the King shall be obeyed, and you shall enioye peace &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celor had procéeded thus far forth, and had spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> somewhat concerning the Kings substaunce and great erpences, exhorting the Court of Parliament to ease the same, he declared that it was the King and the Quéenes pleasures that euery man shoulde fréely put forth his complaintes and sutes: for that their Maiesties inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with all clemencie, as it was meete, to prouide for all thinges. And this only was done the first day.</p>
                  <p>In the next méeting the assemblye of States chose out thrée men to speake for them, the which thrée stoode before the King and made their seuerall orations. The sum wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will briefely repeate, so far forth as they shall séeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for our purpose.</p>
                  <p>The speaker for the thirde order of States, that is to say, for the Commonalty, was named <hi>Angell,</hi> a Counseller and<note place="margin">The oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, made by Angell.</note> a pleader of causes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate of <hi>Burdeux</hi> in <hi>Gascoyne.</hi> This man declared by many reasons, that for the due putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of perturbations and troubles it séemed good and most necessary to the people, first of all to remoue and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the causes. Which causes (he saide) were partlye the corruptions among Ecclesiasticall persons: among which corruptions (which were very many in number) there were thrée notable and more pernicious than the rest: namely, <hi>Couetousnesse, Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Luxurie.</hi> Ignorance (he sayd)<note place="margin">The ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of prelates.</note> was so manifest that no man néede to doubte of the same: and so great also that among that sorte of men it was to be séene from the hyest to the lowest. Which ignorance is the mother and Nurse of all errours, as both experience, and also the testimonies of learned fathers aboundantlye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
                  <p>To remedie this, he saide, <hi>Canons</hi> and decrées woulde be prouided but in vaine. For so great is the contempte and negligence of preaching and instructing the people, (which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:27102:70"/>
is notwithstanding the office of a good pastour) that Bishops at this day counte it a shame and reproch vnto them to féede the flocke of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And such as are Curates, and other masse priests, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the euill example of Bishoppes, doe also euen abhorre their office, and doe commit the same to vnlearned vicars: who singing Masses for their rewarde, haue onely some one slender bosome collation or other, which they alwayes vse without discretion, as one plaister to all maner of soares. The seconde vice is Couetousnesse: the whiche as it is no<note place="margin">Couetousnes.</note> lesse pestiferous than <hi>Ignorance,</hi> so is it no lesse to be séene as well in the heades as in the inferiors.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Luxurie</hi> &amp; the pompe and pryde of Prelates, he fayde it was suche, that it was a great stumbling blocke and offence to all men. For they are painted and set for the as though by an outwarde shewe in the world they should represent the maiestie of God: when as they shoulde rather expresse the same by godlynesse and integritie of life. How greatly haue our Bishoppes of late dayes degenerated from the meane estate, puritie, and godlynesse of the true By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of olde time? All these corruptions (saith he) must be taken away by a godly, and lawfull Counsel called, and also by the kings authoritie.</p>
                  <p>The speaker for the Nobilitie was one <hi>Iacobus Sillius.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The oration for the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litye.</note> This man began first to speake many things concerning the power, authoritie, and office of Kings, and largely also concerning the order of Nobles, which he saide was verye profitable and necessary to preserue and maintaine the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the king.</p>
                  <p>In speaking of matters concerning Religion, he founde this fault aboue all others, namely, that hytherto there had béene great ouersight, in suffering Ecclesiasticall persons to haue so great power and authoritie, and so large lyuing and reuenewes: who haue incroched vnto them selues y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houses of Noble men, &amp; do wickedly abuse all that euer they haue.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:27102:70"/>
Wherfore (saith he) it is necessarye that these sortes of men shuld he reformed. Also he wished that it might be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreséen that the office of an Ecclesiasticall person might not be committed to an vnlearned, vnapte, and ignoraunt person, affirming it to be vnlawfull for them to dwell from their flockes in other places at their owne pleasure, and so giuing them selues to worldly businesse, wholy to neglecte their offices: but (sayth he) it is the Kings duetie to cal them to their office againe.</p>
                  <p>And in the ende he made earnest peticion that there might be wayes taken in time to stop the seditions at hande: and also that it wold please the king to haue regard &amp; considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his nobles, as his auncetours had done before him. When he had thus spoken he put vp a Supplication, in the which peticion was made in the name of the nobilitie that temples might be graunted, for the vse and seruice of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion.</p>
                  <p>After this man, one <hi>Quintinus Heduus,</hi> who was chosen<note place="margin">The oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Clergy.</note> to be the speaker for the Clergie, when he had commended the king and Quéene to their face, saying that the kings of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> were specially chosen, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if they had béen borne and appointed, to be defenders of the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that therefore they had that moste auncient name from all ages, as to be called <hi>Most Christian Princes,</hi> he sayde that this assembly of States or court of Parliament was verye well called. The causes of the which assemblye (saith he) is that the complayntes of the people mighte be hearde and holpen, and that meanes and remedyes might be prepared for the scarsitie of the kings treasure and substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But this (saith he) is the greatest cause of all, whiche I speake with great sorrowe and griefe, and yet notwithstanding muste néedes speake the same, namely, that the corruptions and notable faultes of Ecclesiasticall persons myghte bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed and amended. For (sayth he) the matter is nowe come to thys passe, that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues which shuld declare
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:27102:71"/>
this Ecclesiasticall holynesse by their life, are more afrayde<note place="margin">The faultes of persons Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.</note> of the kings Edictes than they are of Gods word, and of the Gospell of Christ. Notwithstanding we muste therefore thinke (saith he) that the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church is sought for, which hath not erred, neither can erre: but a correction only of those most greuous faults in those men which were the chiefe gouerners of the Church, which correction must procéede from the king: but so notwithstanding the king must vse correctie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he follow the steppes of those kings that haue gone before him, who alwayes fauored y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. Adding to this also that those kings his auncetours woulde neuer haue suffered the wicked practises of these newe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, which falsely and wickedly of late time take vnto them selues the profession of the Gospell, that they mighte therby both refuse all ecclesiastical order, and also abolishe, if they might, al Ciuill power and authoritie. For (saith he) the king ought to this ende specially to exercise his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and draw his swerde to punishe and vtterly to roote out all heretikes giltie of criminall punishments.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he desired that Churches might not be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Churches.</note> to those horrible men (for so he termed them): and that they also might be counted &amp; punished as heretikes, which durst offer the supplications of <hi>Heretikes</hi> to the king. This truely (saith he) hath bene the olde subtill practise of Sathan to bring this libertie to heretikes, that they might the more securely and without feare of punishment destroy the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the which subtill practises he hath nowe also in hande, and therefore the more diligent héede (saith he) ought to be taken. In like maner also he desired the king that according to the doyngs of his Auucetours, and also according to the example of <hi>Charles</hi> the great (whose name he bare) he wold constraine all his subiectes to liue according to the Canons &amp; rules of the fathers. For detestable (sayth he) is the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of these new heretikes, which scoffing at the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the fathers, and reiecting the doctrines and Canons of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:27102:71"/>
the Churche, saye that they will haue nothing but the true Gospell onely: as thoughe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promise of Christ were vaine and to no effect, who promised that he would neuer forsake his Churche: and as thoughe that they were wiser than so many Fathers, which left so many godly Canons behynde them in writing: also as though they alone vnderstoode the word of God. Horrible boldnesse &amp; reebllion is that (sayth he) which casteth of the yoake of the Church: and what else will they do at the last but murmur and grudge also against the power and authoritie of the Ciuill Magistrate?</p>
                  <p>Moreouer he said, that the notes &amp; badges of the Church were not obscure, which these new men wanted: as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting and continuall successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Apostles time, and the Canons and rules which the Fathers left behinde them: which badges the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath.</p>
                  <p>Therefore (saith he) that they may neuer hereafter abuse the name of the Churche, we must plainely pronounce and affirme. <hi>That the Church of Rome is the Catholique, or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Church.</hi> But if these newe men take vnto them the name of the Church, we will not denie it them, but we saye that they are not of the <hi>True Catholique Church,</hi> but of the <hi>Malignant Church.</hi> Also he made petition that they which had fled the Realme for Religions sake, might be banished men for euer: that they might loose all maner of priuilege, and that they mighte, be handled euen as if they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine enimyes.</p>

Also he complayned that the authoritie to chose Prelates was taken from the Clergy and giuen to Kings, saying that it was done against Gods word, against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Canons, and againste the approued examples of the Elders: and that euer since that tyme, (namely, from the yeare of oure Lorde God. M. D. XUII. when the same was first vsurped) all things haue had euyll successe.</p>
                  <p>For (saith he) in that very yeare, in the which that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full right was abrogated from Ecclesiasticall persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that damnable heresie of <hi>Luther,</hi> whiche afterwarde soke suche rooting in euerye place: and herevpon followed an infinit number of mischiefes. He intreated therfore that the same authoritie might be restored againe to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons: and that the king woulde take away no more the reuenewes of Churchmen, for that they were consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and halowed, and coulde not be taken away withoute some manner of sacrilege, séeyng that men of the Churche ought carefully to be fed and maintained.

                  </p>
                  <p>And last of all he made petition that al the Clergy might neither pay tribute nor tax: for that was the prorogatiue of the Church which oughte not to be taken from it. For saith he it is the chiefest part of the Kings duetie to defende the Christian faith and doctrine, and to maintayne Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons.

                  <p>Thus much concerning his oration, which we haue tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye reported according to the written coppie of the same.

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer bycause he wished them to <hi>be taken and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed as newe Heretikes which shoulde offer supplications to the King,</hi> (all men at those words loking vpon the Admiral as though he had openly noted him) the Admiral made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint hereof to the king and Quéene.</p>

                  <p>After this there beganne to aryse certayne quarels, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes and controuersies againste the <hi>Guyses.</hi> For the Burgeses of the Parliament that were chosen for <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Dolphiny,</hi> of the which Prouinces the two brethren the <hi>Guyses</hi> were gouernours and chiefe, went aboute to bring to passe that the <hi>Guyses</hi> mighte be counted as honorable, as anye of the Princes the Kings neere kinsmen were: to the whyche notwythstandyng the greateste parte of the Burgeses of other Prouinces woulde in no wyse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.

At the whiche, the <hi>Guises</hi> beyng offended, called those that hindered their estimation, sedicious persons.

                  <p>Then were there certaine dayes spent in bringing the assembly of the Parliament together againe, and in deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of diuers matters.

                  <p>While the Princes were thus occupied, there came two<note place="margin">The Pope iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiteth the Princes of Germanie to the generall Councell.</note> Legates from the Pope, to intreate the Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> to come to the generall Councell. The which two declared their message as followeth. The one of them began thus, saying: That the most high bishop so soone as he was called to the most holy &amp; reuereud office of gouerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churche, to the end he might do the dutie of a true pastor, he had this care aboue al others, to correct and amend whatsoeuer was amisse: that the Church mighte be quiet, &amp; that all nations might be of one consent &amp; minde, and embrace one doctrine. To bring the which thing to passe, séeing he saw no better way or remedie than an assembly of a generall Councell, by due aduise &amp; deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; by his own authoritie also which he hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, hath ordained &amp; appointed a councel, which shal be holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the feast of <hi>Easter</hi> next co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. And that the Princes might be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more fully certified of this matter, &amp; to the end they, ioyning their indeuor with the Popes careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, might be willing &amp; diligent to procure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tranquillitie &amp; peace of <hi>Germanie,</hi> they said y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his holinesse, greatly desiring &amp; seking the peace &amp; quietnesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey of <hi>Germanie,</hi> had sent his legates, to pray &amp; exhort all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which it should be lawfull for all men to speake what they would.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:27102:75"/>
Also they intreated those Princes by name, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they woulde not by any meanes hinder that godly zeale and peace of the Church, the most holy Father being ready to giue vnto all men a most large Charter of the publique faithe, and most solemnly to be bound to performe the same: his holynesse exhorting al Princes to send their Ambassadors to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counsell with their commissions: to the ende the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies of the Church, (in the which there are so many opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as there are heads, and so many Gospels as there are teachers) maye by their industry and diligence be spéedily ended: and that they also giuing that honor which is due to the Church, one Faith may be kepte, and one God alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored and worshipped.</p>
                  <p>Thus when the first Legate had very copiously vttered his mind, the other also bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in maner &amp; forme following, saying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would not repeate those things whereof his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low before him had spoken, séeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had all one charge and commission from the holy Father.</p>
                  <p>There is no man (sayth he) that can be ignorant of the most greuous calamities of the Church, and into what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie the same is cast one euill and mischiefe following an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being giuen to the enemies of Christes name to calumniate and speake euill of the same: Insomuch that of necessitie, so great confusion must be prouided for, &amp; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy sought. For the dangers do require these things, the oportunitie of the time persuadeth to the same, and the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and godly zeale of the holy Father, allureth men therevnto: so that there could neuer be a better consent, and a more fitte occasion offered: the Christian common welth being pacifyed, &amp; Gods grace so plentifully being giuen to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> most holy father, who is not only very careful for Princes, but also for souls helth, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace &amp; tranquilitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church,<note place="margin">The answere of the Princes of Germany to the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates.</note>

                  <p>Thus they both made an end of their Oration, to whom this answere was gyuen: The moste honorable <hi>Electors, Princes, Ambassadors,</hi> and <hi>Counsellers,</hi> of the moste sacred

                     <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> make this answere to the proposition of the <hi>Legates:</hi> namely, that they doubt not, but that a great sorte of learned, godly, and wyse men, of all ages and conditions, haue wished a long tyme, that the Churche might be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter state: praying that at the length the pure doctrine of the Gospell might be restored, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wicked errors might be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away. Of the which matter Byshops of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to haue a speciall care, for that they haue of long tyme at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to themselues the tytles of <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church: but (say they) experience hath hytherto declared, that they haue bene rather occupyed in establyshing of their Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and in bringing errors into the Church, than in amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and setting foorth the glory of God, and in curing the diseases of the Church. The which truly is most manyfest, by too too many sorrowfull effectes, as the best friendes that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath cannot but confesse, if there be any shame in them.</p>
                  <p>Also they sayd that they did not a little maruel what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Pope, and what hope he had of them, that he sente his embassage vnto them, and that he woulde call them to this Councell: as though he were ignorant what Religion the States of the <hi>Empire</hi> followed: who of late, that they might reforme their Churches according to the true doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Gospell, were constrayned to plucke their neck out of the Popes yoake, that is to say, to separate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues from their fellowshippe, which went about to oppresse and destroy the true doctrine of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>We woulde therefore (say they to the Legates) that ye should knowe for a suretie, that the most noble Princes of Germany, will by no meanes obey the Pope, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he hath any power, either by Gods lawe, or by the lawe of man, to call a Councell: specially, being such a one as maketh dissention &amp; strife in the Church, and most cruelly warreth against the truth. Furthermore, they affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that they were misreported of &amp; slaundered, as though
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:27102:76"/>
they retained no certaine faith, but that there were now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, <hi>So many heads, so many opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, So many Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, so many teachers:</hi> wheras they retained the plaine and manifest confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made at <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> and offered to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Charles</hi> the. v. in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yéere of our Lord God. M. D. XXX. in the which not only all the principall grounds of faith are distinctly contained, but also y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> celestial truth manye wayes therby set forth and published. Also they said that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall complaints of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did sufficiently declare with what errors the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was filled, and with what filthy superstitions the Gospell was there suppressed: in so much that the same is rather like to the traditions &amp; vaine inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of heathen men, than Christian Religion. Wherfore (say they) bicause we haue of late separated and deuided our selues from the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> (not by anye rashnesse or vaine curiositie, or being led by any leude affections, but by the only commaundement of God which willeth all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to flee Idolatry) we protest that we wil so abyde most consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not be subiect any maner of waye to the Pope. For we acknowledge no maner of iurisdiction, besides the iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the most renoumed <hi>Emperour Ferdinandus.</hi>
                  </p>

Affirming also, that yf the Guyses were ouercome (as it is moste lykely, bycause they haue procured the hatred of all the assemblies, agaynste themselues) then shoulde his prudence, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and goodnesse bring to passe, that he shoulde be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratour and a iudge of the reformation of the Churche: the errours of the whiche Churche he ought not to defend, bycause he was the chiefe officer vnder the King, and the successour also of the firste Christian that was in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Also he sayde, that he ought not to count it an iniurie that mention was made of hym by those that were of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie at <hi>Paris,</hi> seing that he had doone nothing but by the authoritie of Kings, and of the hyghest powers: and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also that he hadde receyued so little of kyng <hi>Henrye,</hi> that there was no manne but hée woulde iudge hym woorthie of greater rewardes, bothe in consideration of the office, whyche hée had so long, and also for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney whiche hee bestowed in the Kings seruice. Moreouer, hée sayde, that it appeared by the Bookes of accompte, that the gyftes whyche the kyng gaue hym, were not so muche by the seuenth parte as those giftes were, whiche were bestowed vpon the Marshal <hi>Santandrae,</hi> so farre they were from being compared with the Guises gifts, and with the giftes of the Duchesse of <hi>Valentien.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To these persuasions onely of <hi>Momorentius,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable made answer, saying, That Religion coulde not be

altered without the mutation of the state, &amp; ciuil regiment: that he was a faithfull seruant of the king, and of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren also: that he feared not to be found guiltie: that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he woulde not suffer the actes and deedes of the Kyngs deceassed to be reproued, and disalowed: That hée desyred that hys nephews the <hi>Chastillions</hi> might be so good Christians in verie déede, as they séemed to bée in woordes: also that hée dyd willingly forgiue those that had offended him whatsoeuer they had doone.</p>
                  <p>After this verie shortly, the <hi>Chastillions, Odetus</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, the Admiral, the <hi>Andelot</hi> came oftentimes vnto him, protesting that they bare no hatred in their heartes agaynst the Guises, but went only about to frustrate their practizes and deuyses, whiche (as it euidently appeared) tended both to their destruction, and of the realme also. Whome the Constable (saye they) oughte to resiste aboue all others. But they persuaded in vayne: for his mynd was drawne awaye, and was linked in the freendship of the Guyses, by diuers that allured him therto.</p>
                  <p>Thus dissentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s grew dayly more and more by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Religion, and openly burste foorthe: insomuche that both partes sought to iniurie and to reproche one another, the fauourers of the Popes doctrine, calling the professours of the Gospell, Huguenotes: and the Protestantes callyng them agayne Papistes. Herevpon came a rumour abroade of Seditions, the Popes chaplains in their Sermons mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and pricking the people forward to the same. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the king sent his letters to the Magistrates of euerye Prouince: the summe and effect wherof was:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>These letters, the Senate of <hi>Paris</hi> went aboute to let and stay, but in vaine: neither could their admonitions (as they term them) which they sent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, preuaile so much, but that these letters wer euery where published abrode, which also almost in euery place were diligently obserued. They were deliuered which were kepte in prison for Religion. And many, which for the Gospell wyllingly chose to lyue in exile in other landes, retourning nowe home agayne, greatly increased the Churche: The Churche more and more flourished, the Gospell was confirmed: All menne, as though they had quite forgotten all other things, talked onely of the Gospell: Euery one of what estate and degrée soeuer he was of, only reasoned of the Gospell: Sermons were made euery where both in the Cities and in the fiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: All men diligently resorted to heare them: yea the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie rude and ignorant sort of people, bicause of the newnesse of the thing, came also to heare them of which a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by this meanes were brought to the knowledge of God. But the aduersaries, they stoode amazed, wondering and musing at so great a matter: The seruice of ancient cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies began euery where to waxe colde, yea and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie places to be derided: yea verie manie casting asyde the Popes badges and markes, came into the Churches of the faithfull, and were made as one with them. So greate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations came to pau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e in so little a tyme.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> (as we haue declared before) came
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:27102:81"/>
to <hi>Paris,</hi> that his innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie and guiltlesnesse might be farther tried by the Senate. He therfore, the Cardinall of <hi>Burbon,</hi> and many other noble menne attending vpon him, pleaded with the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> concerning this matter as follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth: manie men maruelling that he was thus dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. It is (sayth he) a special token of Gods prouidence, by whiche I béeing deliuered from the platformes and secrete traps of my enimies, shall get vnto my selfe an euerlasting testimonie of my innocencie in those thynges layde to my charge. The lying in wait and mischeuous practizes of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, do nothing at all hurt those which haue their hope &amp; trust in God. I haue always wished that my cause might be throughly wayghed and vnderstode of the Senate, which is the moste notable place in Fraunce for the executing of Iustice. I should (sayth he) be iniurious to my self, vnlesse I should bring the equitie and integritie of my cause againste the slaunders of my aduersaries, before so worthy an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, that the matter being worthie of the laudable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable sentence of the Senate, may by the grauitie and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the same be defined and ended. Wherfore he prayed them to consider of his estimation, whiche to hym was more deare than his lyfe. Then when he had required of the Senate that <hi>Petrus Robertus</hi> his man of lawe mighte be peaceably and quietly hearde in making his declaration, he so departed.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Petrus Robertus</hi> by and by made his oration, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">The oration of Petrus Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, the man of law for the Prince.</note> That it hadde pleased God to trie the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> with that triall of affliction, with which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doth oftentimes trie his faithful serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which affliction he doth oftentimes sende to those that are his, but specially to those that are set in high degrée, and that for two speciall causes: First, that Kings and Princes, and men of great calling might know that they haue their power &amp; dignitie from God alone, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dependeth eyther their preseruation or destruction. Secondly, that the innocencie of his seruantes maye more euidently appere, by false accusation, &amp; that by that meanes
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:27102:82"/>
there may be perfect triall of their integritie.</p>
                  <p>When he had thus spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he declared what things were wrought against the Prince at <hi>Aurelia,</hi> howe his appeales were not receiued, howe he was condemned his cause not heard: and therfore he sayd, that the sentence pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst him was voyd and of none effect. At the length whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many things were debated &amp; reasoned of betwene hym and<note place="margin">The conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Paris.</note> the Kings Sollicitour, it was concluded: <hi>That all matters that had ben broughte in agaynst the Prince, should be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Senate: And if nothing could be found that should deserue or require an extraordinarie waye then by and by the Senate should pronounce the ful and absolute sentence of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and discharge: But if the Senate should find any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greater weight, that then it shuld be lawful before those testimonies and proofes were receiued and credited, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the witnesses again, and to consider the matter more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely: and that the sentence pronounced by the former Iudges should be voyd, seing that it appertained to the Senate alone, (which is the court appertaining to the king &amp; to the nobles of France) to examine and iudge the causes of the kings kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if any criminall cause were obiected against them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The which point <hi>Petrus Robertus</hi> the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his aduocate, expounded and opened at large: least the Prince shoulde seeme by the weaknesse of his cause to forsake that former iudgemente of the iudges whiche were chosen by king <hi>Frances</hi> the second, of purpose to giue sentence on him. He declared therfore, that the Prince did refuse those iudges, bicause they were far vnmete to iudge him: besides that so it shuld haue ben preiudicial to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priuilege &amp; right of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings kinsmen, for that they being accused of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, maye appeale to be iudged of the king only their chiefe lord, and the head of their stock, in the Senate of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the kings solicitor answered, That he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow the sentence of the kings priuie councel, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the innocencie of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but also earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:27102:82"/>
that the same mighte be ratified and confirmed by the iudgement of a parliament: notwithstanding saith he the same must be established by an ordinarie and lawful way.</p>
                  <p>Therfore the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was made playntiue, and the Kings Solicitour the defendant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it was concluded, That for somuche as the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was put vpon his further triall &amp; purgation, the whole assemblie of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate house would receyue any manner of accusation to bee made agaynst the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and duly consider of the same: to the ende if nothing coulde be brought agaynst him wherby he myght be founde guiltie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e myght straightwaye by publike sentence, be declared and pronounced to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and guiltlesse. Wherefore all the Senatours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that if any man had any manner of accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> he should come into the Senate house, and then he shoulde be hearde. Yea euery one of the prince Councell were asked by name if they had any thing to obiect against the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> Who affirmed in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall by a solemne othe that they had nothing to obiecte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
                  <p>Then was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> final sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Senat giuen in maner &amp; <note place="margin">The decree of the senate con cerning the innocencie of the Prince.</note> forme folowing, that is to say, <hi>That the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had done nothing against the kings Maiestie but was pure, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and guiltlesse of all those crimes layd to his charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all actions commensed against him were voyde.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thys ordinaunce and decrée was pronounced and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the chiefe iudge of the Senate, the gates of the Senate house beeing set wyde open, and all the Senatours assembled together solemnely apparelled in their Scarlet Roabes, accordyng to order. And also at the Readyng
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:27102:83"/>
hereof, there was a great multitude of people, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the Nobilitie of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as the kyng of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Cardinall <hi>Burbon, Monpensier,</hi> and others of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Kinges kinsmenne: and with these also were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Dukes of Guise, <hi>Nemorosius,</hi> the Constable, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morentius,</hi> the Marshall of <hi>Santandrae,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayn,</hi> and the <hi>Chastillion.</hi> Others also, which were accused for the same cause with the prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> receiued the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their purgation openly read.</p>
                  <p>And vndoubtedly, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> alwayes denyed, that he was the author, or of the counsell of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>umult of <hi>Ambaxian,</hi> howsoeuer the Guises maliciously interpreted that counsell and way which was deuised to kepe them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to be intended against the kings maiestie, and the state of the realme.</p>
                  <p>By these and such like practizes, those two brethren the Guyses inflamed the yong king <hi>Frances</hi> against the men of <hi>Burbon,</hi> leauing nothing vndone that might séeme to proue their accusations. Accusers were diligently sought for, and matters of accusation inquired after: By gifts &amp; by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings all things were attempted. And in the iudgement of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> they leaned specially to one witnesse, whose name was <hi>Sagua,</hi> a seruant of the kyng of <hi>Nauar,</hi> of whom we haue made mention before. That <hi>Sagua</hi> being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and apprehended by the Guises, was diligently exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned concerning the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> if he knewe whether he had conspired against the king or no. <hi>Sagua</hi> at the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied this, saying that he knew no suche matter. But at the length <hi>Frances</hi> the duke of Guyse broughte it to passe, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with him a hangman and a halter) by thretning death vnto him except he would plainly accuse the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> of conspiracie against the king. But at the length being es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped out of the Guyses hands, he most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly sayd both by word and writing, that the accusation agaynst the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was extorted from him by force.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:27102:83"/>This publike sentence therfore of the Senate toke away from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> that spite and slaunder wherby he was sayd and thought to be guiltie of the tumult of <hi>Amba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xian.</hi> But if the sentence of the Senate had not cléered and purged him, yet the effect and sequele of that whiche follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, maye be sufficient to approue that he neuer conspired against the king: As his only studie and moste vndoubted good will in defending the young king and the realme also, being in great perill, from the mischiefe and lyings in wait of forrain enimies. The which he would neuer haue doon, if he had intended to hurt the king any maner of way.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Lorrayn</hi> complayned to the Quéene that<note place="margin">The complaint of the Cardinal of Lorrayn.</note> the matter was euery daye worse and worse, and that the people presumed and toke too much libertie vpon the kings Edictes, and also that the negligence and carelesnesse of the Iudges increased more and more: affirming that there was no wiser way to be found, than in suche troublesome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to take counsell of the Senate of <hi>Paris.</hi> (It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that he went about this thing, being assured and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified before of many of the mindes of the Senatours, that by this preiudice he myghte helpe the Nationall Councell shortly at hande.)</p>
                  <p>Therefore the King and the Quéene and all the priuie Councell came vnto the Senate to deliberate wyth them of those matters whiche appertayned to Religion, and the gouernement of the realme. The Chauncellor briefly declared, that they wer therfore called togither by the kings commandement, that they might shewe certaine ready and exquisite wayes to qualifie those perturbations and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, whiche would euery day more and more increase by reason of the diuersitie of Religion: to the ende the Kings subiects might peaceably lyue vnder his obedience.

But after that the lyght of the truth in our tyme brast forthe and more cléerely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than it had done before, it began also more cléerely to shine in those valeys.

These men of the valleys had many noble men appoynted to rule and gouerne them: but among the reste, they acknowledge the duke of <hi>Sabaudia,</hi> their chiefe Prince and gouernour. Therfore these inhabitauntes being hated for religions sake of the noble men that dwelt about them, were diuers and sundrie wayes by them vexed.

They being carefull by reason of these new commaundements, sende at lengthe their Ambassadour to the Prince with a supplication and confession of their faith, protesting that they beléeue all things conteyned in the old and newe Testament, the articles of the Christian fayth, called <hi>Symbolum Apostolorum,</hi> the Nicene Créede, and the Creede of <hi>Athanasius:</hi> also the foure firste Councelles, and the doctrine of the auncient Fathers, so farre forth as they

Adding herevnto that this doctrine had continued a long time among them, as they coulde well approue by great testimonyes receiued from their ancetors. Desiring him also to inquire how they behaued them selues towards their gouerners, and in what order they liued: protesting that their only desire was to render vnto him all obedience as vnto their chiefe Lord and Prince, and that if they should<note place="margin">The Edict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the valleys.</note> be founde otherwise, to be sharpely and seuerely punished. This was the effecte of their ambassage to the Duke, but it did nothing at all preuaile. For the Duke gaue strait com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement that no man should come or resort to those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which the Ministers of the inhabitantes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valleys made: if any did resorte vnto them, their first punishment was the losse or forfeiture of. 100. Crownes, and the seconde punishment was to be a Gally slaue. He commaunded also all the Nobles and Magistrates that had authoritie to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe, seuerely to execute the same againste the offenders. Therfore the Noble men began to waxe fierce against the inhabitantes of the valleys: in so much that when they had taken certaine of them, they burnte them: among whome were two preachers of Gods worde. All men vsed violence against the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the valleys, euen as if they had béen mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enimyes: great damage and hurte was done to them: and those which dwelt about them, making an armie made hauocke of them and spoyled them. The men of the valleys were contented with all this iniurie, and by the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Ministers and preachers bare these things pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently for a time. But at the length being ouerladen and wearied with these troubles, they purposed to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

in so much that they flew many of them which came to pray and spoile them. Wherevpon the Duke gaue forth a commaundement that they shuld leaue off to spoile them anye more: and sent vnto them <hi>Ranconensis</hi> and <hi>Trini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they retourned home agayne as they came, bycause they woulde haue bounde them to sende away their Ministers and Preaches. The Duke beyng angrye wyth this, intended to make open warre against them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he sente agaynst them <hi>Trinitaeus</hi> with fiue thousands soulders (the greatest parte whereof were gunners, and some horsemen) commaundyng hym that excepte the men of the valleys woulde doe as they were commaunded, he shoulde deale with them as with mortall enimyes, to spoile their goods and to put them to fire and sworde.</p>
                  <p>First of all therefore <hi>Trinitaeus</hi> assaulted <hi>Agronia,</hi> with a thousand and a halfe of gunners: certayne of the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the number of thirtie being slenderly armed wyth flyngs and Crosbowes, straighte waye went against them, and withstandyng the firste fronte of the Armie, were straite way rescued with two hundered oute of the valleys adioyning vnto them: and so by and by they put their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes to flight, and slewe three score of them, three of their owne side onely being lacking.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Trinitaeus</hi> sawe that he had assaulted <hi>Agronia,</hi> in vaine, he assaulted the villages thereabout as <hi>Comba</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliaret:</hi> but at their handes he receiued the repulse also with losse of thirtie of his men. Seyng therefore howe hardly he should obtaine his purpose, and that he little preuayled by open violence he soughte to practise by subtiltie and crafte. And sent to the inhabitantes of the valleys, promising them peace, if they woulde vnarme them selues, sende men to the Duke to craue pardon for their rebellion, and gyue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym sixtene thousande Crownes. The people desyring peace and to bée eased of all their troubles, easilye yelded to

these conditions. And sente chosen men for the purpose to <hi>Trinitaeus.</hi> saying that they woulde fulfyll his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and so they put off their armoure, which by and by was taken from them by the souldiers. They sente in lyke maner in their owne name to the Duke two men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the obedience of the people vnto hym by an othe, so that they might haue libertie to vse their Religion. In the meane time there was a great summe of money required, the one halfe beyng payed, and a daye appoynted for the payment of the other halfe. Within fewe dayes after the Duke sente for the two Legates of the valleys, and the Popes Legate sitting by him, and a great multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beyng present, commaunded them, kneeling on theyr knees, in the name, and on the behalfe of the inhabitantes of the valleys, to confesse their faultes, and to craue pardon for the same: firste of the Duke, and then of the Pope in the person of hys Legate there presente: and to sweare both of them euer afterward to be loyal and obedient. This thing beyng extorted from the Legates by feare, the Duke by the meanes of these promyses, commaunded the men of the valleys to put awaye their Ministers, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue suche as he sente vnto them, and to come to the Masse. The inhabitantes of the valleys, blamed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie of their ambassadors, saying that the same shuld not deceyue them, neither that they woulde consente vnto that which they had done, beyng agaynste theyr wils and commaundemente. They woulde (they sayde) obey theyr Prince, but so notwithstanding that they woulde haue the libertie of their conscience.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore they desired that they might haue leaue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise that doctrine which before time they had followed. So soone as the Duke hearde of this, he sent an armye againe, and that in the deepe of Winter, inuading all the countrey, burning houses, spoiling goods and Cattells, and showing so much crueltie as might be.</p>

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:27102:87"/>The men of the valleys therefore being constrained, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke their houses, and fled to the toppes of the Mountaines with their wiues and children, beyng couered with snowe.

And yet for all this eueryone of them, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their women shed no teares for the same, but gaue prayses vnto God who had made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthie to suffer for his name, and had made their houses ashes to throwe in the eyes of Antichrist. Therefore when they sawe whereabout their enimyes went, they dispayred not in the middest of so great affliction, but made their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto God: and sayde with one mind and consent, that in so iuste a cause they would spende their liues, thinking it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to dye than to receiue such horrible superstitions, beyng fully persuaded, that in so good and iust a cause God woulde not fayle them. And thus they bended them selues to séeke their owne defence: appointing scoutes and watches in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conuenient places, making certaine holdes: stopping the wayes againste their enimyes: and setting all thyngs that was necessarye for them in so good order as they coulde. There was therefore dayly skirmishes on bothe sides, and within a fewe dayes there were a hundred men slaine on the Dukes side, and on the other side not fortie. Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther valiant Captaines there was one called <hi>Carolus Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetus,</hi> a very expert fellow in the warre, and of great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and authoritie with the Duke. This fellowe sought how he might win the Castles and holdes of their enimyes, and therefore by the skill of the places and by the knowledge that he had of their situation, he brought to passe by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming on the backe side of the mountaine, that he brought a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand souldiers and placed them on the ridge of a hill: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing quietly possessed the same, he put his souldiers in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to haue the pray: and after he had fortified the same, he made hast to win another holde. Of the which, when many were ware that kept a little hill harde by, they tolde the rest

of their fellowes: of the which, part went to repell their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes: and parte with all spéede gaue warning to all those that dwelt there rounde about, with the sounde of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. And at the laste two hundred men being gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they easilye put their enimyes to flight. And making hast to remoue those souldiers which were placed on the top of the hill, they sawe certaine troupes of their enimyes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hast to get a forte néere vnto them of great force. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they had altered their purpose, leauing their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer assault which they had ment to giue against those on the ridge of the hill, they made hast to encounter with the other part: and setting vpon them before they were readye, they slew many of their enimyes, and had made a greater slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had not a certaine preacher of Gods word by his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions stayed their force. But <hi>Truchetus</hi> being stricke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a stone on the legge, was caryed away by two souldiers.

And nowe for wante of Gunnes, the men of the valleys had made them crossebowes of wood, which would deliuer stones with great force: and therefore the men of <hi>Sabaudia</hi> being on the lower ground were very muche anoyed with this newe kinde of shooting. Wherefore the men of <hi>Sabaudia,</hi> to saue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues from the force and violence of the stones that were thus shot at them, deuised great Targets, with which they might couer their whole bodyes.

                  <p>We beléeue that the pure and sincere preaching of Gods worde, the pure Ministration of the sacraments, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, by the which the Churche is gouerned according to the rule of Gods worde, are notes and markes of the visible Churche.</p>

At the length by the Kings commaundement they embraced one another, and promysed to put away all grudge and malyce, and to be euer afterwarde true and faithfull friendes. This reconciliation gaue the Constable occasion more fréely to ioyne him selfe and to kepe company with the Guises, and to begyn afreshe to suppresse Religion, the which he had alwayes obstinately resisted.</p>
                  <p>We sayde before that the assembly of States, or Courte of Parliament was delayed and put off vntill the moneth of May.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they resorted agayne in the moneth of August to <hi>Pontosia</hi> a towne in Picardie: and by and by there arose dissention betwéene the Princes and the Cardinalls aboute the order of sitting: the Princes denying to sitte belowe the Cardinalls.

                  <p>Therefore the Legates or Speakers for the thrée estates

Also he made pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in the name of the thirde state, whiche we call the comminaltie, that the King woulde refourme these greate faultes, and woulde so temper and order the lyuings and reuenewes of Ecclesiasticall persons that they mighte not lyue too licenciously at their ease.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer he declared that it was the office of a King to take vpon hym the defence of Religion, and bycause so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye troubles daylye did aryse for this cause throughout the whole Realme, he sayde it was a presente remedie to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie them, to call forthwith a Nationall Counsell, and to gyue to all men leaue to come vnder safe conducte: and that it woulde please the King also with the Princes hys Kinsmen to bée present at the same, and to call for learned and godly men to come to that parley, and also to remoue all those that might be suspected.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore that they whiche thinke that they can not

wyth a safe conscience come to the Ceremonyes of the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> myghte haue libertie freely and quietly to come together into some temple or other publique place, where they maye be taughte the worde of God in theyr vulgar tongue, and maye haue the rytes of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ministred.</p>
                  <p>And bycause many things maye be sayde to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in those assemblyes, he wished that the King woulde commaunde certaine of his officers to be presente in those assemblyes to see what shoulde be done.</p>
                  <p>Also he sayd, that they oughte not to be counted for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes whiche were condemned, their cause not hearde, but should be tried and iudged by the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Finallye, he made humble supplications that it woulde please the King to graunte suche reasonable requestes: the which also the Nobilitie with one consent required, but the Ecclesiasticall order or Clergie soughte diligentlye by all meanes possible to defend their cause.</p>
                  <p>But to the ende it maye more plainely appeare what<note place="margin">Certaine Ciuil actes worthy to be noted.</note> greate alterations haue happened within a shorte tyme, it shall not be amisse to repeate certayne things whiche were done in that assemblye concernyng matters Ciuill, and yet those things onely which also seeme to be more neere to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the state wherof to shewe we meane.</p>
                  <p>Therefore these remedyes were deuised to discharge the Kyng of that debte and paymentes of money wyth the whiche wee sayde before the Kyng at that tyme was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye burthened: Firste, that they whiche had had the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying of the Kyngs Treasure, shoulde come to accounte: In the meane tyme that so manye as were of the Kings Priuye Counsell shoulde bee forbydden to come into that assemblye, vntyll they hadde playnelye made theyr accountes: also that all shoulde make an accounte (the Queene onely excepted) of all excéedyng giftes, rewardes, and doles.

That so manye as in their owne persons, did not discharge their Ecclesiasticall offices, should loose all their reuenewes sauyng some parte which shoulde bee lefte them for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine seruice, and for aimes deedes. That all the reuenewes of Benefices in controuersie should be brought to the kings Treasurie. That so many Benefices as had their pastors resident, if they were worthe fiue hundred pounde in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, shoulde paye vnto the King the fourth parte: if they were worthe a thousande pounde, the thirde parte, if they were worth three thousande pounde, that then they shoulde paye vnto the King the one halfe. Also that they which had in yearely reuenewes comming vnto them twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande poundes, shoulde haue onely remaining to them of the same, three thousande, and the reste to be payde to the King.</p>
                  <p>That from the <hi>Cartusian Fryers,</hi> the <hi>Minimi,</hi> the <hi>Mathu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,</hi> and the <hi>Moniakes</hi> should be taken all their reuenews that surmounted and came to more than would finde them ordinarie meate, drinke and clothe: bycause by the order of their rytes and vowe, they ought to haue no more.</p>
                  <p>Also, (they saide) they had yet a better and more compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way, and that was this: if all the landes of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall persons belonging to their benefices and spirituall promotions, sauyng onely a house for the Bishop, Canon, Maister of the Colledge, or person to dwell in were solde.</p>
                  <p>And of some parte of the money for the same, the Kings debtes should be payde, and the rest to be distributed to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons that had more neede of the same. Also to the ende the king with the rest might perceyue howe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a way this would be, they declared that the reuenews of those ecclesiasticall landes woulde be worth fortie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounde, and their proper liuing and remainder neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse twelue hundred thousand poundes. And they sayde that these lands would the sooner be solde because they were frée from tribute, &amp; were all most lords within themselues.

Adding moreouer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ecclesiasticall persons should sustaine no harme hereby for they should neuerthelesse haue inough to liue vpon, and the king of the ouerplus of those yearely reuenewes should both pay his debtes, and also haue euery yeare a great summe besides, towardes the maintayning of garrisons of souldiers, the fortifying of Cities, and other such lyke vses to the great profit and commoditie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

Furthermore they requested that the King with his kinsmen the Princes woulde be at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: that all men might haue frée libertie vnder the kings warrant to come to that conuocation: that they might haue Churches for the administration of their doctrine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, graunted vnto them, which affirme that they cannot with safe conscience come to the Ceremonies of the Romishe Churche: that they mighte openly and plainely professe and maintayne their Religion, and put awaye all occasions of slaunder and reproche.</p>
                  <p>Last of all they required, that all iurisdiction mighte be taken away from Ecclesiasticall persons, and restored to the King to whome the same truely appertayned: that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons myghte haue no place in the Ciuill as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblyes of Parliamentes: and also that Ciuill or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall persons mighte not haue benefices or spirituall promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                  <p>After long contention, by the earnest persuasion of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> (who sought to haue the Queenes fauour) and sayd that he did willingly giue place vnto hir, the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers answered, that if the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> woulde departe from his right, and that the king and Quéene could so agrée they would not be against it, nor hinder it.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:27102:94"/>
they were of diuers opinions: And that other opinions can not let the vnion of the Churche, euen as in tyme past the diuersitie in celebrating the Passeouer, the diuers and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie<note place="margin">Diuersitie of rites.</note> obseruations of fastings, and rites in sacraments, and other partes of diuine seruice, did nothing at all hinder the vnion of the Churche: and that the same waye then vsed, should be very profitable now to stay the controuersies of the Latine and Gréeke Churche.</q>

                     <q>Therfore they trust the controuersies being at an end, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God wil be with them, and that the darke &amp; mistie cloudes being driuen awaye at the length, he will shewe the true and perfecte lyghte of the truth. And (sayth she) if this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall waye shall not be approued and allowed, although it oughte to be referred to a generall Councell, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng it is necessarie that the holie Father do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide a spéedie remedie before that time, considering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent necessitie.

                  <p>
                     <q>But the remedie séemeth to consiste in two thinges:<note place="margin">The remedy</note> First that they which haue alreadie separated themselues from the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmunion of the Churche, might be called and brought to the same agayne: Secondly, that they which as yet haue not withdrawne themselues, might be kept in this communion still. To winne the first, it may séeme very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, to vse often admonitions, and to haue mutual and quiet conference on bothe partes. Bishops and their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters muste diligently preache Gods worde, and exhorte the people to mutuall peace and concorde: and names of reproche on bothe sydes muste quyte be taken awaye. The whyche she hoped, was a speedie waye to bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and loue. The whyche also (she sayd) she had giuen in commaundemente to those that were separated from the Churche, and was hytherto obeyed. But as touching those whyche as yet hadde not separated them selues from the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:27102:94"/>
Communion of the Churche: there are many (sayeth she) whiche as yet purpose not to departe from the same, and yet notwithstanding they stande continually in doubte, and specially in these thrée principall poyntes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The first is, that they vnderstande, that the primitiue<note place="margin">The fyrste poynte of offence.</note> Churche had no images. They knowe that God hathe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely forbidden to worshyp them, or to set them in those places where they maye be worshipped: They know also that <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath foribdden the same: and that diuers good men in lyke maner, whiche synce that tyme, receyued them into the Churches, expressely declared that they were ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for no other vse, than to put the ignorante people in mynde of their Gods whiche were absente. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, many errours, deceytes, and lyes haue preuayled and crepte into this kingdome and realme of Fraunce, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deceyuers, contrarie to the doctrine of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<note place="margin">Worshipping of images.</note> haue moste wickedly abused the worshipping of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to their owne lucre and gaine, in so muche that the cousciences of many men for this cause are greately offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and therefore will not come into the Churches, least they shoulde bowe theyr knée before the Images.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The matter therefore béeing well examined, if on the one parte the inconueniences whyche may aryse héereof, and the fruites and commodities whyche are lyke to come, bee wy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore to cut away all occasions of slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reporte, and to keepe those still, of whome we speake, in the fellowship of the Churche, lette it be considered if it bée profitable to remoue these Images from the Altars: and to place them aboute the Temple, eyther within or without: the causes béeing declared, namely that certaine vngodly men séeking theyr owne gayne on the one parte,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:27102:95"/>
and on the other part certaine ignorant and vnskilful men, also wil bring to passe, that the people shall abuse them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the ordinaunce of the Churche.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>2 The second principall point is concerning the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration<note place="margin">Sacraments.</note> of Sacraments, of Baptisme, and of the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. In the administration of Baptism, it seemeth strange<note place="margin">Baptisme.</note> to many good and godly men, that Exorcismes, and many formes of prayers should be vsed: the which may somwhat profite those that vnderstande them: but séeing the greatest parte of the people doe not vnderstand them, it séemeth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to omit them. And where as it is beléeued and taughte that these things are necessarie to be done before Baptism, they say that it is done against the pure and sound iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Churche, which hath decréed and appoynted Water and the Worde to be only necessarie in the Sacramente: but as for Exorcismes and Prayers not to be necessarie to the Sacrament. Furthermore they saye, that in Baptisme<note place="margin">Catechismes.</note> the wordes of the auncient Catechismes are reteyned still, the vse wherof is nowe gone, and therfore at this tyme is vsed in vayne in Baptisme. Also many do very much misse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that a diseased or infected priest should spit his vncleane spittell into the mouth of the infant: wherby some great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and perill mighte arise. All these inconueniences (she sayd) might be remedied if it might be left in the choyce of al men, eyther to vse Exorcismes and prayers in baptizyng their infantes, or else purely and simply without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to kéepe the substance of Baptisme, that is to saye, water and the word: and to haue the same ministred in the vulgar tong that the people may vnderstand it. The whiche libertie were more tollerable, than eyther the offence, or separation of many men: and so no infantes shall be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed out of the Congregation of the Romishe churche.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>3 As concerning the holie Comunion, many good men do misselyke thrée things in the same: Of the which, the firste<note place="margin">The holie communion</note> is, that it is giuen to communicate only vnder one kynde:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27102:95"/>
Whose consciences in this matter can not bée quieted and stayed, eyther by the authoritie of the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> or by the obseruation of custome, receyued not many yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res agoe: seing that Iesus Christ playnly sayth, <hi>Take yee, eate ye, drinke ye,</hi> Paule the Apostle also sayth: <hi>VVho soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Constance,</hi> yet notwithstanding, seing thorough feare of erring, they leane only to plaine testimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to the auncient custome of the Church, it is to be feared, that whyle there is controuersie aboute this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, others whiche are weake will easily be broughte to their opinion, and so withdrawne from the fellowship of the Churche of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the obiection of the aduersaries séemeth to be of greate force, seing they bring bothe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse word of God, and also euident reasons for that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they alleage. Maye it please him therefore to consider whether it be not best to giue libertie that the communion may be ministred vnder both kindes, although the councell of <hi>Constance</hi> be against the same.</q>

in the which they desire that this disputation might be begon forthwith by his authoritie: and that these might be the conditions to be obserued in the same: Firste, that those prelates, which were of the contrarie opinion, might not be set as chiefe Iudges in this disputation, but that the king with his Counsellours, shoulde by his authoritie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and rule the whole matter: Secondly, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies should be referred and ended by the word of God only.

Therfore bycause the thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is offred vnto vs, and so truly giuen vnto vs as the signe it selfe, we muste also acknowledge by the same reason, the coniunction of signes with the thing signifyed.

In the highest place sat the King, and harde beside him, according to custome, the Princes his kinsmen: the Bishops sitting all a long on both sides the hall vpon gréeces one aboue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Then were brought in the chosen men, for disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the reformed Churches, which were twelue Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and twentie others, which were sent also of the same Churches: whom the Kings Gard at the commaundement of the king had brought from <hi>Sangerman</hi> thyther, least there should be some tumult raised against them.</p>
                     <p>When euery man kepte sylence, the King spake in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and fourme following: All men (sayth he) know well<note place="margin">The proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of king Charles the ix.</note> enoughe, what and how great perturbations and troubles are in the Realme: for the which cause I haue appoynted you to come together at this time, that those things which ye knowe haue néede of reformation, maye quietly of you

be declared, without any maner of affection, hauing no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration or care for any thing, but for the glorye of God, and the peace and quietnesse of consciences: The whyche thing I greatlye desire, in so much that I haue determined not to suffer you to departe hence, before you haue made some ende of all controuersies, that at the length all dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being taken away, mutual peace and concord may be had among all men. This thing if ye bring to passe ye shall giue me occasion to maintayne and defende you with no lesse care than those kings my auncestours, that haue béene before me, haue done.</p>
                     <p>Then he commaunded his Chauncelor to declare his<note place="margin">The proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chauncelor.</note> minde more at large. The Chauncelor therefore began to shew that the kings will was according to the wils of his predecessors that had béene before him, in staying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of Religion, the which, when those Kings of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie memorie went diligently aboute to bring to passe, they had in their labors very small successe, in so much that day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie more and more new troubles arose: wherfore he would that all men should the more diligently, wisely to apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to pacifie in time these troubles, for the which cause he had caused them to come togither, and minded in his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all person to accompany them, that disordered matters in Religion which concerned both doctrine and maners might be reformed: he vnderstanding that this was the onelye cause of all troubles, woulde diligentlye prouide for them as his office required.</p>
                     <p>The remedie which nowe he intendeth to vse, séemeth to be a present remedie, as it was of late deliberated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of in the most noble assembly of the Princes &amp; Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For (sayth he) we our selues shall better prouide remedyes for oure selues, than men of strange and forraine countreys can doe, which know neither the state of our cause, nor the condition of our people: of which kinde of strangers notwithstanding the generall Councell shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siste.

Wherfore he wished the disputers on both partes onely to be carefull to doe their duetie, both of them ioyntly to seke concorde, the greater part not to despise the lesser: not to vse curious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations without profit: and to iudge &amp; examine al matters by the word of God only, which being wel vnderstoode, fewe other authours shall serue: also that they which say they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the newe doctrine, woulde not counte the prelates of the contrarye parte for their enimyes, séeyng by Baptisme they retaine the name of Christians.</p>
                     <p>For the king (sayth he) hath therefore giuen you leaue to come together, that men mighte sée what reasons you haue, and that the Prelates on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes side, might séeke by strong arguments to confute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that the disputation at the length beyng published abrode, all men may euidently sée, that they are condemned for iust causes, and not by the vaine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of men. Therefore, take héede in any case, that you do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ambitiously: know ye, that ye are not iudges: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:27102:103"/>
yourselues to finde out and manifest the truth. So shall you both glorifye God, and also profite your countrey: and God himselfe shall blisse your indeuours, and the moste constant minde of the king, in this matter.</p>

Then the Chaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour saide that he woulde not giue the matter in writing, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was plainely enough declared. And thus they coulde get nothing at the handes of the Chauncelor, althoughe the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> required the same.</p>
                     <p>Then the ministers, which sat oueragainst them, hauing leaue to speake, <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> began thus.

When he had spoken these wordes, he falling on his knées with the rest of his fellowes, beganne to pray vnto God in that forme of confession of sinnes which is vsed in the refourmed Churches, pronouncing the same with a loude voyce: and that done, straight way he added vnto the same these wordes. <hi>For so much as (O God) thou hast bene</hi>

For such is our nature, that those things which we sée oure selues with our eyes, do more effectually moue our affections, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those things which we féele and perceiue by the bare and simple apprehension of the minde.</q>

But nowe there are manye occasions, which euen at this day, will not suffer vs to enioye so great a benefite, and haue also taken cleane awaye from vs al hope to enioy the same, except by other meanes we be stayed and comforted.

This truely is our hope, and persuasion of you. And we praye and beséech you, by the name of the mightie God, which hath gathered vs here togither, whiche shall be a witnesse of our cogitatious and wordes, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatsoeuer hath bene written or spoken for the space of these 40. yeres) you will with vs put awaye all preiudiciall meanes: which maye possibly hinder the fruite and profite of this laudable way, now taken in hand: and that it will please you to hope

At which thing truely we might be ashamed, if both of vs preaching the doctrine of concorde and peace, shoulde easily be deuided, and made enemies, and hardly reconciled agayne. But what néede these wordes?

simply and plainly meane good soothe, we will (if it so séeme good, and if leaue may be graunted) briefly declare the chief and principall pointes of this Conference or Disputation: notwithstanding in such order that no man shall haue iuste occasion to be offended. There are some whiche thinke and woulde also persuade others, that we disagree in matters of small waight, and in those thinges which are indifferent, &amp; not appertayning to the substance of our faith. And ther are other some, which hauing no knowledge or vnderstanding of those things which we beléeue and defende, do thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse but that we agrée with the Iewes and Turkes. The purpose and thought of those first sort of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we trust shall be approued by vs, to be no lesse commendable than the other is to be reiected. And yet certainly neither of their opinions are firme and true. For if we shoulde beléeue the opinion of this last sort, the one part could not stand by any meanes without the destruction of the other. But if the first opinion be receiued, many matters shall be left so raw, that occasions of greater troubles will thereof by and by spring and arise.

                     <p>We confesse that there is one God, in one essence, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite<note place="margin">In what thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Papists and Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants do agree, and in what they do disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> and incomprehensible, distinguished and deuided in three persons consubstanciall and coequall in all thinges: namely into the Father begotten of none: into the Sonne begotten of the Father before all worlds: and into the holy Ghost procéeding from the Father and the Sonne. <q>We confesse that ther is one Iesus Christ, perfect God &amp; perfect man without confusion of the two natures, or separation of the Prophets.

We beleeue that Christ is now in heauen at the right hand of God, from whence he shal come to iudge the quick &amp; the dead. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in the holy Ghost, which doth illuminate, comfort, and defend vs. We beleue that there is one holy Church, Catho lique, that is to say vniuersall, which is the companie &amp; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of Saints, out of the which ther is no saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bycause it semeth vnto vs (&amp; if we erre therin, if it can be proued, we are ready to acknowledge our error, that many things are added vnto those articles as thoughe they were not sufficient: &amp; so as though the edifice shuld neuer be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the new inuentions of men haue dayly ben brought in. Furthermore we say, that whatsoeuer hath ben buylded &amp; set vp more, was not (so far as we can perceiue) builded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those ancient &amp; first foundations: &amp; therefore they do not only, not set forth &amp; beautifie the building, but also wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defile, deforme, and disgrace the same: &amp; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing greater credite and authoritie hath bene giuen vnto those fayned inuentions of men, than to the pure woorde of God.</q> This is the summe of those things whiche we beleue and teach.</p>
                     <p>But to the end our purpose may be the better vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, these things whiche we haue touched generally, we will (if it may séeme good) declare particularly. Therfore we do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,<note place="margin">In the manner of obtaining Saluation.</note> and are persuaded that we may defend with al sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and modestie out of the worde of God, that the true God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:27102:107"/>
in whome we beléeue, is spoyled and robbed of his perfecte righteousnesse, if we set against his wrathe and iudgement for sinne, any other satisfaction or purgation, eyther in this world, or in any other worlde, than the sounde and perfecte obedience, the which can be found in no other, sauing in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Chryst only. In lyke manner also, if we shall saye that God doth forgiue onely parte of our sinnes, that we maye bring vnto him the other parte, we spoyle hym wholly of his mercy. Héerevpon it followeth, that when we speake of the manner of saluation, we muste stay our selues in the passion and death of Chryst Iesus our Sauiour and redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer onely: or else we must appoint in the place of the true God, some straunge and fayned God, which is neyther per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly iuste, nor perfectly mercyfull. Heerevpon also depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth another speciall poynte, and of great force, concerning the office of Iesus Chryst. For except he aboue be wholly our saluation, that precious name <hi>Iesus,</hi> that it to say, a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,</hi> béeing gyuen to him of the Angell, dothe not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto him.</p>
                     <p>In like maner also, except he be our only Prophet, which hath so fully declared vnto vs the will of his father, as should be expedient for our saluation: firste by the mouth of his Prophetes: then by himselfe with his comming at the fulnesse of tyme, and after that by his Apostles: except also he alone be the spirituall King of our consciences: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be our euerlasting Prieste after the order of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidech, and by that sacrifice of himselfe only, once offered for al, and neuer to be offered againe, hath reconcyled men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: and doth also now alone in heauen make intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs to God, euen to the end of the world: And to be short, except we be complete &amp; perfect in him, that name of <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> or <hi>Chryst,</hi> that is to say Anoynted, and appoynted of God the Father, for vs to be a Sauiour, dothe nothing at all bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto him. Therefore if the preaching of his worde out of the bookes of the Prophetes and Apostles be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:27102:107"/>
he is spoyled of his prophèticall office: if newe lawes be made, and layde vpon the consciences of men, hée should be depriued of his kingly maiestie: And if he be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again for remission of sinnes, &amp; other ways also be found out to pacifie the wrath of God, althoughe it shoulde not be sufficient to haue one Aduocate and Mediator in heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene God &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he should be defrauded of his Priesthood. Thirdely we agrée not, neyther in the defiinition, neither in the original, nor in the effectes of faythe, which by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Apostle Paule we call Iustifying: by whiche only, we affirme that Iesus Chryst with all his graces, is made ours.</p>
                     <p>As touching good workes, if there be any that thinke we contemne them, they are vtterly deceyued: For we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate no more, fayth from loue, than we separate lighte &amp; heate from fire. And with Iohn we say, <hi>He which sayth hee knoweth God, and keepeth not his commaundementes, is a lyer.</hi> But in these thinges we confesse we disagrée in thrée speciall poyntes. First of all in the originall of good woorks,<note place="margin">In the matter of faythe and good works.</note> that is to saye, from whence they come: Secondely, what those good workes are: And thirdely to what vse they are good. As touching the first principall pointe, we finde no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fréewill in man than that whiche is made frée by the grace of Chryste, and we affirme that our nature, being in that state, into the which it is falne, hath néede not onely to be holpen and susteined, but rather to be mortified, and as it were killed by the power of the holy Ghost: which founde our nature not only weakned in grace, but also destitute of all strength, and enemie to all goodnesse, and deade, yea and putrified in sinne and corruption. And this honor we giue wholly vnto God, neither do we think that in this matter we ought in any wise to be ioyned with God. For we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to his grace and mercie, the beginning, the middle, and the ende of working in vs. Concerning the seconde pointe. We acknowledge no other rule of righteousnesse and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:27102:108"/>
which may stande before God, than his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whiche are faithfully described and put downe to vs in his worde: to the whiche we thinke it not méete, that any creature should adde any thing that apertaineth to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of mens consciences, or detract from the same. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the thirde point, namely to what vse these good works are profitable. We confesse that so far forthe as they come from the spirite of God working in vs, hauing their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from so good an originall, they are good, and ought to be called by that name: howbeit, if God would examine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the rigour of his iustice, he should finde many things in them worthy of condemnation. We say also that they are profitable for an other vse: bycause by them our God is glorified, &amp; men brought to the knowledge of him: but we are persuaded that for so much as the holy Ghost is within vs (for he is certainly knowne by those effects) we are of the number of his elect, and of those that are predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to saluation. But for so much as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in question to knowe by what title the kingdome of God appertayneth<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> vnto vs: we say with S. Paule, <hi>Eternal life is the free gift of God, and not a due reward of our merits.</hi> For by this means Christ Iesus doth iustifie vs with his righteousnesse onely, which is imputed vnto vs, sanctifieth vs with his holynesse only, giuen vnto vs, &amp; redéemeth vs with his only sacrifice imputed vnto vs, by true &amp; liuely faith of the grace &amp; liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our God. Al these riches &amp; treasures are giuen vnto vs by the power of the holy Ghost, vsing the preching of Gods word, &amp; the administration of the sacraments to this ende: not as though it hath néed of those means (for God is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent) but bicause so it pleaseth him to apply &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>form him self vnto vs, &amp; by these ordinarie meanes to create &amp; nourish in vs y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> most precious gift of faith, which is as it wer at hand to apprehend &amp; take hold of those gifts, &amp; as it were a ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I vse this word, <hi>Signified.</hi> not to weaken or abolishe the Sacramentes: but to the ende I might distinguishe the signe from the thing signified. Herevpon we confesse, that it is alwayes necessarie in Sacramentes, that there be a heauenly and supernaturall change: for we say not, that the water in Baptisme is simply water, but a true Sacrament of our regeneration, and of the washing of our soules by the bloude of Christe. Neither do we say, that the breade in the holy Supper of our Lorde Iesus Christe, is simply breade: but a Sacramente of the precious body of Christe Iesus, whiche was giuen for vs, and that the wine is not simply wine, but a Sacrament of his precious bloud, which he hath shed for vs. Neuerthelesse we deny that there is any change made in substance of the signes, but in the ende and vse for the which they are instituted. We denie also that the same mutation is made by the efficacie of certaine wordes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, neyther by the intention of him that pronounceth

This truely, in fewe words, is our faith in this point, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we thinke, is not repugnant to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of Christ, nor to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle Paule, &amp; destroyeth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humane nature of Christ, neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> article of the ascention, nor the sacramentall institution, it giueth no occasion to bring in curious &amp; obscure questions: it doth by no meanes derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the coniunction which we haue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> speciall end of ordaining of sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might be either worshipped, laid vp, caryed about, or to be offered vnto God for a sacrifice: to be short,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:27102:111"/>
(excepte we be deceiued) it giueth more to the power and to the wordes of the Sonne of God, than their opinion, which thinke that his body must be really ioyned with signes, to the ende we might be partakers of him.</p>
                     <p>But concerning the administration of Baptisme we say nothing at all. For I beléeue that there is none of you that accounteth vs in the number of Anabaptistes, bycause they haue no greater enemies against them tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we. As touching certaine other particular questions in this argument of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, we trust God willing, that the speciall articles being brought to some order, by this modest and quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the rest shall of themselues easily followe. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the other fiue Sacraments, as ye call them, thus wee thinke, that vntill we be better taught by the Scriptures, they cannot be called by the name of Sacraments: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, we think that we haue broght in the true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, which standeth in this, that so many as are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised<note place="margin">Confirmation</note> in their infancie, and all others, whatsoeuer, before they come to the Lordes Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maye be instructed in the Cathechisme.</p>
                     <p>We teach also true repentance, whiche consisteth in the true acknowledging of sinnes, and in satisfaction either pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely or priuately, of the parties offended, also in absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whiche we haue in the bloud of Iesus Christ, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement of life.</p>
                     <p>We do allowe Matrimonie according to S. Paule, in all those whiche haue not the gifte of continencie: and wée thinke it vnlawfull for any man to bynde himselfe with a perpetual vowe to leade a continent life, and neuer to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and we condemne all fornication &amp; lightnesse in word, gesture, and deede. We allowe the degrees of ecclesiasticall offices, euen as God hath ordeined them in his house. We allowe visitation of sicke persones, as the speciall parts of the Ministerie of the Gospell. We teach, with S. Paule, that no man ought to be iudged for choyce in days, &amp; meats,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:27102:111"/>
for the kingdome of God doth not consiste in those corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and externall thinges. The last point to speake of, is of external order and gouernement of the ecclesiastical State, of the which we think it lawful for vs to say, by your leaue, that all things are so corrupted, that very hardely, the notes and printes of that auncient buylding very well ordered &amp; appointed by the Apostles can be seene. Of the which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticall discipline.</note> you your selues maye be witnesses, whiche toke some paines not long agoe herein. But we omitte these matters, the whiche we thinke better not to disclose than to vtter. And to conclude this Oration, we proteste before God and his Angels, before your Maiestie, (moste Christian king) and before this honorable assembly, that our purpose and meaning is nothing else, but to bring the state of the Church to that puritie and perfection, in the which it so greatly flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the Apostles tyme: and that so many of those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as should be found either superstitious, or else ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly against the worde of God, might quite be abolished and counted superfluous: also that all thinges might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaye whiche (experience teaching) bring men to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition. But if certaine thinges be founde profitable and necessarie to edification, firste consider of them wisely by the auncient Canons and authorities of the Fathers, then let them be obserued and kepte as it shall be thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and méete for the times, places, and persones: that so with one consent God maye be worshipped in spirite and truth, vnder your obedience (O King) and the obedience of those whome God hath appointed to your Maiestie to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Realme. For if there be any yet whiche thinke that the doctrine which we professe, dothe withdrawe men<note place="margin">Obedience to Magistrates.</note> from their dutifull obedience to Kinges and Magistrates: we haue to answere them. For this we teach that the firste and principall obedience is due vnto God, whiche is King of Kings, and Lord of Lordes. But if our writings may not suffise to cleare vs of that crime layd to our charge, we wil
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:27102:112"/>
bring forth many examples of principalities, of rules, and of kingdomes, that haue bene reformed by the prescript of our doctrine, which may be sufficient witnesses of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie. To be short in this point we say with S. Paule, <hi>Let euery soule submit himself to the authoritie of the higher powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Yea and Chrisostome writing vpon that place, faith, <hi>Yea, let him submit him selfe though he be an Apostle or Euangelist, bicause that subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not derogate from the glory of God.</hi> Wherefore if it shall come to passe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after that any man falsely professing oure doctrine, shall be found to rebel, but against the least of your officers, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test before God and your maiestie (O King) that such kind of men shall not be of vs, neither shal they finde more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enimyes against them than we. Therfore (O king) our desire to aduance y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God, our obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; loue which we owe to your Maiestie, our loue also towards our cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, &amp; specially to the Church of God, haue brought vs into this place, trusting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the most mighty God according to his accustomed mercy and goodnesse, will blesse you no lesse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g king <hi>Iosias:</hi> &amp; that by your most happie gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (O Quéene) &amp; by your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sels (most honorable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sellers) the ancient memory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> famous Quéene <hi>Clotilda,</hi> shal be renued: whose diligence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord vsed as a meane to make himself knowne throughout this Realme. This is our hope (most mightie king) for the which we are readie to spende our liues: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> obeying your maiestie in this so godly a matter, we may sée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> golden world, where oure Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ raigneth with all honour and glory for euer and euer.</p>
                     <p>Thus far <hi>Beza</hi> procéeded in his oration: who with his fellowes fell on their knées, and standing vp straight way againe, offred vnto the king the confession of the Churches of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and then he spake thus vnto him: We beséeche your Maiestie not to regarde oure rude and barbarous speache, but our well wishing mindes wholy consecrated to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:27102:112"/>
obedience. But, bicause the principall pointes of oure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, are more plainly and copiously contained in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our faith, we beséech your Maiestie to receiue the the same: and we trust (by the leaue of God) it will come to passe that when we haue conferred together with all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie and reuerence we shall come to some agréement. But if our iniquities be the cause that we may not obtaine so greate a blessing, we doubte not but your Maiestye will consyder of all thinges, and prouide for them accordingly, without preiudice of any partie.</p>
                     <p>And here wée thinke it not good to let one thing passe, namely, that when <hi>Beza</hi> intreated of the Lords supper, and spake these wordes, <hi>As touching the distance of places, the bodie of Christ is so far from the bread and wine, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is higher than the earth:</hi> the Prelates were so moued, that by and by they began to make disturbance, and to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, but this being somewhat quieted, <hi>Beza</hi> made an ende of his oration. After whom the Cardinall of <hi>Turnon,</hi> hauing great indignation, and shaking and trembling for very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger began in the name of the Popishe Prelacie (of which he was chiefe) to declare vnto the king, that the Cardinall, Bishoppes, and the reste of their fellowship, by reason of the kings commaundemente, gaue their consente that the newe Euangelistes (for so he termed the menne of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed Churches) shoulde be hearde what they coulde saye, but notwithstanding, not withoute some offence of their consciences, bycause they perceyued that they myghte speake manye things not méete for a Christian Prince to heare: which might also, (and that not withoute cause,) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the mindes of many good men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therfore he sayd, that the Prelates suspecting that it woulde so come to passe, had giuen hym commaundement to intreate the King, that if any suche matters fell oute he woulde not in any wyse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue their wordes. And that therefore he would reiect both
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:27102:113"/>
the wordes and sentence of that fellowe, that had spoken in the name of those of the new Religion: staying and suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his iudgement vntill the Prelates hadde otherwyse opened the matter: the which if it might please him, he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted that both the king, and the whole assembly shoulde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand &amp; see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what diffenre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce there was between the truth and a lye.</p>
                     <p>He required also, that he might haue a daye giuen him to answere. Adding that had it not beene for the regarde they hadde vnto the King, and to his commaundementes, they would not, at the hearing of those horrible and abhemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wordes which that other fellowe vttered, haue suffered him to haue procéeded any further. At the length he besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the King that he would follow the faith and footesteps of his auncestors: the whiche he prayed all the Saintes in heauen, and the Uirgin Mary to graunt.</p>
                     <p>To this the Quéene answered that nothing was doone in<note place="margin">The Queene answereth the Cardinall of Turnon.</note> this matter without due aduice and counsell, by the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Princes, and the priuie Councell, and by the iudgement and consent of the Senate of <hi>Paris.</hi> The whiche (she sayd) was not done to alter any thing in Religion but to quiet the troubles that were rysen through the diue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>sitie of opinions in Religion, and by these means to bring those that were gone astraye into the way againe. Which (sayth she) you and your fellowes ought to séeke, specially at this time, by vsing good and strong argumentes.</p>
                     <p>Thus the mynds of the Popishe Prelates being galled, and very much grieued at the first méeting, <q>with the words of <hi>Theodore B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>za,</hi> the daye following, he writ vnto the Quéene, saying, bycause he feared that she was not fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, by reason of certen words wherat the Prelats were offended: therfore he earnestly desired of hir, that he might haue libertie more plainly &amp; largely to discourse that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which then he could not copiously declare. The occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therfore (saith he) of those words by me vttered, was the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:27102:113"/>
opinion of certaine men, which not wel vnderstanding our mindes, thought that we went about to exclude Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Supper: the which to doe were manifestly wicked, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue the contrary to be found in the word of God, namely, that, that precious Sacrament was therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned by the sonne of God, that he might make vs more and more partakers of the substance of his verye body and bloude, whereby we might more straightly be vnited vnto him and mighte growe to euerlasting life: And vnlesse it should be so, it were not the Supper of Iesu Christ. And therefore it is so far from vs that we should say that Christ is absent from the Supper, that none of all others, more resiste that blasphemie than we. But we saye that there is great difference betwéene these, to say that Iesus Christ is in the Supper in that he gyueth truely vnto vs his bodye and bloude, and to say and affirme, that his bodye &amp; bloude is ioyned to the bread.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That first I haue affirmed, bicause it is the principall &amp; chiefe, the seconde I haue denyed, bicause I thinke it to be repugnant to the truth of Christ his nature, and to the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the ascention, as it is in Scripture, and as the ancient fathers expounde the same. This sentence and opinion gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth more dignitie and authoritie to the worde of God, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which teacheth that Christe is really and corporally ioyned to signes. This therefore is the declaration &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that which we spake, which I desyre may satisfie you: being ready to be taught if better be shewed. To this also he added certaine testimonies of the Fathers. As of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> writing vpon the. 5. Chapter of S. Iohn, where he saith: <hi>VVhen our Sauiour Christ saide ye shall not haue me alwayes with you: he spake of the presence of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. For, according to his Maiestie, prouidence, and inuisible grace, that which he promised in another place, is fulfilled: I will be with you to the ende of the world: But according to his humane nature which he toke, according to that, that he</hi>

                     <p>They did also deliberate, whether it were not good to haue a confession made, which shoulde be offered to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:27102:114"/>
but if their chosen men, which were appointed to dispute for them had denied to imbrate the same, that then they should haue the sentence of condemnation proncu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced against them as heretikes: &amp; so the disputation sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But this their deuise was not fully concluded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that many of them woulde not agrée vnto the same And when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministers of the reformed Churches heard of this deuise, they complained to the king &amp; Queene that the matter was not indifferently handled, beseching them that the fruit and profite of the conference might not be hindred by these plat formes and subtill deuises.</p>
                     <p>Therfore the conference began againe the sixtene day of<note place="margin">The seconde session.</note> September the king &amp; Quéene, the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and the Princes the kings kinsme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And here the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> first of all spake very largely in the behalfe of the Prelates, concerning the obedience of his fellowes<note place="margin">The oration of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Loraine.</note> towards the king, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which they acknowledged to owe vnto him by the commaundement of God, &amp; confessed that they wold gladly giue the same vnto him. Notwithstanding that the king ought to haue great care to defend the Church, not as heade, but as a member of the same: and, that in those<note place="margin">Note here the subiection of Papistes.</note> things which appertaine to doctrine, he ought to be subiecte to the Church, and to the ministers thereof, as the expresse testimonies of scripture, and the examples of the ancient fathers doe declare. Therefore (saith he) we doe make this the grounde of all our reasons, that all obedience ought to be giuen to the King. But comming more neere to his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he declareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the assembly whose cause he had in hand did consist of Archbishops, of Bishops ordinarily made, of Priests, of Canons, &amp; of a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of others.

had declared some good will to profite: if they would come againe into their cuntrey and into the ancient house of the Fathers, they shall be receiued, and haue nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is past cast in their téeth: if so be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wil shew themselues pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and will become obedient children to the Churche. Therefore I will frame my selfe according to their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: being glad that they professe with vs the articles of our faith: and I hartely wishe that as in words so in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we maye agrée together. Therefore I will answere them in the spirite of loue and modestie. But I will handle onely two articles, bicause it will be to tedious to intreate of euery one of them particularly.</p>
                     <p>And the two articles whereof I will speake, are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Churche, and concerning the Lordes Supper.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore, concerning the firste, it is not true <hi>I hat the Church doth consist only of the Elect,</hi> bicause in the Lords barne the chaffe is mingled with the wheate: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Church cannot erre.</p>
                     <p>But if some part of the Church shoulde erre, the whole body ought to be preferred before one corrupte member: if any euill should créepe in, then we muste haue recourse to antiquitie, and muste haue respecte to the chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Churches, among which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had alwayes the principall place. If any thing were founde to be amisse in some perticular place of the Church, we must set against the Ignoraunce of a small number of men, the decrées of the auncient and of the generall Counsels. But if this thing maye not suffice, we muste diligently séeke for the iudgements of the approued fathers of the Catholique Churche: notwithstanding we must specially giue place to the testimonies of Scripture, being expounded by the true voyce and interpretation of the Church, least heretikes shoulde bragge and saye that they alone haue the worde of God. For the Catholique Churche must giue authoritie to the word of God. The which order, bicause the <hi>Arrians</hi> kept

not, they fell into great mischiefes: into which destruction they also are like to fal, which seyng not the beame in their owne eyes, are very busie to plucke out the moate in other mens eyes. As touching the seconde pointe, which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Sacrament of the Lordes Supper, I must néedes confesse that I and the whole Clergie are greatly gréeued to sée that the blessed Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariste,</hi> which the<note place="margin">The opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Cardinall of Loraine concerning the Sacrament.</note> Lorde left vnto vs to be a bonde and pledge of peace and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, should by curiositie of searching out of déepe matters, be after a sort, an occasion not onely of infinite controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, but also of forsaking the truth, which maye scarcely be kepte among these controuersies. For in the <hi>Eucharste</hi> we ought to consider foure things. The firste is the vnion and<note place="margin">1</note> concorde, which ought to be among the faithfull, according to, that which the Apostle saith, that <hi>VVe are one body, and partakers of one cup.</hi> The second is the vnion with Christ<note place="margin">2</note> Iesus, as it is sayd, <hi>He which eateth my fleshe and drinketh my bloude abideth in me, and I in him.</hi> The thirde is remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">3</note> of sinnes, which is purchased by the effusion of Christe his bloude. The fourth is, the hope of euerlasting life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">4</note> to that which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>He which eateth this btead shall liue for euer.</hi> But the contrary doth happen in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, namely distractions and diuisions in the Church, the separation from God, the losse of remission of sinnes, &amp; of the hope of euerlasting life. Diuers and sundrye are the controuersies of oure aduersaries concerning this matter, of the which there are eight in number. It is better to abide in the approued opinion and iudgemente of the Catholike Church, which is, that the very body of God &amp; of our Lord Iesus Christ &amp; his very bloude also, is present and receiued in this Sacrament: according as it is sayd, <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> The which wordes, excepte they be in déede of as great force as they sounde and séeme to be, why are they so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently repeated in like wordes of all the Euangelistes and of the Apostle Paule also? Why did not the other three

Euangelistes, &amp; the Apostle Paule, which wrote after Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, writ after that maner y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Sacramentaries would write? specially seyng in a matter of lesse waight they doe one of them expounde another: and that which one of them setteth forth obscurely, another plainely declareth. This is the mynde of the Testator, which by no maner of meanes ought to be disalowed or violated: This is also the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and doctrine of all the ancient writers, that not onely the breade is giuen by the Priest, but also the very body of Christ really. Therefore I imbrace this stable &amp; hole some opinion, and I doe abhorre with all my hearte the curious opinions and sayings of these newe men, which seme so to represent Christe, as if they shoulde bring him forthe in a Tragedie or Comedie.

And then he concluded his oration with these wordes: I come &amp; yelde (sayth he) to your opinion of the Sacramente, excepte ye thinke that Iesus Christe, as touching his fleshe, is in this world from the time of his ascention, and that, more nowe than he was before he toke vpon him our fleshe: excepte ye thinke that Christ hath some other bodye than that whiche is visible: excepte ye thinke that he is otherwise in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

Let them therefore sée and consider which iudge and examine oure Religion not by Philosophie, but by Diuinitie, which of vs two doe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more to the power of God, and to Iesus Christ. And so praying to God to roote out these daungerous and deadly opinions, and not to suffer these controuersies to be in his Churche, he exhorted the king and the Quéene, that they woulde take vpon them the patrocinie and defence of thys matter: and protested in the name of the Prelates of the French Churche that he would liue and die in the defence of this doctrine which he had set forth.</p>

Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of these detractions of times, the ministers fearing that the disputation shoulde be ended, they determined to offer vnto the King a supplication, praying him, that, for so much as, at his commaundement they were come thether from so far countreys, quietly to confer with the Prelates for the rooting out of errors, which so manye yeares had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the Church, they mighte haue leaue to confer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to declare their cause, &amp; that he him selfe woulde take vpon him the defence of Religion: whiche they sayde, was the meane and way to raygne and rule himself, and to preserue his kingdome in peace and tranquillitie.

But in the Scripture there are found two kindes of callings. The one conioyned with the efficacie of the holy Ghost, of which there is mention made in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of S.

For if it be taken generally

for all those which doe externally professe that they doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to Gods calling, then there is no doubt, but so many reprobates and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But if this worde or name <hi>Churche</hi> be taken more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and strictlye, as oftentimes it is, then we saye that it onely comprehendeth those that are predestinate and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen of God. And to the ende men maye perceiue that wee haue not deuised nor inuented this phrase of speache, and much lesse this doctrine, when it is sayde, That the Church is the bodye of the Lorde, bones of his bones, and fleshe of his fleshe, how can the reprobates be comprehended in this<note place="margin">1.

But other some are in the house of God, but are not the house of God. For they are as the chaffe with the wheate.</hi> But hereof there séemeth to aryse a question, whether the<note place="margin">Question.</note> Churche be inuisible: the which séemeth of necessitie to be concluded, for so muche as God onely knoweth his electe, &amp;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:27102:118"/>
seing also we confesse that we beléeue the holy Church: And<note place="margin">Answere.</note> that which is beléeued is not séene.

Where shall then be the waye of our saluation except the Churche be knowne that we may cleaue vnto Christe Iesus, seyng that he doth declare his vertue and sauing health in one Churche? Therefore wée saye, that althoughe the Churche in consideration of those things, whereof we spake euen nowe, can not be séene of men, yet notwithstanding we haue certain notes to know, to what Churche we oughte to ioyne oure selues, namely, the pure worde of God, and the sincere administration of<note place="margin">True notes of the Church.</note> Sacramentes.

                        <note place="margin">1.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus therefore we speake of the Churche not transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng the same into fantasticall imaginations, neyther yet (as it séemeth vnto vs) doe wée giue occasion to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:27102:119"/>
Nowe therefore I come to those notes and badges of the Churche, the which we must diligently beholde, seing out of the same there is no saluation, neither anye manner of thing which Sathan our auncient ennme hath not gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout at all times to counterfaite and falsifie.</p>
                     <p>I sayde that there were two certaine and vndoubted markes, namely the preaching of the word, and the sincere administration of Sacramentes. There are some also which adde Ecclesiasticall discipline, and the fruite of the preaching of Gods worde. But bicause our iniquities will not suffer these two notes to appeare, therefore let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentour selues with those two first.</p>
                     <p>That the word of God is a true badge and marke of the Church, it may hereby appeare, that the word is compared vnto seede. Therefore Paule sayth, that he had begotten the Corinthians in the Lorde, that is to saye, by the preaching of the worde. And therefore in manye places, it is called meate and foode, according to the saying of the Lorde: <hi>My sheepe heare my voyce, but they knowe not the voyce of a straunger.</hi> Also the sacraments are a true note of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, bicause the Lord would instruct vs not onely by the eares, but also by the eyes, and other corporall senses: in so much that he would haue the Sacramentes to be manifest testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and certaine and visible notes of the vnion of the faithfull, first with him, and secondly betwéene themselues. Therefore it was sayde in the time of the olde Testament: <hi>Let the man that is vncircumcised be thruste oute from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people:</hi> and therefore the maister of euery house was wont thrice euery yeare to present themselues in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> that they mighte testifie the vnitie of faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by those sacrifices. Afterward, the vayle being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the cloase shut gate being broken open, the Iewes and the Gentils grewe into one bodye, not onelye by the preaching of the worde, but also by Baptisme, and by the<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> holy Sacrament of the bodye and bloud of Christe. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:27102:119"/>
to this, Christ sayd to his Apostles, <hi>Go and preache to euery creature, baptizing in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> Whereby both the word and Sacraments are noted. For that is to be ioyned with bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme which Paule speaketh of the Supper, saying, that <hi>He gaue that which he receiued of the Lorde.</hi> And this is also the verye same whiche is saide in another place, <hi>That the Church is founded vpon the Prophetes and Apostles,</hi> that is to say, vpon Christ Iesus, which is the heade corner stone, that is to say, the matter and substance of the propheticall and Apostolical doctrine. And thus the other place of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Apostle oughte to bée vnderstoode, that the Churche is the strength and piller of truth, that is to say the word of God, and the same truth of God (as S. Ihon sayth) doth sustayne and holde vp the Church, as also <hi>Chrisostome</hi> interpreteth it. These are the true and visible notes of the Churche, the which Church, bicause it bringeth forthe the faithfull, and nourisheth them with the heauenly &amp; incorruptible meate, is called their mother and Nource.</p>
                     <p>But and if the worde be preached and the Sacramentes ministred, it must néedes followe that there be pastors and teachers, to whom those offices may be committed, as the scriptures in diuers places testifieth, and the Apostle Paule also.</p>
                     <p>Herevpon it commeth to passe, that many adde a thirde note, namely, ordinarie succession from the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. To the which we answere, that suche succession<note place="margin">Succession in the Church.</note> ought to be greatly estéemed, so long as it is rightly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and applyed: euen as the Fathers often times vsed the same against heretikes, as it is to be séene in <hi>Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Irenaeus,</hi> and in <hi>Augustine</hi> against the <hi>Maniches</hi> and <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes.</hi> But bycause they set that buckser againste vs, as bringers in of newe things: it is necessarie that we declare what we thinke of this thing.</p>
                     <p>We say that there is one succession of doctrine, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:27102:120"/>
of persons.</p>
                     <p>The succession of doctrine we acknowledge for the true and vndoubted marke of the Churche, according to those things whereof we haue spoken before. For althoughe the doctrine of the Gospell is neuer a whit the more worthy to be beleued for antiquitie, &amp; although it commeth to passe by the iudgement of God, for oure iniquities, that the same is counted sometimes so newe vnto men, when it shoulde be familiar and knowne: yet notwithstanding the auncient &amp; continuall succession doth greatly preuaile with men, euen to the farther confirming of the authoritie of the same.</p>
                     <p>As touching the succession of persons, we acknowledge the same: but vpon that conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it be ioyned with the succession of the Prophetes &amp; Apostles, specially in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall and principall points of faith, &amp; not otherwise. But waye and consider that I speake of doctrine, &amp; not of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For although the integritie of doctrine &amp; of life be here vnto required, that a man shoulde be counted for a good and true pastor, yet notwithstanding we do not reiecte a pastor for ignorance, or the diuersitie of opinions in smal matters of doctrine, and for maners, if so be that he kepe the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus are we taught of Christ, who sayth, <hi>So far forth as the Scribes and Pharisies sit vpon Moises chaire, doe that which they teach, and not as they do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The which place, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> writing vpon Ihon, saith ought to be vnderstande of hirelings, which neuerthelesse retaine sound doctrine, &amp; not of false pastors, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ speaketh, saying, <hi>Beware of the leuen of the Phariseis.</hi> By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (sayth S. <hi>Augustine</hi>) they sit vpon <hi>Moises</hi> chaire, they teache the lawe of God, &amp; so God speaketh by them: but if they will teach their owne doctrines, ye shall neither heare nor do that which they teach.</p>
                     <p>Therfore to come to the matter, bycause false prophetes may succéede true prophets, &amp; wolues the true shepheards: this truely is a sounde and manifest reason, wherefore we

thinke that personall succession ought not onely, not to be receiued, but also vtterly to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, bicause it giueth place to that which is false, &amp; craftely coloureth the same, least the succession of doctrine should be laid for the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Furthermore, if personall succession should simply be taken for a true note of the Churche, we muste bring forth and shew a certaine sure promise of God, by which he hath bounde his grace to certaine definite places and Regions, the which we thinke can in no wyse be shewed oute of the newe Testament: seyng this is rather manifestly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there is a certain catholique or vniuersal Church, bycause the particular members thereof are dispersed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the whole world, euen as it pleaseth God to shew forth his iudgements vpon those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath vtterly caste off, or who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he chastiseth for a time, and to shewe his mercy and blessings vpon those, whom he preserueth, or whom he newly bringeth to the knowledge of him. For God shewing his vengeaunce in certaine places séemeth to abolishe atl things, in so muche that there is no manner of signe of the Church left, as it is come to passe in all <hi>Africa, Greece,</hi> &amp; in the whole East part of the world. But sometime that personal succession doth decay only for a little while, as it happened at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the time of <hi>Samosatene,</hi> &amp; at <hi>Alexandri,</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> &amp; in many other Churches also, so long as there were heresies among them. And to be short, personall succession ceassed in the time of <hi>Honorious,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the yeare of oure Lorde God. D. LXXXI. for the execrable doctrine of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> and in the time of Iohn the xxii. of that name, who was condemned of Heresie: excepte we shoulde saye that manyfest Heretikes maye be true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours. I omitte to speake of those things which happened in the tyme of that woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pope <hi>IOANE,</hi> and of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde tumultes of the false vsurping Popes, which the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories make mention of.</p>
                     <p>These things therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, I conclude, that if we wil
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:27102:121"/>
rightly knowe the Churche, we muste not haue regarde to<note place="margin">Successors of the Apostles.</note> personall succession, but to the puritie of doctrine, &amp; to the sincere administration of the Sacraments: in so much that we must counte them for the true successors of the Apostles which being rightly called, do build vpon their foundation: and do first of all set forth the word of God in certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether the succession of persons be perpetual, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it decay or ceasse for a time.</p>
                     <p>Wheras on the contrary parte, they which either preach not the word of God at all, or else preache their owne doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in stéede of the Apostles doctrine, althoughe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and bring in for them selues, a thousande continuall successors, are not to be hearde as pastors, but to be shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as wolues: according to the expresse commaundement of Christ Iesus and of his Apostles.</p>
                     <p>But some man will obiect and say: is it lawfull then for<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> euerye man to preache the worde and to minister the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes? No truely, it ought not so to bée. For al things muste be done in the Churche of God (as the Apostle saith)<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> in order?</p>
                     <p>Who are then true Pastors? surely suche as are lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called.</p>
                     <p>It resteth therefore now to consider what is lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<note place="margin">Vocation in the Churche, ordinarie, and extraordinary.</note> that this speciall matter also may be vnderstoode. We say that there is one forme and maner of ordinary calling, and another of extraordinarie calling. That is ordinarie calling, in the which, the order appointed of GOD in the Church, is obserued. In this order the first thing is, The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination<note place="margin">1</note> of doctrine and maners: the seconde, lawfull<note place="margin">2</note> election: and the laste, imposition of handes. These thrée<note place="margin">3</note> things may be gathered &amp; approued, by diuers testimonies of Scriptures: as by the election of <hi>Mathias,</hi> and of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">Act. 1. Act. 6. 1. Timo. 3. Titus. 1.</note> Deacons in the Actes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles: and also by those things which Paule writeth in his Epistles to <hi>Timothie,</hi> &amp; to <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>tus.</hi> This is the descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ordinarie calling. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:27102:121"/>
it maye be gathered, that the same is an extraordinarie calling, in the which, although it be lawful by Gods autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, either one of these two things, or both, or else all, are wanting. The which kinde of callings God hath ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times vsed as in the Scriptures appeareth. For who layd hands<note place="margin">Exod. 28. Esay. 6. 9. Dom. 1. 17. Amos. 7. 14.</note> on <hi>Moyses</hi> to dedicate <hi>Aaron:</hi> Who annointed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, <hi>Esayas, Daniel, Amos,</hi> and many others? Therfore when they which had authoritie, abused the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie calling, then I saye, it was necessarie that the Lorde should vse extraordinarie meanes, not to bring in confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to refourme those which had peruerted and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued al things in the Church, vnder the colour and pretence of ordinarie succession. And that the matter standeth thus, the writings of the Prophetes which specially inueye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Priestes, do manifestly declare.</p>
                     <p>If any man obiecte and say, that they had extraordinarie<note place="margin">Esay. 28. Iere. 7. Ezechiel. 22. Soph. 3.</note> testimonies of their calling confirmed with certaine mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, we answere, That this is so far true in some, that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some, it is starke false: except we shuld speake of those things of the which there is no testimonie. And truely I cannot tell whether there be many Prophetes to be found of the progenie of <hi>Aaron,</hi> vpon whome hands were laide af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an ordinarie maner. If in like maner it be alledged that they contented themselues with the office of reprehending and reprouing, and exercised not the office of sacrificing: we answere, first of all, that this is not founde euery where to be true. For <hi>Samuel</hi> which was not of the familie of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Samuel. 7. 1. King. 18.</note> but of <hi>Chore</hi> sacrificed in <hi>Mispa.</hi> And <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Carmel.</hi> Secondly we answere, that it ought not to séeme straunge that the prophetes at that time extended not that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie office, to the doing and fulfilling of ceremonies, seing that the same office did appertaine by inheritaunce to the kindred and stocke of <hi>Leui,</hi> which at this day is out of vse. Thus far therefore concerning these speciall pointes, what is the Church: what are the markes of the same: what is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:27102:122"/>
the vocation of Pastors, we haue spoken oure iudgement. The which things if ye meane to call in question &amp; to séeke and trie whether they be in oure Churches, or in oure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, we trust, by the helpe of God, to bring suche certaine reasons, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can doubt that we haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Church, and that our calling is lawfull.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs come to the third principall point, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth<note place="margin">Authoritie of the Church. Hebt 11.</note> the authoritie of the Church.

                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> the which the Church is beautified.

Cor. 13.</note> God, but in part. To be shorte, we confesse, that out of the Church, there is no saluation, seyng there is life no where else, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Christ Iesus, who exerciseth his quickning lyfe in no other than in his members, the vinion and coagmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof is called the Church.

For it were an easie matter (sauing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reuerence which we owe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to note many blemishes &amp; spots, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the greatest &amp; most ancient

fathers, but we wil not stand in repeating of them, both for the honour which they worthily deserue, &amp; also for that the Lord Cardinall (if I wel reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber his words) thinketh not that they ought rashly and indifferently to be receiued.</p>
                     <p>This is our opnion concerning the particular me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the church, whose perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is no such cause or let, but that the Church may consist of them.

                        </gap>le and little both in the knowledge of God, and also in the perfection of maners.</p>
                     <p>But and if the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church be considered more generally, as they be distributed into diocesses, &amp; prouinces, shal we say that they may erre? Moreouer, if I be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, my Lorde Cardinall thoughte of late that particular Churches, and prouinciall councels may erre, and haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes erred: And truely this thing is confirmed by so long experience, that I thinke not that any man in his right<note place="margin">General coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles.</note> wittes will denie the same. It remaineth therfore that we consider the whole Church vniuersally.</p>
                     <p>But how? For if we beholde the same in the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a certain general Councell, first, it is not likely that all the force and vertue which the holy Ghost hath powred out vpon the Church, is restrained to a certaine number of prelates, which are oftentimes neuer the more learned nor any whit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better, although they represent all those, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are sent. For how ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times may it come to passe that some one man altogether vnlearned, shall haue more wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> learned of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany beside?

And who will denie, but that they which are absent, haue oftentimes had the more sound and better iudgement tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those that were present? Beside these things, ye also my Lordes doe know, what great confusion raigneth in the Church, and specially in the greatest offices of the Prelacie: in so much that we may say, The greatest corruption hath bene in that part, which ought to haue béen more per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>But let this be spoken, my Lordes, not that I touche or meane any of you, but onely to declare, that seyng the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall vocations in the Churche are so fowly corrupted, it cannot be, that the generall Councels after so long time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by a multitude of such wicked men, should be so gouerned by the holy Ghost that it cannot erre.

                     <p>Furthermore if a general Councell haue this priuiledge, that it cannot erre, neither in the rule of doctrine, nor in the forme of maners, we demaunde, when and at what time it obtained this priuiledge. For there was neuer at any time, but one faith, &amp; one Church. And the Prophetes do plainly
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:27102:123"/>
declare, and the histories doe euidently confirme the same, that the ancient Church in the tyme of the olde Testament hath erred. <hi>All the beholders thereof are blinde,</hi> (sayth the<note place="margin">Esay. 56.</note> Prophet) <hi>they knowe nothing, they are dumbe dogges.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> sayth, <hi>From the Prophet to the Priest</hi>

                     <p>If any man obiect and say, that these things happened in the time of the olde Testamente, we reply that this is no answere, for bicause it shal be alwayes a strong conclusion, that the congregation of the Prelates or Papistes of the Church although it be vniuersal at the last, is gouerned ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the spirite of error than by the holye Ghoste.

                     <p>I remember, my Lorde Cardinall, that ye saide, that the firme and vndoubted interpretation, which was alwayes in the Church, euery where, and of all men receiued, oughte to be imbraced. But who will certifie vs of those thrée prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pointes? Furthermore if we come to these wordes, <hi>Alwayes,</hi> and <hi>Of all men,</hi> at what time shall we begin, but onely at the Apostolicall Churche? And who shall be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the first, but the Apostles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, whose stories <hi>Luke</hi> hath so faithfully described, and are also to be séene by their writings. Therefore bicause all truth dependeth vpon God, which hath made the Prophetes, and Apostles to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of our saluation, we alwayes come to this foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>And yet neuerthelesse we reiect not the iudgementes of Councels and of the Fathers, so that they agrée with the Scriptures: the which, as S. <hi>Austine</hi> saythe, are so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and placed by the holy Ghost, that the same which in one place is spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obscurely, in another place is more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vttered.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding here remayne certaine doubtes to be opened, and expounded. For there are many which thinke, that the will of God, as touching our saluation, is not fully contained in the writings of the Apostles. But I pray you consider with your selues, if this be graunted, what a way is made to all errors? And truely, by this way, Sathan hath greatly broken into the Lordes vineyarde. Neuerthelesse we doe not denie, that God before <hi>Moyses</hi> time, ordered and taught his Church by visions and reuelations, and that the Apostles builded the Churches with their owne voyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:27102:125"/>
they had written any thing.</p>
                     <p>But why would God, the number and wickednesse of men increacing, haue this doctrine to be described, which was preached and knowne to all men? for this cause truly that he might preuent their subtill craftes, which colour all their doings, wyth the names of tradition, of reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of custome. But if this doctrine be onely written in part, what shall this remedie profite? Ihon truely spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not thus of the Scriptures, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayth, <hi>These things</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ihon. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>are written that ye mighte beleeue, that Iesus is Christ, the Sonne of God, and that in beleeuing, ye might haue life:</hi> the which no doubt should be false, if there were any other doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine necessarie to saluation. In like manner the Apostle Paule, expounding the vse of doctrine, and in the person of <hi>Timothie,</hi> instructing all the ministers of the Churche, had not sayd, that <hi>The Scriptures make the man of God,</hi> that is<note place="margin">2. Timo. 3.</note> to say, the minister, and euery faithfull man) <hi>perfecte, and fully giuen to all good woorkes:</hi> if any thing oughte to be ioyned to the same. Notwithstanding we doubte not, but that there haue bene alwayes from time to time vnwritten traditions, as touching the order and maner of doing. But bycause manye of late dayes do abuse this worde <hi>(Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)</hi> we will shewe what Traditions oughte to be recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The which shall be easily done if these two things be considered: namely, if the doctrines be conformable, and fyt to edification. For this is alwayes firme and certaine, that the Apostles and true shepeherdes, neuer appointed rites, either dirictly or inderectly contrary to holesome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: or other things which might in any point or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ot draw men from the spirituall worship of God. Therefore when this rule shall be obserued and kept, it will be an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to discerne true doctrine from traditions, and true tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions from those that are false. You also may remember how greatly <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his tractation of the Scriptures, condemneth those which sayd that the Apostles lefte some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:27102:126"/>
obscure &amp; not sufficiently expounded, which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I will say more, namely that the same which the Apostles haue done here is not perpetual: not as though they were not by al exception the greater witnesses but bicause they did beare somewhat with the infirmitie of the Iewes by the rule of charitie: as in willng them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things offered to Idols, &amp; from strangled: and in that also which Paule did in <hi>Timothe</hi> &amp; in himself, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which<note place="margin">Act. 15 16. 18</note> things at this day ought to haue no place, but onely by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule of indifferent things, which of themselues are<note place="margin">Things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</note> neither good nor euill, in which things we ought to applye our selues to the infirmitie of our brethren.</p>
                     <p>These things also may be gathered of the rytes which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed with their times, as the maner of kissing one another in going bareheaded in signe of authoritie, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the common custome of many people.</p>
                     <p>All these things therfore ought to be considered, before a custome be established as apostolicall: least the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call authoritie and custome be abused to the disturbing of the churches, as it came to passe after the Apostles tyme, for the feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> and in the Apostles time for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> as appeareth by Luke.<note place="margin">Actes. 15.</note> How then shall we thinke that the Apostles founde oute so many ceremonies, in which afterwards was placed remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, when as plainely they haue testified the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. <hi>Augustine</hi> complained of these things long ago: and there is no doubte, but that if he had bene in these our dayes he shoulde haue had greater occasione to complaine. To be short therfore, we wishe that the Scripture which is very plaine in these matters, maie Iudge betwene traditions that are good and euil betwéen holy and prophane, betwene profitable and hurtful, and betwene such as are necessary, and those that are super flucus.</p>
                     <p>The which being graunted, this question may easily be resolued, namely, <hi>VVhether the Church be aboue the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:27102:126"/>
The which questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> semeth so absurde vnto me as if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld demaund, whether the father were inferior to the sonne, or whether the wife were aboue the husband, or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue God.</p>
                     <p>And truly the true Church neuer complaineth and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mureth against God in this matter, but alwaies modestly submitteth it self vnto him. Neither maketh it any matter that the Church was before the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>For that word which was afterwardes written, is more<note place="margin">The worde of God more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient than the Church.</note> ancient tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church, seing of the same, the Church was conceiued, begotten, &amp; brought forth, &amp; hath also of the same his denominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And to disproue this the saying of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine is brought against vs, when he saith: <hi>I would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue the scripture, were it not that the authoritie of the church did force me thervnto.</hi> But we must consider y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. <hi>Austine</hi> speaketh here in the person of <hi>Manichaeus.</hi> For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do contend about the truth of some instrument, to whom in the end shal they go but to the Scriuener or Notary, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath the first draught or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terpane of the same: Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it doth not here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> folow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the person of the Notary, the which should be no lesse firme and strong, althoughe the Notarie being aliue, woulde refuse to giue testimonie of the same. The same answere muste be made to those, whiche thinke<note place="margin">Canonicall Bookes.</note> the authoritie of the Canonicall bookes of scripture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende vpon the determination of the Church.</p>
                     <p>But I will content my selfe to adde vnto that, wherof I haue spoken before, one only argument, confirmed by the authoritie of certaine approued Fathers.</p>
                     <p>The argument is this, Christe him selfe did so muche e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéeme of the doctrine of the Prophet, that he sought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme hys doctrine by their testimonies. After the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Apostle Paule went about to confirme the Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians<note place="margin">Actes. 17.</note> in his doctrine. Peter also the Apostle commendeth vnto vs and alloweth this order of teaching.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:27102:127"/>
Therefore it is not méete that they which call them selues Christ his vicars, and the successors of Paule &amp; Peter shuld<note place="margin">2. Peter. 1.

Furthermore, thus sayth Saint Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>The error either of the fathers or of the elders, ought not to be followed, but the authoritie of Scriptures.</hi> And Chrisostome sayth, <hi>He which will knowe which is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Bycause so soone as heresie hadde entered into the Churches, there coulde not be had a true probation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianisme: neither can they which would knowe the truth of faith, finde any other refuge than the holy scripture.</p>
                     <p>Whosoeuer therefore woulde know the true Church of Christ, how shuld he know the same but by the Scriptures?

so vncertaine, the certaine victory of truth cannot be gotten. At the last he obscurely sayde, that God beside his Councell, had giuen vnto vs his doctrine in writing, &amp; saide that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> was the author of this saying.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Beza</hi> made answere that those long &amp; tedious words of the Monke were very impertinent to their conference, and nothing helping to that peace and concorde which they wished: and directing his oration to the Quéene, he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sech hir to prouide that they might neuer afterward swarue &amp; fall into perturbations &amp; troubles not seruing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Therefore (sayth he) that I may answere to the firste doubt of <hi>Espensius,</hi> from whence the Ministers of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, had their calling, seing they were not called by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">Imposition of handes.</note> meanes, neither had receiued the imposition of handes: know ye, that Imposition or laying on of handes, is not the speciall note of lawfull calling: for the principall and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall notes are, the Inquisition of maners and doctrine,<note place="margin">Signes of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling.</note> and Election: from the which two, if imposition of handes shall be wanting, yet we muste not thinke the calling to be any whyt the lesse lawfull. We are elected Ministers, and approued of our Churches, which with one consent haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed our Ministerie. But wheras we haue not had impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of handes, nor appointed by those whome ye call Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, that oughte not to séeme straunge, seing that in so greate confusion of all things in the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> wée would not receiue imposition of hands of those, whose vices superstition, and false doctrine we disalowe: for that they were open enimyes to the truth. It is out of all doubte, that the Prophetes in olde time had no greater aduersaries than the Priestes, whiche reiected sounde doctrine, and neglected their office and duetie.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:27102:129"/>
into those offices, which they executed and discharged faithfully with great perill and daunger of their life? The which also we ought to do at this time. And it ought not to be said that Myracles are necessarily to be required to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie callings: for that which is written concerning the calling of <hi>Moyses,</hi> is not common to all.</p>
                     <p>For by what Myracles were the callings of <hi>Esayas, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Miracles.</note> and <hi>Zacharias</hi> confirmed? Did the Apostle Paule loke for imposition of handes of the Phariseys, that he might exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that office which God had committed vnto him? And when he woulde confirme his Apostleship, he speaketh not onely of the Myracles whiche he had done, but also of the fruites of his preaching: The which also we may say, of so many kingdomes and prouinces, which haue receiued the Gospell by our preaching, notwithstanding so many lettes and impedimentes to hinder the same: and we thinke that there cannot be required of vs a more firme confirmation of oure Ministerie, seyng the vertue and power of God is manifest in vs, the which neither bondes, neither impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, neither fire, neither banishments, nor death could let.</p>
                     <p>Albeit, sayth <hi>Espensius,</hi> bring ye me one onely example done a thousand fiue hundred yeare agone like vnto yours. Al things, sayth <hi>Beza</hi> that haue happened, are not put down in histories: but howsoeuer the matter be, it doth not folow that this our example is not manifest inough, and set forth of God in his due time: who went not about to giue a new Gospell, but ment to renewe that olde Gospell, which was<note place="margin">The Gospell.</note> exquisitly written by the Apostles, and sufficiently confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Miracles. And so by a certain vnwonted and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meane or way, he caused that bright light to shine. But concerning Traditions, what foolishe madnesse is it to make them either equall with the Scripture, or else more certaine than the same, bicause of the diuersitie of interpretations? For what shall be the staye and foundation of oure faith if
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:27102:130"/>
we stande in vncertaine opinions? But what so euer men do, this notwithstanding is most certainely to be imbraced,<note place="margin">Truth will be truth still.</note> That truth shall be most firme and constant, although for a time it seme neuer so obscure: and although heretikes do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse it, yet neuerthelesse ought we alwayes to leane to the same. Also, touching the place of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which <hi>Xainctius</hi> willeth me so diligentlye to consider, I haue so certainely considered the same, as I am sure he hath falsely cited <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> in whom that shal neuer be founde, which he hath falsely fayned.</p>
                     <p>We will not denie but that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was deceyued in certayne places: and yet notwithstanding the place cited,<note place="margin">The place ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Tertullian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed.</note> beyng rightly vnderstoode, and the ende thereof considered, it shall be verie easie to be expounded. For it was his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to declare, that we muste not dispute in vayne against heretikes: but as the Apostle Paule sayth, they beyng once or twice reprehended must be reiected. But shewe vnto vs, with what Heretikes he had to doe: surely euen with those<note place="margin">Titus. 3.</note> whiche being conuicted by the worde of God, obstinately thrust in certaine testimonyes of scripture, transformed to maintaine their errors.</p>
                     <p>Against these men <hi>Tertullian</hi> bringeth in the traditions of the Churche, the whiche he sheweth ought to be of greater waight than the new deuises of many men. First of al ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is méete that we should be conuinced by the word of God, that we may be brought from error. For if we should simply leane vnto traditions, which are neither Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, nor agréeing to their doctrine, we should set open a way to a thousand deceites, and at length peruert and ouerthrow the certaintie of the Scripture. And why dothe <hi>Tertullian</hi> cast the heretikes in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>éeth, saying that <hi>They,</hi> contrary to <hi>Scripture, doe beleeue without Scripture,</hi> but onely to teache them that they must leane and cleaue to the certaine truth of the Scriptures, and by them conuince errors? But if the traditions and ceremonies, which are at this daye obiected
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:27102:130"/>
vnto vs of our aduersaries, were Apostolicall and alwayes vsed of the Churche, we might otherwise thinke and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: but seyng we can shew their beginnings, it followeth that they are not come from the Apostles. And truely <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> dothe greatly reprehende them which thought that all things, whiche appertained to saluation, were not put downe to vs by the Apostles. Therfore, when truth comes in question we must haue recourse to the Apostles, whom Christe hath sent to teache the Churche. But how shall we agrée of the Apostles doctrine, but by their writings? For therefore were they called of God to that office, that they might plainely teache and instructe vs in all things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to our saluation.</p>
                     <p>After the same maner also the place of <hi>Chrisostome</hi> may be explaned in the which we haue these words, <hi>Christ lefte nothing to the Apostle in writing: did he therefore forbyd</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The place of Chrisostome expounded.</note> 
                        <hi>them to leaue anye thing in writing?</hi> No truely. <hi>But he dyd rather illuminate them by his holy spirit, to the ende his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine being put in writing, mighte abide for euer.</hi> Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, the Apostles taughte certayne things, which they haue not written. We denie it not. But we say that those things whiche they haue not written, doe not appertaine to oure saluation. For those things whiche mighte appertayne to certaine rytes profitable for that time, and to the order and gouernement of the Churche, they haue shewed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by woorde of mouthe. But bycause those things are of suche condition that they maye be diuersely altered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the circumstaunces of the place, tyme, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, therefore they neither oughte nor can bynde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men.</p>
                     <p>And as concerning these wordes: <hi>Not begotten, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiall, Trinitie,</hi> and suche like, althoughe they be not to be founde so expressely in the Scripture: yet notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their sense, effect and meaning is plentifully to be founde therein.

Upon which silence the Sorbonistes afterwards persuaded them selues to haue gotten the victorie.</p>
                     <p>Then the Cardinall began to speake concerning the<note place="margin">Cardinall of Lorain mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the controuersie.</note> Lordes Supper, protesting in the name of al the Prelates, that they woulde procéede no further, vntill that question were fully determined and answered: both for that it was the principall pointe of all controuersies, and also bycause the Ministers hadde so playnely declared their opinion and iudgement concerning the same in that their first Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the rumoure thereof is gone thoroughout the whole Realme. Therefore he demaunded of the Ministers whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they woulde receiue and imbrace the Augustane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:<note place="margin">Augustane confession.</note> And the Ministers on the contrarie part demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if they also would receiue the same.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinal faring as though he woulde answere to this demaunde, began to bring for the the iudgement of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ministers of Germanie, concerning the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: the whiche (he sayde) was sent by them, to him out of Germanie. But herein he played the craftie Foxe, to the ende that if they had openly denyed this thing, he mighte haue set them and the Ministers of Germanie togither by
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:27102:131"/>
the eares: but if they had imbraced the same, that then hee mighte tryumphe ouer them as if they had gotten the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beza</hi> to auoid this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> and subtill traine, answered, That he and his fellowes came thyther to defende the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their owne Churches, whiche they were, onelye by them, inioyned to doe. So that he desired that the order of the disputation might be framed vpon the forme of their confession: to the end that they might gather thereby bothe the greater fruit, and also come into a more perfect concord. For the order of nature doth require that firste of all those things which are more easie shoulde be handled: and we must first of all dispute of doctrine, bycause the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes doe depende of Doctrine. Notwithstanding the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall did with no lesse vehemencie still vrge the matter. Therefore the chosen men of the Churches, fearing least by this meanes occasion mighte be taken to breake off the conference, and that the blame thereof shoulde be layde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they desired to haue leaue to vewe and consider that writing, whereto the Prelates wente aboute to make them to subscribe, and so they woulde deliberate together what they were best to doe.</p>
                     <p>Then was broughte for the a fourme of the article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords Supper, written (as the Cardinall said) oute of the <hi>Augustane confession,</hi> thus. <hi>VVe doe Confesse that the very body and bloud of Christ Iesus, is truely really, and Sacramentally in the Supper of the Lorde, and is so giuen and receiued of those that doe communicate.</hi> There were also broughte forthe manye opinions of the <hi>Saxone</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters concerning this matter, written in the yeare of oure Lorde. 1559. And thus was the assembly dismist vntill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time newes was broughte, that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">The subtill sleighes of one Balduine.</note> exhibited by the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> was by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie of one <hi>Frances Balduine,</hi> sente with letters, whiche

signifyed that he woulde come verie shortly and bring cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ministers with him out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which shoulde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute and contend with <hi>Beza,</hi> and with the rest of the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengers of the reformed Churches. <hi>Balduine</hi> therfore came to <hi>Poossiac</hi> in the time of the conference, leauing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng behynde him those ministers of <hi>Germanie,</hi> making the more haste, to the intent he mighte offer vp a certayne Latine booke, intituled, <hi>The office of a godly man, among the controuersies of Religion:</hi> perswading himselfe by this meanes, that he shoulde please all men, specially the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes.</p>
                     <p>And this Booke he highlye commended and bragged of, as a certaine singular meane and waye to worke peace and vnitie: the author of the which booke, the miserable ambitious man partlye affyrming, and partlye denying hymselfe to be, by vayne dissimulation, the name of <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> beyng suppressed and quite taken awaye, whiche had patched the same together, would that all men should haue counted hym to bée the authour thereof: perswading hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hereby to wyn greate fame. But his expectation for all this was deceyued, for he was called of neyther part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conference, for that all men feared his inconstancie and lighte rashenesse, whiche he had all his lyfe time she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by manyfest proofe and shewe of his subtill and false minde.</p>
                     <p>But his hatred for this matter was wholly kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ministers of the reformed Churches, whom he thought to be the cause that he was not called to the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

whereby among good men he had gotten a good reporte: notwithstanding chaunging oftentymes his Religion, one while he séemed to imbrace the doctrine of the Gospell, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to those places in the whiche the same was publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached: another whyle he wente to the Papistes, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to lyke of their seruice, whereby at the last all men iustly Iudged hym to bée of a wycked and vnconstant mind.

We knowe not to what end these things haue bene propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. For first of all, we came not hyther, eyther to preach the word, or to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Sacraments. So that it séemeth superfluous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of vs by what authoritie we would doe this thing. If answere be made vnto vs, that this was therfore demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that we might giue account of those thinges whiche we haue done afore time, it was to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered that this assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doth consist of two sorts of men. For some are Ministers of other Cuntreys, in such places, in whiche their calling is approued. Of these men ye haue nothing to do to take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their offices. Other some there are here whiche preach the word of God in this Realme: but ye haue not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led these men before you, to constraine them to make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their calling, but to conferre with them concerning doctrine: otherwise they mighte séeme after this manner to be brought to iudgement: the which we thinke (O Quéene) not to be your will or meaning. But if ye did it for disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sake, by your leaue, I must say, that it was not meete to moue any such talke openly: to answere the which we had no good occasion offered vs, excepte we woulde offende the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:27102:133"/>
mindes of the Prelates: the which to doe we would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie loth, least we might seme to be the cause that the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence should be broken off.</p>
                     <p>And least we may séeme to speake without reason, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that so often, as two partes come together to conferre or to dispute: If the one parte demaunde, why do you this? and the other parte also demaunde the same thing, saying, why do you this? it cannot be but in these questions reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated there shall discention arise.</p>
                     <p>But omitting the Prelates of this Realme, whome we will not offende, let vs imagine with our selues, that there were here a certaine Bishop which should demaund of vs, saying, by what authoritie doe ye preache, and minister the Sacramentes? And we in like maner should demaund, by what authoritie he did the like: that is to saye, whether he were elected by the Seniors of his Churche, in the which he is Bishop: whether the people desired to haue him: and whether his life, maners, and doctrine were firste exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>He would answere that he was in that order called: but the contrary is manifestly knowne, and we call the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of those to witnesse that heare vs, &amp; knowe how y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter standeth. If he should saye vnto vs, ye are no ministers, bicause ye haue not the impositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, we in like maner would answere, neyther are ye Bishops, bicause in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, the principall and most substantial matters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the worde of God are lacking. If the disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion procéede farther, we maye vse these wordes: ye haue but one onely thing, which is required in the right institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, laying on of handes. If the lacke of this one thing, make (as you thinke) that we are not ministers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>must néedes the lacke of the other two, (namely the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Seniors, and the triall of life and doctrine) proue you to be no Bishops.</p>
                     <p>The Councell of <hi>Chalcedone,</hi> euen one of the firste vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall

Counsels, appoynted that the ordering and appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Prieste shoulde be voyde whiche was not doone by the Ministerie of some one Churche. A greate deale more might we say to the Byshoppe disputing with vs, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that two principall and substantiall thinges are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">1.

                     <p>There is also an other thing whiche we speake agaynst our will, and yet notwithstanding we must speake it, that all the whole assembly maye euidently sée, that this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning Uocation, is full of perill and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. If ye shoulde demaunde of that Byshoppe of whome, he hadde receyued imposition of handes, and for howe muche he hath bought the same, what woulde he saye? Surely he woulde make aunswere that he hadde receyued imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of handes of Byshoppes, and that he hadde not bought the same, but that he gaue for it so many thousande Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: whiche is as muche as if he shoulde saye, I haue not bought the breade, but I haue bought the wheate. If this disputation verily shoulde be iudged by the Counsels and Canons of the Church, it woulde make many Byshoppes and Cura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>As touching the Article of the Lords Supper, we would of late speake no further of the same, bycause we hadde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to many men of this assembly, whiche neuer hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of any suche matter before, mighte easily haue béene there at of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To satisfie this our desire, and the expectation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of a great manye men, the article of the Lordes Supper was put forth, decided out of many and verie necessarie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the fayth, and it was sayd vnto vs, <hi>Either subscribe vnto this, or else we wil proceede no farther.</hi> If ye were oure Iudges, and had authoritie to sit vpon our liues, ye woulde not say, <hi>Subscribe vnto this</hi> but, <hi>VVe condemne you.</hi> Your office leadeth you to another maner of speache, and willeth you to shewe vnto vs our errors if there be anye in vs, and to instructe them in the doctrine of truth, which are readie to giue an account of their faith by the word of God.</p>
                     <p>We are here before you (O Quéene) &amp; that for two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall causes. The firste is, that we maye giue an account of our faith to God, to you, &amp; to the whole world.

                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:27102:135"/>Therefore (O Quéene) we most earnestly beseche you, that so good and godly a worke be not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off, and that ye will vouchsafe to graunt such men vnto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Notwithstanding least we might séeme to want an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: wée affirme that we doe receiue all those things, which <hi>Espensius</hi> hath alleaged and brought out of the booke of <hi>Caluine.</hi> But the article exhibited by the Cardinall is onely a portion of the <hi>Augustane confession.</hi> In the which matter many things are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered: First y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession should be propounded vnto vs: for it is not méete to set before vs one verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to omit the rest. Then we must sée, whether the Cardinall doth this thing of him selfe, or in the name of all the Prelates. For herevpon we should giue thankes vnto God, that they them selues do confesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be ouercome in the Article of Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which truely is condemned by the consent of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches of Germanie and of others.</p>

of so great a mistery in so fewe woords) if it seme good vnto the Cardinall that we search and confer together the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the writinges of the aunciente Fathers, (as hee hath also promised) and if it may please you (O Quéene) to make a conuenient forme of collation, and to cal Notaries whiche may receiue our disputations, we trust you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that we came hither not to bring disorder and trouble, but peace and quietnes. For this one thing we wishe, that both to this doctrine, and also to the Sacramente the verye natural and proper integritie and perfection it selfe may be restored. In the which matter we dedicate and wholly giue our selues to God, to your Maiesties, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Christian commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, and specially to the peace and tranquillitie of this Realme.</p>
                     <p>Thus far procéeded the oration of <hi>Beza.</hi> But the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates toke it very haynously, that <hi>Beza</hi> had thus spoken of their vocation. Therefore the Cardinall swelling with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<note place="margin">The braule of the Cardinall with Beza.</note> saide, that the Quéenes Maiestie was dishonored with these wordes, into whose hands the righte and libertie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was giuen, and by whome they themselues were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.

                        <hi>Beza</hi> answered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was altogether giltlesse of this fault, saying, that Kings had taken vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues that libertie &amp; authoritie, bicause Churchemen had so filthily abused the same. As touching Election, no man is ignorant that they make as it were a play or enterlude of it: I speake not this of purpose (saith he) but am constrained therevnto, to the defence of our Ministerie, and to the intent also I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what maner of calling it is: the which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding without cause is contemned.</p>
                     <p>To this the Cardinall answered, That <hi>Beza</hi> first began to offer iniurie and not he, without the hauing of anye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the reuerence due to the kings: willing him and

                     <p>The Ministers denyed this consequence, affirming that the Legall Ceremonies which were appointed by God, had respect to the truth, whereof also, the ancient Fathers were partakers before the comming of Christ, and we after his comming, in which time, we are not vnder ceremonies, but yet notwithstanding we néede visible signes and sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, so long as we shall be in this world: and yet for al that it doth not followe that we haue the lesse vnderstanding of the truth, although we haue externall Sacramentes.</p>

And layde vnto the charge of their chosen men that disputed for them, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the same opinion, in the whiche, they concluded with the Ministers of the reformed Churches, that they had made a compacte and agréemente with the Ministers, and therefore they were not suffered to conferre or dispute any more after that.

                     <p>The matter standing thus, the Quéene fearing what would come to passe, perceiued that it was needefull to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide a spedie remedie.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Artly Experience of the former friendly acceptation of my good will (right woorshipfull) and partly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption vpon the same agayne, twoo bold guides, haue moued me to attempt the Dedication of these two other partes of Commentaries (to the which also is ioyned an Addition of the horrible, and cruell slaughter of the Admirall Chastillon and other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) vnto you: hoping that as you haue already worshipfully receyued the first part, and taken the same to your protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so likewyse you will not refuse these other partes, set foorth with such diligence as conueniently might be vsed. The gyft (which is my small labour in the Translation) is scarce woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the presenting to your worship, but the Argument which concerneth the affaires of so noble a kingdome as Fraunce is, I boldly presume in the learned Authours name too presente vnto you: especially seeing the reading and knowledge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of shall not onely redound to the profyt of our Countrey, but also greatly illustrate and set forth the glory of God. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shall compare our happy estate, with the miserable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the afflicted people in Fraunce: when (I say) wee shall call to mind the happy dayes of peace and concorde, and the prosperouse successe in our ciuill gouernement, which by the vnspeakable mercy and goodnesse of God, wee haue enioyed since the raigne of our gratiouse Soueraigne: and contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse, the bloudy warres, the sore dissentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and stryfe, with the horrible desolation that hath ensued in the realme of France, we cannot choose, but we must needes be forced too magnifie and extol the great mercies of our God, which hath deliuered vs from the lyke destruction, no lesse deserued by our sinnes.

Shall we say that the Frenchmen our neighbours are greater sinners than any other Nation vnder heauen, because of the great desolation fallen vppon them? No verily, <hi>but except wee</hi>

                     <hi>repent, wee shall in lyke manner perishe.</hi> Therefore (right woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) by the benefite of this discourse of the ciuill warres, we shall not onely be drawne to the knowledge of our selues, but also bee prouoked to gyue God moste harty thankes, for our quiet &amp; peaceableestate, which by our Soueraign Prince we enioye. These are the frutes which shall ensue to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader, by these Commentaries: the which if they maye reape, as no doubt they shall: I may account my labour well bestowed.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing boldly craued your worships courtesie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing this base and simple present of myne, I cease wyth thankes for your liberalitie shewed towardes me: committing you &amp; my good Lady your wyfe, into the handes of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, who send you prosperouse successe in al your affaires, desired health, and the blessed felicitie of Gods Electe in the kingdome of Heauen.</p>

                  <p>Therefore, I will let them passe, if you be at leysure, and may vouchsafe to reade these fewe thinges. For nowe I haue here for thee (Gentle Reader) breefe Commentaries of the whole Ciuill warres of Fraunce, wherein I haue followed the order &amp; course of the matters rehearsed by vs in the former three bookes of Com mentaries. And if I shall begin to excuse my selfe, first for that I being a man euen without name, haue enterprised to begin the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of so waighty matters, which had ben a fit Argument for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned writers: I see that strayght way, that may be obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, which was obiected to <hi>Albinus</hi> the Romane, excusinge himself and asking pardon for writing a history in the Greke tong, wherein he was not very skilfull, (to wit) that he had rather aske pardon for his faulte, than to be without fault. But beit that I am in a faulte, whether it be rash nesse or temeritie (for I know that this my enterprise shall incurre the iudgements of diuers men) yet I truste, I shall not be accused of rashnesse before they haue red me, except it be of such, as by giuing their verdict of an vncertayne and vnknown matter, may be accused of temerity themselues. And as for the iudgement of those learned &amp; moderate men, which shall reade these our Commentaries, I do not greatly feare it, neyther will I thinke my labour wast, but rather count it for an excellent gayne vnlooked for, if I shall prouoke them to set them forth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the vtilitie of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But least I should stay lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I promised, in the defence of this exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall writing, not lyke to liue aboue a day, lacking his <hi>Genius,</hi> I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Here then thou mayst behold how many wayes God doth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and preserue his church, among the manifolde chaunges of

worldly businesse: and how maruelously he prouideth entertainment for them in the seates of Monarches. The Gospell being spred abroad and planted in Germany, Switserland, England, &amp; in other places, France remained vtterly without so great a benefite, established by publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Magistrates. But it is a most delightsome thing to call to mynd by what meanes God did bring the gospel into France, &amp; by what maner of men, and how mightely God did work by weake vessels. For first the foundacion being layd by the helpe of poore men, which suffered sclaunder, proscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, stripes, torments, burning, &amp; euery kind of slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the length also when it pleased him, he ioyned vnto this Churche, men of greater account &amp; fame, euen noble men, Peeres, &amp; Princes: and those great difficulties, which could not but hinder the course of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, he toke away, &amp; layed open a broad entrance, to the propagation and enlarging of the same, that he might make it known, how far his power reacheth and extendeth it self to the preseruation of his Church, and that the same is contayned within no limites.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that whereas before the maliciouse enemies of the church, had the chief rule, and the authoritie of the Magistrates was armed against the same: now contraywyse, those maliciouse enemies were so restrayned &amp; holden vnder, that thei seemed to be brought on their kneese, the fame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of those matters were brought vnto them which fauoured the gospell, &amp; seemed to haue a speciall care to spread &amp; plant the same. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fell out far otherwyse: for he which seemed to haue most abilitie to promote &amp; further the cause of the gospeil, reiected the gospel &amp; became an vtter enemie to the same: so that he seemed most of al men to haue ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a wyde window to the ruyne therof. But how trimly did the Lorde disapoint Sathan &amp; Antichrist of their purpose: yet did he alwayes so mo derate the matter, that neither the church when it was expedient, might seeme to want mans help, neither might seeme wholy to be stayed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon. Greeuouse warres arose: God gaue vnto his seruants strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of mans helpe, yet least they should depend thervpon, he weakned the same also, &amp; that so greatly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great daungers in diuers places ensued to the church, notwithstanding the end fell out for their safety.</p>
                  <p>In the middest therefore of these confusions &amp; tumultes, God himselfe the Prince of Princes, shewed his singular prouidence &amp; care which hee hath effectually towardes mankind: but especially &amp; peculiarly, towards his church, to preserue and stablish the same mightely in the iniddest of al worldly troubles: neither by one meanes only, bnt by sundry meanes, as it hath seemed good to him in the diuers formes of rule &amp; gouernment, to assigne vnto his church an abyding place: as of old time in the gouerning of the primitiue Church immediatly after the Apostels, and in our tyme in Germany, Switserland, England, Scotland, and in other places, it hath appeared: and more of late in these our countrey of Fraunce, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently seene: not that in this varietie we should ascribe any thing to the rule of fortune, but that the manifold and maruailouse efficacy of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, might be considered, which doth singularly wateh ouer the safety of the Church. And if it may please thee to consider the second &amp; middell causes and reasons of the Instruments, which God vsed in the beginning of this worke; you shall see how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary they be, and how va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable: On the one side the wicked and vnbridled iustes of men proue to

worke mischief, doo appeare: a colour of religion is pretended to worke the ouerthrowe of Religion: the kinges name is vsurped when they go about to suppresse the King himself: and in the meane time, the gospeil is accused as a common enemy, and the subuersion of the same is conspy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. On y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other side, God styrreth vp many men to preserue &amp; defend his church in those troubles, because the destruction of the same was chiefly desired. Ther appeareth in those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the history plainly sheweth, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the safety of the church, of the Kings dignitie &amp; authoritie, &amp; of the publique peace: and yet in the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ution of that their laudable desire, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that they were not vtterly faultlesse. yet is the Church preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the middest of all these misorders: that as it is manifest, that men cannot be sayd to be the very authors &amp; keepers therof, so must we nedes confesse that God is the very author, preseruer, and keeper of the same. Therfore, the church doth not triumphe as hauing gotten the victory by mans ayde, neither doth it lye vtterly prostrat by the violence of worldly tumultes: which being fashoned like vnto her head, raigning in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> time when they shall fully triumph. The church hath heretofore ben ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in many battails, &amp; how many are behind, God knoweth, bycause the time which is appointed for the last victory is vnknown: yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly reward is most true, which y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> most valiant Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion hath pronounced with his own mouth saying, <hi>That through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of heauen.</hi> If the promise of God as touching y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> victory of his church were included within the limites of this world, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely it should triumphe in this world, by the vertue &amp; power of the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent &amp; euerlasting God: but that her triumph is appointed elswher, the often &amp; greuouse spoyles and calamities of the same declare.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time let vs consider these things, &amp; contemplate wher &amp; in what partes of the world the tokens of that Catholike &amp; true church do appeare, &amp; let vs aduaunce the prouidence, wisdom, bountifulnes, and power of God in preseruing &amp; gouerning the same, least if the blind igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of men be reprehended, &amp; that worthely, because they see not God, who hath not left himself (as saith the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But Sathan en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying that peace and tranquillitie, caused after a while not only priuate perturbations, and troubles betwéene man and man, but also, open and Ciuill warres, by the deuises and practises of the aduersaries, to the great hurt of the Realme. The which things, as briefely, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so truely will we declare in this historie: In pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof, we know into what sundry hap and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of iudgements we are in, what a large scope wée
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27102:158"/>
haue, to set forth diuers matters, and also, what hatred and perill we bring vnto our selues. But the truth shal defend it selfe, and shall also take away all sclaunder &amp; reproche.</p>
                  <p>Many gréeued and repined at the increase and good successe of the reformed Churches, greatly misliking of the <hi>Edict of January,</hi> for that it tended much for their<note place="margin">The very cause of the Ciuill warres was the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Edict of Ianuary</note> peace and quietnes which fauored the <hi>Religion.</hi> Of these repyning enemies there were two sortes: The first sort were such as had their liuing by the Benefices, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes, and spirituall promotions of Priestes: and of these many were gentlemen, and men of high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who perceiuing that the greatest part of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance came vnto them by the sayd Benefices, thought that they should sustaine great hinderance and losse, if so be they of the reformed Religion should obtaine and enioye the benefite of the Edict. The second sort, were such noble men as being inriched, not onely with those great and huge sommes of money which came to them by the yerely reuenewes of those Benefices, (the fatte wherof, they reserued to them, and theirs,) but also with the innumerable giftes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and <hi>Fraunces</hi> the second: feared, least they being called to giue vp their accompts, (according to the custome of the Realme) should be found giltie of extorcion. Among these latter sort, the chiefe were the <hi>Guises,</hi> the fatall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the kingdome of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> who also as yet were to make their accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for great sommes of money taken out of the Kings Treasury, for common affaires, and other waightie matters in the time of King <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> the second: and also of their euill demeynor, wherof they were playnely accused, vnder the raigne of Kyng <hi>Henry</hi> the second. Also the great losse of that high auctho ritie, which almost they alone had during the minority of King <hi>Fraunces</hi> the second: and with the same losse,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27102:158"/>
the feare foreséeing the great euilles to come, pinched them euen to the hart, and gréeued them to the very gall. To these also was ioyned the Martiall of <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> a man full of all subtiltie, guile, and mischief, who being out of measure riche with the great giftes which he receyued of Kyng <hi>Henry,</hi> for his euill and cruell ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, was pricked in conscience for spoyling, by sinister meanes, diuers noble men of his familiar acquaynta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. By the practise and endeuour of this <hi>Martiall,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Momorentius</hi> (as we sayd in our other Booke) a<note place="margin">Momoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius the Constable made a friend to the Guises.</note> little before a mortall enemie to the <hi>Guises,</hi> hauing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times experience of their hatred, was brought to the familiaritie and friendship of the <hi>Guises.</hi> And to the intent they might winne the Constable wholely vnto them, by a new benefite, they graunted franckly vnto him, the dominion of <hi>Dammartine,</hi> for the which, afore time there had bene great contencion betwéene them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the daily adhortations of the Martiall of <hi>S. Andrew,</hi> and the Duches of <hi>Valence,</hi> (beside the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall and daily perswasions of his wife, and of the Earle of <hi>Uillars</hi>) greatly vrged and pressed the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: as, that the ancient and catholique doctrine was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolyshed: that the common wealth was disturbed: that they of the reformed <hi>Religion</hi> did plainly threaten to bring such as had bene officers of the kings afore time, to giue vp their accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: that those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sought only by lit tle and little to place them selues in authoritye, and to abase those that serued and had borne office vnder the kings in time past, and to haue the spoil of their goods: that the <hi>Queene Mother,</hi> was led away with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions: and that shée being an effeminate &amp; weake woman, would incline to that parte which was moste strong: also that it was manifest that shée did fauoure those of the reformed <hi>Religion</hi> for the king of <hi>Nauar</hi> hys sake, who séeketh all that he can to haue the <hi>Religion</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27102:159"/>
being thervnto prouoked by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to spight those which are suspected to be the authors, that he was cast into prison: And therfore that they, if they might bring al things to passe after their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, as to haue their enemies subdued, and the state of the kingdome and of <hi>Religion</hi> altered, would bring the Constable him selfe to their owne bent and wil, &amp; wold in like manner call him to account. These perswasions being oftentimes inculcated and beaten into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables eares, being rather an enemy to <hi>Religion,</hi> drewe him quite away at the last to the contrary part: and so by little and little for saking the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> he openly shewed his displeasure and choller against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Chastilions.</hi> Therfore now began to be manifest familiarity and frendship betwéene the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable and the <hi>Guises,</hi> in so much that they ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ketted one another, and had oftentimes secreate conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them selues.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> last they conspired together, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> as a Prince of aliance to the<note place="margin">The conspi racie of the Guises, the Constable and the Martiall of S.

Andrew, as head Martiall, should bend their whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors in this, that no parte of the ancient and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion might be altered. And because, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the constitutions and Edictes of the former kings, a new Religion was brought in, they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor them selues with all their force and might, that those hereticall doctrines might be quite abolished and destroyed: And also that they would not suffer newe Decrées to be made concerning the state of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme, and the willes of the former Kings to be disproued: that they would openly declare them selues to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to all those, which would go about this thing: And finally, that in this cause they wold do what they could,

euen to the spending of their goods and liues: To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the which, they swore solemnely one to another.</p>
                  <p>The matter being thus agréed vppon betwéene them, they did deliberate and aduise them selues, what they were best to doe, namely that they would gather together al the power they were able to make, and that they would séeke for all the helpe and aide at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers and fréends handes that might be had: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assured of aide, out of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Jtalie:</hi> and that the <hi>Guises</hi> should proue what helpe they could get out of the partes of <hi>Germanie.</hi> But first of all they thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to intise and win the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> &amp; to bryng him if they could to defend their part, to get <hi>Paris:</hi> and finally, to haue the King and Quéene at their becke. These things once obtained, they perswaded them selues easely to obtaine their purpose. Concerning the winning of the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> they had good hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voluptuous, geuen to ease, and vnconstant: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his housholde seruaunts hired by the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> to vse their diligent endeuor to bring y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same to passe. Who, being once woon to take their part, they perceiued a plaine way to haue their purpose. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the entent they might win him, they vse very subtill and crafty meanes. First, they assay what they can do by his houshold seruaunts, the byshop of <hi>Aussere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Monsire Escars,</hi> and <hi>Frances Balduinae,</hi> being sent in to confer and talke with hym.</p>
                  <p>These declared to the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> that they of the Religion, sought now, to bring in new and more seuere Lawes than were woont to be, to reforme Princes: as though it were not lawfull for Princes to liue as they list, and to do what séemeth good in their owne eyes. If credit be gyuen vnto these men, than must men frame a new lyfe: and if these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be made Iudges to reforme what they thinke good to be reformed, (the which no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27102:160"/>
doubt they goe about) there will ensewe no smal daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But he being one that had chéefe authoritie in the Realme of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> ought rather wisely to follow that which was agreable to the present state: and to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into what troubles he should bring the Realme, if he would abolish the auncient Religion, which so many Kings before time had receyued. There are (say they) opinions of diuers Religions, which as they come with tyme, so with tyme they fade away agayne. If therfore he shuld be of the reformed Religion, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> would be his open enemie: And beside this, the Pope would set whole <hi>Jtalie</hi> &amp; al Christian Realmes, against the kingdome of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> whiche might easely be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished and ouerthrowne, in the middest of so many dis sentions. But looke how much hurt and dammage hee should bring to himselfe and to the whole Kingdome, if he should defende that new <hi>Religion,</hi> and the professors thereof: so much profite, glory, and fame, should come to him and to all his stocke, if he did not to much intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle himselfe in these controuersies of <hi>Religion,</hi> but dyd rather frame himselfe wysely according to occasion and tyme: that is to saye, when occasion is offered, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and defende the auncient and <hi>Catholike Religion,</hi> whereby he might looke to finde great profite. Thus if hée would shewe himselfe, he should winne the Popes fauour, and bind his holinesse to requite him with some great benefite, by whose meanes he might recouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne the kingdome of <hi>Nauar,</hi> which belonged to his Ancetours, without warres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> greatly estéemed the Popes Authoritie. Consider ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (say they) with your selfe what you were best to do, least sodenly by the force of sinister persuasions, you bring your selfe to great extremitie. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider with your selfe, that as the tymes are perillous, so is the euent &amp; successe of all things vncertayne: wysely wey therefore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27102:160"/>
with your selfe what is most profitable for you. Admit the cause of Religion should be dissided by disputacion: should men so leane to the opinions of a fewe, that they should not imbrace other mens Iudgments? For amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g those men which imbrace the doctrine of that new Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, what contrarietie is there, and difference of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But you which were borne, not to Iudge of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasticall Disputacions, but to the exployting of greater matters and of more waight, may occupy: and trouble your brayne with these matters, at your leisure. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we wishe you, according to your wisdome, to weye and consider what is most néedfull to be done.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> being to much giuen to volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnesse and ease, harkened all to soone to these persua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sions: and being ouercome, forgetting his authoritie, he wholy gaue himselfe to his Aduersaries: by whome he being spoyled of that his authoritie, and of his wittes also, was the occasion of many and great mischéeues. The waye therefore being thus made wholely to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and subuert the King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> there came then vnto him the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrar,</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Towers,</hi> with many faier promises from the Pope, that hée, if he would thus imbrace the Catholike Doctrine, should prosper and benefite him selfe very much. For (sayed they) the Pope will bring to passe that the Kings of <hi>Spayne</hi> should very shortly gyue vnto him agayne the kingdome of <hi>Nauar.</hi> And also, that he would geue vnto him a bill of diuorcement, that he being diuorced from his wife, which was to much inclined to that new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">Queene of Scotts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be giuen in mariage to the king of Nauar.</note> might marry with the Quéene of Scottes, a woman of excellent beautie, riche, and the widow of a renowmed King. And thus he should haue two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, namely the Kingdome of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and by this new mariage also, the Kingdome of Scotland. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, was offered vnto him oportunitie, to exployte and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27102:161"/>
bring to passe great matters, when as hée hauing the kyngdome of Scotland, might clayme also vnto him the kingdome of Englande, which bordered vpon the same, which the Scottish Kyngs afore time challenged vnto themselues as their right. And so, he being of so great power both by his owne kyngdomes, and also by the helpe and ayd which he might haue out of <hi>France,</hi> out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and from the Pope, should easely conquer and enioye England, and so become a great Monarch.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore they exhorted him to consider how many occasions Fortune luckely offered vnto him to bring to passe whatsoeuer he would. The which if he should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slowe and neglect, and on the contrary part like of and mayntaine the new Doctrine, they wished him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, according to his wisedome, what gréeuous perils and troubles he should fall into, the which yet might easely be repressed and anoyded, if so be he would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to good and wholesome counsell. Adding moreouer, that the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> would do as he did, and that the <hi>Chatillions</hi> would not be behind: and as for the rest of the nobles and common people, it should not force, if so be that he would vse the aucthoritie of the Kings E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictes and his owne power, and ioyne himselfe with the faythfull and trustie seruants of the King.</p>
                  <p>After these persuasions, the kyng of <hi>Nauar,</hi> dayly more and more shewed himself, not only to dislike of the reformed Religion, and of the professors therof, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was angry and sore offended with them. Insomuch that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the Ministers of Gods word which were with him in house to depart from him: and went him selfe oftentimes to the Popish Churches, heard Masse: and earnestly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his wife, which was a very honest &amp; vertuous Lady, (who also refused) to do the like: gaue him selfe to filthy pleasures of we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: and was also very familiarly conuersant with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27102:161"/>
the Guises, the Constable, the Martiall of S. Andrew, and with the Cardinals. Notwithstanding all this, the reformed Religion so preuailed, that new reportes and rumors were daily brought into the Court concerning the same. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Admiral, and many of the Nobles, diligently séeking to haue the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: The Quéene mother also was ruled by good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell: And as for the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> he was vncertain what to doe in the middest of these troubles, and was like vnto an vnskilfull marriner destitute of counsell, hauing diuers cogitations in hys minde, vncertaine whether to go, and yet neuertheles, standing stil as one amased. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time the Edict of Ianuary (wherof mencion is made before) toke place, and was put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. But then were the minds of the <hi>Guises,</hi> of the <hi>Constable,</hi> and of the <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>S. Andrewe</hi> so vexed &amp; gréeued, that they thought good not to delay the time any longer: they being encouraged to procéede wyth their purpose, for that they might rule the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uar</hi> as them list. Therfore euery man being appoynted what to do: the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> departed from the court: The <hi>Constable,</hi> went home to his house: and sent for his retainers and fréendes to see if they woulde s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>icke vnto hym: and such as he doubted of, he sought to win. The <hi>Marshal</hi> of <hi>S. Andrew</hi> did euen the like.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Guises</hi> (as is sayde before) had taken vpon them to winne the Princes of Germanie to take their parte: and therfore they wrote letters oftentimes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them. And to further their busynes they vsed the helpe of the <hi>Rokendolfe,</hi> and the <hi>Rheingraue:</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall trimly countenancesing, and dissembling that he imbraced y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Ausburgue</hi> Confession. And that he minded, not long agoe, to establishe the same in <hi>Fraunce:</hi> but he sayde, that the men of the newe Religion did greatly gainsay &amp; let the same: whome he blamed in all things,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27102:162"/>
as vngodly men, and the vpholders of all monsterous opinions. Moreouer he sayd that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> by the meanes and counsel of the <hi>Admiral,</hi> went about to aspire to the kingdome: and that vnder the pretence of Religion, he liued a licentious and voluptuous life. After these practises, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> him selfe, came to <hi>Sauerne,</hi> a towne bordering vppon <hi>Germanie:</hi> and there he talked wyth the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberge:</hi> fained that he embraced the Confession of <hi>Ausburge:</hi> sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered and falsly accused the prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the reformed churches, and craued his aide against them: and vnder the pretence of that communication, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> vaunted and bragged muche of the fréendship of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberge,</hi> saying, that he was sure that he would wythout all doubt take his parte, and also allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that he had taken these enterprises in hand, by the Dukes aduise and counsell: For the which the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberge</hi> afterward blamed hym, and proued that he perswaded him selfe to haue more frendship at hys hands, than euer he meant vnto him, and did falsly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, wherfore he earnestly exhorted the <hi>Guises</hi> to cease from persecuting the reformed churches.</p>
                  <p>After this, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> hauing gotten to take his parte, certaine valea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the Duke of <hi>Aumal,</hi> the Martiall of <hi>Saint Andrew,</hi> which came to him to <hi>Nantueile,</hi> and with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble men more, and with a great Armie of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<note place="margin">The Guise commeth to Paris a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Queenes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> also.

Now when they were come, there were many doubtfull and vncertaine reportes in the Citie: and the conspiracy betweene the <hi>Guise,</hi> the Constable, and the Martiall of <hi>S. Andrew,</hi> eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared to all men: Who ioyning with them certayne of the Senators of <hi>Paris</hi> sate in counsell euery daye.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> also came to <hi>Paris,</hi> accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with certaine noble men, and exhorted the faithfull not to forsake him in so great perill and daunger. The <hi>Guises</hi> were very sory for this comming of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> which they iudged would be very hurtfull for them. For although the common sort of people of the Citie of <hi>Paris</hi> were foolish, hawtie, &amp; stout, at the first, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the <hi>Guises,</hi> yet notwithstanding their courage and pride, was brideled and abated euen with the name of the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> insomuch that they stayed from open outrage. Therfore the Citie, by the comming of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> was quieted, and as it were, newly altered.</p>
                  <p>But this thing did very much hinder the purpose of the <hi>Guises,</hi> which greatly desired to obtayne <hi>Paris,</hi> being the chiefe Citie of the kyngdome, and a very fit place to bring their matters to passe. Therfore, first of all they saw that they must bring to passe that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> might depart from the citie. Wheruppon they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27102:165"/>
practised by the King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> that, Marshall <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie</hi> the Lefetenant of the citie, might be called backe<note place="margin">The practi ses of the Guises to expell the Prince of Conde out of Paris.</note> againe: and that the Cardinall of <hi>Borbon,</hi> which woulde be at their commaundement, might be sent in his stede: the necessitie of the tyme, (saye they) greatly requiring this thing.</p>
                  <p>The Constable brought to passe that his sonne <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morencie,</hi> should not greatly refuse this thing: who, if hée had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly withstoode them and denied their request, they had very hardly brought their purpose to effect, hée being a man of excellent wisdome, and experience, but yet withall a tyme seruer.</p>
                  <p>By this tyme, the King of <hi>Nauar</hi> was come to the King and the Quéene, which lay at <hi>Moncaulx:</hi> thither came also, out of hand, the chief master of the Marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, an Authour of Seditions, hyred and sent by the <hi>Guises.</hi> This fellow declared to the King and Quéene, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> wrought sedition at <hi>Paris,</hi> the whiche, would shortly tourne to great mischief, except he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence: the which if it should come to passe, hée to whom authoritie was giuen to prouide remedies for the same, should beare all the blame. So that, with hys often complaynts to the Quéene, he brought about, that according to his request, the king of <hi>Nauar</hi> should goe out of hand to <hi>Paris.</hi> Then the <hi>Guises,</hi> ioyning with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certayne of the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> that were fittest for their purpose, and séeking to haue the greater authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through the presence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> which was chiefe Uicegerent, they determined to haue a common counsell: to the which they neuer called the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> And this they called <hi>The Kings Counsel.</hi> The king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> by the decrée of this counsel, wrote out of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Notwithstanding it was to be doubted what would come to passe: For a man might beholde thoroughout the citie, the diuersitie of mennes myndes by diuers shewes: Somewhile they trembled, somewhile they triumphed: both partes in one hower chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged: Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and planted péeces of Ordinance, in suche places as he thought néedefull. Therefore when the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> came néere the citie, notwithstanding mynding not to enter therein, the whole citie roonge and sounded with the noyse of the great Gonnes.</p>
                  <p>In the meane tyme the <hi>Guises,</hi> otherwise peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture scarse able to match with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> thought it not best to tarry his comming at <hi>Fontaynbleau,</hi> least they should put their purpose in hazard. Therfore they purposed to carry awaye the King from <hi>Fontaynbleau,</hi> which was a place, not of strength, but of pleasure, to a more strong holde. Whereuppon they caused the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> whose authoritie they abused in all things to serue their turne, to persuade with the Quéene, that it was very necessary, for diuers present necessities, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from <hi>Fontaynbleau:</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to take the king. To this the Quéene answered, that there was nothing more vnlikely, than that his bro ther the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> being the Kings kinsma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shuld purpose any such thing against the king, his leige Lord and maister: and beside this (saith she) the king will not departe to any other place.</p>
                  <p>The Quéene constantly persisting in this mind, was agayne prouoked by the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> who sayde, that they must of necessitie departe from thence: otherwise the king would be destroyed: and excepte shée would graunt hereunto, he sayd he would him selfe of his own authoritie and office, being the Kinges kéeper and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r, transporte the King to another place. Then the Quéene began to beséeche the King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> to knowe his intent, and why hée should haue these suspicions of the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> The King him selfe also sayde that hée would goe to no other place, and in his childish ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence, hée declared his griefe with teares. But the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27102:167"/>
King of <hi>Nauar</hi> still affirmed, that there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, but that they must néedes departe from thence. Therefore hée and the <hi>Guises</hi> caryed away the King, and the Queene his mother, his bretheren, and his Sister, from <hi>Fountaynbeleau,</hi> to a Towne called <hi>Mellune:</hi> The King so soone as hée came thyther, was appointed to lodge in the Castell that was therein, without any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Kinglyke prouision for the same: the which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell afore tyme had bene vsed as a prison to kéepe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders in, and such as had deserued death, by their euil demeanor.</p>
                  <p>By reason of this expedition and haste of the <hi>Guises,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had no way or meane to doe any thing as hée would: In so much that now there was a playne gate set wyde, to open warres. For the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> being the Kinges néere kinsman, and séeing that his elder Brother dyd not his dutie, thought that hée ought not to suffer the safegarde of the King, and of the whole realme to come in perill.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, hée tooke counsell out of hande: hée came<note place="margin">The Prince of Conde commeth to Orleans.</note> to <hi>Orleans</hi> strayt after that hée had sent the <hi>Andelot</hi> with certayne horsemen, and kept the same, béeinge a well fenced citie, and fit for his purpose: gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement by publiqne Edictes, That no man shuld cause any tumult, vnder the pretence of Religion: and that all men, of what Religion so euer they were of, should obserue and kéepe the kinges Lawes &amp; Edictes.

                  <p>The faythfull according to the prescript of the kings

Edict, had their Sermons without the Citie. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes on the other part fréely vsed their rightes and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: frequented their churches, and the morrowe Masse Priestes walked through the citie in their priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparell: All things were done fréely on both parts: the Prince gyuing new commaundements and charge from day to daye, that no man should be so hardy as to breake the kings peace. This was done in the moneth of March.</p>
                  <p>After this, that the <hi>Guises</hi> were certified that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was come to <hi>Orleans,</hi> yea, and that<note place="margin">The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Guises con cerning VVarre.</note> great rumours were brought dayly vnto them, they were fully determined to take no small enterprise in hande. Therefore the societie in the which they were lynked before with the <hi>Constable,</hi> and the <hi>Martiall</hi> of <hi>S.

                  <p>The king of <hi>Nauar</hi> was woon on their side: <hi>Paris</hi> they enioyed: And the king was in their handes, But they feared and stoode in doubt of the Quéenes mynd, which at that tyme playnely séemed to inclyne to the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>

                  <p>Least therefore the Quéene ioyning with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> should go about some new practise, first of all they determined to carry the king and the Quéene, to the most conuenient place for their purpose, that all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of feare might be quite taken away.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27102:168"/>
that it was necessary for the King to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> to stay the hurleyburleys, and to quiet the people by his presence. They declared therefore to the Quéene that it is fully decréed that the king should be carryed from <hi>Melune</hi> to <hi>Paris:</hi> notwithstanding that the Queene earnestly requested the contrary.</p>
                  <p>First, came the <hi>Constable,</hi> with thrée hundred horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men attending vpon him, from <hi>Melune</hi> to <hi>Paris:</hi> and then began open warre agaynst the faythefull.

                  <p>The houses, at the last, the streates, and the riuer were filled with dead carcasses: There was nothing so cruell, which the furious multitude did not attempt.</p>
                  <p>To this tumultuous and sedicious citie, did the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> bring the king: first of all to the Castell which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayned to the King: then the King entered the citie without any maner of kinglike pompe, to the Castell called <hi>Lower.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All thinges falling thus out, according to the desire of the <hi>Guises,</hi> they now seriously studie and beate their braynes concerning the order of their warres: and they communicated their busines with the Kinges counsell (which they had almost renued, chusing such as they knew were for their purpose, and putting out others, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding also <hi>Michael Hospitall</hi> the kings Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to get him home to his house) requiring them to prouide for the mayntenaunce of the warres, euen as if they should haue delt with the forreyne enemy.

the magistrates of the towne, and to his Centurious, that he desired nothing more than to haue all men liue according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prescript of the Kings Edicts. He wrote also daily letters to the King, to the Quéene, and to the King of <hi>Nauar</hi> hys brother, beséeching them to take héede and sée that all things were done peaceably, and by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon consent, if it might be: admonishing also such as had the gouernment of the Common wealth to be ware, least by the ambition of the <hi>Guises,</hi> and of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, the King and the Realme were broughte into great pearill and danger, for the auoiding whereof, so many meanes of late were vsed: protesting héerewyth that he desired rather to sée the very extréeme end, than warre: and that he wished specially that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king in that hys te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der age, and hys realme also, might be according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided for.</p>

They prayed and most earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séeched him, being of the Kings bloud, that he wold not forsake the captiued King in such time of perill, that he would not suffer the Kings Edictes, to be violated and contemned of strangers, of whose violence he him selfe not long agoe, had experience: and principally that he would not permit that true Religion, (wherof he hym selfe was so zealous a professor) to be suppressed so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously by warre.

promised to performe and kepe, by the assistance of hys grace and mercy inuiolable, vpon these conditions.</p>
                              <p>First of al, we protest, that in this League, we haue no manner of consideration or regard either of our priuate persons, or of our goods: but do only set before our eyes, the honor of God, and the deliuerance of the King and Queenes Maiesties, the obseruation of the Edicts which they haue commaunded, and a perfecte good will to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Rebels, and such, as contemne the King &amp; Queenes Maiesties. And for these causes only we sweare, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that we and euery one of vs, will spend and bestowe all that euer we haue, euen to the last drop of our bloude. And this League shall abide inuiolable, vntill the Kings Maiority, that is to say, vntill the King come to his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full age, and doe take vpon him selfe the gouernment of the kingdome: that then we may obey him in all things with voluntary obedience. At which time, we trust, we shall geue so good an accounte of this our League, (the which also we wil do to the Quene, she being at her own libertie, whensoeuer she wil) that it shalbe manifest that this was no conspiracy, but our duety of true obedience, to preserue their Maiesties in these perillous times.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, to the end all men maye vnderstand and know that we haue entered into this league, with a pure conscience, and in the feare of God, vppon whom wee call, as vppon the vpholder and protector of our society: VVe declare, and promise by our othe, That wee will not suffer any man among vs to commit any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the honour of God, and against the Kings Edicts: as Idolatry, Supersticion, Blasphemy, VVhoredome, Theft, Sacriledge, and all suche otherlike, forbidden by the lawe of God, and by the last Edict of Ianuary: the which if any do commit, we will seuerely punish. And to the end all thinges may be done according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script rule of Gods word, we will haue in all our assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, faythfull ministers of Gods word, which may teach vs the wil of God, and whom as it is meete, we may heare,

that we may obey the will of God.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, we elect and nominate the Prince of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to be our Captaine generall, being the Kinges neere kinsman, and therfore one of his Counsel, and the lawful protector and mayntayner of the Crowne of Fraunce: VVhom we promise to helpe, ayd, and assist, with al our might, and to giue to him all obedience, in all those thinges, which appertayne to this League: and if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to do our dutie in any thing, we submit our selues to such punishment as it shall please him to lay vppon vs.</p>
                              <p>And if it shall so happen that the Prince of Conde, shall not be able to go forward with this enterprise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let with sicknes or with any other reasonable cause, we promise to serue and obey him, whom he shall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate to be his Vicar or Deputie.</p>
                              <p>And the Prince of Conde, for the glory of Gods sake, and for the obedience sake, which he oweth to the King, byndeth him selfe to these conditions: promising to all that are of this confederacy, by his othe, that hee will with all diligence and courage, by the helpe of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to couenant, constantly do the dutie of a true Capitayne.</p>
                              <p>Fourthly, we comprehend in this League all the Kings Counsellers, except those which contrary to their office, beare armour, to make the King and Queene fulfill their mindes: The which armoure, except they put of againe, and do giue an account of their doinges with all subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience to the Queene, and King, whensoe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              <p>And to come to the ende of this our league (the which we protest againe wee haue made, only for the glory of God, for the dignitie and libertie of the King, and for the peace and tranquillitie of this Realme, which is to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27102:172"/>

                              <p>And if it shall happen that any of our companions and fellowes in this seague, shall sustayne, any hurt or detrement, for this leagues sake, we promise that we will helpe, ayde and assist him all that wee can, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Prince of Conde. But if it shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen (as God forbid it should) that any one among vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his dutie and othe, should conspire with our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and should violate this league by horrible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and should not stand to these conditions and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunts: VVe sweare and protest with all constantnes of faith, that we wil bring such an offender to the Prince of Conde, and will accompt him for an enemy and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle him as a traytor. And thus be it ratefied and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed betweene vs, with free consent, and irreuocable.</p>

Therefore diuers Bands of soldiers well appoynted at the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Cardinall of <hi>Guise,</hi> who was Bishop of the same Towne, sodenly and vnloked for, sette vpon the Congregation and flew many of them: and at the last,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27102:173"/>
such was their rage, that they killed both old and yong, yea wythout all pitye or mercy, man, woman, &amp; childe. The which slaughter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued the space of thrée dayes, and had continued longer if so be any store of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the Gospell had ben left aliue to kill. Yea and it was reported that diuers women great wyth childe, were put to the swerd, and the children, most horrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torne out of their wombes. Suche was the spoyling of the houses of the faithfull, and the shedding of bloude in this Citie, that the horrible murther committed by the <hi>Guises</hi> at <hi>Vassi</hi> was counted nothing in respecte of thys.</p>
                  <p>When newes héereof was brought to the Court, it made all that heard the same abashed.

Notwythstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after these presumptuous enterprises and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings after the slaughter of <hi>Vassi,</hi> all men were fully bent to Ciuill warre.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> complained of this thing to the Quéene by his letters, which he wrote the ninth of Aprill, to this effect: First he sayth that he thought that the fault and blame of the wickednesses afore time com mitted, would haue stayed their boldnesse which enuied the peace and tranquilitye of the common wealth, and haue taught them at the length to embrace, folowe, and obey the Kings Edicts. But (sayth he) so hath their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice increased, that they can no more restraine and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle their wickednesse, but do violate and breake al law: which may moue vs to loke for nothing but the seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods iudgement to fall vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>Of thys brutishe boldnesse (sayeth he) after so many olde examples, there is now a newe come in place to be séene in the pitifull slaughter at <hi>Sens,</hi> vppon those that professed the liberty of the Gospell by the benefit of the

any manner of meanes. Yea euen in the midst of those vexations and troubles, they loked quietly and modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Proclamation of the same Edicte in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Paris.</hi> Thys proclamation being at the lengthe made at <hi>Paris,</hi> and being extorted by the Supplications of the King and Quéene rather than by commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> after his gréeuous sicknes, when he had saluted the King and Quéene, gotte hym home to hys house to recreate him selfe.</p>
                  <p>Amidst these troubles, there came newes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cruell and horrible slaughter at <hi>Vassi,</hi> done in the presence of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and by hym: many of the Kings Subiects both men and women being slain, which according to their manner, by the benefite of the Kings Edict came together to heare the worde of God.</p>
                  <p>This horrible Acte being reported at <hi>Paris,</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moued the mindes of all men of bothe partes: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that much mischéefe was like to followe.

Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> intreating him, that he would come to the king and to her to <hi>Monceaulx.</hi> The which thing being twise required by the Quéene, was also twise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of the <hi>Guise:</hi> the first tyme, hée made excuse that hée was busied in entertayning his friendes, which were come to sée him: and the second time by silence, making no aunswer at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But hée came to <hi>Paris</hi> with a great nomber of armed men, hauing also with him the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,</hi> the <hi>Martiall</hi> of <hi>S.

And hée was receyued into the citie by the citizens with great pompe, the Marchantmaister being their Captayne: and the people crying as hée entered into <hi>S.

                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> returning from <hi>Monceaulx,</hi> that hée might goe to his house according to his former purpose: and being certefied of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> and of his company to <hi>Paris,</hi> hée altered his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: and determined to abyde at <hi>Paris,</hi> according to his dutie, to defende the kings subiectes: being persuaded that his presence would staye the mindes of the citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> which began to waxe somewhat haughty by the comming of the <hi>Guises.</hi> And truely all men knowe that so long as the Prince remained at <hi>Paris,</hi> there burst forth no great Sedition.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding there were many &amp; great reasons why the Prince and many of the Nobles which were with him, should be disdayned. For the <hi>Guises</hi> so soone as they were come to <hi>Paris,</hi> calling vnto them such out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senat, as they thoght méet, had a counsel, which they called the <hi>Kings counsell:</hi> as though a councell consisting of the chief officers of the king were very lawfull.

                  <p>These things should first of all haue bene done by the aduise and consent of the Quéene, who alwayes open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resisted their dooings.

                  <p>First of all therfore he testifieth, that he is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by desire of his owne profite: but only with loue of the glory of God, and of the profite of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, to séeke the which he thought him selfe spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bound vnder the Quéenes auethoritie.

content and quiet, as appeareth by diuers tumultes by them all ready raised, manye of them (which hath not bene heard of before) being so bold that they dare make open warre, and take diuers of the Kings Cities: The which, although it be very greuous vnto him, that men should so lewdly and impudently behaue them selues, abasing him in this hys tender age, to the great hurt of the Realme: yet notwithstanding he will continue still toward them hys accustomed clemency and goodnesse. And therfore to confirme that his will and meaning, he willeth and commaundeth by this publique Edict, that al men vse the rites and administration of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fréely, according to the prescript of the Edicte of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary. But because at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Metropolitane Citye of the Realme, there haue ben oftentimes great perils of moste gréeuous seditions, he willeth in consideration of the present time, that there be no exercise of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, so called, in that City, nor in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbes, borders, and limmites neare adioyning to the same, vntill it shall séeme good otherwise to the King.</p>
                  <p>There was also publiquely set forth about the same time very solemly, the Kings Rescript, whych they call Letters patents in manner and forme folowing.</p>
                  <p>All men sée the great perturbations and troubles of the Realme, and also howe the mindes of all estates and degrée, are so vexed and disquieted, that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but insue great hurt, except God of his mercy and goodnesse turn away the same.

But the King and the Quéene do openly testifie, and would haue it generally knowen for a suertie, that hée, his mother, his brethren, and hys sister, neuer came, thankes be to God, into that state of captiuitie: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywyse, do retaine &amp; kéepe, libertie, autority, &amp; kingly dignitie and power, and shal no doubt by the goodnesse of God, enioye the same, with the help and diligence of good and faithfull subiects. And bicause those seditiouse persons doe greatly abuse the facilitie &amp; gentle nature of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> their kinsman, whom they haue chosen to be the Captaine of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie, he testifieth that he will doe all that he can to restoare him to his former libertie, and to pacefie the troubled state so much as he may.</p>
                  <p>There was also at this time mustering of men in <hi>Pa ris,</hi> specially of Noble men, which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be horsemen: and commaundement was sent tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough euery prouince to all men to be in a readinesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the moneth of May nexte comming. <hi>Paris</hi> also was in euery corner replenished with armour, with sol diours, and Enseignes.</p>

Wee beséeche you, that you would not any more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue these reportes: séeing it is so manifest and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently knowne to all men that it cannot be doubted of, how that the King of <hi>Nauar</hi> your Brother, a man of great wisedome, and such a one as is very carefull for the preseruation of the king and his dignity, is with the King and Queene, who will not, without all doubt, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any maner of violence or iniury to be offered to the King, being both of kyn to the Kyng as well as you, &amp; also charged with the king by his office. Beside this the Cardinall of <hi>Borbon</hi> is with them, who hath no lesse care for the safetie of the king and the Realme than you haue. Moreouer there are with him other Princes his kinsmen, men of wisedome, which are bound both by their office and also by the bond of loue to defende the kyng, with a great sort of his Counsell also, which if the kyng were so shamefully misused, would lay their heades together to remedy the same: because if in this poynt they should fayle to do their dutie, they might be sure to be euill spoken of among all men. In that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do so diligently séeke with one consent the pre seruation of the state, and would haue you to be ioyned with them, you may thereby certainely perceiue how false those reports haue bene: the which reports would greatly haue offended and gréeued the mindes of your bretherne if that they had not here tofore declared their fayth, and great good will: for if they should so behaue themselues towards the king, it wold greatly redownd to their reproch and shame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:27102:183"/>If you will wey and consider these things, you shall find that those reporters, do vnto you and to them also great iniury, séeing that ye are bretherne.</p>
                  <p>This also we woulde haue you to vnderstand, that we haue none otherwise confirmed letters concerning the libertie of the King and Quéen then the very truth thereof hath caused vs, least you should thinke that we had done any thing rashly or through feare.</p>
                  <p>We feare no man in the executing of our office: in doing whereof, we haue only a consideration of the kyng, specially in those thinges which do belong to the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the kyng, and to the profite of the Realme: being ready for these causes to spend our life and goods.</p>
                  <p>Know you also for suertie that all dew reuerence &amp; obedience is shewed here to the King and Quéene. And because we vnderstand by your declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that you find fault with certaine of vs, as though we forsaking the Kinges lawfull Counsell were present at certaine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Counselles: Know you also this for a certaine, that none of vs were present at that counsell, which was kept here extraordinarily, by the aucthoritie of the king of <hi>Nauar</hi> your brother, but only by the slat commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Cardinal of <hi>Borbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> your brother also, and the kéeper of the Citie: neyther did we heare, sée, or perceyue that anything was done there, which did not appertaine to the obedience of the King.</p>
                  <p>The other principall poynt of your complaints, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth Religion. The which truely is no lesse straung and wonderfull vnto vs. Of the which, we perceyuing that you haue ben otherwise infourmed, than it is, haue thought good to certifie you of the trueth. You knowe that the Edicts which haue ben made in these our kings dayes, pertaine to no other end, than to kéepe the kings subiectes in their obedience, and to auoyde seditions, vntill such time as the kyng were come to his full age:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:27102:184"/>
for all those <hi>Edictes</hi> are temporall, and serue but for a tyme, to the intent they may be chaunged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if so be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie and experience of things shall so declare it to be best. The Edict of <hi>Iuly</hi> was not so soone made as abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, at the making wherof you your selfe were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: and yet notwithstanding the same ought not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be defended by violence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After this, there was made another Edict, in the moneth of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> And least it should rather bring trouble than tranquillitie, at the first we doubted to confirme the same: but when we had good hope of peace and tranquillitie, we confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the same, otherwise we would not haue doon it. And vppon the same hope of peace, thrée dayes agoe, we confirmed and published another Edict like to the Edict of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in euery poynt, sauing that <hi>Paris</hi> the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane Citie is excepted. The which exception was not made without great cause: For when the sedition which was there of late dayes wared more gréeuous than in other places, it could not be otherwise appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. The end of those Edicts was not, to bring in news Religions, but, as it is sayd already, to kéepe the people in peace and tranquillitie. If the offence be as great in the first as in the second: the Kyng hath power of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to continew or to alter lawes, and not the subiects by priuate aucthoritie &amp; by force of Armes. The whiib thinge truly wee cannot couller or hide, séeing wée read in your declaration, how that you say that you, and fiftie thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more, which are of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same mind, wil spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your liues in this cause. We wish that you may receiue this our admonition to your profite: &amp; to consider that it is a great deale more méet for you, being the kings néer kinsman, to defend his dignitie, than to ioyne your selfe to others which are not in the same conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If by your following of other counselles the dignity of the king be deminished, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater blame &amp; reproch shalbe youres.</p>

                     <hi>WE</hi> haue spoken before concernyng the letters which the Quéene sent to the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> In the which shée perswaded him to come vnto the King vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weapened and wythout Armor, that the matter might be ended quietly among them, and that he might by his presence put away those slanders which were reported of him. For there went diuers euell reportes abrode of hym, and the more by reason of the Declaration which he caused to be published, the Kings Letters being set forth against the same: insomuch that the causes of all the troubles were openly layd vpon him. Wherevpon the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> published another wryting the. ix.<note place="margin">This name Triumuiri signifieth three chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> officers of equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note> of May, in the which he declared that the <hi>Guises,</hi> whych were called the <hi>Triumuiri,</hi> and not he, were the causes of al the troubles: declaring reasons, by which it might appeare, that he had soughte peace, did, and would still séeke the same: And although (sayth he) I haue alwayes hitherto declared by vndoubted Arguments, not only a singuler loue, and an obedient mind towards the King
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27102:185"/>
and Quéene, but also a notable desire and care for the profite and concorde of the Realme: the which also of late I declared, when as I deferred the putting my self in Armor, euen vntil the very pinche and extréeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitye, at what time I was constrained to doe it, that I<note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Prince of Conde.</note> might resist their violence, which threatned to kill and slay, and made great bragges, and which of late, when they had gotten an Army of men, contrary to the King and Quéenes commaundement, armed them selues, &amp; entred into <hi>Paris,</hi> where I was at that time, being not ignorant what they ment to do: yet notwithstanding I made no sturre or do, least I should put the City in pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. Yea, I hauing no consideration of my estate and condition, although I was not the first that put my self in Armor, yet notwithstanding at the first commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Quéene, least I might séeme to omit any thing lawful that might bring peace, I with mine we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from <hi>Paris,</hi> minding to get me home to my own house, and to dismisse al my train, thinking that my aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would haue done the same: who notwithstanding co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywise, kéeping <hi>Paris</hi> still, and doing many things there against their office, and also hauing vsurped the Kings authoritye, kept the King and Quéene captiues not only in body but also in minde.

                     </gap>ity of the Realme: yet notwithstanding, fearing least my answers to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts from the Quéene, after I had offered the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of peace, be not so truely and wholely brought to

her handes as they passed from me: I thoughte good to haue the whole matter put in wryting, both to the ende they may be considered of the King and Quéene, and also that they being published throughout all Christian Realmes, may be known to all Princes, to our Frends in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and specially to all Courts and Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of this Realme: of the which, but specially of the Court of <hi>Paris,</hi> to the which before this time I haue sent my Declaration, I require and craue, that these explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my reasons, may be put in the publique Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: to the ende I may geue accounte of all my actions to my Prince and soueraigne Lord the King, at what time be shal come to that age that he may Iudge of the merites of his subiects, and of their euell desertes also, which haue don any thing during the time of the kings Minoritie.</p>
                  <p>First of all, this I thinke for a suertie, that it ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can, nor ought to be sayd that I haue ben the cause either of stirring vp or of maintaining these commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and troubles: when as my ennemies them selues wil confesse that I was not the first that toke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sweard in hand: and when I did take it after them, whych put them selues in Armor againste the King and Quéenes willes, I had good occasion so to do. For by the Lawe of Nature, being a Prince and one of the Kings kinsmen I ought, and am bound of duety, to defend and maintain the dignity of the King, and the peace and tranquillitye of the Realme. So soone as I put on Armoure I prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted that I woulde put of the same againe vppon suche reasonable conditions, as shoulde appertaine to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertye of the King and Quéene, and to the peace and concorde of the Realme.</p>
                  <p>Whervpon it must néedes follow, that they are the causes &amp; authours of troubles, which haue refused those conditions, and which, when they could not abyde the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:27102:186"/>
peaceable gouernement of the Quéene, and that shée should be the head ouer the Kings subiectes, and disday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at her, for that shée looked so straytly vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, least they should defraude the kings creditors of any of their debt, put themselues in armour, came with a bande of soldiours to the King, and beset him about with armed men, that hauing the king and Quéene in their owne power, they might gouerne the Realme as thei list the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: they committed horrible murthers vppon the kings subiectes liuing peaceably according to the kings lawes, and thus haue brought vpon the whole Realme of <hi>France</hi> these stormy tempestes of trouble, beginning euen a litle before to enioy peace and tranquillitie, both partes being contented to liue peaceably, so that they might enioye their Religion.</p>
                  <p>But and if (leauing the present state of things) wée will call to mind and consider euery mans actes in time past, in good sooth, wée shall finde these same men, which at this day stirre vp these troubles, haue ben also afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme, the causes of great inconueniences to the Crown and dignitie: séeking by the perturbation of this realme to enrich themselues, whereas by peace and tranquility they decay.

Therefore I leaue the Iudgement of these, to all indifferent men, to discerne who are the authours of troubles: whether they, which haue sought peace and concord by all meanes possible: or they, which haue so mayntayned dissensions always, that thei dare at this time, to the great hurt of the whole Realme proclayme open warres. Besides this, there
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27102:187"/>
is so little cause for any man to marueile why I should be so busie to deale and so ware and circumspecte in the matter, that I shuld be in great falte if I did otherwise. For their actes in time paste againste me, haue taught me sufficiently to beware how I put my selfe into their handes. And it is playne enough to be séene, that their purpose is to destroy the greatest part of the Nobilitie, and of all estates of men which imbrace the truth of the gospell, specially those that attende vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mée. The which their meaning may easely be gathered by the talk which the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the <hi>Constable</hi> had togyther of late in the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> before a great assembly. But what obedience they shewe towardes the Quéene, it may appeare hereby, that contrary to the Quéenes wil which she oftentimes declared, they dyd frustrate the kings Edict of Ianuary, adding this new exception: <hi>Let not the Religion be vsed at Paris.</hi> Who seeth not that they intend nothing else, but euen to banish the Gospell out of all partes of the Realme? when as also of late procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was made at <hi>Paris,</hi> to banish al the new Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. To what purpose shoulde I say that by no other meanes, the Inhabitants of <hi>Paris,</hi> can be kept in quiet? For we haue séene that the Prince of <hi>Rochesuryon,</hi> and <hi>Martial Momorentius,</hi> hauing about them only twelue soldiers, haue kept the people of <hi>Paris</hi> in quiet without any maner of tumult, the space of thrée monethes togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The which continewed euen vntill that daye, on the which the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> entred into <hi>Paris.</hi> But this is worthy the remembrance, that when the same <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Memorency</hi> had somewhat increased the number of soldiers to kéepe the ordinary watch, wherby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies of certeyne factious persons, might be preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ted, the Marchant maister and certeyne of the Citizens sayd, that the people might be kept in peace and quyet with lesse ado a great deale. Notwithstanding after the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:27102:187"/>
comming of the <hi>Guises</hi> into the Citie, the mindes of the people were so altered, that to kéepe them in quiet they were fayne to haue a band of men which they appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without the knowledge and wil of the Quéene. But I knowe it came to passe by the singular prouidence of God, that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> and the <hi>Constable</hi> should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close the secrets of their harts, before so great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that their toong no doubt might runne before their wyt. The which thing truly doth sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declare that those things are true which certeine of their familiar friends, and houshold seruaunts haue reported, &amp; which doth also appere by diuers of their letters that haue ben taken, namely, that their purpose is to depriue me of that company of men which are here with me, &amp; to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with such punishments as they had already deuised.</p>
                  <p>The which in déed the slaughters, and spoyling rapine committed by the soldiers of the <hi>Constable,</hi> &amp; those things also which were done in diuers places against the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reformed Religion, do opeuly declare: but specially that horrible murther don by the <hi>Guises</hi> at <hi>Sens.</hi> Of the which calamities they are to giue an account, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. But as touching the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Quéen, by which shée hath willed me, laying my armour asyde, to come vnto the king vpon hir fayth and trust, and too make me such assurance in wryting as I shall require: I protest truly, that I haue a singular desire &amp; good will to obey hir commaundements: but I vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these are the subtil practises of my enimies, which bring all things to passe as they lust themselues: And agayne, I sée not how the Quéene can saue me harmlesse, so longe as shée is in that state that she is now in. For how shall she resist them, who putting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in armor against hir wil, haue beset hir round about?

and authoritie as he should, whose facilitie &amp; sufferance thei haue greatly abused, &amp; do what they list themselues both against his will and the Quéenes: eut<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as also they haue done oftentimes heretofore, when they were put in authoritie to gouerne. The which iniuries done to them, if they would remember, they must néedes think themselues much bound to the prouidence of god, which hath safely preserued them from the counsels and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of the <hi>Guises.</hi> To be short, I sée no other way for the safegarde of the king and Queen, than for the <hi>Guises</hi> to depart from the Court home to their howse, and for the Quéene hir self to recouer hir former libertie.

For what mischief is it not, that they séeke to worke against me, and those also that are with me? They openly reuile vs as rebelles &amp; open enimies to the King and the realme: and doe thruste vs out of our offices: and also threaten death vnto vs. For who knoweth not what false rumors, and shamelesse re ports, they haue openly bruted abroad against me? Who séeth not the preparation of warres which they make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, both within the kings dominions and also without? They conspire with foreyne Ambassadours to make warre, partly without the Quéenes knoweledge and consent, and partly by hir consent, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torte from hir through feare, abusing hir facilitie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hir beléeue that which they intende not. They set the King and encourage him agaynst his faythfull sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes. They spende and waste the kings Treasure in warlyke affayres, which should be better bestowed to the paying of his debtes: So that the same whiche the people gaue to helpe their King withall, is nowe tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                  <p>For whereas it is sayd, that I do séeke my owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate commoditie more than the common wealth, that certainely cannot be rightly sayde of me, but more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great deale of them which adde dayly to their olde wickednes new mischiefes: being so obstinate and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they had rather bring the kyng and the Realme in to this perill of warre, than for common quietnes sake, somewhat to relent. They say that they will not go home from the Kyng. What faythfull Subiecte would denie to obey his soueraine in this? To the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the causes of such present and imminent euilles. For whereas they obstinately say, that it is not méete for them to depart from the Kyng in this his minority, they haue no reason for it. For the Quéene is sufficient inough to discharge that matter, specially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as great and vrgent cause requireth the same. Let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that they were aduaunced to their dignities, not to do all thinges after their owne mind, and contrary to the wils of the kyng and Quéene to bring the Realme into these daungers: but to the end they might kéepe the same in peace and concord, that is, to leaue it in that state, in the which it was before thei enterprised to take armoure. In putting on of the which, dare they say that they haue done according to their office? It is lawfull for no man truly in this Realme to put on Armour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be by the expresse commaundement of the kyng. It hath not bene lawfull at any time by the lawes of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:27102:189"/>
                     <hi>Fraunce</hi> in the dayes of those kynges that haue bene of lawfull age, for the kynges naturall bretherne, though they retourned from warre, to enter armed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the Court. And haue they aucthoritie so to do in this time of the Kinges minoritie? But if they were the Kynges faithfull subiectes, séeing that by their comming in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour into the Court, the whole Realme is in a roare, they would for the peace &amp; tranquillitie of the Realme, depart.</p>
                  <p>And séeing this is the only way to bring peace and concord, they, if they were good and faithfull subiectes, woulde shew themselues to haue more regard to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon profite of all men, than to themselues. Although truly I my selfe am not only as they are an officer to the kyng, but also the Kinges néere kinsman, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue more right and authority to be with the king: yet notwithstanding I, which was not the first that put my self in Armour, for the common wealthes sake, do protest and promise that I with all that are with me, will depart euery man to his house: vppon condition that they will do the like. To the which condition except they graunt, all men may sée, that it is not I, but they which prefer their owne gaine before the common wealth.</p>
                  <p>But and if they cannot be satisfied with these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, let them also search for examples: let them call to mind what hath ben alwayes wont to be done hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in these matters: and they shall find that the Kynges aforetime of <hi>Fraunce</hi> haue vsed this meane, that when controuersies haue fallen out betwéene their Princes, and that both partes had put themselues in Armes by their priuate aucthoritie, to giue commaundement vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to vnarme themselues, and to go home to their houses: and afterward to make them answere to the same.</p>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:27102:189"/>But admit that they had aucthority to abide stil with the Kyng, against right, and all approued customes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but his seruants only and to beset him round about with such souldiours as they haue gathered together by their priuate aucthoritie: yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denied but that I haue great iniury, I (I say) which shoulde haue this prerogatiue before them, beinge the Kinges néere kinsman, and which haue not put on Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but by them constrayned, only for this cause, to defend the Kyng, the Quéene, and my selfe from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: these thinges (I say) considered, I haue great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury except I haue leaue in like mauer for mée, &amp; mine to be about the kyng: which are sworne as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto him: and which I say and affirme are the Kynges faithfull subiectes and seruants, as they haue both shewed already, and also will shew hereafter: at what time they shall be commaunded by the kyng of <hi>Nauar,</hi> the kynges Deputie, to defend the kynges li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and the aucthority of the Quéene, and of the kyng of <hi>Nauar,</hi> being ready for the same to spende both their life and goods.</p>
                  <p>But and if they will not suffer the Quéene to vse that equallitie that she ought, let her not leane to the one part more than to the other (howbeit if she be more inclined to any part, she should rather be inclined to me being a Prince and the kynges néere kinsman) and let her vse her aucthoritie to remedy the mischtefe at hand otherwise than she hath done before: for no man wyll thinke that any thing hath ben done by her consent, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that shée is of such wisedome, and so carefull for the preseruation of the kyng her Sonnes dignitie, that she woulde not bée negligent to do her dutie in a matter of so great waight. But there is no doubt, but that which shée did, was for feare of them, which hauing hir in holde, pulled her from doing of her dutie.

When as also it is manifest that the King is broughte to that state that he is constrained to graunte manye things against his will. To proue this thing, their chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of new Counsellers shall serue: whom they ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chose, that vnder the pretence of a Counsell, the Quéene might be constrained to do what they wold by a more clenly way. For it is knowne in what order it was done, and in what estimation they nowe haue the Quéene: who deliverate and take counsell together by them selues a parte, and do conclude whatsoeuer they them selues do like of. They do many things by their owne priuate authority, and when they haue don, then they come to aske her minde and opinion. And what soeuer they them selues lust to haue done, they cause the high Courte of Parliament to confirme the same. And in very déede they preuatle more wyth those of the Parliament than the Quéene her selfe can. Finallye, who will deny, that it is necessarye at this time, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Quéene from feare of this violence, that shée may recouer her former authority: and so they to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side their Armor, and to goe home to their houses, that all suspicion of violence being taken away, there maye be more quietnesse héereafter, and the perrils of great calamities auoided? For I and all that are wyth me he fully perswaded and bent, that except the matter be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly and indifferently handled, rather to abide the extremity, and to sèe the end, than that they which haue vsurped to them selues power, against all law &amp; right, to the great hurt and detrement of the Kings subiectes hitherto, and also as yet going about to worke their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destruction, by so many horrible murthers cruelly committed against the kings Edicts, should still héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after impudently procéede in their Insolencie.</p>
                  <p>And to take away all occasion of slaunder whych they may haue against me héereafter: wheras they say

that the kings letters were taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kings Postes by my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement: I answere that I haue geuen contrary commaundement to those that attend vppon me, neither were there letters at any time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them, which were sent eyther to the king, to the Quéene, or to the king of <hi>Nauar.</hi> This I confesse to be true, that there haue bene many letters taken which haue bene sent to diuers priuate persons: by which are to be séene an infinite number of sclaunders, false ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, counselles, and practises against me: many thinges being quite contrary to those promises which they haue made vnto me concerning peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde.</p>
                  <p>But concerning the casting downe of the Images at <hi>Towers,</hi> and at <hi>Blais:</hi> I protest that I was very sory for the same: in so much that I signified to the kinges Officers which are in those places, that I would ayde and assist them, to punish those according to the kings lawes which should be found gilty in the fact. This is and may be an Argument of my will and meaninge, the which also I haue done, and doe as yet, at <hi>Orleans.</hi> Euery one of what state and condition so euer he be of, prayseth and commendeth the moderation and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of al those which are with me, which liue peaceably and quietly with the Townes men, without any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of offence, or breach in any poynt of the Edicte of Ianuary.</p>
                  <p>And as touching those which kéepe in hould certayn Cities: I affirme that they do it for no other cause, than to keepe those Cities for the vse of the Kinge, and not to suffer them to come into their handes, which abusing both the Kings name, and his Artillery, do séeke to get power for their owne priuate profite. For so sone as the Quéene shalbe restored to her former liberty, and into that state wherin she was within these thrée Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes,

she shal wel perceiue and vnderstand that those Cities will shew all obedience to the Kinge and to her as they had euer done before: and will alwayes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the same so faithfull, that in that point they will geue place to no Citie within the Kings dominion: no not to <hi>Paris,</hi> which of late hath gone about to cause this ciuill warre, spending great store of money to that end and all vnder pretence of Religion.</p>
                  <p>And nowe, I and mine are so farre from forgetting these thinges and buryinge them in silence (as we are wished to do) that we would rather haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicled for euer, to be written in Tables, and to be por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed in letters of Golde, and to be shrilly proclaymed throughout all Christian realmes, that they may sée our dutifull obedience and faithfull trust, shewed towardes our King greatly iniured in this his younge and tender yeres: and also that so notable an example of my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage &amp; concord with the rest of the Nobilitie of <hi>France,</hi> which haue ioyned our selues together with one hart &amp; consent, to preserue the dignity of the kinge &amp; Quéene, may be a memorial for euer in writing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> posteritie.</p>

                  <p>And do perceyue that the causes of those troubles are the iuste iudgements of God, punishing the sinnes of men, which reiect so notable a benefite, as the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the gospel, the power of God to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or else estéeme not so reuerently of the same as they ought.</p>

And hauing cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued both their bodies and their willes, at their owne pleasure, they most impudently abused them, breakinge the Kings Edictes, and violating his dignitie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (say they) there are great causes why we shuld hope that God the author of humane societie, but specially y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preseruer of his church, will not suffer the vnbrideled force of those violent and cruell counsailes to procéede more outragiously than they doe: but will make hys Churche in the middest of all the trouble, the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. And we haue a new and manifest argument, beside those which haue appered heretofore, of this his good wil towards his seruants: in that hée hath in these dayes of his afflicted church, raysed vp the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to be a Patrone and defender of this cause, by miracle of hys diuine prouidence. For this cause, we must gyue harty thanks vnto God, the first and principall author of thys benefit, &amp; we must looke for happy successe of his cause.</p>
                  <p>And because hée will vse this meane to preserue his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:27102:194"/>
church we for our partes, must be diligent, faithful, cou ragiouse, and constant: least we omitte good occasion to bring things to passe, being offered. Wee séeke the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ser uation of the Gospell and of the church, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendinge of the libertie and dignitie of the King, of the Realme, and the whole common wealth.</p>
                  <p>Who will denie that these are iust and lawfull causes, to put on Armour, and specially for them to whom that authoritie appertaineth? It is méete and necessary ther fore (say they) that you and we to the vtmost of our pow er, and to the spending of our liues, do aid and assist the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> &amp; the rest of the kings officers, which haue made a sollemne vow for the defence of the King, the Realme, and the Church: and to be very carefull to giue vnto the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> for this cause, money, fourniture, and all maner of warlike prouision when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he shall require the same. In so doing (they said) this thing should be so profitable for them all, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more necessary, the time being considered: And as they thought it to be their dutie, to admonish them of these things, séeing that now, the glory of God, the safetie of the Church, and the preseruation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane societie, was to be sought for: euen so (saye they) you must not delay the matter, being of so great waight by any maner of meanes. But forsomuch as all mans helpe is wholely vnprofitable and vaine, except wée haue first of all the helpe and ayd of God, the aucthor &amp; reuenger of this cause: We must take héede that wée be diligent in calling vpon God, and that we professe the true Religion with holines of life, least in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of these troubles of warres, the care of true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be quight extinguished. The best weapons that may be had to fight against our enemies, is holines of life, and godly prayers. If these be wanting, our words shall runne through our owne sides. And because (saye
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:27102:195"/>
they) we sée before our eyes such horrible calamities: we, following the approued custome of the Church, haue appoynted by a common decrée of all men, that in all congregations, their should be fasting and sollemne prayers for certaine dayes, which we admonish you to vse modestly, deuoutly, and godly: and also that God should be prayed vnto publiquely and priuatly, to send a happie successe of all these troubles, to the glory of his name, and to the peace and tranquillitie of his Church.</p>
                  <p>They wrote letters also in the name of the whole<note place="margin">Letters to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Pallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, from the Synod.</note> 
                     <hi>Synode,</hi> to <hi>Frederike,</hi> County <hi>Pallentine</hi> at <hi>Rheine,</hi> whom the refourmed Churches of <hi>France</hi> had found alwayes in time of cruell persecution a fréend, and ready to helpe at néede. This was the coppie of their letters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We are not ignorant, that the basenes of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is such, that we should not trouble you with our letters: but notwithstanding both the experience which we haue had of your singuler clemency and humanitie, and also the waight and sharpenes of our miseries and calamities, do constrayne vs in these our extremities to flée vnto you for ayd: séeing that of long time you haue professed the trueth, and haue had a singuler care to pro mote the glory of God, and to mayntaine and defende those which professe the trueth of the Gospeel in what place soeuer they are. First of all therfore we pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God omnipotent, and to the Father of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, which will haue Kings and Princes to bée Nourses of his Church, that he will vouchsafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and strengthen your highnes, in true fortitude &amp; constancy, by his holy spirit, which fortitude you haue hitherto aboundantly shewed, with great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in setting forth and promooting the woord of God in your Churches. And we giue you most harty thankes for those benefites which we receyued of you within these few yeares oftentimes, intreating our kynges

on the behalfe of our bretherne which were afflicted for the doctrine of Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And now we being gathered together of late out of all partes of the Realme, for a common Counsell or <hi>Synode,</hi> gladly call to mind the benefits which you haue shewed vppon vs: and so much the more willingly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, because at this time the truce being broken, by which we began to enioye the benefite of the Kinges Edict, we stand in great néede of your clemency. We foresée the great tempest, and calamities of our Churches like to ensue, the state of your Churches of <hi>Germany</hi> in that Ciuill warre, comming into our mind: the which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and calamities, being ended by God so happely, who hath promised without all doubt to helpe his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, there is no cause why we should feare.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But to make the matter more playne, because we know that ye vnderstand already our care by certaine Noble men, we will not be tedious vnto you. Thus much we ad concerning our Churches, namely, That there is such a conspiracy made against our Churches, that except God in his mercy do prouide for the same, there is like to ensue no lesse calamitie and confusion, than there hath happened long agoe, to the <hi>
                           <hi>Orientall, Greeke, and Affrican</hi> Churches.</hi> For, to conclude the matter in few wordes, when the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and they which haue conspired with him, perceyued that by the Edict of Ianuary, men had leaue fréely and openly to preach the Gospell, and that they were restrayned of crueltie, which till that time they had declared by all maner of punishments: many of the Kinges officers &amp; Noble men imbracing the doctrine of the Gospell: they made a conspiracie with the enemies of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to kill in euery Citie the professors of the Gospel.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:27102:196"/>
Of which their conspiracy we haue had manifest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: First, by the horrible slaughter committed at <hi>Uassi</hi> it may appeare, and then by the cruell and bloudy murther of the men of <hi>Sens,</hi> the Bishoppricke wherof pertayned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Guise,</hi> so great slaughter of them being made, that for the space of fower dayes, there was such killing and steying, of men, women, &amp; children, without any respect of person, that the only remembraunce therof, cannot but cause teares to bée shed: Yea, the dead bodies of such as were slayne, came swimming down the Riuer of <hi>Seine,</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> requiring (as it were) their buriall, and complayning of this tira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, or rather calling for vengeanee of God, and man. And now, although we know it rather to be our dutie to pray for our enemies, and for those which do perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vs, than to accuse them: yet notwithstanding, we trust that you will interprete to the best these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of our iust grief, &amp; of our manifold calamities. And for so much as, those our aduersaries, to leaue no thing vndone that might be to our destruction, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired your Realme of <hi>Germany</hi> to ayd and assist them, we earnestly pray and beséech you, for the loue which you beare to the Church of Christ, that you will bend all your might, to withstand and put away this euill, least <hi>Germany</hi> imbracing the same truth of the Gospell which we do, be euill spoken of, for séeking to hurt and anoye vs. And we intreat your honour by the tender mercy of God, that you will vouchsafe to be a meane for vs to the King and Quéene, that there may be some consideration had of our Churches: and that you would helpe to mayntayne and defend, so iust a cause, the time requiring the same.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the Letters which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> sent to the refourmed Churches of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> we haue spoken before: in the which he willed them, when they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:27102:196"/>
sawe warres to begin, to prepare themselues to the warre with a good courage. Whereuppon in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they obeyed his commaundements, some prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring very well in their affayres, othersome, not hauing so good successe. They fortefyed with men and munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so much as they could the Cities. And after the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Towers,</hi> of <hi>Blais</hi> and of <hi>Angewe,</hi> had so done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, the men of <hi>Poicters,</hi> did the like, and then the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> which fortefied diners Cities, &amp; tooke their chiefe Citie called <hi>Roane.</hi> But at <hi>Burdeux,</hi> and almost through<note place="margin">Vasconia is Gascoyne.</note> but <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> except in certaine meane townes, the faith full were molested, by <hi>Monsiere Monluce,</hi> the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who delt very cruelly with the faithfull euery where, but specially at <hi>Bourdeux.</hi> By the meanes of this <hi>Monsire Monluce,</hi> there was a great slaughter<note place="margin">the slaugh ther of Tolosa.</note> committed vppon the faithfull at <hi>Tholoz,</hi> and the rest of the multitude, which were many in number, and had escaped this gréeuous murther, brake out of the Citie, being a necessary place of refuge, both for them, and also for al the faithfull of the Countries therabout. The citie <hi>Montaubane</hi> in <hi>Langnedoc</hi> being taken by the<note place="margin">Mont au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</note> faithfull townesmen therin, and fortefied with their garison, who, being oftentimes assaulted by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Tholoz and M.

                  <p>¶ Therfore in the prouince of <hi>Languedoc</hi> diuers things attempted, had diuers successe. In the Townes called <hi>Chatronouar, and Limos,</hi> many of the faythfull were slaine. The faithfull fled out of <hi>Narbon,</hi> being not able to withstand the power of <hi>Monsier de Iuoys</hi> the<note place="margin">The actes of Narbon in general.</note> Liuetenant: they fled also out of diuers townes about <hi>Towers,</hi> the inhabitants wherof are called <hi>Rheni. Castra Albiens</hi> a Noble Citie was taken by the faithfull, and many other cities néere adioyning to the same. <hi>Pezenac</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:27102:197"/>
                     <hi>chum,</hi> a Citie, so called, yéelded also to the faithfull, but within a while after they were troubled againe. Also the Citie called <hi>Blitter,</hi> was taken and fortefied by the faithfull. <hi>Aijgnes</hi> also a Noble hauen lying vppon the <hi>Mediteran</hi> sea, was yéelded into the hands of the faith full. <hi>Monpellier,</hi> also a Citie very famous for Phisicke, and healing diseases, and very rich also for that it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vppon the sea, was fortefied by the faythfull. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the faithfull tooke a very strong hold called <hi>S. Peters</hi> Castell, &amp; thrust out a Bishop that kept the same, after which they got the whole Citie, the Ile, and the castel of <hi>Maguelon.</hi> The tooke also a towne called in old time <hi>Foss Marian,</hi> but now <hi>Aquae Mortuae,</hi> a noble hauen of the <hi>Mediteran</hi> Sea: but the Captayne thereof being slayne, through treason, the Papistes got the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.<note place="margin">Nemaux otherwise called Nimes</note> Moreouer the faithfull tooke <hi>Nemaux</hi> a Citie very rich, and noble by the auncient monuments of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and they tooke not only this, but the whole ter ritory thereabout. The whole territory also almost of <hi>Uiuar,</hi> and <hi>Seuenas</hi> yéelded to the Faithfull: with the Medowes on both sides the riuer called <hi>Roane,</hi> from <hi>Lions</hi> almost to <hi>Auinion,</hi> after the which, they tooke a very strong holde called <hi>Rochmor</hi> Castell, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes<note place="margin">Auinion in Prouince.</note> greatly anoyed the men of <hi>Auinion.</hi> Therfore, a great part of <hi>Narbon,</hi> which is called <hi>Languedoc,</hi> being very rich and replenished with stout and valiant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, yéelded to the faythfull.</p>
                  <p>On the other part, the Inhabitants of <hi>Dolphiny,</hi> being a great number which professed the reformed religion, made almost the whole prouince on their side, putting al such as were Papistes to silence. And herein they vsed the helpe of <hi>Baron des Adretz,</hi> who hauing with good successe done many valiant actes in those regions, with the very terrour of his fame and name, euen at the first quayled the mindes of the Papistes thereabouts. The
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:27102:197"/>
Citie of <hi>Ualentia</hi> also was taken by the faithful, but not<note place="margin">Valentia taken.</note> without great perill In the which Citie there was one <hi>M. Mottecondrin,</hi> Deputie to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> (who was gouernour of that prouince) a man of warre, and by the meanes of the <hi>Guises,</hi> a mortall enemie to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion. This man to withstand the faythful, gathered togither all the power hée was able to make:<note place="margin">Mottecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus slaine.</note> and brought into the Citie new garrisons of soldiers, &amp; apointed new watch and ward at euery gate of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the great terror of the faithfull Citizens, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing the present daunger, fled to the Churches that were reformed thereabouts, crauing their helpe &amp; ayd. Wherevpon many came from <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Montill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> noble citties, and from the hyther part of <hi>Viuaretz.</hi> And now when assault was made, the faithful of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Valencia</hi> got the gate, and whilest the souldiours of <hi>Mottecondrin</hi> made hast to withstand them, the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rescued them on euery side: in so much that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes were constrayned to giue backe: And <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecondrin</hi> himselfe, after he was come to his house from the tumult, was besieged, &amp; at the length by fire, which was set to his house, constrayned to yéeld himselfe into his enemies hands. Then the Captaynes entered into communication with <hi>Mottecondrin.</hi> And while they were thus in talk togither a good while, the people stood wayting at the dores, and long looking when <hi>Mottecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin</hi> shoule be slayne: and at the last they threatened certaine of their captaynes which went about to saue his lyfe, that except they deliuered into their handes <hi>Mottecondrin,</hi> they would slay them. Uppon this, one <hi>Mongoni,</hi> a noble man came to <hi>Mottecondrin,</hi> &amp; sayd vnto him: <hi>That which thou wentest about to bring vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou shalt now taste of thy selfe, and shalt suffer punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for so many good men that haue ben slayne.</hi> And then vnarming him, he thrust his dagger into his side, and so
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:27102:198"/>
slew <hi>Mottecondrin:</hi> and hoong the dead carcasse out of the window for the people to behold. And thus the faith full enioyed <hi>Valentia,</hi> and almoste all the chief Cities in <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> as <hi>Grenoble, Uienna, Romans, Montil, Crest,</hi> and others. It was reported that letters of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> were found among the writings of <hi>Mottecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin,</hi> in whiche hée gaue commaundement to kill the faythfull in euery Citie: and it was reported, that the fourth of May, was the day appointed for that murther the which rumour greatly stirred vp the mindes of the faithfull, they plainly vnderstanding whereabout their aduersaries the papistes went.</p>
                  <p>While these things were thus a working at <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and throughout all <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> at <hi>Lyons</hi> also (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it commeth to passe in so great garboyles) diuers mens mindes were diuersly occupied. The papistes sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to excéede the faythfull both in strength, and also in nomber. Who notwithstanding, what with their own might, and what with the help of their neighbors, were not weake, and as touching their mindes and courage, they did no doubt far excell their enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Lieuetenant at that time of <hi>Lyons,</hi> was one <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> a Noble man being of quiet and modest dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Saltanus Liefetena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Lions.</note> and was not altogither an enemie to the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: &amp; yet hée was very carefull to maintayne peace, according to the prescript of the Kings Edictes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hée endeuoured himselfe all that hée might, to kéepe both partes and sortes of men in peace and concorde.</p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse there came newes to the Elders of the reformed churches, that the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church was euen now a working: certeine noble men papistes, that were of the <hi>Guises</hi> faction, intending to be at <hi>Lyons,</hi> by a certeyne daye, as <hi>Mottecondrin, Aches, Calmentius, Mongeronius:</hi> who were reported to haue gathered great armies of soldiours from euery place. Soldiours
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:27102:198"/>
also were mustered at <hi>Lyons, Saltain</hi> not knowing thereof. Their conspiracy and purpose was, to remoue <hi>Saltain</hi> from the custody of the Citie, &amp; then to destroye all the faithefull. Then came <hi>Mongeron</hi> to <hi>Lyons,</hi> and shewed to <hi>Saltain</hi> the kinges commaundement, that<note place="margin">Saltain Liuetena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Lyon.</note> hée should be ioyned with him in the custodie &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Lions.</hi> By whose comming the Papistes were not a litle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted. Wherevpon the faythfull thought, that in this extremitie, it was not good any longer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the time. According to their manner, they had Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the suburbes: notwithstanding being carefull to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, euen now of late, they had brought soldiours, &amp; armour into the Citie. In the meane time newes was brought to <hi>Lyons</hi> of the tumult of <hi>Valentia,</hi> almost about that hower, in which the sturre was there made. Then wente <hi>Mongeron</hi> from <hi>Lyons:</hi> and by and by Fame reported, that <hi>Mottecondrin</hi> was slaine at <hi>Valentia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the faithful thinking it best to behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, they in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night time, secretly placed diuers armed soldiers in so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry places of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon streates: &amp; &amp; at the length when thei had gotten the Townhouse, &amp; had fortified euery place of the Citie, and had taken the Churches they came into <hi>Parley</hi> with the Brother hood of saint <hi>Jhons,</hi> which were fat and rich priestes, who had leaue giuen them to departe out of the Citie vnarmed. And so the faithfull had the City to themselues, placed certaine péeces of ordinaunce in diuers conuenient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; fortified, the City. After those things, they came to <hi>Saltain</hi> the Liuetenaunt, and declared vnto him, that they had not done these thinges, eyther for contempt of the king or his magistrates: but to defend the Citye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniuries of open enemies, and to kepe it for the Kynge: obeyinge (as their dutye required) the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to whom the conseruation
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:27102:199"/>
of the king and Quéen appertayned: and therefore they willed him, according to his accustomed maner, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the citie. But <hi>M. Saltain</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while after forsaking his office, got him home to his own house. And <hi>M. des Adretze,</hi> in the name of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> tooke vpon him the gouernment of the Citie. And when consultacion was made by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens what were best to be done, they agréed at the last vpon this: That there shuld be chosen out two thousand men of the reformed Religion to kéepe the Citie: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should be payed their wages, both out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon treasury, and also out of Ecclesiasticall liuings. That no man should be indammaged or hurt for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: but that it should be lawful for euery one to liue with his conscience to him selfe. Notwithstanding, that there should no Masses or other rytes and ceremonies be vsed, either within or without the citie. That there should be twelue of the chiefest of the reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ioyned with the Consuls or Aldermen of the Citie. And that it should not be lawefull for the Aldermen of the citie to do any thing without their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent. And thus <hi>Lions</hi> came wholy into the handes and power of the faithfull. After this the people spoyled the popish chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, brake the Images and pictures of saincts and other ornamentes belonging to the Masse. And it is reported that there were only thrée slaine in the winning of thys<note place="margin">Lions wonne by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</note> so great a citie. <hi>Lyons</hi> being after this manner brought into the handes of the faithfull, they tooke also the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of <hi>Burgundy: Monsieur Tauuanes</hi> the Liefete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant séeking in vaine to hinder and let them.</p>
                  <p>The newes of these things, thus prospering on the Protestants side, being spred throughout <hi>Fraunce,</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the mynds of the <hi>Guises</hi> a new, and encouraged the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and those of his syde to procéed in their purpose.

And the people were not a little displeased with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> for that he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely forbad these things to be done. Therefore vpon a certayne small rumour of the throwing downe of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolles which were set vp in a certaine place in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes, the fame thereof was by and by spred throughout the whole citie, in so much that all men ran to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, some into one church, and some into an other, and made such a spoile of Images and other monuments of Idolatry, as thogh it had ben so appointed by the kings commaundement or by an Edict: this I saye, they dyd, notwithstanding that the seruauntes of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> did all that they could to staye them.

                  <p>But the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> said, that his purpose was not to deface Idoles: but to see that nothing shoulde bée done contrary to the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> for the breaking wherof his aduersaries, he sayd, being giltie, were to be punished. But the common voyce notwithstanding of the people was this to him againe: Séeing, say they the aduersaries of the trueth haue first begoone to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingnish the reformed Religion, and to persecute the professors thereof, why should we not destroy all false worship? And why should they deale coldly, which had taken vppon them the defence of the trueth, and of the liberty of the Realme, séeing that their aduersaries had proclaymed open warres against the truth, the Kyng &amp; the Realme.</p>

The aunswere which he made was to this effect: Although (saith he) I haue heretofore oftentimes declared, both by writing, and also by other meanes, why I haue put myself in armour, and vppon what condicions, I am ready to vnarme my self agayn, and to go to my house: yet notwithstanding I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer obtayne any thing at their handes, which haue the King and Quéene in hold, but threatnings &amp; contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wordes. So soone as I came hither, before they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood any thing of me, they sent letters, &amp; such seuere &amp; sharpe commaundmente, as though they had had to do with théeues, &amp; the most wicked men aliue. But nowe, when they perceiue that I regarde not their impudent boasting &amp; proud threates, &amp; that thei cannot stay me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my purpose, &amp; also that I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly perseuere in my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full request, hauing no consideration of my selfe, but of the libertie of the King &amp; Quéene, and of the peace and tranquillitie of the realme, they séeke to preuayle by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subtil wayes. And this forsooth is their deuise, they haue offered a certayne supplication to the king, in the which they pretend al obedience, submission &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But if a man read &amp; mark the same well, he shall find it rather a Decrée than a Supplication. For it is a flat sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and decrée made &amp; concluded vpon by these thrée, namely by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the <hi>Constable Momorencie,</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:27102:203"/>
and by the Martiall of <hi>S. Andrew:</hi> &amp; with these also was the Popes Legate, &amp; the seruants of straungers. But they which for six monthes ago, marked &amp; noted al their doings, can testifie vpon what foundacions these conclu sions do stand, not vpon zeale of Religion and fayth: but rather vpon the fraude, deceypt, and ambition of those thrée: who séeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be out of the court, were offended, not that thei had any iniurie offered them, but because they could neuer yet abyde that the Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the kings bloud, should be about the king: percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing also that the Quéene rather sought the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and the peace and tranquillitie of the Realme, than to satisfie their willes: they began to ioyne ano asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate themselues togyther, to recouer their former libertie againe, to rule and gouerne all thinges as they list themselues. And when they saw that they could not haue helpe of the Nobles, nor of the common sorte of people to bring their matters to passe (for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they were iustly hated of them): they coloured their purpose wyth the pretence of Religion, hoping therby that the popish priests and those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hoong vpon them, would ayde &amp; assist them. And thus winning so many to take their parte as they could, and séeking to haue ayd by straungers of for reyne Nations, they minded to come to the kinge and Quéene in such battayle aray, that no man should once resist them. And to the end they might haue better hope to rule, thei tooke and kept the names of all those, whom they thought or suspected would be hurtfull vnto them, minding to kil some, to banish other some, and to spoyle and depriue many of their offices: And among the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall number, was <hi>Michael Hospital,</hi> the Kings Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour, &amp; diuers of the kinges counsell, and many other good men, set in authoritie and office vnder the Kinge. There were also already some placed in their roomes, which were eyther slaine or banished. And truely, they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:27102:203"/>
very well declared their iudgement of late, in chosinge those six, whom they appointed to be of the Kings coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel: the matter being so ridiculouse that the people made a game or ieste of that choyce.

The Prince <hi>Rochsurion,</hi> the kinges néere kinsman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very wise and godly person, was called away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King: and in his place were set new Tutours, that he might neuer heare any mention made of God, or of any godlynesse, nor any thing else which appertained to good education, he being of himselfe of a good disposition, and well inclined: And that he might not bée taught to vnderstande his estate, which the Quéene his mother went about to instruct him in, teaching him to heare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans cause peaceably: to make much of his noble men: to estéeme the vse of armour for necessities sake: to looke to iudgement, to maintaine his people, &amp; to be a gard to the afflicted, &amp; to deliuer the oppressed: and aboue al things to beware least he retayned any suche persons about him, which vnder colour of frendship &amp; humility, would take vpon him the kings office, &amp; vse tyrannie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the kings subiectes. These things (I say) were taught him of the Quéen his mother: which these thrée Suppliants much mislike of, who would haue the King frame himself to their bent &amp; disposition, as to daunce cunningly, to sit or ryde a great horse well, hansomly to carry a speare, to be a wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> louer, to loue another mans wife more than his owne, and (to be short) to bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of all honesty &amp; vertu. For they say, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it is not méet for a King to be occupied and troubled with suche hard matters. But rather (say they) it is méete for a king, to shewe him selfe very seuere towards his subiectes that come vnto him: to enriche his housholde seruaunts, and to commit the gouernement of the Realme wholy vnto them: not to trouble himself in hearing mens causes, in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:27102:204"/>
reading letters, in setting too his hand and seale: (least their deceites which they vse vnder the coullour of his seale should be espied:) to fancy and fauour a few (which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend one with another who shalbe the greatest theef:) to be liberall only to a few, and to other some sparing &amp; hard: and to dispoyle the people of their goods: to sell the offices of Judges for money to simple and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men: &amp; last of all to fill the Court full of al vanities, and wickednes. I speake not these things vnaduisedly: the Quéene knoweth these things to be true as wel as I. These Suppliants therfore haue made a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and hurtfull conspiracy to this Realme, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was that which <hi>Sylla,</hi> which <hi>Caesar,</hi> and which the <hi>Triumuiri</hi> made. And it had by this time caused much mischiefe to be done, if I my selfe had not with all my might withstode the same vnto this daye. I marueyle that they so impudently contend before the Quéene in wordes: and I doe wonder that the Quéene will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and agrée to their wordes, as though she had neuer heard any thing of their wicked counselles: the which truly playnly declareth that she is more than a captiue. And truly if she were not afeard to be stifeled or stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geled in her bed, (which they haue threatned to her, as I appeale to her selfe if she may speake her conscience) she would not haue giuen her consent to their Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but would haue tolde them to their téeth, that their couetousnes and Ambition is the cause of all these troubles. Séeing therfore at this time the Quéene, in so great perill, cannot speake of the matter, as she would, nor restst those which abuse her w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> feare, to bring their purpose to passe: I my selfe am constrayned to defend her aucthoritie and the Kinges also, to answere to their suppliant petitions, in the King and Quéenes name, of whose libertie I confesse my selfe to be a defender. And why should I not trust that God will prosper my inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:27102:204"/>
and that good will which he hath giuen to mée, and the Kinges faythfull subiectes also, doing their duty in so honest and godly a cause?</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First of all they begin with their titles of dignitie, séeking therby to get the more aucthoritie: and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently paynt forth the memory of their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in time past: and would haue men to iudge of their minds and meanings, by these their actions.</p>
                  <p>Truly it is necessary that so glorious a beginning, shuld haue as euil &amp; base an end set against it. And why so? They haue very well behaued themselues towards their Kinges (they say) in times past: is that sufficient not only to couer their faultes at this time, but also so to countenaunce them, that wicked actes shalbe taken for meritorious déedes?</p>
                  <p>If they haue done any thing profitable or worthy of commendation for their Kings (as they haue done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so farre as I know) if they haue not in all this time receiued their deserued recompence, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that they should so importunatly craue to bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced at this time, to the ruine and destruction of the King, and the Realme. But they thrée séeke so great ly for their profite, and are such carefull followers of gayne, that they would not tary so long before they would craue and receiue a reward for their deserts, if they euer deserued any thing. For probation wherof, what say you to this? That their profites and yerely re uenewes do amount aboue the summe of two hundred and fiftie thousand french Crownes, more than their patrimony, beside other helpes. On the contrary part, let them remember (if any of them will say that they haue not ben fully satisfied in all thinges) How many good and singular men, by their meanes, were cast in prison: how many Noble families haue ben, by them destroyed, in the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi>

the second: In so much that it may euidently appeare that they abused the fauour of those Kinges, not onely to the inriching of them selues, but also to the reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their malicious mindes, to the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of many. Wherefore if they will haue their mindes and counsayles (as they say) to bee examined, tried, and iudged by their actions in time past, go to then, and let them haue that triall and iudgement: and let them denie, if they can, whether their doinges haue not ben such, that they ought to be reproued and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, by all the Kynges true and faythfull subiects:</p>
                  <p>Further more they saye <hi>that the Kyng and the Realme are in great perill: and least they should fall into that meui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table destruction, they offer vnto him certayne sure remedies? but</hi> (say they) <hi>with all reuerence and obedience.</hi> If it should be demaunded of them what were the very cause of this destruction, and if they aunswered truly as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science beareth them witnesse, they must néedes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the cause, and the whole blame hereof, vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. For after the proclamation of the Edict of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, there was peace throughout all partes of the Realme.</p>
                  <p>Now if they will denie that they were not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers and breakers of this peace, then they shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a thing so manifest that all men can giue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie against them. For in what state was the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome when the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> began warre and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted horrible murther at <hi>Uassi?</hi> To what end were the conspiracies of the <hi>Constable and the Marshiall of Saint Andrewes?</hi> What ment the beastly barbarous rudenes, and rude barbarousnesse shewed at <hi>Paris?</hi> For where as they professe their reuerence and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Kyng, how incredible séemeth that in the eares of all men?</p>
                  <p>Those thrée often times contemned the Quéenes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27102:205"/>
as when the Quene commaunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go to their Mannors, &amp; Lordships: when by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement also in tyme ef perill, they were sent for to <hi>Monceaulx:</hi> is this to shewreuerence and obedience to the king and quéene? They came also contrary to the Quéenes commaundement to <hi>Paris,</hi> with an armye of men: and would not departe from thence, for any thing that the quene could do either by intreaty or otherwise. Whereas I my selfe to obey the quéenes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes went from <hi>Paris:</hi> they abyding in <hi>Paris</hi> at their pleasure, when they had made there al things sure, came to the king and quéene with an army of men, &amp; brought them whether they would or no violentlye, from <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbleau,</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi> I appeale to the conscience of the Quéene for testimony of these things, if shée may fréely speake. They were fully determined to rule all thinges at their owne pleasure. But this is their obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the king which they shewe by the open breaking of the kinges Edictes: This is their loue toward theyr countrey, to destroy the which they thinke it not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to arme thmselues and theirs, except also they cause the aunciente enemyes of the Realme to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against the same.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They seke to haue a perpetual edict made for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but to what end? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wée desired to haue the Edict of January kept, vntil the king came to sufficient age him selfe, they sayd it was a very vnlawfull, request: adding that the king might order change, amplify, and restrain the Edictes, when, and how it pleased him: and that we, in desiring that the same which was decréed by the king and his Counsell might be kept vntill he came to his full and ripe age, went about to make the king a bonde man, and to shut him vp as it were into prison, which would limitte his power and authoritye with these exceptions. They then saide. And now they go about to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:27102:206"/>
make that an euerlasting and irreuocable lawe, which they thrée themselues haue deuised and decréed. Truly, we may with better reason and truth conclude, that they go about to make the king a captiue and bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>man vnto them, not only in this his minoriti, but in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iority also. Who séeth not their sondry and contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises? Who séeth not that they go aboute, not only to haue the king in their handes, and to rule him at theyr pleasure, but the whole Realme also? when as in a mat ter of so great waight and perillouse, they dare take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to determine &amp; decre what they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues list.</p>
                  <p>Dyd euer those <hi>Triumuiri</hi> of Rome namely <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus, Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> which by their conspiracie peruerted the lawes and the common wealth of Rome, any thing more bould and presumptiouse? If they had ben moued by the loue of peace (as they say) and not by the outragiouse heate of sedition: if they had ben moued by zeale of Religion, and not by the force of ambition: they would not haue begon those their counsailes with force and murder: they would haue come reuerentlie and modestly: they would haue declared the causes whi they could not allow of the Edict of January: And they would haue intreated the kinge and quéene to consulte with their Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sail for the remedeing of those troubles, to the glory of God, the dignity of the king, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the Realme. And so they should haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they were moued by zeale of their consciences. But while they go about these things, they sufficiently declare that they take Religion but for a colloure, to the end that they may draw away the Kinges subiectes to take their part: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by their help, &amp; by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> help of strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, they may bring al things to their rule. Can the Princes the kings kinsmen suffer this, that strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers shal make lawes, &amp; Edictes, to rule the king &amp; the whole Realme?</p>
                  <p n="4">4 They require to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Rome, which they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:27102:206"/>
call Catholike and Apostolicall, to be alone through out the whole Realme: and that the vse and administration of the reformed religion should be forbidden. Let this be the Edict of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> a straunger, of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Momorentius,</hi> and of the Marshall of saint <hi>Andrew,</hi> the kinges seruauntes. Let their willes, mindes, and decrese, be set against the authority of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges Edict, which the king, the quéene, the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the kinges kinsmen, the kinges Counsel, and forty chosen men out of euery court of the realm, haue made. Let them oppose, and set this their Edicte both against the decrées of the nobility, and the cominaltye, by their supplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they offered to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king first at <hi>Orleans,</hi> then at saint <hi>German,</hi> concerning the orderinge of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after this maner, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they must nedes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confesse that their Edict, will be the cause of ciuil warres, and in tyme, the destruction of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme. But blinde Ambition carieth them out of the way, to bind the king and the Realme to them, (as they saye) by these merits. For this I affirme that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> and his brethren, can not deny, but that while they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to molest, &amp; trouble those that are of the reformed Religion, what zeale soeuer they pretende, they brynge the Realme into greate perill. Let them remember what happened of late almost in the same counsel to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Scotland. There, both sortes of men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, both papistes and Protestants, liued peaceably, &amp; obedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder the gouernement of the Quéene: vntill it was commaunded by the aucthority of the <hi>Guises,</hi> that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religion should be there receyued, then that which is of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then a certen smal nomber of men for this cause being raised, and appointed to battaile, by the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the quene, and by the help of the Nobility, were easely put down again. The which thing ought to haue made the <hi>Guises,</hi> sease from their former purpose, for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:27102:207"/>
feare of greater trroubles, whiche would ensue by the meanes of those Edictes. But they on the contrary part more obstinately went forwarde with their purpose to hinder the reformed religion, writing sharp letters vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Quéen, because shée shewed hirself so fauourable: and perswaded with hir, that it was necessary that the principal authours, and many of the Noble men, should be put to death. Therefore to bring that to passe in déed which they vttered in woordes, they sent an army of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into <hi>Scotland</hi> with <hi>M. Brosseus,</hi> &amp; the Bishop of <hi>Atniens.</hi> At whose comming most seuere Edictes were made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the obseruation of popish rytes, and comming to Masse. The Bishop said that he would soone cal those that were gone astray (as hée sayd) to the obedience of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and <hi>monsieur Brosseus</hi> said, that hée would quickly within few dayes by force of armes put all the rebels to flight. And as cruelty hath always co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse ioyned with it, they beheld &amp; considered the landes and possessions of the noble men, and wrot to the <hi>Guises,</hi> that they could both make the people tributary, to pay vnto the Frenche king two hundred thousande Crownes, and also assigne to a thousand Noble men of <hi>France</hi> which should continually maintayne warre in Scotland, houses and land. The <hi>Guises</hi> hearinge of the which, were glad: but the Quéene &amp; <hi>Osellus</hi> (a noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Scotland</hi>) said vnto <hi>M. Brosseus,</hi> that the Scotts could not be so easely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered: who if they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strayned, would craue helpe of straungees, which imbracinge the same Religion, would not desire to haue better occasion to banish the Popes Religion out of Scotland, whereby the Kings Royall estate should come in peril. But they refusing these admonitions of the Quéene &amp; <hi>Osellus,</hi> said that the Quéene with hir facilitie and sufferance would marre all: and they called <hi>Osellus,</hi> foole and dastard. Ther fore these wise men so wrought, that the greatest parte
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27102:207"/>
of the nobility gathered vnto them an army of men, and within few dayes eyther slewe or put to flight the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes and sacrifising priests: which if this had not ben, might haue liued peaceably. And thus thei which before would binde Beares, and which triumphed before the victory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did not only dishonour the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so lost the aucthoritie of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this example the <hi>Guises</hi> ought to acknowledge their fault and to leaue of their enterprise, &amp; also to haue no more in their mouthes these wordes: <hi>One of those two Religions must be banished the realme: and some muste needes giue place to other some.</hi> These proud words become not subiectes and seruaunts: but a king, of full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect age. And whereas they would haue no religion but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romish religion established within the realme, which they go about to defende by force of armes, they bring the realme into great perill and daunger: And truly, it were a great deale better, to kéepe both partes in peace and concord, and to vse in stéede of blowes, woordes and writings, omitting all force, warres, &amp; sheding of blood. The which peraduenture will so prouoke God, and his vengeance to fal, that the papists and priests the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, which might quietly enioye their offices &amp; liuings, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be the first that shal féele the furour and madnesse of the people. To be short, the protection of the Suppliantes, cannot chuse but bring great trouble and garboyle vnto them. But, when they may be assured of this, that they néed not without they will themselues, be enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maged, neyther in body, office, nor goods, haue they iust cause to complayne? except peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture they will say that they were carefull and sory for the losse of our soules. But what hath made them so sodenly so carefull, when as neyther any one Bishop, Curate, or popish priest, hath laboured or take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any maner of paines to that end? Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therfore we neuer intended to hurt any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:27102:208"/>
néed was there to bring them into this contention, and to pretende the name of the Church? Is not this too set one against another? and to cause the people whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not abyde those priests, to hate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the more? Was there euer a more sorowfull sight séene in thys Realme? Can there be any profit, benefite or good turn so great, that it maye make a sufficient mennes for so great destruction? Can the Popes pardones and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences restore the bloud that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is shed for this cause? These Suppliantes maye one day say vnto the Kinge, that they to defend that which no man gainsayed, and to preserue the Romish religion, which no man wente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to hinder. haue lost, or went about to loose the one half of his nobilitie, and chiefest of his subiectes. Then, and that truely it shalbe obiected vnto them, that as by their fayned and dissembled opinions concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they had brought the Realme of Scotland into great perill of destruction, and caused much bloud too bée shed: euen so by the same opinions, counsayles and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, great discord hath ben sowen in this realm: and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both sortes of men set togither (as it were) by the eares, in such sort, that they may iustly hereafter amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all posterities be sayd, to be the authours and causes of all mischéeues and calamities which shall happen to the men, both of the reformed, &amp; also of the Romish Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>And, to cause more trouble, they would haue all the Kings officers, and all Ecclesiasticall persones, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the confession of their faith: and that such as should denie or refuse so to do, should be depriued, if they were temporall men of their offices, if they were priests, then to loose their benefices. For this is the other Edicte of those thrée Suppliants against the receyued &amp; approued lawes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king. For there is no man that can reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, neither hath it ben heard of, that any king, that hath ben heretofore, hathe constrayned hys true Subiectes to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:27102:208"/>
receiue any other confession of faith, than that which is in the Apostels Créede. Let that Lawmaker, by whose craftie and subtill witte these their supplications were made, bring forth but one only example. The which, truely, he cannot do, except hee will bring into this Realme the Inquisition of <hi>Spaine:</hi> the which by the iudgement of all other Nations is counted so wicked, that they all reiect the same. These are the very same trappes and snares, which they layd at <hi>Aurelias,</hi> (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called, <hi>Orleans,</hi>) a little before the death of Kyng <hi>Fraunces</hi> the second, and which cannot chuse but bring the extreame ruine and destruction of the kyngs sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes. For those Suppliants know that there are ten thousand Noble men, and a hundered thousand souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, which neither by authority nor by force, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake that Religion which they haue receiued: and wyll not suffer the preaching of the woord, and the administra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments according to the forme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they professe, to be taken from them, and will defend themselues with the sword, against them which abuse the aucthoritie of the Kings name.</p>
                  <p>That great number cannot be ouercome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed (which God forbid) without the anoyance and ruine of those that shall set vppon them.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude the matter briefely, I saye and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in the name of the Noble men, Gentlemen, and of many others which are here with me, that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée is made by thrée priuate men, which by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie peruert the kynges Edictes and make no accompt of them, and to put their decrée in execution, before they made the Kyng and Quéene acquaynted with their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, they put themselues in armour, and tooke them both captiue. I say and affirme that the same Decrée is against the lawes of this Realme, against all Christian order, against the State, against the Edict of January,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:27102:209"/>
which was only made for this cause &amp; against the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; safetie of many of the kings subiects: whose ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they openly shew themselues to be, &amp; whose goods and life they séeke to take away, and all vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion &amp; conscience. This decrée also, taketh away the liberty of going to a Counsaile, the which should haue ben considered by that subtill counsayler. For if it be decréed, that the same confession, which they call the confession of the Faith, shalbe receiued of all the inhabitants of this Realme, that is to say, if all men be constrained to receiue the Popes doctrine and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: this must néedes be a plaine sentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against the reformed church: neither is it then lawfull for our Ministers, or for the Ministers of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Nations, imbracing the same doctrine, to go vnto a Counsaile: when as they, being not heard are condem ned. But before the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> his brother, bring forth the decrée, concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confession of the Romish faith, let them renounce &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie many speciall poynts of the confession made at <hi>Aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge,</hi> which, when they were at <hi>Sauern,</hi> they said thei imbraced, &amp; promised to one of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> that they would cause them to be obserued in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> It is néedfull also that the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> should declare by open writing whether he do persist in that opinion, which sometime he said to the Quéene before a great many witnesses, concerning <hi>Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> concerning the carying about of the Sacrament, concer ning Iustification, Inuocation of Saints, Purgatory, Images, and concerning many other speciall points al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, of which he spake plainely against the iudgment of the Catholique and Apostolique church of <hi>Roome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Furthermore in that supplication, straight after this, they call to mind the throwing downe of Images, &amp; require, that the same Images be repayred, and the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:27102:209"/>
breakers of them be punished. But thervnto I make this answere: The punishments, wherwith I punish them, which brake downe Images, first in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; at the last in <hi>Orleans,</hi> shall witnesse before God, &amp; men, that this misdemeanor of the rash multitude, al wayes displease me: both for that it was contrary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Edict of January, &amp; also against the forme of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> League &amp; othe taken of vs not long since. But if that deiection of Images deserueth any punishment, because any such fact is contrary to the kyngs Edict, what punishments then deserue they, which so greatly abuse the kinges name, that vnder the coullour therof, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit great wickednesse, as may appere by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted murthers at <hi>Uassi,</hi> at <hi>Sens,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Tholoz,</hi> and in many other places He that preferred this Supplication, shuld first of all haue considered and remembered himselfe, that it is read in no place, that a dead Image requireth ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: but it is read, that the bloud of a slaine man, which is the liuely Image of God, cryeth and calleth for the vengeance of God, and doth at the last cause the same to fall vppon the bloudshedders.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Moreouer those Suppliants, or rather commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, require that they may vnarme themselues, which without the commaundement of the king of <hi>Nauar</hi> put on the same: and that they should be counted for Rebels and enemies to the King and the Realme. I would glad ly demaund of them, which thinke them selues so wise, and saye, that they séeke for the peace of the common wealth, if that be not the way to cut of all hope of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, when they require that I, and they that are with me should be counted Rebelles and enemies to the king and the Realme? For they say not, <hi>Let them which wyll not put of their Armoure,</hi> but, <hi>which haue put on Armour, be accounted the Kinges enemies.</hi> They which poynt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth another maner of aunswere than by writing.

They abased him all that they could, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to be little regarded of the king, hys right and dignity being suppressed in matters of great waighte. They cannot deny, but that of late dayes, when they went about to vsurp the gouernement of the Realme, by their meanes it was brought to passe, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the king of <hi>Nauar</hi> required, was denyed: al occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to rule and gouerne, either in tyme of war, or peace, being taken from him: and to discharge their spitefull stomacks, in the dayes of king <hi>Fraunce</hi> lately disceased, they made him to be lesse estemed then a man of meane state and condition: being sent for to <hi>Orleans</hi> with thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: and commaundement giuen to Noble men that they should not entertaine him at his cumminge: also Marshall <hi>Tremen</hi> béeinge sent with two armies one of horsemen another of foote men, was commaunded, to take and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> spoyle all his Dominion, and to cal the straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the pray.

This is the hope that we haue of their good and wholesome counsaile.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 To be short, they adde this request, that the Cities might be yéelded vp againe to the kyng, and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants therof sworne a new vnto him.

                  <p n="11">11 Last of all they protest that they are ready to goe home to their owne priuate houses, yea to the vtmost partes of the world, if néede should require: and to the end we should not be ignorant, they assigne the time of their departure, saying: <hi>When these thinges are fulfilled and brought to passe,</hi> that is to say: When the Edict of January by their priuate authoritie is openly broken: when the reformed Religion is wholy abrogated, with the preaching of the word of God and the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sacraments: when our consciences shalbe subiect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of straunge doctrine: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue im braced the reformed Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shalbe put to sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; made subiect to the furor &amp; outragions madnes of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: &amp; being in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of their liues if they liue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than they would haue them: and (to vse their owne wordes) if they shall liue without offence, that is to say, if they will come to Masse, and to other popish ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, this they call to liue without offence. These are the conditions which we may looke for at their handes. This is their discréete counsaile.</p>
                  <p>¶ But let vs now procéede a little farther, and let my petition be ioyned and compared with theirs, which I now make, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>I require the obseruation of the Edict of January: they on the contrary part, would haue the same aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. They desire the subuersion &amp; ruine of many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble families, and of others also: I desire that al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings subiects of what estte or condition soeuer they be of, should be in safty, &amp; stil inioye their goodes &amp; liuinges, and to be deliuered from all iniury violence, and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. They goe about to kyll and destroye all those
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27102:212"/>
of the reformed Religion: I séeke to preserue them, vntill the Kyng shall come to ryper age to iudge and determine of the whole matter as shall séeme best vnto him: and in the meane time I desire that both parts may liue quietly: that the papistes may enioy their liuings &amp; reuenewes with safety. They séeke to deale by open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, not caryng to begin ciuill warre, séeking by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne ayd to destroy vs, spending the kings treasure to the destruction both of the king, and also of the realme, wherby we are constrayned to defend our selues. I ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desire warres, neither do I spend the kinges trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, neither do I séeke the helpe of straungers: nay I re fused them alwais hitherto, when they haue offered me their seruice, &amp; so wil I doe still, except I be thereunto greatly constrayned by these authours of warres. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to haue armour put of on both partes, &amp; do promise, that all those which are of my part shalbe obedient, and that loue and the reuerence which we owe to the king, shal more preuail with vs tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> force of armes, for whose preseruation we are ready to spend all that we haue. They desire that we may be counted rebells and open enemies, our cause not heard: yea they séeke our bloud, our offices, our goods, and our consciences. We neyther séeke their bloud, their offices, their goods, nor their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. This only we séeke for at their hands, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wée will be bound, that they and wée will go home eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to his own house, according to the tenor of those conditions which we haue more copiously declared in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Instrument which we sent to the King and Quéene con cerning this matter. Neyther can they complayne &amp; say that they are hereby dishonored, séeing that we submit our selues to the same conditions. Our peticion is alike without any manner of inequalitie, we desire nothing but that which is indifferent for both partes: séeing that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues came otherwise then they ought to haue come to the king: and were the causes of these troubles,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27102:213"/>
by their vntimely vsurping of armour. And they haue violently assaulted so many good men, that although our petitions are not alike and so indifferent, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it should be expedient for the peace &amp; tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the realme, to haue rather regard &amp; consideration of many men than of a few, least the whole kingdome for these causes be brought into peril of ciuill warres.</p>
                  <p>But, although there be no comparison betwéene these two peticions, séeing the one is iust and equal, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vniust and violent, the one seeking warres &amp; horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble murther, the other peace, and the generall profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But and if shée cannot at this time fréely declare hir iudgement, eyther beinge stayed by violence, or else because shée will not for other causes offend them: yet notwithstanding this thing wée craue and request at her hands, séeing these times great ly requireth the same, namely: That their supplication and myne may be registred in the publike Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Senate: That the Edict of Ianuary maye bée obserued: and that both partes laying asyde their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, may depart to their own houses, vntill the Kinge comming to ryper yeares, shalbe able to iudge and order the whole matter as it shall please him: or else till the Quéene with the aduise of hir counsaile shal determine of the same.</p>
                  <p>The remedie appertayneth to both partes, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man complaine that hée receyueth any preiudice: &amp; it is so easy to be done, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whosoeuer shall refuse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same, cannot deny himself to be an enemy to the king and the realme. Neither can it be but that they shalbe iudged of all men to be in the blame, which refuse the remedye so easie to be had, for so great misery and calamitie lyke too ensue. It shalbe iudged also who is a traytour and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen enemie to the king and the realme eyther he which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27102:213"/>
willingly offereth to vnarme himselfe: or he which had rather destroy all, than restore the King agayne to hys former liberty.</p>
                  <p>But because ciuil warres haue alwayes euill successe, the soldiers minds and handes being not easie to bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned: I protest before God and men, that I put my self in armour, and prepare my soldiers to battaill with great grief of mind: and doe hartely desire that so great calamities and miseries as are like to come by these ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres might be auerted and appeased by my bloud only, if it might so please God. But bicause my reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble request is reiected, and séeing my aduersaries wil be Iudges in this cause, I protest agayn that my only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and intent is, to restore the king and Quéene into their former liberty, and to bring the gouernement of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kingdome to the Quéene, and to the king of <hi>Nauar:</hi> and to deliuer the greatest part of the people from the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and oppression of such as haue vsurped the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the realme. I haue no regard to my owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate commoditie or gayne in this cause. I am not led by ambition, by a desire to reuenge, or by couetousnesse, as knoweth the Lord, whose glory and truth I séeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende, with the dignitie of the King, and peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie of the Realme.</p>
                  <p>While the matter was thus canuassed too and fro by writing, and the <hi>Guises</hi> with their compartners bearing only an outward shew to the Quéene of reuerence, and séeking notwithstanding daily more and more to rule &amp; gouerne the realme themselues, the Quéen by hir effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat and timerouse nature, was very doubtful, being carefull for hir libertie &amp; authoritie which shée had lost: and fearing also the ambition of the <hi>Guises</hi> and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.

For what can be more vnreasonable than this, that the common sort of people should not only defend these opinions, without law to maintaine the same, but also being of all the Kynges subiectes the very rascall sort, should put on Armour both to breake the Kynges Edictes, and also to rule and gouerne the Kyng at their pleasure? Notwithstanding, this they know, that séeing that Edict was made and established by a notable and singular assembly of Noble, wise, and learned men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that matters on both partes were wisely considered of, the Nobillitie of <hi>Fraunce</hi> will not suffer themselues to haue such ignominy, neither yet straungers to break the Kings Edicts, &amp; to make new Edicts at their owne pleasure. These things being of her wisely considered, she may iudge whether it be méete that the consciences of the kyngs faithfull subiects should be tyed to the wils of factious men, and of the outragious multitude: or what concord is to be hoped for of them, which tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all power of gouernement from the Quéene her selfe: and whether it be to be suffered that they shoulde

                              <p>I think (saith he) that these are conuenient and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary meanes and waies to auoyd the perturbations and troubles which hange ouer the realm: the which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound by the leaue of the King and Queen, For so much as, before thei began their counsail, which were the first that put themselues in armour, and which as yet kéepe the Kinge in their custodie by force of armes, all thys whole realme began to enioy peace and tranquillitie, concerning religion: men of both sorts of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues in very good case by the benefite of the Edicte made in the moneth of January last past, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduise and consent of the Princes the kings kinsmen, of the Kings Counsaill, and by the consent of all the most notable men of all the kingdome: and experience will shewe that without the obseruation of that Edict, there cannot be peace and concord kept among the kings sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes. First of all I require this, that the same Edicte of January, according to the forme thereof, be obserued and kept without alteration of the same, vntill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of another Parliament: or vntil such time as the King himself by lawfull age shalbe able to take vpon him the gouernement of the Realm, and to order the matter according to his owne discretion: to whome I and my Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federates doo yéeld ourselues in such wyse to obey, that if it should please the King to take from vs the benefite of the reformed Religion, we would also alter our purpose and obey.</p>

                  <p>The common Counsell and consent of all men was to go to <hi>Paris</hi> with all their power, being the chiefe Mee tropolitane Citie, and the head of their enemies, and to assault the same.</p>

                  <p>Then the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had told his fellowes that the Quéene had promised him that the <hi>Guises</hi> and his adherentes should foorthwith depart to their owne houses, and vnarme themselues, vpon condition that he himselfe should come vnto her as a pleadge, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of the peace that should be concluded, when I say he had reported these things to his fellowes, he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting the same, perswaded his fellowes to giue him leaue to bring this thing to passe, that he might séeme, to leaue nothing vndone that might bréede peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.

                  <p>Then was this request, which the adherentes of the

                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding he attempted no maner of force, because of the letters that came in the meane time. The sixe and twenty day following, the <hi>Guises,</hi> the <hi>Constable,</hi> and the <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Saint Andrew,</hi> departed from their Campes. And by &amp; by word was brought to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> that those thrée, accordinge to the forme of the peticion, were departed from their armie home to their houses. When the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> vnderstoode this, he came to the King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> to <hi>Baugence,</hi> with a fewe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attending vppon him.</p>
                  <p>Wherevppon he was brought through the middest of the host, in al the hast to a village called <hi>Talsiac,</hi> wher the Quéene aboade: and betwene <hi>Baugence,</hi> &amp; that Uil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage <hi>Talsiac,</hi> were placed certain Garrisons of soldiers.

                  <p>I send vnto you this messenger in all hast possible, to certefie you that all thinges were yesterday finished.

To be short, the reformed Religion, if we behaue our selues wisely (as we mean to do) will haue a fall: Ye and our Admirall shall haue euill successe.

                  <p>There came also to the hands of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes of one of the kyng of <hi>Nauars</hi> houshold ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, a note in writing of the Duke of <hi>Guises,</hi> left with the Kyng of <hi>Nauar</hi> for a remembraunce: to this effect.</p>

                  <p>These forewarnings greatly troubled the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and his adherents: they sawe that he was fallen into the handes of his enemies: so that there was great daunger on euery side.

                  </p>
                  <p>These saluted the Quéene, and were very louingly entertayned of her: She gaue vnto them thankes, for their great diligence and paines for her and the kynges prifite at that time: insomuch that she sayd they had pre serued her life and the kyngs: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which their merits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing honour, &amp; pryce, the sayd, she wold neuer or get.</p>

Whereuppon they most hartely prayed and beséeched the Quéene, that they might not preferre the immaginations of a few men, before those things which appertayned to the glory of God, and the safetie of the Realme: For God (saye they) will defend euery good cause, and seuerely punish all kind of wickednes, which are committed against the Kyngs Edicts, abusing the Kinges name therunto.

Wherefore he sayd it was now high time to prouide some remidies to resist and repell those
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:27102:224"/>
calamities at hand.</p>
                  <p>The Quéene being before instructed concerning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing what answere she should make, began, not to answere to those things which were spoken by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but to declare: That the number, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">The queen denieth the vse of the reformed Religion.</note> and authority of those was very great which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and imbraced the Church of <hi>Roome:</hi> and they haue the sword in their hands (sayth she) and are fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to defend that Religion, which all former kings haue receiued and imbraced: so that they meane this shalbe the principall condition among the rest, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and peace: <hi>That there be no other Religion obserued &amp; followed throughout the whole Realme, than the Catholique Religion of Roome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest, replied, that they did not plead their owne priuate cause: but whatsoeuer had ben done by them vntill that day, was done first for the defence of the kynges libertie and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and secondly for a common wealth: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon they put themselues in armour at the first by the Quéenes commaundement: for the which cause, they did not care if they spent their goods &amp; liues, so that the kyngs Edict might be obserued and kept, wherby eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man might haue leaue to vse the reformed Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the libertie of their conscience: without the benefite wherof, they thought them selues to be but dead.</p>
                  <p>Insomuch, that if they in whom so great a number of faithfull did repose their trust for the handling of these matters, should so much ouershoote themselues, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their dutie, that they should agrée to those thinges which were so repugnant to the glory of God, and the common profite of all men, it could not be auoyded but that they should be counted of all men forsakers &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of the glory of God, of the kings dignitie and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27102:224"/>
safetie, &amp; of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peace &amp; tranquillity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme. The which, rather then it should come to passe, shoulde cause them to forsake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm, before they would agrée to those so vniust and seuere conditions. And if their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of the realme, might remedy the matter, he beséeched the Quéene, that there might be no regarde or consideration had of them but of publike peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times vsed these words: <hi>Let there be no consideration had of me, I would gladly bring to passe that by my exile the kingdome might be in peace, and the vse of the reformed Religion restored.</hi> And the Quéene euen of purpose had entised and prouoked the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> shée hauing the <hi>Triumuiri,</hi> hir Schoole maisters, to vse these wordes. Therefore, the Quéene hauing féete occasion offered hir, answered, That shée had alwayes the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the rest in as great estimation,<note place="margin">The queen woulde haue the Prince of Conde &amp; his friends banished,</note> as became hir. But for somuch as the matter was come to this point, that suche remedies must be vsed as shée wished not, to her great grief, yet notwithstanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the present necessitie, she said, she receiued that condition, namely, that they should forthwith depart the Realme, by whose absence the myndes of the Bishopps would be the better pacified, and so the Realme should be at peace and quietnes.

                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and his fellowes wonderinge greatly at these wordes of the Quéen, which they looked not for, said at the length, that they had respecte vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as wel as to themselues, whose aduise thei would haue.

                  <p>Thus they made an end for this day.

                  <p>And in very déede, if the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had brought hys armie at the first to <hi>Paris,</hi> being so well appoynted,

and of so great courage, there had ben great hope of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. But these delayes, through parleying, dyd both abate the number and also the courage of the soldiours: where as the enemie thereby greatly increased his power.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Guises</hi> hearing of this, retourned with all spéed<note place="margin">The Guises remoue their army fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bogen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, &amp; take Blesa, and Towers.</note> to their hoaste, and were not a little gréeued that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was so escaped their handes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thought it necessary, they remoued their host secretly in the night from <hi>Baugence,</hi> leauing there only certayne garrisons of Souldiours to defende the same. The day following they assaulted <hi>Blais,</hi> being a Noble Citie, which wanted sufficient power to defende the same, because the enemie came vnlooked for: This they tooke, and put a great number of men to the sworde. From thence they went to <hi>Towers,</hi> and sought to haue the same rendered vnto them: the which when they had taken by surrender, they spoyled: &amp; horrible slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was committed by the Papistes in the same towne agaynst the faythfull.

                  <p>These sodayne, and vnlooked for rumours, stayed the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> also the great and huge stoare of raine which fell in that Region, being of it selfe very déepe and foule, made the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to alter his purpose and to leaue following the enemie: For there was no ioyning of battayle by reason of the foulnesse and dyrti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Countrey, the tyme rather seruing to assalt and besiege Cities.

                  <p>At <hi>Lyons,</hi> and about the vtmost regions, as <hi>Dolpheny, Burgundy,</hi> and the prouince of <hi>Langres,</hi> the faithful were diuersly vered and troubled.

                  <p>In <hi>Prouince,</hi> which is a Region nere vnto the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taran</hi> Sea, the faithfull were very euill intreated and murthered. Before the first motions of this Ciuil war, there was stirred vp a greuouse sedition, the chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Captaine whereof was one <hi>Flacean,</hi> a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate person, who had gotten vnto him a band of wicked and lewde men: the which sedition, notwithstandinge, was easely repressed by <hi>Monsuer Cursol,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King sent for the same purpose, and by the helpe of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med churches, notwithstanding that <hi>Monsuer Somme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue,</hi> the gouerners Sonne of <hi>Prouince,</hi> and many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, and diuers other in authority, for bicause of the

                     <hi>Guises,</hi> assisted those lewde persones.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Monsuer Sommeriue,</hi> so soone as he heard that warrs should begin, fortyfied the Cities of greatest trust, as <hi>Marseile, Aiigues,</hi> and others, gathered togither so great an armie as he could, and euery where euell intreated the faithfull. Thus the matter daily waxing woorse and woorse, and both partes being bent to battaile, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full also gathered an Armie, with no small nomber of soldiers and captained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they had small store of great goonnes, and of cities, out of which they were excluded by the subtil practises of the papistes. Their Captaines were these, <hi>Monsuer Cardet, Monsuer Bari, Monsuer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, and Monsuer Mouans,</hi> a very good and expert cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. These marching forth with their armies came to <hi>Pertus,</hi> and beséeged the same, and for want of greate goonnes, they intended to vndermind the citie. Notwith standing when they heard of the comming of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which in dede were mani mo in nomber, they rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their séege, and came to <hi>Cesteron,</hi> which at that time they themselues possessed. But while <hi>Monsuer Somme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue,</hi> intended to follow and pursue them, behold hée got a new occasion to commit great wickednesse. There was at <hi>Auinion</hi> (which was a towne belonging to the Popes iurisdiction or territory, and of great wealth) a certain man called <hi>Fabricius Cerbello</hi> of <hi>Bononia,</hi> béeing Gouernour of the same towne, expert in the warres, &amp; the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> Nephew, and a mortall enimye to the reformed religion. This man intreated <hi>Monsuer Sommeriue</hi> by his letters, that, for so much as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready an army prepared, he would come out of hand to <hi>Orenge</hi> (which is a Noble citie, and the Lordship or seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norie of the house of <hi>Nassau</hi>) to the whiche there came

dayly a great multitude of <hi>Huguenotes,</hi> who vnlesse they were oppressed euen at the very first, not only <hi>Auinion,</hi> which bordered vpon the same, should be endammaged, but also all <hi>Prouence,</hi> should thereby receiue great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore by this mans aduise and counsel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Mon sieur Sommeriue</hi> marched with his armie toward <hi>Orenge,</hi> and had this occasion offered vnto him, easely to assault the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monsieur Parpalia</hi> of <hi>Auinion,</hi> Lord chief Iustice of the Parliament of <hi>Orenge,</hi> returning from <hi>Lions,</hi> was taken at <hi>Bourg,</hi> which is a towne in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> néere vn<note place="margin">Orenge as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted &amp; take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the papistes.</note> to the riuer called the <hi>Rosne,</hi> the inhabitants of the same towne being sworne enemies to the reformed religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore, to deliuer and redéeme this <hi>Parpalia,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Orenge,</hi> and the borderers thereabouts, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a small garrison to kéepe the Citie, came in battail array to <hi>Bourg.</hi> Whereupon the army of <hi>Monsieur So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriue,</hi> being ayded with many of <hi>Dolpheny</hi> and <hi>Auinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> whose Captain was <hi>Monsieur Suze,</hi> a notable enemy to the reformed Religion, besieged the Citie of <hi>Orenge,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voyd of men to defend the same: battered the walles thereof with ordinance, the which being shaken downe, they easely obtayned the Citie. After the taking wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the furiouse and outragiouse soldier, exercised al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of crueltie vpon the poore inhabitantes.

destroyed the chiefest &amp; principal buildings in the city.</p>
                  <p>The victorie being in this wise gotten, the army by and by marched to <hi>Cesteron,</hi> which we saide before the faithfull possessed: and determined to giue the assault vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Citie.

                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:27102:228"/>This man by his singular diligence and indeuour, hauing gathered together from diuers places an Army of men, came from <hi>Lions</hi> to <hi>Montiil,</hi> a noble Citie of <hi>Dolpheny:</hi> at whose commaundement suldiers came to him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuers places. For at that time his name was of such authority throughout all those Regions, that he might rule and gouerne as he listed himselfe, al those places in the which the faithfull abode, as the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Lions, Dolpheny, and Languedos. Monsuer de Suze</hi> hauing gotten a great Armie, went to besiege the City of <hi>Vauriac</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Venais,</hi> but being the more bold by reason of the successe that he had at <hi>Orenge,</hi> hee was carelesse and rechlesse in his busines. Therfore hée incamped him selfe néere vnto the Citie, and willed the Citizens to yeeld vp the same vnto him. In the meane time, the souldiour being carelesse talked of the spoyle, and of the pray, assuring himselfe of the same: and the Captaines euen as if they already had gotten the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, began to deuide the spoyle among them selues. Also <hi>Monsuer de Suze</hi> him selfe, sate wholely vnarmed in his tent playing at the Dyce after hee had dyned, and boasted and triumphed greatly of the praye before the victory. And when the Scouts of the Army cryed out that the enemies were come, <hi>Monsuer de Suze</hi> made a iest and scorne of the matter, saying that they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in vaine to deliuer the citie out of their hand: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he gaue commaundement to certaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der captaynes which were with him, to make better enquiry what the matter was, and to commaund the souldiers to arme them selues. But hée in the meane time followed his play, till euery man began to crie, that the enemy which had ambushed themselues on the other side of the hyll, which lay betwéene them, was come. Therfore at the length he arose, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the souldiers to set them selues in battayle araye:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27102:228"/>
hée him selfe tooke vnto him his Armour: and had scarse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put on his brestplate, when euery man began to crie that the enemy had giuen the onset vpon the first froont of the battayle, which was now constrayned to retire and flée. He therfore in all hast, without his helme mounted on horsebacke, set the souldiers in their araye, ran vp and downe, and cried out like a mad man so that all were now on a roare, and at their wittes end. Yet neuerthelesse many of them stoode stoutly vnto the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, so that the sight began to wax fierce on both parts. Notwithstanding the faithfull being vnder the conduct and charge of <hi>Monsuer de Adretze</hi> preuayled, and flew a great number of their enemies. Then the souldiers of <hi>Monsuer de Suze</hi> turned their backes and fled before the faithfull. And <hi>Monsuer de Suze</hi> him selfe being beset with a certaine troupe of horsemen, escaped by flight, but very hardly. Thus when the faythfull had gotten the victory, with losse of a fewe of their souldiers, wher as on the enemies side two thousand were slaine, they tooke and caried away their tents and artillary. They tooke allso some of their enemies prisoners, and had it not ben that they wanted horsemen, fewe of them had escaped, the souldiers were so sore moued to wrath by the remembraunce of the destruction of <hi>Orenge.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>There is a certaine towne in the County of <hi>Venais</hi> of no great fame, called <hi>Mornac,</hi> yet notwithstandinge by reason of the cituation of the same, and also of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell belonging thereunto, it is very hard to be woone.

This towne also <hi>Monsuer de Adretze</hi> obtayned: but the Castell, the Garrison of souldiers appoynted to kéepe the same by <hi>Monsuer de Suze,</hi> held, with two hundered townesmen also. Yet notwithstanding at the length, partly by force, and partly by surrender, he enioyed the Castell, vpon condition that the souldiers should escape with life. But so soone as he was come into the Castell, the men of <hi>Orenge</hi> which were in the Army, cried out saying that all those souldiers, which were dismist with life, were at the winning of <hi>Orenge,</hi> and many of them were noted to be great shewers of crueltie at that time.

Then said <hi>Monsuer de Adretze:</hi> As they haue handeled others so let them bee handeled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Then were they caried into the Castell againe, from the top wherof, to requite the crueltie which they had shewed towardes the men of <hi>Orenge,</hi> they were cast downe headlong: The like execution was done at <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> when the souldiers of <hi>Monsuer de Adretze</hi> had taken a very strong holde that appertayned to the same. And from hence forth this kind of punishment was vsed eue ry where among the enemies. But while these men of whom we spake before, were cast downe bedlong from the Castell of <hi>Mornac,</hi> there happened a thing worthy to be remembred.

                  <p>Furthermore that they should be made an open shame and a perpetuall ignominie that neither they themselues, nor any of their posterity euer after might beare any publique office vnder the King.

Al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Edit of Ianuary brought such peace &amp; tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quilli ty to the whole realme, that the state of the kyngdome (being before tossed and tormoyled with tempestious waues of diuers troubles) séemed to haue attayned at the length to the most quiet hauen of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, when as the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> commiting a most horrible slaughter at <hi>Vassi</hi> openly declared, that he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                              <p>For this séemed vnto me to be very lewde, that a sub iect durst be so bold, so openlyto co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne the law of his Prince, &amp; that such a law as was made &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by al the states of the Realme in sollempne Courte of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

                              <p>And here I beséech the Quéene to call to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, how that when she was at <hi>Saint Germans</hi> she was certified of the whole purpose, counsayle, and intent of the <hi>Guises:</hi> as, that shée should bée put beside her authoritie, and that her most faythfull and trustie
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:27102:233"/>
seruants that were about her should bée put from her, to the end that when they had gotten the gouernement of the Realme, they might rule and order all thinges at their owne pleasure.</p>
                              <p>Of the which matter when she vnderstoode, and of the League also which the Spanish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ambassadours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, she was wonderfully troubled and gréeued: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that for this cause she intreated me that I wold with all spéede gather together so great a power as I could to hinder the same. The which request I faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accomplished, hauinge both a consideration to the Quéenes commaundement, and also of my dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Kyng and the Realme. This was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all those things which I haue prosecuted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since that time, setting my self against those whom the Quéene iudged to be our enemies. And here also let her call to minde those, whom at that time shee coulde name one by one.</p>
                              <p>But when the <hi>Guises</hi> by their conspiracies both at <hi>Paris</hi> and els where, had openly bewrayed to all men, that thing, which before was setretly in their mindes: the Quéene againe both by her letters and also by mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers confirmed that her former charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement giuen vnto mée, which was, that I shuld withstand the violence of the <hi>Guises</hi> and his adherents.</p>
                              <p>And here I pray and most humbly beséech her, that so farre forth as the faith and word of a Quéene ought to stand firme, she would set before her eyes, euen those things which she wrote vnto me with her owne hand, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which I am now constrayned to publish abrode for all men to behold, that in her letters also my innocencie maye bee séene. For I must néedes assure my selfe of this, that shée cannot chuse but be mindfull of those thinges: which she wrote vnto me from <hi>Fontainbleau<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                              <p>Let hir also remember, how oftentimes she hath sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and hath signified also the same by letters, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and like very well of my doinges: which she sayd she would put the Kyng in mind of, that when he came to lawfull age, he might reward me according to my well deseruing. To this purpose it serueth which shée spake to the <hi>Admirall</hi> a few dayes before he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Court, namely, that she knew him to bée so faithfull and obedient to the Kyng and to her, that hée would indeuoure himselfe all that he could, to deliuer them from the oppression of the <hi>Guises.</hi> Insomuch that of late she wrote vnto him by <hi>Monsuer Rembouill,</hi> that she thought him to be so faythfull a seruant to the King, and so carefull for the Kynges crowne and dignitie, that she would vse his aduise and counsayle, to pacefie the present troubles. To be short, her behauiour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me and my fellowes, when we and shée were together at <hi>Baugence,</hi> do so playnely proue her consent and agréement in this matter, that it shall be néedelesse to repeate many other arguments to proue this thing. For there before seuen Noble men, shée speaking of our dutifull obedience, protested vnto vs that she did acknowledge that we by our déedes had preserued her life and the Kynges. These thinges considered, haue our aduersaries any reason, nay, haue they any coniecture of Rebellion against vs? By whose aucthoritie, shall we be sayd to be Rebelles? Shall we be sayd to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles by the Kyng and Quéenes authoritie, who haue
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:27102:234"/>
giuen vs expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements to arme our selues, who flée vnto vs for succour in these perilles, who by their will, letters and messages like of our doings, giue vs thankes, and approue the same, as profitable for the preseruasion of this Realme? Furthermore all men know, that those our enemies haue abused the Kyng &amp; Quéenes names, whose willes also they haue captiued vnto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The which is the only cause why I and my fellowes haue hitherto testified, and as yet also do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly protest: That we will not receiue any Edicts, Rescripts, or Decrées comming forth in the Kynges name, so long as he enioyeth not his libertie. For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation wherof this example may serue, namely: That the Quéene complayned vnto vs oftentimes in hir let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that she could not therfore graunt vnto vs our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes, because the contrary part was mightier, and the people armed. And although the Kinges name, since the Moneth of Aprill last past hath ben so abused: yet notwithstanding the matter thereby hath the more playnely appeared: but most playnely by those letters which the Quéene sent by <hi>Monsure de Villars,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                                    <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure Vieilleuill</hi> the xxiiy. day of May: In the which shée wrote, that shée deliuered the Kyng into other mens handes: vnderstanding by these woordes <hi>other mens handes,</hi> our aduersaries. Whereuppon it followeth that this sentence of Rebellion, and all other thinges done in the Kynges name, ought to be iudged to be done by our enemies: séeing the Kyng is in their handes, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the testimony of the Quéene. Let men iudge therfore what sentence that is against the condemned, being pronounced by those which are both aduersaries and Iudges. But let vs sée what great fault of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is which is layed to our charge, and why it is ob iected to vs: <hi>Because</hi> (say they) <hi>they will not vnarme them selues.</hi> If this be the fault, I demaund what they are to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:27102:234"/>
be called, which comming to the Court armed, although they had no enemies in Armes, yet notwithstanding would not vnarme them selues at the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Kyng and Quéene: and which continew in the same boldnes and presumption still? But who is hée, which at the commaundement of the enemie will laye aside the sword which he hath drawne to fight? What doth the enemy els in commaunding me to vnarme my selfe, than to will me to commit my goods to the spoile, and my life to crueltie, and also to receiue the lawe at the handes of an outlawe? Is not that to breake the fence with the which God hath inclosed his Church: that being destitute of fence and inunition, men may fall in to the handes of their cruell and fierce enemies?

With what modesty haue I behaued my selfe in those Cities, which were in my handes? Was there euer any signe shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of violence, or vniust dealing? Whereas the enimies assaulting the Kings Cities, and taking away the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the Kings Edictes concerning Religion, did all things with barbarouse crueltie, in so much that they filled the streates of the Cities with deade bodies, and caused the earth to flowe with innocent bloud. Let men therefore iudge by the effectes, who they bee that are worthy to be counted gilty of Rebellion: Am I and my fellowes, which haue armed our selues to defende and mayntayne the Kings Lawes made by solemne acte of Parliament so to be counted: or our enemies? who put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselues in armoure without the Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, haue broken the Edictes; spoiled Cities, &amp; brought the Kings subiects to the slaughter: and taking awaye the Kinges Edictes, and specially that notable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Edict of Ianuary, haue made newe Edictes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues?</p>

And they are gilty of humane trea son, which contemne the Kings lawes, kéepe the Kinge as a captiue beset with armed men on euery syde, and which seeke the destruction of the King and the Realm. And to conclude, they are gilty of Treason, which haue encouraged and brought the whole Realme to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to oppresse the libertie of the Gospell, and which doe bind the Kinges subiectes vnto them in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice by an othe.</p>
                              <p>Those outragiouse kindes of wickednesse, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actes do crye that the <hi>Guises</hi> and his fellowes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles, seditiouse, and gilty both of Diuine and humane treason.

Of the which matter, beside the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I haue alleadged, this also may be a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, That they haue ouerthrowne the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of this Realme, and that in the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> whose helpe thei haue abused in this false and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciouse sentence of Rebellion.

this Senat which ought to be the place of Iustice, the refuge and Sanctuary of the oppressed, and the brydel &amp; punishment of vice is so declined from his right &amp; natu rall vse, that it looseth the raynes and openeth the gate to all Iniustice, violence, and to all vnbrideled wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And for probation hereof, I do not only bring in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manifold iniuries, which they haue done to diuers, the complaintes, the cryes, and the bloud of so many oppres sed, condemned, and slayne innocents by them: but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially I bring forth this false and peruerse iudgement, which thei haue denounced against vs: which is an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry done to a great number of men, whose lyfe &amp; actions haue alwaye testified the reuerent obedience which we wishe might be giuen to the King. But, to the end those vniust Iudges might leaue nothing vndone, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this sentence, the cause not heard, no matters discussed and the reasons of iustification not vnderstood: also they being refused, and the causes of the refusall or appeale being declared, yet neuerthelesse they persisted in their purpose: that all men might knowe how, that in the Senat of <hi>Paris</hi> there ar no other Iudges, but prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterouse opinions, corruptions, and hatreds: that there are no other lawes, than the contempt &amp; open violating of the Kings Lawes &amp; Edictes, and of his approued cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.

The waight of which thinges do so touch our mindes, that when we considered the horrible calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and destruction, which through murders, bloudshed, rapines, and such kinde of mischieues, is like to come vpon the whole realme if they go forward as they haue begon for the space of these fyue monethes, we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for the auoyding of such euilles to shunne no perill, and for the safetie of the Kinges subiects, and the tranquility of the Realme, to aduenture our liues, and loose our goodes. And as for that wicked and false iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rebellion we feare it not at all, but do account the same a false slaunder, impudently deuised and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by our aduersaries. And truly séeing we do oppose and set our selues against the same, we protest that we do not in any point withstand the Kinges will, nor the ordinance and decrée of the Parliment lawfully made: but the robbery, oppression, &amp; open violence, which our aduersaries shew against our liues and goodes.

And although for my part I haue refrayned vntill this day to séeke the helpe &amp; ayd of straungers: yet notwithstanding séeing my aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries haue begon to call straungers to assiste the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their euill cause, I protest that I will not let hereafter to vse their helpe, to defend my cause, because the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seruation of the king standeth thervpon. And because this warre, which dayly increaseth more &amp; more, cannot choose but bring great calamities with it. I and my fellowes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test before God and men, that we are not the causes of those calamities: but they which haue stirred vp &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed these garboiles, that is to say my enemies, that they may beare the blame of all the euills like to ensue.

warely prouided in their Testaments, that if they should disceace before their Sonnes were come to their perfect age to gouerne the Realme, then the States should prouide for the same gouernement. The which doth sufficiently declare that this kind of gouernement, doth in no poynt deminish the Kynges aucthoritie or power (whom whosoeuer resisteth, resisteth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of God,) but is rather necessary to preserue and defend them, so long as they are vnméete to take vppon them any such gouernement, through the defect and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitie of Nature.</p>
                  <p>But when the Kyng shall come to the age of foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene yeres, that vicary or substituted gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth cease, and all things do so retourne to the Kyng, that whatsoeuer he shall will or decrée, shall be ratified.</p>
                  <p>In the dayes of <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt, after he had raigned many yeres, and that it pleased GOD for the sinnes of the people, to depriue him of his witte and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and when the time came that the Realme must of necessitie be gouerned, there arose a certaine contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the Princes that were the Kyngs kinsmen, about the same gouernement. but this was neuer heard of that a forreyne Prince, would euer intrude him selfe into the gouernement of the Realme, and that, against the will, ordinance, and decrée of the States: as doth now the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> at the first, with force of armes, and afterwardes vnder the coullour and name of the Kyng of <hi>Nauar:</hi> corrupting and breaking all Lawes, constitutions, and customes, that by all meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he might satisfie his ambicious minde, and get the gouernement of the Realme into his handes.</p>
                  <p>And (say they) most renowmed <hi>Emperour,</hi> you must not thinke that he is moued to do these things for the loue he beareth to any Religion: but doth only make Religion a cleake, to fulfill his ambicious desire: but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:27102:241"/>
vnder this pretence, he hath drawne a great part of the people vnto him, whom he hath so stirred to outrage &amp; crueltie, promising that they shall escape vnpunished whatsoeuer they do, that now the mad and franticke people throughout the whole Realme of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but kill, spoyle, and shew al maner of violence. After the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and <hi>Fraunces</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Kynges of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> it was expedient according to the auncient vse of the lawes, that the States of <hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> should be called together, and that in the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber because <hi>Charles</hi> our Kyng was of tender yeres.<note place="margin">The true cause of the first warres.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the States, as it was méete, made certayne lawes and statutes, the which should only stand in force and strength duringe this time of the Kynges minority, according to the institution and maner of our elders.

                     <item>2 The second concerned those which should be of the Kyngs Counsell for that time.</item>

                     <item>4 The fourth concerned Religion, and the staying of such troubles as might ensue by occasion therof.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>As touching the first, vppon great causes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<note place="margin">The first.</note> wise, waighed and considered, the States or whole body of the Realme haue decréed that the Quéene the Kyngs mother, shal haue not only the charge and custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Kynges maiestie her sonne, but the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also of the Realme, in her owne person, and the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:27102:241"/>
same not to be put ouer to any other without her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, will, and pleasure. And this decrée of the States was confirmed and approued, by Princes the Kynges kinsmen.</p>
                  <p>Also the States decréed that the <hi>Queene Mother</hi> should be by them so directed, that she by her wise orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and disposing of thinges, should discharge the great debt which remained to be paied after the death of king <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Fraunces:</hi> and so the people to be disburthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from such great exactions and payments, as they had aforetime payed: And that she for her part should endeuour her selfe to bring all thinges to their former state and condition, and that the people might liue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in peace and tranquillitie.</p>
                  <p>The second principall poynt, was concerning the<note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> Kynges Counsaile: The which the States desired to haue furnished with men that were vertuous, wise, &amp; carefull for the Kyng and the Realme. Therfore they thought good that the Kynges Counsayle should consist, of such men, as were not sworne to any forreyne Prince or power: as Cardinalles, Bishoppes, Abbats, &amp; all such which they call Ecclesiasticall persons: both for that they ought to followe their ordinary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per office and calling: and also for the oth which they haue sworne and vowed to the Bishoppes of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning temporall obedience, which haue ben often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enemies to the Bishoppes of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therfore they prohibite and disalow any of them to be of the Kynges Counsayle: or that there shoulde come vnto that Counsell two bretherne or more toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the example of other Parliaments. Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding here thei except those which are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the Kyngs kinsmen; to whom it appertaineth without limitation of number, by right to bée of the Kyngs Counsayle, except the States haue any thing to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:27102:242"/>
obiect against them to the contrary. Also they forbid such to be of the Kyngs Counsaile as haue had the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, vse, and disposing of the Kyngs treasure, vntill such time as they haue made their accompts.</p>
                  <p>And last of all, bicause the Kinges Counsailers are bound, to make account to the King of their iuste and lawfull counsaile, and also to preserue and maintayne the Kinges treasure: and when the Kinges treasurie hath smal store of money in it, not to receiue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, or to suffer to be giuen to any, great and large gyftes: the states do appoint and determine, that all such giftes shalbe reuoked: and that so many as haue receyued such gyftes be constrained to restore them backe againe: and in the meane tyme not to be of the Kinges counsaile.</p>
                  <p>Upon this second point dependeth the occasion of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>uill warre and sedition, which at this day shaketh and violently assalteth the whole Realme of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> the <hi>Guises,</hi> the <hi>Constable,</hi> the <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Santandre,</hi> percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that they by thys meanes should not only be exclu ded out of the Kinges counsaile, but also be constrayned to restore those giftes againe which they haue receyued of the Kinges, &amp; thereby greatly in riched themselues. And so they haue ioyned themselues, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spired togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, specially to hinder and frustrate that decrée. It is no new thing, that giftes which Kings haue bestowed, contrary to the lawes appointed, should be nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, not only of the States, which are chiefe in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the tyme of the Kings nonage, but also of the ordinary Iudges of the exchecker, by whose indgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the Kinges afore tyme haue ben put to great expences in gyftes, contrary to the lawes of the realme. Of these thinges we haue many examples: as of the <hi>Constable Clisson</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Charles</hi> the vi. who was depryued of his office, because he had gayned by the seruyce of the King to the valew of sixtene thousand pound. But there
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:27102:242"/>
is greater and more vehement cause at this tyme, why they which are bound by the decrée of the states, should be called to giue an account of that which they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued: and seing that now there is found in the kinges Treasurie the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of 330000, poundes (which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer séene before) and yet the people at this present are more burthened with exactions and tributes, than euer they were before. And it is manifest that King <hi>Frauncis</hi> the first of that name, which had diuers warres for the space of thrée and thirty yeares, &amp; paied for his discharge a great summe of money, and toke not so great and so many tributes of the people, lefte notwithstanding in his treasury a greate masse of money. Therefore the states demaunde the cause of so great expence. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is likely that they were spenders and wasters, whose dutye it was to husband and increase the same: the States vppon verie good consideration do desier to haue an account, that restitution and allowance may be made of such vnmeasurable expences. The which truly is the verie cause why those thrée haue brought the Realme of <hi>Fraunce</hi> into these troubles, to ouerthrowe those decrées of the states: that the same may appeare most true which we saide before, namely, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, not for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sake, but for because they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetously and ambitiously minded, which Religion not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they take for a cloake, to couer and hyde their wickednesse withall</p>
                  <p>The third principall point of their costitutions is<note place="margin">The third</note> this: The States would haue it in their power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie during the tyme of the Kinges minoritie, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and appoint warres: and at their pleasure to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the subiectes to arme themselues. Because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take warres in hand, they should vnderstand the causes thereof, and by what meanes they might be appeased. Therfore also they would haue this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:27102:243"/>
that they which haue prouoked the people to Ciuyll warre, might be made knowne to be the authoures of all the calamities and detrements which come by these warres.</p>
                  <p>The fourth principal point is that which concerneth<note place="margin">The fourth</note> Religion: by which the states haue decréed that there must be a difference made betwene the cause of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the cause of sedition: in so much that for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sake no man ought to be condemned as a seditiouse person aud a Rebell. Therefore they thinke it lawfull for the kings subiects to haue liberty to take which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the ilist, that is to say, eyther the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Romish Religion, or els the Religion reformed according to the Gospell, and to cleaue to none other: and that all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, eyther pryuate or publique, against eyther parte, ought to be prohibited: and that the Ciuill magistrates should prouide Temples for the ministers of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion to haue their diuine seruice in: and that no man should receiue any maner of viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or harme, for vsing the benefit hereof. But because those constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions manifestly touched the <hi>Guises,</hi> the <hi>Constable,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Saint Andre:</hi> the <hi>Guises,</hi> for that there were two Cardinals of them which were chosen to be of the Kings Counsaile, also the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Aumal:</hi> also because the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Lorraine</hi> his Brother, were the Kinges treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: And they touched the <hi>Constable</hi> and the <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Saint Andrew,</hi> because they by the same meanes, were come to great aboundance and wealth. For these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they haue sought by all meanes possible, to adnihil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and disanull these Lawes.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, the Quéene the Kings Mother, as she hath ben alwaies in al her doinges wyse and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspecte (the which she declared when she had full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and was not Ruled by other mens power and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence)

indeuoured her selfe to make an vnity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord betweene the Churches by frendly and quyet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                  <p>To the which Conference and Disputacion came all the chiefe Prelates of <hi>France,</hi> and many Doctors out of the vniuersitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> many Moonkes also which were sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrer</hi> the Popes Legate: and beside all these, twelue Ministers of the Gospell: both partes hoping it would come to passe by this friendly conference, that they should come to some concord and agréement. The which was greatly hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and let by the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> by whom, after certaine principall pointes of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of <hi>Ausburge</hi> were disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blingly imbraced, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Assembly was dissolued. Then the <hi>Guises</hi> tooke other practises in hande, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the Quéene and the King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> to sende for the Iudges and Counsellers of all the Parliamentes of the Realme; that they with the Princes and the Kinges Counsaile might giue their aduice for the present neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie: And to this Counsaill they sent suche as they had bound vnto them afore time by one benefite or other: that by this meanes they might abolishe that which the States had decréed. The which notwithstanding by the prouidence of God, fell out otherwyse than they looked for. And to the end they might the more craftely bring their purpose to passe, they departed from the Court.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But before they should go, to the ende they might leaue nothing vndone that might serue to worke their wills, they subtilly practised to carry with them the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> our Kings brother, that if their deuises had not had good successe, they might haue had one with them of the Kings linage whose name they might abuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This thing was plainly proued by diuers arguments, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Afterward the <hi>Guises</hi> departed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Court, but also to the vtmost partes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites of the Realm, and came to <hi>Sauern.</hi> And there they fayned to like of the Confession made at <hi>Ausburge</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one of the Princes of the Empire, that by theis meanes they might insinuate themselues into the num ber of the Princes of the Empire, the which as known to your highnesse, we touch by the way.

                  <p>About this time there was an assembly of Iudges and Counsellers, which sate in the Court that belongeth to<note place="margin">These things are touched before.</note> the Princes and to the Kings priuy Counsaill: amonge whom was the <hi>Constable,</hi> and the <hi>Mashall of S.

The Bourgeses or cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen men for the states, declared that there was nothing in those things which the States had decréed to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but must stand wholy vpon their determination &amp; liking: and they sayd that before they began with any other matter, they must séeke to purge and to reforme the Kings Counsaill.

And thus of their owne priuate authority they put them selues in Armes, to mayntaine their ambition and couetousnes, which notwithstandinge
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:27102:245"/>
they couer with the cloake of Religion: they came to the Kyng and Quéene with an Army of men, and made them subiect to their power, and tooke vppon them the gouernement: subtillie foreséeing that there was no better way to make the people to take their part, than vnder the pretence of Religion and the name of the Kyng: &amp; so to abolish the Lawes and constitutions of the States, and the Edict it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Therfore from that time forward, hauing gotten <hi>Paris</hi> into their hand, and brought the Kyng captiue thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they left no kind of mortall crueltie vnshewed, no one corner of the Realme was frée from the Ciuill warres which they had stirred vp: insomuch that the lamentable remembraunce of things past, and of the great destruction like to come, would make a man to tremble. Nothwithstanding the Quéene being certified of these thinges, was very carefull to let and stay their purpose, and to frustrate their deuises: sent for the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to come to <hi>Monceaulx:</hi> and prayed him to resist the violent force and crueltie of these men by force of Armes: and for this cause she appoynted him to be Captaine generall, and named certaine men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whose helpe and furtherance he might vse.</p>
                  <p>But the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> delaying the matter for feare of tumults and vproares, was preuented with the expedition and hast of his enemies: who had so got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Kyng and Quéene into their handes, that they abused their willes at their owne pleasure: deludinge and abusing also the facillitie and sufferance of the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> they séeke thereby coullers to hide their tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranie.</p>
                  <p>The which sufferaunce notwithstanding of the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> although his full consent were ioyned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as it ought not by any meanes to restraine or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the king of his libertie, euen so it can be of no force
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:27102:246"/>
to excuse the vnbrideled ambition and presumption of the <hi>Guises.</hi> For in giuing authority the simple and bare ratefying is not sufficient, but the ciuill lawes do shew that it is néedefull to haue expresse commaundement.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore the Kyng of <hi>Nanar</hi> hath not this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to rule and gouerne the Realme, without the Quéene: and neither of them haue any such authoritie that they can set ouer the same to any other without the consent of the States.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer as touching the tractation of warre and artillerie, the Quéene her selfe during the time of the Kynges nonage, can do nothing, as of her owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: séeing this thing pertayneth to the States: who notwithstanding haue not decréed and appoynted this warre, but the <hi>Guises,</hi> which haue caused the same to be in euery corner of the Realme. Is there any man in the whole Realme that can or ought to take vnto him such power and authoritie, as to gather Armies of men and to moue warre to the detrement and hurt of the Kyng and the Realme, as the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> now doth? And this is the seruice that the <hi>Triumuiri,</hi> namely the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the <hi>Marshiall of Saint Andrew,</hi> and the <hi>Constable</hi> do to the Kyng their soueraigne Lord, in this his tender age, in the which he is subiect to many iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: that is to say, their wicked actes, by which they go about to ouerthrowe the Kyng with the kingdome. Which are the causes <hi>(O Emperour)</hi> that we put our selues in Armour, and haue chosen the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to be our Captaine: who shewed him selfe willinger to take so notable a matter in hand, being moued the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by no lesse good will toward the King and the realme than we were.</p>
                  <p>The Quéene also her selfe both perswaded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to take this warre in hand, to deliuer her from that iniury which both she and the king sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:

as appeareth by her expresse wordes in letters to be séene, the Coppies wherof we haue sent vnto thée <hi>(O Emperour.)</hi> Notwithstanding al this, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> which was the last which put himself in armes, and that at the commaundement of the Quéene, neuer ceased to séeke peace and concord, offering all indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and reasonable conditions that might be, as, That hée would put of his Armour, depart from the Court, and would go also, if néede were, out of the Realme, so that his aduersaries would do the like, and that the Edict of Ianuary might be obserued.</p>
                  <p>Also he prayed and doth pray and beséeth by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, al Christian Princes that are in League and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with <hi>Fraunce,</hi> to be meanes for the making of peace and concord: and with them all Noble Princes of the Empire, whose godly and commendable indeuours for peace and concord were notwithstanding hindered by the <hi>Guises:</hi> who in the meane time sought by al meanes possible to be ayded by straungers.</p>
                  <p>And it is manifest that the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> hath sought so many waies to establish peace and concord, as they haue sought by all meanes possible to hinder the same: as may appeare by the last Parley betwene the Quéen &amp; the prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> at <hi>Baugence,</hi> they séeking by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to circumuent the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>

                  <p>The enemie being ware of their comming, rushed out of their tentes to méete them with all spéede: and thus the battaile began to waxe hot on both parts, the men of <hi>Montpellier</hi> fighting with such a courage, that they constrayned the proude enemy to retire and flée backe euen to their tents: from whence they dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging certaine great péeces, but in vaine, the faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned safe into the Citie againe, with losse of two of their men only, whereas on the other part there were slayne 100.</p>
                  <p>For this good beginning, and happie successe, the faithfull caused publique and sollemne thanks to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto God: the which being done they prouided di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently for the safetie and fortefying of the Citie: and at the commaundement of <hi>Monsuer Bellodine,</hi> the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbes, in the which there were certaine great Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and great stoore of houses, were with the diligent labour of the people throwne downe. And after this there were certaine Skirmishes dayly betwéene both partes, the Protestantes most commonly hauinge the victory: Insomuch that <hi>Monsuer Ioyse</hi> was discouraged from befieging the Citie, before he had more helpe and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:27102:250"/>
aide from his fellowes: Notwithstanding because hée would not in the meane while spend the time in vaine, he intended to assault a Castell which is in the Ile of <hi>Maguelon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For in that part, bordering vppon the Sea coast, there is a certaine Fen or Marshe, which the Sea at certaine times ouerfloweth, being of a great compasse both in length and breath, in the which also there is a certaine Ileland lying out in length almost thrée miles: and vppon this Ileland there standeth a Castell both of great antiquitie, and also of sufficient force, the which at that time the faithfull held. Therfore <hi>Monsuer Ioyse</hi> tooke shipping and in his shippes great store of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, with the which hee so battered the Castell, that the kéepers thereof for want of helpe yéelded, and deliuered the same into his handes.</p>
                  <p>The men of <hi>Montpellier</hi> in the meane time not know ing of the yéelding vp of <hi>Maguelon</hi> intended to go with all the power they were able to make out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie, &amp; to set vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their enemies camp being busied in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> besieging of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Castell. Therfore they went out of the Citie to the number of eight hundered horsemen, and twelue En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of footemen, leauing behind them a Garrison to kéepe the Citie, carying with them also certaine fielde péeces. And they had not gone farre, but they met with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Campe of <hi>Monsure Ioyse,</hi> whether hee was retourned with al his men from the siege of <hi>Maguelon,</hi> and al that day was spent betwéene them only with discharginge shot one at another, <hi>Monsuer Ioyse</hi> woondering at the boldnes and courage of the men of <hi>Montpellier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And while he was in a certaine Manner Place, or ferme, sitting at supper with certaine of his Captains, and talking of the helpe and aide which he looked for, at which time they assured them selues of the victory, it came to passe that a certaine pellet which came out of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:27102:251"/>
the shot of the Protestants, fell vppon the toppe of the house in the which he sate, and shaking the house, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed the whole table at the which he supt with dust, &amp; made their eares to ring with the cracke and rashing rent of the house. Then all of them began to feare and tremble, doubting least the house would fall vppon their heades. Then <hi>Petrus Lapas</hi> that spanish théese, of whom we spake before, being merily disposed, cried to <hi>Monsuer Joyse in the Spanish tongue,</hi> saying: <hi>Behold Mon sure Ioyse the keyes, which Montpellier offereth vnto thee:</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding hereby his security. The same day being the xiii. day of September, <hi>Baron des Adretz</hi> came out of <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheny</hi> with eight hundred well appoynted horsemen, to the Protestants Campe of <hi>Montpellier:</hi> by the rumor of whose comming, <hi>Monsure Ioyse</hi> and the rest of his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, were not onely greatly afeard, but also much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the delay of their fellowes. Then <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure des Adretz,</hi> when he had found out the situation of their Campe, minded to besiege them.</p>
                  <p>First therfore he got betwéene them and the Marsh or fenne, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did so beset or inclose them on euery side round about with men and ordinance, that they could by no meanes escape, nor yet by any way attaine to ayy vittailes. And the mindes of the Papistes, which had conceiued that the Protestants were many mo in num ber than they were, (as they were in déede) were so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and amazed, that they durst by no meanes set vppon their enemies, nor yet aduenture any waye to escape.</p>
                  <p>But now when the souldiers of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> were throughly incouraged by the aide of <hi>Adretz</hi> to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and that their enemies on the other part were quight discouraged, behold <hi>Baron de Adretz</hi> tolde the Captaines that he must néedes depart from thence that night, for so woord was brought vnto him from <hi>Lions.</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:27102:251"/>
And entering into the Citie of <hi>Montpellier</hi> by the break of the day, he commaunded the Aldermen of the towne to giue vnto him 15000. <hi>Frankes.</hi> Who for feare of force<note place="margin">A Franke is a peece of French coyne in value ij. s. ij. d. q.</note> and sedition gaue vnto him so much money: after the receipt wherof he departed out of the Citie: minding no doubt to play the false <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Apostata,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward came to passe.</p>
                  <p>Thus the siege being broken vp, word was brought to <hi>Montpellier</hi> that <hi>Monsure Sommeriue, and Monsure de Suze,</hi> were come with a great Armie, and that they went about to make a Bridge to come ouer the Riuer called the <hi>Rosne,</hi> and that on the other part the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men of <hi>Auuergnoys</hi> came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teritory of <hi>Seuenas,</hi> vnder the charge and conduct of the <hi>Graun Prier.</hi> Word hereof also came to the Campe of <hi>Monsure Joyse,</hi> who when<note place="margin">This great Prier was brother to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine.</note> they vnderstoode that they were deliuered from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, of the siege and that there had happened so soden a change they were excéedingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted and reuiued, as commonly it happeneth to men that haue escaped great daunger.</p>
                  <p>This rumour therfore dayly increasing more and more, the men of <hi>Montpellier</hi> sawe that it was necessa ry for them to learne and know, both what power the enemie of <hi>Fraunce</hi> had, because he was nere and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and also how farre &amp; which way he minded to go, &amp; whether there were any way to stop him. Therfore by the common aduise of the Captaines, <hi>Monsure Grill, Monsure Bari, Monsure Bulargues,</hi> men very expert in the warre, went to <hi>Nisines</hi> the twentie day of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with fiue hundred horsemen, and thrée hundred foote men, leauing the rest of their army behind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kéepe the Citie: Who in the meane time suffered not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, which lay néere the citie to be in quiet, comming out oftentimes euen to their Camp, and skirmishings with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:27102:252"/>Now <hi>Monsieur Bulargues</hi> being a man expert and payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in warlike affaires, was put in trust to vewe the Town of <hi>Sangiles,</hi> whether the enemie minded to come, and to sée whether the Towne were sufficiently forte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to defende it selfe, and what garrison it had: who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thyther, saw that the Citie was indifferently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefied: and was certefied by the inhabitants of <hi>Sangiles,</hi> that they had ben summoned by the enemie to yéelde vp the citie: and while <hi>monsieur Bulargues</hi> was there, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie summoned them agayn with the same comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, saying that <hi>monsieur Sommeriue</hi> and <hi>monsieur de Suze,</hi> required them to yéeld vp vnto them forthwith the citie, vnlesse they would suffer and abyde all manner of extremity and cruelty, if the same were wonne by force of battery. So <hi>monsieur Burlargues</hi> leauing twenty of his men at <hi>Sangiles,</hi> they scarse hauing in their own gar rison in the towne so many more good &amp; able souldiers and incouraging the townsmen with promise that out of hand they should haue more ayde, he returned to <hi>Nis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes:</hi> &amp; conferring with his fellowes, he had charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him to conduct to the Towne of <hi>Sangilles</hi> two hundred Gonners. And <hi>monsieur Grill</hi> and <hi>Bars</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that they would follow with the reste of the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and horsemen.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time word was brought to <hi>Sangiles,</hi> that the enemie was come with a great army, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning six thousand footemen, and eight hundred horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing with them also thrée great Canons, &amp; that they intended to make a bridge ouer the riuer called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Then the enemies began to batter the walles with their great Canons, and to set ladders to the walles to scale them. They of the towne
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:27102:252"/>
séeing this, called vpon their Captaines to make al spéed to defende them: for they were gréeued at the proude wordes of the papistes which bragged as if they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wonne the towne. And oftentimes the souldiers of <hi>monsieur Sommeriue</hi> would crye out to the townes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saying: <hi>Say vnto thy God, Judge me O God:</hi> for that psalm was made a common ryme. Therefore <hi>monsieur Bular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> remoued in the night to goe from <hi>Nismes</hi> with hys two hundred gonners, and troupe of horsemen, which we sayd were appointed to ayde those of <hi>Sangilles:</hi> hys fellowes followed after, notwithstanding with not so much spéede: and thereupon hée sent vnto them to make more haste from <hi>Estegell,</hi> where they taried their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
                  <p>In the way to <hi>Nismes</hi> from <hi>Sangiles,</hi> there aryseth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at the first a little hil, which lying out in length, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an euen playne, and then assendeth agayn with an other hill betwéene both which hilles there are certaine small valleyes: and then againe that playne or leuell (at the entrie whereof the towne of <hi>Sangiles</hi> is situate) is bounded with the Riuer of <hi>Rosne</hi> for the space of fower and twenty furlonges, and so extendeth it selfe to the Castle called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  <p>By this meanes following, there was a bridge made by <hi>monsieur Sommeriue</hi> and his men. First they tooke cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

Shippes, and tyed them syde to syde with ropes crosse the Riuer, vpon which then they layed bourdes &amp; plankes, and so the whole armie of <hi>monsieur Sommeriue</hi> went ouer to the other shoare of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> For the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer called the <hi>Rosne,</hi> diuidteh <hi>Prouance</hi> and <hi>Languedoc</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder. <hi>Monsieur Bulargues</hi> therefore looking for his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours at <hi>Estegel,</hi> there came ryding out of the armie of <hi>monsieur Sommeriue</hi> ten horsemen, not ware of <hi>monsieur Bulargues,</hi> at whose commaundement eight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were presentlye hemde in: the other twoo, with great feare fled backe agayne to the armie, and made report that a great number of their enemies lay hid in the valleyes besyde <hi>Estegell.</hi> Therefore <hi>monsieur Sommeriue</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the horsemen to set themselues in aray, and euery one to marche from thence, and the footemen to arme themselues with spéede. Then <hi>monsieur Bulargues</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing placed certaine scoutes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of the hill which lay betwéene them and their enemies (for from thence they might easely behold the whole armie vppon the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell) was by them tolde that the horsemen of <hi>monsieur Sommeriue,</hi> were comming towardes them in battayle aray. Here <hi>monsieur Bulargues,</hi> being like to be ouercom easely by the greater number of his enemies, deuised a way out of hand, and brought all his souldiers out of the valleyes and set them vpon the top of the hill to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater shew to terrifie his enemies. Whose pollitique deuise had good successe: for so soone as the enemie sawe them vppon the top of the hill, they suspected that it was a trayne made to beguile them: imagining also, that so small a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber durst not come so nighe, except they were sure of more ayde, and that therefore they shewed them selues, because they would allure them forwarde vntill they had gotten the aduantage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, and then with a great number to ioyne battayle with them. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they stayed euen right ouer against them, and so keeping a

while their battaile aray, they retourned backe agayne to their campe.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time some were sent againe to accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and hasten the comming of <hi>Monsure Grill, and Bari,</hi> who at the last came with the rest of the Army: which being ioynd with those that were before with <hi>Monsure Bulargues,</hi> made the whole Army to be in number one thousand, fiue hundred of them horsemen, and the other fiue hundred being footemen: and for the space of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine howers they abode there still in battayle aray in the sight of the Army of <hi>Monsure Sommeriue:</hi> which Army when <hi>Monsure Bulargues</hi> perceyued to be quiet, they came to the towne of <hi>Sangiles,</hi> that as it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, they might both aid the Citie and also retourne out of hand to <hi>Nismes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therfore <hi>Monsure Bulargues</hi> leauing his fellowes hard by the towne, sent into the towne two hundred goonners, and shortly exhorted them and the souldiers that were in the towne to play the men, promising vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that he would not be long from them. And then going out of the Citie he perceyued that the enemy had raysed their siege, &amp; therfore he ran in hast to sée which waye they were gon. And he sawe the Army going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the <hi>Rosne,</hi> as though they fled away. Then hée ran and told this thing ioyfully to his fellowes, that thei might sée the discomfited enemy fléeing away: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sayde that they must not neglecte this occasion which God had offered them: for God fighteth for his: be therfore saith he of good courage, and let vs pursue the enemy. And thus talking a while with his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, many of them because they were a few in number refused so to do, (for he had with him only a hundred &amp; <note place="margin">A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full victory gotten by Monsieur Bulargues.</note> twentie horsemen.) Then he sayd, <hi>Let him that loueth me followe me:</hi> And so setting spoures to his horse, he and so many as were with him pursued after the enemie,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:27102:254"/>
vntill he came within thrée hundred paces of them: at the sight wherof the horsemen of <hi>Monsure Sommeriue</hi> fled by and by before the footemen, which were appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to kepe the ordinance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monsure Bulargues</hi> making no stay put forth his horse and began to skirmish: and after the discharging of two small péeces, the horsemen of <hi>Monsure Sommeriue,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their great ordinance, tourned their backes, and brake through the raye of the footemen, &amp; so the whole Army began to flée. Then <hi>Monsure Bulargues</hi> with the rest of his fellowes began to crie, <hi>The victory,</hi> and killed whom soeuer they met, though they made no resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and so they made a great slaughter.

                  <p>Notwithstanding they which came last delaying the time, because they beléeued not the same to be true which <hi>Monsure Bulargues</hi> told them, many horsemen of <hi>Monsure Sommeriue,</hi> which were on the other part of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Army, and had the better horses, escaped by flight ouer the Bridge and among these were <hi>monsure Sommeriue,</hi> and <hi>monsure de Suze,</hi> who breaking the Bridge for feare least their enemies should followe after them, caused a great number the more of their men to be slayne: Ther fore the scattered souldiers, ran vp and downe, to and fro, séeking how to escape, but found no way.

of the people of GOD were slayne, of which the greatest part of that Army did consist.

herein: beside the mutuall and fréendly communication also which I had w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same Quéen of <hi>Scots.</hi> But amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g these deliberations, and communications concerning peace, beside the lacke which I had of the fruite of peace.

                  <p>At the beginning, when I knew well enough, if these troubles should prenaile, it would not only come to passe amidest the Ciuill dissentions, that the kyngdome of <hi>Fraunce</hi> should come into great perill of destruction as now it is: but also that other Christian Realmes, &amp; especially my owne Realme should fall into the same perill, both for the néerenes of the places, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the authors of those troubles are my enemies: I vsed all meanes that I could, both by Letters &amp; also by Ambassages, that there might some wayes be taken for peace and concord betwéene both partes. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one part refused the same; and bursted forth into open violence and mortall warre, yet I ceased not from my purpose and good intent.</p>
                  <p>But when I sawe, that the desire of crueltie dayly more and more enereased, and that euery where bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, &amp; butcherly murther was committed: and (which was most perillons) that the young Kyng and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were sodenly besieged, and came into their handes without aide and succour, and that he was so forced by them, that he would suffer his authoritie to be abused, to the murthering of his poore and innocent people, to the besieging and spoyling of his Noble Cities, to the breaking of good and wholesome Edictes, to the iniury
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:27102:260"/>
of the Kynges kinsmen and Nobles, and to the ruine &amp; destruction of the Kynges faithfull seruants, beside an infinite number of wickednesses mo: and all, to satisfie their willes and mindes, which determined to breake the Kynges Edictes, without punnishment: which Edictes were made by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> States of the Realme, for the preseruation of peace and tranquillitie, and for the safetie of the Kyngs Maiestie: When also I perceiued that they went about and had already put in practise to ouerthrowe and destroye the Religion, and the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors and followers of the same: I thought it good and most necessary for these causes, to prouide out of hand a more effectuall and forceable remedy, that the authors of these troubles, might at the last he constrayned, to come to peace and concord, vppon reasonable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: least the whole Kyngdome of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> through the vnbrideled and outragious willes of a fewe, should bée brought into so great perill.</p>
                  <p>And for these causes I sent some of my Counsayle Ambassadours into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> wise, graue, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensed men, and addicted to neyther part: that in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of these matters, there might bee a remedy found out, whereby their Kyng and soueraigne Lorde might be obeyed, and the peace and tranquillitie of the Realme mayntayned. Notwithstanding this my labor and good indeuour, was not thankfully taken, neyther could I haue any answere fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the yong Kyng, nor from his Mother the Quéene, being made a feard by that part which was the cause of all these troubles.</p>
                  <p>Whilest therfore I was carefully busied about these thinges, and had no other care than for the profite of the Kyng, my welbeloued brother, without condemning of either part: I was other wise delt withall than I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for. Wherby appeared that their will and minde was, which so often times denied the bearing of those
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:27102:260"/>
things, which were propounded by me and mine at my commaundement, for peace and concordes sake. For al my Marchaunts of <hi>London</hi> and of other partes of my Realme, which came into certaine places of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> only about their Marchandize, and were preparing to retourne home againe, were taken, and robbed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoyled of all their goodes: and they which sought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them selues, were cxuelly slayne, their shippes &amp; Marchandize taken, by the Magistratrs of those places whereunto they arriued: and that for no other cause, but for that they were reported to be <hi>Huguenotes</hi> By the which woord, although it séemed strange to those poore Marchaunts and Marriners, who knew not what it ment, it sufficiently appeared from whom they recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued commaundement to doe these thinges, and what they would do more, if time and occasion would suffer. This was no small rapine or light spoyle, but of great waight: it was not done sodenly or marage, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common Magistrate, vpon the commaundement of the Gouernour of those partes, and that by great contenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with my subiectes. The matter being complayned of to those that should haue reformed the same, nothing was done: but to make a mendes, one of my messengers comming homwards with letters of my Ambassadour was robbed: the which also escaped vnpunished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther examination. Wherby I perceiue, that the Kyng, or Quéene his Mother, or rather the Kyng of <hi>Nauar,</hi> do rather want authoritie than good will. And certainely it is manifest both by this and by an infinite sort of other arguments, in what state and condition y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> young Kyng standeth: when as he maye not preserue his people and houshold, establish his lawes and Edicts, nor giue no iust answere to other Princes and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. By which, and by other wicked deuises, practised against me and my Realme, it appeareth to all men of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:27102:261"/>
sound iudgement, how greatly that violence, (which is now vsed in <hi>Fraunce</hi> by the <hi>Guises</hi> and his fellowes) doth toutch not only <hi>Fraunce,</hi> but also mée, and my whole Realme, more than any other Prince.</p>
                  <p>Therfore, forsomuch as the dignity and authoritie of the Kyng and the Queene his Mother, &amp; of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers louers of peace, cannot at this time so much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, as to haue abillitie and leaue to rule and gouern, or to do any thing els appertaining either to their own people, or to other Nations, or to their owne proper persons: séeing also the Kynges tender age, and the Quéene his Mother are so circumuented and snared, that they must condescend and agrée to whatsoeuer the <hi>Guises</hi> will haue them: as may testifie those great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and manifold calamities, which the authors of these troubles haue brought, in besieging, assaulting, and sacking the Kynges Cities and Townes, and in shedding the innocent bloud of his subiects: also, séeing they haue caused ciuill warre that they might abolish and extinguish in euery place the reformed Religion, &amp; do séeke to make mortall warre in euery part of the whole world: furthermore séeing they are the authors and fautors of these pitifull and lamentable troubles &amp; are noted so to be of all men, who, if they might haue time and oportunitie, would séeke by all meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to violate and diminish the state and dignitie of my Realme: and to conclude, séeing of late also they haue openly gone about to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend with me by force of armes, (but by the grace and goodnes of God were disapoynted of their purpose) and do yet diligently séeke the same, &amp; also to aduaunce them selues to my inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie: shall I suffer and beare with those sworne and mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to peace and concord? Shall I suffer the bloud of my neighbours to be cruelly shed, if by any maner of meanes I might let the same? Shall I suffer the young

Kyng my welbeloued brother, to bee besieged and in great perill, and not to be counted vnthankful and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse? Shall I as vnwise and negligent haue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration or regard to my mortal enemies, and to their practise. Therfore for these iust, euident and necessary causes of the Kynges subiects, requiring my helpe and aide in these tempestes and calamities: I commaunded many of my subiectes, to be armed both by Sea and land, to deliuer the subiectes of my welbeloued brother the Kyng of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> from tirrany, Rapine, murther, and destruction: and to kéepe certaine Cities, bordering vpon the sea coast and more néere vnto vs, in saftie from those enemies, least the peace made betwéene me and my brother the Kyng being broken, they might the more easely warre against my Realme.</p>
                  <p>To prouide for the which thinges tyme calleth vpon me. For I haue the testimony of a good conscience, and do protest that I in these thinges do vse such sinceritye and integrity, that I séeke and iusue christian peace, as I ought: and I doubt not, but that the protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of innocent bloud is acceptable vnto God: &amp; wilbe taken in verye good parte, of my wel beloued Brother, when he shall come vnto that age, that he shall be able with equity to Iudge of these matters. It wil serue also for the lawful protection and preseruation of me and of my people.</p>
                  <p>And to be short, by the great goodnes of God, it shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be an occasion of more firme and sure peace, betwéene me and my well beloued Brother the King of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> that eyther of vs may peaceably vse our libertys. And this one thing also I most earnestly say and affirme, to my beloued Brother the King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> to the Quene his mother, to the King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and to all his faithfull Counsaylers and seruantes. That I, whatsoeuer any mallicious person hereafter shall report, will deale in

After that I shewed the diuers Counselles and secret deliberations had, they couering their conspiracies with the cloake of Religion, and how they began to arme them selues by their owne prinate authoritie, contrary to the expresse commaundements of the Quéene, and the Decrée of the States, breaking the common peace: how they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Quéenes authoritie, &amp; the decree of the States, by which they were commaunded to goe home to their owne houses, came with an army ofmen and tooke the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:27102:265"/>
King and Quéene into their handes perforce, with so much grief to the King, that hée declared the same with teares openly. I haue also declared, and will euer eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare that I haue for iust and necessary causes, and by the expresse commaundements of the Quéen her selfe, (as may appeare by letters sealed with her owne hand) armed my selfe: and haue ben nominated and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by her to take vpon me the defence of this cause: as can testifie <hi>Monsure Jarnac, Monsure Soubize,</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And as for me, if I should not take the sword in hand, the King and Quéenes Maiesties, and the Realme cannot choose but be ruled by the wills of the aduersaries, whom experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath shewed of late to be the tyraunts of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> And now, although I haue the testimonie of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science towardes God and the Quéen, who hath power and authoritie to gouerne the Realme: and although I haue already declared all my actions and the trueth of my cause, by diuers writings: yet neuerthelesse, because my aduersaries, according to their wonted wicked cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, do send abroad into forreyne nations many false reportes and sclaunders in writing, impudently burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mée with false lyes, making mée the authour and cause of all these troubles. I which desire to haue a good name and report among all Christian Princes &amp; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and among the Kinges faythfull subiectes, &amp; which desire to kéepe my honor and dignity: thought good, after many other to publishe this writing also.</p>
                              <p>To the ende all men may vnderstand, how carefully euen vntill this present daye, I haue laboured &amp; sought by al meanes possible to mitigat and pacefie those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:27102:265"/>
raysed by their wickednesse: not onely because I know what great destruction will come thereby, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so because I haue a singular care and desire, both to sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Kings authoritie and dignitie, the safetie and preseruation of the Kings faithfull subiectes, the liberty of their consciences, and also the peace and tranquillitie of this Realme, in the which I was borne. And I am fully perswaded, that the only demonstration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which I haue done and will doe, shall proue those my aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, lyers and sclaunderers, &amp; shall bring to passe, that neuer hereafter any indifferent man shall giue credit to the like. First of all, euery man may behold and see, how I alone in the beginning of this our Kings raigne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured peace and tranquillitie, and sought to put away al occasions of seditions and troubles: for the which cause, I had much ill will and displeasure in the dayes of King<note place="margin">Of this me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cion was made in the second booke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries</note> 
                                 <hi>Fraunces. II.</hi> but I haue forgiuen that iniury. Since that time hitherto, those enemies of God, the King, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike peace, were offended with the decrées of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> States, and with the forme of Gouernement, which they then perceyued to be contrary to their ambition: when as they had determined to peruerte all things, &amp; to enlarge their power and tyranny: to the which end and purpose they conspired with straungers: the which conspiracye is more perniciouse and detestable, than was the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie of the <hi>Triumuiri</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as now appeareth by the lamentable effects thereof: but I, on the contrary part, to quench that burning fyrebrand of troubles, haue left nothing vndone that I could doo. Neyther dyd I regarde the goodnesse of my cause, nor the wickednesse of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries cause (when as they armed them selues of their owne priuate authoritie, to ouerthrow the Edicte made by the consent and aduise of the States) neyther did I so estéeme of my place and dignitie, that I woulde put my selfe in armour, without the expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:27102:266"/>
of the Quéen: yet in the beginning I of my own accorde offered to vnarme my selfe agayne, so that my enemies would doe the same, and that the Edicte so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly made by the Decrée of the States, might be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly kept: as may appeare by my writinge concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter. The which conditions seemed to all men very indifferent and reasonable, sauinge to them selues. Furthermore, to the ende we might the better and more safely enter into peace and concord, I sought diligently that many Christian Princes might be admo nished of this matter, and I entreated them by letters and by Ambassadours that they would be meanes to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cefie the same, and to take away all occasions of greater dissentions.</p>
                              <p>But my aduersaries euen at the same time, when al things might haue ben brought to some quietnesse, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about to take away all hope of concord, and sought for the nonce to exasperat and prouoke our mindes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure by new cruelties shewed vpon our bretheren: making more carefull prouision to warre against mée and myne, than doth the forreyn enemie, when hée in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadeth the boundes and limites of the Realme. Beside this they suffered not the Ambassadours of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> which were now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming forwarde in their iourney, to doe their office about the pacification: but sought to procure the <hi>Italian,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Switzer</hi> to ayde them in their warre: and because a certaine No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of <hi>Fraunce</hi> called <hi>Gonor,</hi> did disallowe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of forreyne power into the Realme, they abused him with iniuriouse wordes openly among the Kinges counsaill. Whereby it may appeare to all indifferent men of sound iudgement, what I and my aduersaries haue sought for: and whether I could in this time of the Kings minoritie, deuise more profitable meanes and wayes, to auoid these gréeuouse troubles: and also whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:27102:266"/>
they can doe more than they haue done, to increase the same. For they haue gone about to bring in newe, harde, and violent lawes, playne contrary to the Kings Edicte, made by the consent of the whole Realme, and agréeing with the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> which is the ruyne and ouerthrow of peace and tranquillitie: that thereby they might not onely bring in an infinite heape of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but also the confusion of all things. The which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so I my selfe by publishing a writing contrarye to the same, shewed how much it was disagréeing from al rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and indifferency. But what soeuer I could shew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Quéene, they had her in such bondage and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, by force and subtiltie, that they made her an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument and meane to doe what soeuer they woulde themselues. Notwithstanding shée perceyuinge what great inconuenience would come by warre thought, she might do much good if she could bring the matter to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. Therefore, the Quéene, my brother the Kinge of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and I met togither in the midway betwene <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and <hi>Orleans.</hi> Then I made declaration vnto them of two things, which I sayd were the causes of troubles, the which causes being taken away, the effectes, that is to say, great troubles shall with them be remoued also.</p>
                              <p>To take away the causes, I sayd, the first was: That the <hi>Guise, the Constable, and the Marshal of Santandre,</hi> who had broken the peace by arming of them selues by their owne priuate authoritie, and had forceably dealt with the Kyng and Quéene, and also had broken the kyngs Edict of January, might go home to their owne houses and might be forbidden to be of the Kynges Counsell,<note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Prince of Conde, at the first par ley.</note> during this time of his minoritie: And I my selfe, though I were of the Kyngs bloud, and of much higher degrée than they, promised to do the like.</p>
                              <p>The second was, I sayd, that the Edict of January might be fully obserued, and that according to the tenor
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:27102:267"/>
therof, the vse of Religion might bee frée for all men throughout the whole Realme. To these two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither the Quéene nor my brother would agrée. Affirminge that it was not lawfull for those being the Kynges ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, to depart from the young King being in such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie as he was: the request, they said, was neither indifferent nor profitable for the Realme.</p>
                              <p>Moreouer they sayd there could not be two Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons together in one Realme, and therfore the Edict of January could not bee suffered, because they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were so many in number &amp; so sharpe set to mayntaine their Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if they should not haue their willes, greated troubles would dayly arise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To this I replied againe saying, that it was neyther indifferent nor profitable for the Realme, for them to abide with the Kyng, which had both abused the Kyngs age and dignitie, and also had brought him &amp; the whole Realme into great perill, and vnhonestly broken the Kyngs Edict. And concerning the Edict of January, I sayd, what could be more vnseemely than for a few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men, so little to regard the Kynges dignitie, that they durst breake the Kynges Edict, to obserue &amp; kéepe the which, they themselues were sworne: by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of which Edict, not only <hi>Paris,</hi> but also the whole kingdome enioyed peace. Also I said it was a very euell example, for the people to be armed to breake the kings Edictes, and was the ready way to make them euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more disobedient: also that the Religious were not so contrary, that the Christian name should not euery where be retayned: As for that Religion which I and my fellowes imbrace, it is the true and reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is also receiued and imbraced of great Nations, and pourged from <hi>Romish</hi> Idolatries and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions. And to make the matter more plaine, what say you to the late example of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:27102:267"/>
fifth, who after he had assayed to establish in <hi>Germany</hi> that Religion which he him selfe approued, and coulde not bring it to passe, thought it to be the best waye, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had gotten the victory by force of Armes, to let euery man vse what Religion he would, for quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sake. What shoulde I néede to repeate many other examples, when as experience teacheth vs, that this is a necessary remedy to kéepe the people of this Realme, in peace: To let them haue the vse of what Religion they like best. But for all that I could saye or do in that Parley, the Quéene durst not go from that which was prescribed vnto her to speake. So that the Armies were prepared on both partes againe: Then we entered into parley againe: by which they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout very subtilly to betray me: First, I yeelded vnto my brother the King of <hi>Nauar</hi> the Towne of <hi>Baugence,</hi> the which he ment to vse for him and his family during the time of intreaty for peare, which I had good hope to obtaine by the meanes of the Quéenes letters. Then I did put my selfe into my enemies hands; minding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to winne peace. The <hi>Guises</hi> and his fellowes fayned a departure away, but they were not far of, but had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped themselues within the compasse of thrée miles minding to oppresse me, as appeared afterwardes by their Letters which came to my handes.</p>
                              <p>At y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> length I and certaine of my fellowes came in parley and conference with the Quéene At the first we were denied to haue the liberty of our consciences. We straight way affirmed that the libertie of our conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was to vs the most precious thing of all and the chiefest thing that we desired: and added this also, that if the departure of a few, would be an occasion of peace, and of the libertie of Religion, we our selues woulde wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly go into crile, euen to the vtmost partes of the world. The Queene tooke our offer, and liked of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:

and when she had made a long protestation of hir good will toward vs, she perswaded vs to prepare our selues to take our iourney, and she would send vnto me whether soeuer I wold appoynt ten thousand Crowns, promising there withall that my exile shoulde not bee long. But when I was certified of the platforme and snare which the <hi>Guises</hi> had made for me, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intreatie of my fellowes I made hast backe againe to my Armie. Then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Quéene before my departure required of vs an aunswere, the which we referred to the common counsell and aduise of my fellowes: affirming notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing for our selues, that we were ready, not only to go into exile. but also to suffer any maner of extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie willingly for a common wealth.</p>
                              <p>But afterward I had taken deliberation and consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">The reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that staied the Prince of Con de from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into exile.</note> with my fellowes, they aunswered: That except I would forsake God, the Kyng, and my Countrey, I could not nor ought to go to any other place: declaring vnto me that the auncient and approued Lawes and constitutions of the Realme were, that when the king by reason of his younge and tender yeres cannot take vppon him the Gouernement of the Realme, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were the Kinges néere kinsmen, with the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But amongst all other it was decréed by the Quéene, that matters concerning Religion, should be established, for peace and vnities sake. First of all therefore the matter was handeled by Disputation at <hi>Possit</hi> but in vayne. Then the Queene caused an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be made of the Princes the Kings kinsmen, of the Kings Counsellers, and of certaine, choosen out of all Parliamentes of the Realme, that they might make an Edict concerning this matter. Then there was an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict made in the Kings Counsel: to the which they were all sworne (and they also which at this day haue broken the same) and which was published and confirmed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to custome, throughout all Courtes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm: by the benefite whereof the Realme in euery place sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be at peace. Notwithstanding this, thrée priuate men offended with the Kinges Counsell, and inflamed with their owne desires, because they knewe that they were bound to obey their Decrées, aud to giue vp their accountes: conspired togyther how they might remoue the Quéene from her authoritie: gathered an army of men togyther, without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Quéen, contrary to the authoritie and decrées of the States: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to go home to their owne Prouinces, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Quéen, and to vnarme themselues: came armed to the Kinge, and so tooke him: stirred vp warre, and put the king to great expences: not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:27102:269"/>
into the kings Counsel, from which they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Decrées of the States, but also did put in and put out such as it pleased the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and finally they brake the kings Edict solemly made and confirmed by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise and determination of the States, &amp; from the time that they armed them selues, they haue not suffered the same to be kept, without the which notwithstanding, it it not possible that the publique peace should stande. By which their wicked actes and presumption, they haue broken the authoritie of <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Lawes,</hi> &amp; haue playnly declared themselues to be enemies to God, to the king, to the Realme, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peace. For these causes my friends sayd vnto me (considering my state and calling in the Realme) that it was not meete that I shold gyue place vnto them, which by violence had gone about already to confound all thinges: Neyther that I should forsake the cause which was not perticuler, but generally belonging to all men: and that I should resist open force and tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny, and restore libertie of conscience to the men of the reformed Churches, by the benefite of the kings Edicte, after so great and so longe affliction, whereby they sayd I should preserue the authoritie and dignitie of the king and the Estates. For these causes the greatest part of Noble men and Gentlemen, vppon conscience of their dutie, knowing that they were bound hereunto both by diuine and also by mans lawe, haue followed me: and with these the greatest part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings subiectes, and his most noble Cities, haue voluntarily ioyned themselues with me: and rather by diuine than humane reason, haue elected and created mée with one voyce and consent, for this cause to be their Captayne. The which office, I being of the kings bloud, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bound to the Crowne of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> haue taken vpon mée, and haue sworne to maintayne the glory of God, &amp; the dignity and conseruation of the king &amp; the Realme:
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:27102:269"/>
hauing also entered into league with them, in respecte whereof I haue bound my selfe vnto them, and cannot be discharged of my othe againe, without the solemne consent of my fellowes, to whom I haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my faith. And whereas I offered to the Quéene to become a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished man, vpon this condicion: <hi>If by the departing of vs fewe, the common peace, and libertie of Religion might bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned:</hi> it is manifest, that my departure shall open a gap to more miserable destruction, and therefore there is no cause why I should be bound by that my promise. If I should departe the realme, I should leaue the King in this his nonage in perill of the ambition and viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of straungers: and the Crowne of the which I am by nature a defender and protector, in hasard of lying in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dust. Agayne, it cannot be, that the Kinges subiectes should be in the more securitie through my departure, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this one thing is manifest, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                                 <hi>Shepeheard beeing away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Woulfe maye the more easely destroye the flocke.</hi> Can I thinke that so great a multitude, can be sent out of the realm, without their great hurt, and without the great destruction of the whole realme? Therefore, for my duties sake, to do the which I am bound both by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and also by my othe, I cannot, neyther ought I, to depart out of the Realme, specially in these perillouse tymes: vnlesse I would incurre the faulte of a fugitiue and startaway. For as touching the reasons which my aduersaries bring, to couer their wickednesse, and to diswade me from the defence of so iust a cause, they are so weake &amp; of so small waight, that no man will estéeme them, but those which are affectionate vnto them.</p>
                              <p>For, whereas they say, that from that time hitherto, the Quéene hath altered her purpose, disalowed the Edicte, and allowed their bearing of armour, and had giuen hir authoritie to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to rule and order the whole matter: it is nothing.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="226" facs="tcp:27102:270"/>First, bycause it is more probable and agreable to reason, that whatsoeuer the King, the Quéene, and the viceroy, determined and decréed, when they had full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and when the kingdome was in peace, is more firme and sure, than that which they approue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in these troublesome tymes, when they are after a sort constrayned by force of Armes.</p>
                              <p>Secondly the Quéene cannot alow the gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther of domesticall and forein Armyes of men, and the beginning of warre, contrary to the auncient cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the lawes of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and the late decrée of the states, and that for so euil an end &amp; purpose, as to breake the Kinges Edicte, &amp; the decrée aforesaid, made solemly by the Quenes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement: but she must also ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the foundation, vppon which her authoritie stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, which by that meanes should be of no force. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can she of her selfe, put ouer to another her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and power to gouerne, bycause it commeth not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her by natural right, but is giuen vnto her by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite and consent of another. Moreouer touchinge the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whether hée be <hi>Viceroy</hi> or <hi>Legat,</hi> he hath no such authority, that he may commaund the <hi>Guises,</hi> or any other to gather togyther armies of men, and that without the commaundement of the Quene, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings lawfull Counsaile chosen by the states. The which was not obserued when the Quéene gaue them commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to put of their armour. Neyther is it of greater waight or force, that the Quéene, since that tyme, hath approued the bearing of armour and the musteringe of souldiers: bycause in those matters it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be sufficient to haue only a bare allowing or approuing, in the which a sure and expresse commaundement is required. To conclude, admit the Kinges Counsaile were such as it ought to be, by the decrée of the States, and that there were ioyned therwith the authoritie of the Quéene and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:27102:270"/>
of the Kinge of <hi>Nauar:</hi> God forbid that any man, how great soeuer his authority be, in the tyme of the Kinges nonage, might gather an army, proclayme warre, and put the power of the King and the Realme into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of a subiect be he neuer so faithfull, without the wil and consent of the States first had: and specially when the purpose is so euill, and that the Kinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Edict should be broken. These thinges of me considered, I haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, not to forsake my king in his young age, and my Countrey and Religion, all which requyre my helpe. Therefore I haue brought my army more neare my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, my souldiers being very willing and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to set vppon the enemy, and to ioyne battaile. But our enemies which haue so often triumphed ouer vs &amp; scorned vs, haue found no better way, than to packe and steale away secretly in the night. Therefore forsaking to ioyn battail with vs, thei came to <hi>Blais</hi> a town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Garrison, vnlooked for, &amp; besieged the same: and when they had won it they shewed al maner of cruelty: and since that tyme they haue spoyled, &amp; as yet do spoile cruelly many of the Cities of this Realme. And as for the Quéene, though she know the goodnes of our cause, and that I haue done nothing but by her commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet neuerthelesse, bycause she is more a fraide of the power and subtill practises of our aduersaries, than she trusteth to the good successe of oure parte, mindeth to giue her selfe wholy vnto them, anddoth more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vehemently fauour them: as may plainly appear by these effectes. Therefore shée gaue her selfe wholy to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrayn,</hi> who at that tyme was with her, to be gouerned by him: although shée knewe well enough the couetousnes, ambition, &amp; cruell mind which is in him and in the rest of that stocke, which haue bin the causes of most greuous troubles in the Realme of <hi>Fraunce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                                 </hi> since that tyme that they haue borne any rule.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:27102:271"/>
Therfore the Cardinall left nothing vndone that might hinder peace, as may appeare by hys letters which by chaunce came to our handes.</p>
                              <p>Moreouer bicause the <hi>Germanes</hi> (which came to ayde them vnder the conducte and charge of the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              <p>Besides these thinges they obiect against me &amp; mine most shameful slaunders, saying that, we are Rebelles, destroyers of the worshippe of GOD, vsurpers of the Kinges Crowne, possessores of the Kinges Cities, and treasure, <hi>Heretiques, Anabaptistes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Atheictes,</hi> without any Religion or faith. With these and diuers other like crimes they do so fasty sclaunder vs, that we appeale to the consciences of our aduersaries, if they haue any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science at all. But by the grace of God we haue a firme and sure testimony of our Religion, that is to saye, the confession of the reformed Churches, so euidently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and offered to the King, to the Quéene, to the Kinge of <hi>Nauar,</hi> to the Princes the Kinges kinsmen, and to al the kinges Counsaile, as they can testify which now go about to suppresse the same, and sealed with my hand &amp; with the handes of a great nomber besides, which also we doubt not to seale with our own bloud.

As for <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> we are so farre from them, as it is manifest that our aduersaries are giltie in them, and haue ben by vs proued so to be.

And as for the worship of God we haue not abolished the same, for the defence whereof we are ready to spend our liues, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring uothing more than to haue the same purged in the Realme of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> by the puritie and truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell from so many superstitions: and also that it would please God to illuminate our King with the pure know ledge of his word, to blesse the Scepter of his youth, and also to deliuer him from all corrupt Tutors &amp; masters.</p>
                              <p>But how shamefull a thing is this, for the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> to make as though he loued the confession of <hi>Ausburge,</hi> the which he vtterly refused to allow in the disputation of <hi>Possi.</hi> And it may appeare what loue hée and the rest of them beare toward that confession, by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> horrible murther committed at <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>rceau,</hi> in a certayne Mill. At which méeting, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> propounded these condicions of peace: First, that the vse of the reformed religion might be frée in those Cities, in the which it was before the warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: and that the faithful might liue peaceably in other places, and that they might goe vnto such Townes, as they knew the reformed Religion to bée vsed in: also, that there might be diligent héed taken, that they sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no manner of perill for enioying the benefite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Secondly, that it might be lawfull for all men of the reformed Religion, to enioy their goods, offices, &amp;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:27102:274"/>
dignities, but specially their religion in what part of the Realme soeuer they dwelt: and that all sentences and iudgements of any Court pronounced against them for religion be voyd and of none effect: that they which for religions sake were fled the realme, or hauing before fled were now come home againe, might enioye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same benefite, and might haue leaue at their retourne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy all that they had: that euery Noble man might haue libertie to vse the reformed Religion in his house: and also that it might be lawfull for euery one of the Kings Counsell to haue the same religion in or about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, so long as he shall there giue his attendance. Thirdly, that the King himselfe might ratefie and allow y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> warre which they had mayntayned, and what soeuer they had spent of the Kings money to mayntayne the same: that there might be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and generall Counsell appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in some conuenient place within this six monethes, in the which neyther the Pope, nor any other for hym might beare any rule: Or, if it might not be generall: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then it might onely consist of our countrey men, leaue being graunted to euery one to come thyther, that both armies whether they were domesticall or forreyne, might depart home, euery man to his owne house: and that it would please the King to account the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his army, as his owne, the which he protested hée gathered togyther to serue and obeye him: And finally, that for the establishing of this concord, it would please the King and Quéene to gyue their fayth, and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the Kings Counsell, and Gouernour of any Prouince within the Realme, might in lyke manner sweare to obserue and kéepe this peace.</p>
                  <p>These were the special condicions which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> required, which were for certayne dayes sent abroad into diuers places, the <hi>Guises</hi> for the nonce prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:27102:275"/>
with the Quéen subtillie, so to doo, that they might haue the better hope of the ayde which was comminge, and also that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> beginning now in the winter, might fall into greater straytes. For the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> went about at no time to séeke peace &amp; concord, fully perswading and assuring himselfe to haue the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and his. And herevpon it is reported that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> sayd to the Quéen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shée went about to make peace, <hi>If I thought that you would make any certayne and firme pacification with the Prince of Conde, I would neuer agree to the same.</hi> To the which the Quéene made aunswere agayne, that shée ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ment it.</p>
                  <p>This therefore was the aunswer that was made in the kings name, to the peticions of the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</hi> First, the libertie of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was graunted, but with so many exceptions, that it was no libertie at all. For the king denyed any of his Counsell to vse the reformed religion in his Court: hée depriued the Cities of warre which were in the vtmost partes of the Realme, of the benefite of the Edict: among which also hée put in <hi>Lions,</hi> being no citie of warre: Hée also exempted <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp; the whole Territory of the same, from the vse of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion: commaunding the armye of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to breake vp, and to depart home, but the Army of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> which was called the Kings power, to remayne at the kinges pleasure as it was hée denyed also leaue, for those that had forsaken the Realme to come home agayne, hauing not already enioyed that benefite: Hée would not haue the Decrées and sentences pronounced, to bée quite frustrated, but for a tyme suspended: He denyed any Protestantes too enioye his office, sauing the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he refused to allow that expence of his money vppon the warre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:27102:275"/>Uppon this answere, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was out of all hope to haue peace. The <hi>Guise</hi> would not go out of the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> mynding by delay to weaken the pow er of the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> While these thinges had this successe on both partes, the <hi>Guises,</hi> because they would loose no time, went about to make <hi>Monsieur Genly,</hi> a Noble man, whose Brother was <hi>Monsieur de Iuoy</hi> (which had forsaken the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> after the yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of <hi>Burges</hi>) to take their part also. <hi>Monsieur Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> therfore, being earnestly trauailed withall, fell from the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to the contrary part, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into <hi>Paris:</hi> Whose departure made the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to alter his former purpose, because he knew that he being one that had knowne al his secret and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie Counsel, would now bewray the same to the <hi>Guises.</hi>

This battayle had his proporcion in length: but the Battayle of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> not so much in length, but more in breadth.

The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> hauing destroied and put to flight the <hi>Swisers,</hi> encountered then with the next Army of french men, and breakinge their ray, ouer ran them and put them to flight.

Notwithstanding the <hi>Constables</hi> side being not able to make their part good, the <hi>Constable</hi> himself also being sore wounded in the head with an arming swerd, and in other partes of the body with diuers shot, and taken in plaine fight, they fled away, the Prince and the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> pursuing the chase.</p>

                  <p>Agaynst the comming of <hi>Nemours, Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sier des Adretz</hi> had gathered togither out of all <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> so many soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours as he could, to helpe the men of <hi>Lions,</hi> and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted 1500. footemen, with a very small troupe of horsemen. The reporte hereof caused <hi>Nemours</hi> to take a newe deuise in hande: and because he vnderstoode that the army of footemen of <hi>Monsieur des Adretz,</hi> wanted horsemen to garde and defend them, hée determined to set vpon him with his horsemen. Wherefore, not farre from <hi>Beaupere</hi> he met with <hi>Monsieur des Adretz</hi> and his men: and skirmishing with them, troubled them sore, &amp; had slain a great nomber of them, if so be both the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the place, &amp; also the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lines of <hi>M. de Adretz,</hi> in conducting his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had not holpen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p>Notwithstandinge for this cause the inhabitants from <hi>Vienna</hi> all a long the ryuer <hi>Rosne,</hi> were greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feard: and greatly also the newes hereof dismaied <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> although it was strongly fortified with Garrisons of Souldiers. And about this tyme the inhabitantes of <hi>Nonay</hi> sought to winne the Citie of <hi>Sanstephen,</hi> beinge a very Noble and famouse Citie in the Territory of <hi>Viuaretz:</hi> and this was the occasion: there is in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Forrest</hi> a Citie called <hi>Sanstephen,</hi> nere vnto <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> where dyuers kindes of weapons and artillery (the place being very conuenient for the same) are made by Copper Smithes. of which there are there great store.<note place="margin">The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Sanste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen and Nonays.</note> The men of <hi>Nonay,</hi> being desierouse both to haue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones, and also the spoyle of the City, which was of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable wealth, by the aduise and counsayle of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, they intended to winne the same: Imageninge

that by reason of the nearenes of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Caumont,</hi> a man of greate power in that Region, and of diuers other noblemen which dwelt about them, they were secure and careles, and might therefore more easely be opprest. And in déed it came to passe according to their imagination. For the greatest part of souldiers, and almost al the young men and boyes in the Towne, hauinge the gouernour of the Towne their Captaine, went out of <hi>Nonay:</hi> and trauailing all the nighte wyth great spede, through woodes and secret places, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early at the Citie of <hi>Sainstephen.</hi>

Their purpose was to retourne back agayne to <hi>Nonay</hi> with as much spéede as possibly they could, when they had gotten them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and weapons and taken the spoyle of the Citie. But when by the example of their Gouernour, the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours gaue themselues to spoyling of houses, and spent the time in vayne vppon dalliance with women, they gaue great occasion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And when <hi>Monsieur Caumont</hi> vnderstood the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hée marched with his army, taking with him certein fielde péeces, towards <hi>Nonay,</hi> and finding the same voyd of any garrison, and greatly amased with much feare &amp; <note place="margin">Nonay cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly spoiled</note> grief: after hée had battered the walles, at the length, tooke the Citie.

By his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement also there was watch and ward appointed at euery gate, and flagges set out vpon the battlementes of the walles, lyke as the manner is in Cities that be vanquished by force. Moreouer he very straightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Protestantes, that they should bring all their armour to the common halles of euery Citie, and charged his owne men, that they should ransacke all the houses of the faithfull. At <hi>Nemaux,</hi> he caused one to be beaten with cudgelles, bycause he had brought in hys armour, somewhat to late: and vnder colour and cloke of that example, did very haynously sclaunder before the King, the whole company of the faithful in <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> as obstinate and stubborne.

                  <p>Through the vnreasonable outrage of this furious raging president, ther were diuers iniuries and dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wrought againste the Protestantes, eyther vnder coloure of the Edict, or els by playne and open force.

to all and in all places of the Kingdome: yet he did so curtall and weaken the lihertie of the Edicte, that he did not only compell those which were newly come out of the Cloisters and Abbies, or els had forsaken some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popish Rites, in the tyme of warre: but also those who long a go, had left that kind of life and were entred into some better trade of lyuinge, to take againe their former lyfe of monkish supersticion and to put awaye their wiues if they had maried any: or els to depart out of the boundes and limites of his Prouince. And by these meanes he plucked away many of the ministers of Godes woord from their congregations, and droue them out of al the Countrey, where he ruled.

Especially seeinge I did so earnestly request, that my accuser Merae might be reserued, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare against me. VVhich certainly I would neuer haue done, had I not bin therto moued by an assured &amp; cleare conscience of my iust cause and innocencie. This my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest was not in vaine, nor to cloke the matter: for I did not aske it by violence forcibly: nor yet for a fashion, slightly, but only for this one end and purpose: that the truthe mighte be knowen and made manifeste to all the world. But this request beeinge denied me, I did verely thinke with my selfe, and esteeme all the iudgementes that the parliamente of Paris had giuen againste me, as void and of none effect: vvhose entent was (as by the has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and spedy execution of my aduersary it did appeare) to pres me with false and preiudicial surmises, al meanes of reprouing &amp; conuincing mine accuser being quight cut of. I haue therefore done that which my duty requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and requested that the matter might be handled and knowen according to order of law. And whereas besides the letters, I se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Quene of this matter I haue new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>published this writing abroad, I haue not done it with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27102:300"/>
out great and waighty cause, and the aduise and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile of wyse and pollitique men. For by that my request, I was in good hope to haue stayed the spedy expedition of the execution: which, the Iudges being very sore bent against me, did hasten and helpe forward all that they could. Also by this meanes I thought (the end of the broiles and troubles that were then being vncertaine) to haue satisfied the desires of many men, which desired to know the matter: especially of forreiners and straungers, amongst whom I was euill spoken of, by infamous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles and false malicious sclaunders: vntill such time as I hauing my aduersarie before me, might haue better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion more clearely to purge my selfe. Moreouer I did know for a certainty, not only that Merae had vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed and renounced his former accusation against me, whereby it was manifeste that he did that which he did by plaine force and threatninges: but also that his priuy and secret confessions were in my ememies handes, by which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                                 </gap>e did declare me to be innocent and guiltles of the matter. All other accusations therefore, wherewith Merae did charge me (and yet if he had flatly and without all doubt pronounced me as guiltie, my aunswer all men know might be ready<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, forasmuch as I could not bee suffered to talke with him, all these thinges which are obiected against me, were violently extorted and wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of him, eyther in hope to escape death, or els to moderate and lessen the torment and furie of his pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment) I hold and take as forged and faigned: seeing that it may appeare by the testimony of many good and very worthy men, that Merae had often tymes said, that he had declared before the Iudges, that I was cleare and free from all maner blame in that matter: and that when<note place="margin">The words of Merae.</note> he was drawen and had to execution, he expresly and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly said, that those accusations against me, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and penned downe by my enemies, before them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who had left no way in this cause vntried, that might seeme to further my accusation, and for their sakes, in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27102:300"/>
winning of whose fauour, (al men might see) they had set their consciences to sale. vvhich thinge certain letters may easely proue (which when occasion shall serue I can bring forth) that were written from the appointed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners to the parlament the vi. and xv. day of March for the hastening of the execution of Merae: in which these woordes were written. That the Keepers of Merae were corrupted: and that therfore his death was not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be deferred: for that he would cal back againe that which he had said. But I vnderstand, that some do take occasion to coygne and forge a sclaunder against me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I confessed in my former writing, that I had giuen a certain summe of money to Merae. vvhich thinge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I did then and there sufficiently aunswere, and thereby shewed that I dealt plainly and truly: when as I declared the whole matter simply without any manner dissembling: yet notwithstauding, I will playnly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely lay forth the cause of the giuinge of that money, and therby euidently proue, that it is but a meere and malicious surinise, whatsoeuer in this matter is objected against me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and chiefely that I may satisfie them that are trayned in Marshall affaires and do exercise that kind of lyfe. For I am not ignorant that this matter, which came to passe through the occasion of warre, and in the Campes of troublesome warriours: can not easely bee knowen and vnderstood in the peaceable Courtes of quiet laweyers. And yet I could this way easely make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manifest my integrity and innocencie, but the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my owne conscience, shall suffise me before God and men, the double and contrary aunsweres of Merae in his examinations, his mind stroken and amazed with the terrour and feare of death, the hope of lyfe which he conceyued of the Iudges promyse, if he would accuse me (which hope hee helde still euen vnto the laste houre of death: and of mine owne part, the request which I made to haue mine accuser to appeare face to face, and my pro testation of my innocencye if that were not graunted:

the perplexed and headlong affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iudges long before by me refused as incompetente.

VVherby it ap peareth how shameles those surmises were of the crimes laid to my charge. But let that passe, and let vs come to shew the end, wherfore I gaue that money to Merae: least that amongst Strangers, geuing credit to rumours and tales, the good cause of an harmeles and innocent man be oppressed, the matter being neither known nor made manifest.</p>

And this was the first and chiefe cause why I gaue him that money: the which truly I counted as caste away. For there was nothing I lesse lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, then for Merae, when as sodeinly there came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Monsieur Tranuie.</note> me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                                 </gap>ying at Neuuille, Monsieur Tranuie a noble man, who said he was come vnto mee at the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Andelot my Brother, to bring a certaine fellow vnto me, that was newly come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Guises ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe. And although I looked not for him (for I was very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten troubled with such matters) yet I talked with hym, and asked him of diuers small and light matters: in the which he seemed to aunswere mee very readily and cunningly: wherfore I enquired further of him whether the Duke knew of my departure from Orleance, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I vould go. He answered, that the Duke knew not the certain day when I would set forward: but he knew certainly, sixe dayes ago, that I meant to go to Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and had so prouided for the matter already, that I was sure to find many lettes and stayes in my iourney. And for this cause there was commaundement gyuen to the Marshal of Vieleuill and the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of Ringraue, that they should cause all the Townes both great and small to bee fortified: that they should so woorke, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27102:302"/>
there might bee enemies for me in euery place that I could not lay siege to any Towne, for that I lacke both footemen and ordinance: that the Duke himselfe would see that all the Horses that could bee gotten should bee brought to Paris, and that hee would prouide all such Horses as should bee needefull for the cariage of the gunnes, that he would bring the matter about, that hee would bringe three orfoure thousande shotte on horse besides his light horsemen, and men at armes, that hee would followe mee so hard, and trace me so neerely, that I should haue no opportunitie to ioygne with the aide of Normandie, no, not so much leysure to rest me, finally, that besides, that the Germain horsemen waxed faint &amp; weary, he would driue me into such straights and distres, that eyther he would make them to come vnto him, or els (which was more) would cause them bend their force against mee.</p>
                              <p>And bycause I feared that most of all other, I told Merae that it was conuenient he went againe to the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses campe, &amp; to certifie me what the Duke meant to do. To which he aunswered, that he was ready and willing to do it: but he wanted a horse for that purpose: and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (quoth I) I would to God I had one to giue thee, But to say the truth, I haue not one left: to which he replied, that hee could quickly buie one if so be hee had money: Marie (quoth I) I will giue thee money with a good will, so that thou bring me certain and true tidinges what the Duke meanes to do: thou shalt want for no money, only make dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enquirie whether the Duke meane, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue me or no, &amp; if he attempt any thing against Orleans see thou carriest word of it to my brother the Andelot. After this talke, I gaue him 100<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> crowns: and hee forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, not once salutinge my brother the Andelot (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he passed through the Suburbs of Orleans,) came to a Towne called Nun. And this was the cause why I gaue him the 100. crowns. Moreouer I protest, that when he began to talke with me of killinge the Duke: I made
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27102:302"/>
him no aunswere, as though I had eyther allowed or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed the facte: for I little cared whether hee eyther would, or could do it And when I gaue him the hundred crownes, I protest, I did it, for no other end and purpose, but only that he might spedely certifie me, whether the Duke ment to pursue me or no. And why I should feare this thing, there were both waighty and manifest causes which I will not sticke to set forth here perticularly. I could not be ignorant that the Duke knew of my iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for I was constrained, to prouide and take order for it, in a great assembly of horsemen eyght dayes before I departed, neyther could I set forward any sooner, bicause the Germaine Horsemen, were faine to leaue their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and other necessaries behinde them, and surely I had very much a do to bring that matter to an end, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing neyther heard of, nor practised amongst the Germanes. And that the Duke of Guise knewe of this, it is past all peraduenture: for there were diuers that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned amongst our horsemens bandes, to entice and moue the Germans to defection and slyding away from vs to the Guises: in so much that some of them were in such case and so mynded, that the Marshall of Hesse and others their chief Captaynes began to mistrust them. Moreouer, besides that I was admonished by Mere, I dyd also know for a certaintie, that ther was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement geuen throughout all Normandie, that all manner stops,<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal Hesse.</note> lettes, and hinderances that might any waye trouble our armie should be practised against vs. And for the more assurance of this matter, there came certaine letters into my handes, wherein was contayned very straight charge for the accomplishement thereof, and for the furnishing of the Cities with victualls (as afterwards we vnderstood to haue bin done in many places) &amp; that the Milles shold bee so spoyled of their furniture, that they should not grynd, and that in euery place, they should set vpon mee with all their force and power. VVherefore, all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before hand, and the wayes where I shold
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27102:303"/>
passe stopped: it was impossible for me to get to the sea side, to receyue money out of England, for which I lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged very sore to paye the Germaine horsemen their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The which thing as soone as they once knew, there was great daunger that sedition should haue ben stirred vp amongst the souldiours, in so much that they feared not to talke and mutter of it in their common and open communications. VVherefore, if the Duke had attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to haue skirmished but with the straglers and tayll of our armie, it was likely that we should haue bin great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endamaged by him and shamefully foyled: but sure it was past all peraduenture, that he might so haue hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and troubled vs that we should neuer haue gotten to the sea coast: wherein did consist (as farre as mannes reason could reach) the whole and only hope of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent aid, namely of monie, without the which I could not haue payd the Germaine horsemen their wages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon without doubt would haue followed a most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable calamitie and ouerthrow of all my affayres, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being thereby not of abilitie to encounter or ioyne battaile any more with my enemyes. For after we had bin past the plaine of Neufburge, the waye was so vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modius, that 500. harguebuzeres did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ten thousand horsemen most shamefully to fly and the best remedy that I could wish, to ridde vs out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There was also an other let of great waight and importance, and that was that the Villages and Townes were so desert, wast, and so forsaken of all men, and the families in that countrey so scatered and dispersed abrode, that very hardly there could be gathered togyther the nomber of fiftie horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. All which difficulties and lettes the Duke and his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27102:303"/>
Captaines knew full well, which made mee to iudge that he would rather set forward towardes Normandy to pur sue me, then to attempt the siege of Orleans. For if so be my armie had bin once destroyed: it was very likely that Orleance should soone haue come to ruine and wrack, but if my armye had bin safe and preserued, there was good hope, yea although Orleans had bin won, to haue maintained and gon forward with the war. These things I haue here more particularly declared and set forth, to the intent I might shewe to them that haue any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in these matters, whether it had bin expediente and fit for me to haue spared my money in such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, wherein it was necessary to know what way the Duke ment to worke, and for this purpose I had hyred very many, who receiued of mee good round summes of money and yet do not make their bragges and vauntes thereof. And whereas I amongst all these distresses and daungers that I knewe to be certaine, did aduenture vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that iourney, I was truly against my will compelled therevnto, by the extreame perill and hazarde I should haue bin in, if I had bin forsaken of the Germane horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men through want of money. To these foresaid causes that I haue shewed why I gaue this money, I may ad also this, that M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

VVhere vppon I may truly conclude, that it is neyther true nor like to be true, that I should be the author of that thinge which he long before had conceiued and purposed in his mind. Moreouer where as Merae was very nere of kinne to M. Rainold (whom the Duke had caused to be slaine) it was likely that he was enflamed and stirred vp againste the Guise, by some priuate quarell and speciall hatred. And as I haue declared beefore: euen so of a truth the case
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27102:304"/>
standes. vvhereby me thinke it is euident and plain that they who perswade themselues that I was the author and procurer of this murther, (besides that they vse very fonde and childishe reasons to proue the same) do not know my nature, for if so be I had charged him to doo any more then that I haue before declared, I would not feare to confesse it with like franknes and boldnes. And truly, I would gladly aske this question of them: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                                 </gap>gin, that there was any other cause why I should cause my other answer to be published, then that I desired the matter might be vnderstanded of all men. And it there were any thing else, why should I dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? why should I cloake it? why should I not confesse it: who euer was a more deadly and open enemie vnto mee, than the Duke of Guise? for what other cause did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege Orleans, but that he might vtterly destroy and cast awaye mee, my wyfe and children, and whatsoeuer else I held as deare and precious vnto mee? yea there are men of great credite, that can and will testifie, that he vsed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to bragge and make his vaunts, that whensoeuer the Citie were taken, he would spare none, neyther man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yong nor old. Neyther needeth any man to doubt, that amongest all them that were in the battayle at Dreux, it was he I sought for, and chiefely he with whom I wished to meete. And certaine it is, that if I myselfe could haue discharged anie shot at him, I would ful glad ly haue done it: yea truely, if I had ben Captain ouer ten thousand gunners, I would haue charged them that they should euery one haue leueled and shot at him alone. To be short, I would haue left no deuise that might stande with the law of armes, vntried: so that I might by any meanes deliuer my selfe from an enemie so spightfull and deadly against mee and myne, &amp; all good men. And last of all, I protest before God and his Aungelles, that I commaunded nothing else, but that which I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in these my writings.

The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> therefore did very carefully trauell in maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and defending the Popes authoritie and dignitie in the kingdome of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and this matter, as a thing of greatest waight and importance, was thorowly and most earnestly laboured of all sides. And the great and large reuenew that came out of <hi>Fraunce</hi> (whiche thing did chiefely enflame y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> zeale of those reuerend Fathers) and the great daunger and present hazard they were in, to loose them, if the reformed Religion had preuayled, did make them busily to besturre them, and to take the matter in hand.</p>
                  <p>There was present at the Councell the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> hauing great knowledge and experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the affaires of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and a subtill and sleighty old coyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of new fetches, and besides that, the matter for hys owne cause stood him vppon: he was also incensed with an outragious hatred and malice against the men of the reformed religion, and chiefly against the trueth it self, which he both knew and renounced. At his request and setting on, they began to consult how they might vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deface and roote vpp the reformed Religion out of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27102:305"/>
                     <hi>Fraunce:</hi> the readiest and fittest waye for that matter that they could deuise was, that there should be a league made betwixt the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> and the King of <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:</hi> and that the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> (because it was a thing of great difficultie and could not without much a doe bée brought to passe) should helpe the French Kinge at all tymes with such ayde as should be néedfull: and that all wayes and meanes should be sought to abolish and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annull the Edict wherin was graunted the libertie and vse of the reformed Religion. This league which was made for the rooting out of true religion, the holy fathers of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> dyd call the <hi>Sacred and holye League.</hi> The Cardinall of <hi>Lorayne</hi> doth promise all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible diligence and trauaill in this matter: and that hée will perswade the King to finish the league, and as for the Quéene, being of herselfe prone &amp; enclining to their parte, and the consents of the Nobles, he accounted him selfe sure of them.</p>
                  <p>As the Cardinall (a most bitter enemie to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion) did what possible he could for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishement of these matters in the Councell at <hi>Trent:</hi> the enemies of the Gospell were not idell at home in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> in defacing and putting downe the Edicte: and the Quéene was not onely euery day more wayward &amp; disliking of the reformed religion, but was also very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously incensed against it: and dyd by all meanes shée could denise, goe about to engraffe and so we hatred and malice in the tender mind of the yong King against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: that then he might proclayme perpetuall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting warre against al the reformed Churches in <hi>Fraunce.</hi>

In the meane tyme the people should be borne in hand and made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that the Edict as concerninge Religion was not perpetuall, but at pleasure and for a space, till such time as the Kinge might conuenientlye bringe the whole Realme to one only vniformitie of Religion. And that the King especially and his Brother might be enflamed against the reformed Religion. And last of all that no occasion that might séem to make for the accomplishing of these matters, should be let passe, but that al waies &amp; meanes that might in any wyse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> further them should

be practised warely and with great discretion and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.</p>
                  <p>The deuises that were vsed were these. It was tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked openly abrode, and that very much among the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, that it was the Kinges and the Queene his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will and pleasure, that the Edicte should be dyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obserued and executed, and in the meane tyme by the Cardinalles deuise and the Quéenes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, ther were priuie and secret commaundements sent out to certaine picked and chosen men for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that they should not feare to violate and breake the Edicte in any thing, whereof they had occasion offered them. And if so bee that any of the Protestantes that were wronged contrary to the prescripte order of the Edicte, did complaine thereof, (as verie manye did) at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth with great sute hauing leaue to shew their griefs and wronges, they alwayes receyued this aunswere: that it was the Kinges will and commaundement that his Edict for and concerning Religion, should be euery where obserued and kepte, and that whosoeuer were found guiltie of the breach and violating thereof should be greuously punnished: and as this was his pleasure, so they were bidden to take héede least that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues who did so much complaine of wronges and iniu ries done vnto them, had first transgressed against the Edicte, and then malicioufly and falsely accused others for it.

bertie of conscience, &amp; the peaceable vse of the religion which they terme reformed, <hi>this exception is to be added in the way of interpretaion.</hi> It shall not be lawfull to be done or practised in any places that were either bought or take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ecclesiasticall liuings, or in any which wer holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church, to which we forbid the vse of the re formed Religion, both publiquely and priuately. <hi>For there were dyuers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church liuings y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were sold at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, &amp; were by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meanes holden &amp; possessed of the Protestantes, who vsed the benefite of the Edicte for the administration of Religion in those places, to the great griefe of the Papistes. There were also diuers that had great and fat benifices, brought to the knowledge and profession of the reformed religion, but chiefely one of great reputation the Cardinal Chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon a man endewed with many goodly church liuings and was Archebishop of Aeges: and many other of the noblest houses in France. Who if they once had gotten by the Edicte libertie of Religion, it was very likely, that it should haue ben spred and sowen abrode far and wide in diuers places. For many places where those benefises lay, had preuiledges of great authority, and very large and ample dominion &amp; rule: so the Papistes by this interpretation were well eased, to the greate hinderance &amp; discomodity of the faithful. To the first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Edict wherin was.</hi> Be it fre and lawful for al cities, in which that religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was vsed the vii. day of march (besides other Cities that are perticularly to be set out &amp; appointed in euery Prouince) stil to haue and enioy the vse thereof. <hi>There was added a newe interpretation.</hi> That those Cities were vnderstood &amp; meant, which were kept and holden in warlike maner, and in which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion had bin publiquely and openly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, at the day beefore assigned. <hi>So by that meanes there were certaine Cytyes barred and shutte out</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:27102:308"/>
                     <hi>from the vse of their religion. To the sixt article where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cioned,</hi> That the citie &amp; the whole prouince of Paris should be free and cleare from the vse of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>There was added a more straight restraint and prohibition,</hi> That it was not lawfull for any that dwelte within the Citie or precinct of the Prouince of Paris, to goe to any Cities licensed by the king of the prouinces neere adioyning, to exercise that Religion, vnlesse they dyd dwell in them: neyther shall it bee lawfull for any such persons to haue any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion place or dwelling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limites of the Citie or prouince of Paris. <hi>This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint was manifestly knowen to be annexed for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpose, but only in despight and hatred of certain Senatours and Aldermen of Paris, worthie Patrones of the truth, and other worthy and famous men, that thereby they might bee constrained to leaue Paris, and remoue to other places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And where as in the fourth article mention is made, <hi>That all men might liue quietly in euery place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble or daunger for the freedome and vse of their Religion and conscience:</hi> it was restrayned with a very straight exception: <hi>That none, neyther man nor woman were accompted in that number which ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, or after the tyme of warre had forsaken eyther Abbayes, Nunries or other religiouse houses: and these were streightly commaunded, eyther to returne agayne to the places of Religion they came from, and if they were maried to forsake their wiues, or else forthwith to depart the Realme.</hi> So that by this meanes many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies (but with greater discommoditie and wrong of a more number) were eased and helped: to the whiche both yong men and maydes that were in tymes paste thrust and shut vp into Abbayes, were now retourned, being endewed with a more pure and syncere knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth, and sued by the lawe for their patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and partes left by their parents. But by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27102:309"/>
all libertie and licence to sue and pleade for their owne was taken from them, and they either com pelled to reenter the Cloysters they had forsaken, or else enforced to depart out of the Realme. And by this meanes there were many occasions gyuen of diuers great and gréeuous iniuries, as for example: That hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible &amp; accursed murther committed by <hi>M. d' Anuille,</hi> (as we haue before declared) vppon <hi>A. Motton,</hi> a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the woord of God: which detestable facte was cloaked and defended vnder pretence of this Inter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore the vse of the religion which was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a common name, <hi>The administration of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> was maruetlously abated and diminished by a new deuised interpretation. <hi>That it should not be lawfull for any man to be a minister of that religion, but for such as were borne there (that is) bred within any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of the kingdome of Fraunce.</hi> So that by this fetch diuers of the Churches were bereft and spoyled of their good Pastors and Doctours, as namely the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Lions,</hi> of that learned and eloquent man <hi>Petrus Viretus,</hi> who dyd very effectually and faithfully trauel, in aduauncing and spreading abroad the Gospel in that most famous and populous Citie and mart Towne of all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> to the great griefe and hart sore of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, for whose cause especially they had procured this exposition of the Edict. Wherefore he departing thence went first to the Countrie of <hi>Orange,</hi> and afterwardes at the Quéene of <hi>Nauarres</hi> commaundment, he came to <hi>Bearn,</hi> to confirme and set in order the Churches and Congregations that were there.</p>
                  <p>The Papistes now began to mocke and laughe in their sléeues, to sée this Declaration gyuen out by the King, and published abroad in open writing, whereby it was made manifest, what an ouerthrow was gyuen to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27102:309"/>
the Edict: and being in a brauery and al vpon the hoigh set day, and appointed the time, and that with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, when as it should be vtterly abolished and quite done awaye: and warrantinge them selues vppon this beginning, they euery day more &amp; more without checke violated the Edict.</p>
                  <p>There be also new deuises put in practise, whereby they might entyce and allure the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> from<note place="margin">New sleights put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the Prince of Conde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> the reformed Religion. This fetch was practised before by the Cardinal of <hi>Loreine</hi> against the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and had preuayled, &amp; therefore he thought good to proue and trie once againe against the Prince, thinking with himselfe that hée might as easely and with the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises wherewith he had ouercome the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> winne also vnto him the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> the Quéene of her selfe was ready and desirous to take this matter in hande, &amp; many other meanes there were that séemed (as it were) to profer their helpe for the accomplishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thereof. The Prince of himselfe was of a myld and soft disposition, desirous of peace, and euen glutted with the lothsomenesse of the former warres, and being altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bent to kéepe and maintain peace, did from his hart abhorre and detest strife and contentious troubles. Wherefore hée was much and often at the Court, and very familiar both with the King and the Quéene hys mother. The <hi>Guises</hi> also of set purpose séemed not too come so often to the Court, nor to be in such fauour with the Quéene as they were wont to bée, and all for the Princes sake: to win whom, there was no fetch, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, no subtiltie left vntried. The Quéene her selfe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed very often and louingly, to shew the deare good will she bare to the Prince: and told him that of her self and for her part she dyd fauour and loue him: that it was &amp; should be both the Kings and her will &amp; mind to estéeme and loue (as right &amp; reason required) the Princes their

And many other trayns were intermingled with this talke, whereof that subtil and alluring woman thorough her courtly trickes and baytes had great store. Beside this, there were more particular promises made: and that olde forged deuise was renewed of the yéelding and gyuing vp of the Ile of <hi>Sardina:</hi> which had ben diuers tymes before that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and was now agayne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Mariage also was attempted that there might be a more sure band and coniunction of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie amongst them. The <hi>Marishall of Saint Andrew,</hi> a man of excéeding great wealth, being slayne in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle of <hi>Dreux,</hi> had left behind him one onely daughter, who was heire of all those goodly and ample possessions. To her (beinge almost mariageable) the Quéene went about to couple the Prince of <hi>Condies</hi> eldest sonne, who was then called the Duke of <hi>Augnien,</hi> the mother of the gentle woman, doing all she could to bring that mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to passe: And although the honour and nobilitie of the two howfes were nothing like equall: yet the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shialles daughter had great aboundance of ritchesse on her side, which surely is the thing that striketh the strok and beareth greatest sway in marriage matters now in these our dayes wherein men are altogyther gyuen
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:27102:310"/>
to get wealth and riches. The Prince himself was not very vnwilling, and therefore kept company very fami liarly with the widowe the <hi>Marshialles</hi> wife, and great curteousie was exercised betwixte them. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalles</hi> wyfe gaue vnto the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> a very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and beautifull place called the Territory of <hi>Ualeri:</hi> and the <hi>Marishiall</hi> him selfe had bestowed there for the trimming and beawtifying of it, much rickes which King <hi>Henry</hi> had giuen him in giftes and rewardes: this place dyd shée giue vnto the Prince, withall the right, Title, and possessions thereto belonging, the Quéen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and allowing the matter very well: wherefore euery man looked euery day when that mariage should be solemnized. And who in the Courte then but the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> who (as the nature of man is to slyde and fall through ill companie from exercise and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse trauaill to pleasure and idlenesse) began (contrary to the institution of the reformed religion and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation) to gyue himself to the wanton desire and lust of women, and tasting very licentiously of the baytes &amp; snaring traynes that were layde for him, séemed euery day more and more carelesse of that good and vertuouse Matrone his wife, who was of the howse and family of <hi>Roye,</hi> and waxed cold and faynt in the profession and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the reformed religion, to the great grief &amp; feare of all good men, but to the great ioy of the papistes, who made their vaunts and crackes saying, that the Prince would daunce the same daunce that his brother the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had lead defore him. And surely there was great likelihood of most lamentable and sorrowfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and ruine, had not the mercyfull prouidence of god, speedely preuented it, as hereafter in his place shal bee declared.</p>

                  <p>We haue spoken before of the accusation commenced<note place="margin">The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged free of the Dukes murther by the kings own iudgement</note> against the <hi>Admirall,</hi> as though he had ben authour of the Duke of <hi>Guises</hi> death, and of his aunswer there too. But because the matter séemed likely to bréede further trouble, and that it was such as might hinder and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet his progresse, both partes being so earnestly bent to wrath and reuengement: the King thought it best to decide and take vp the matter before he procéeded any further on his iourney.

The <hi>Guises</hi> also &amp; they of <hi>Chastillon</hi> were charged to lay aside all hatred and grudge and to be reconciled, and euerafter become friendes and louers. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement was obeyed and receyued of both sides, whereby the wound was stopped &amp; couered for a while, but not thorowly healed.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the Cardinal of <hi>Lorayne</hi> was here by, sinely beguiled and defeated of his purpose, thinking
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27102:317"/>
by this to haue had iust occasion (as the Spanish Kinge br agged in his letters) both to haue displaced the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,</hi> and also vnder a faire shew of this cause to haue violated and broken the peace.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the <hi>Admirall,</hi> the <hi>Andelot</hi> and other of the chief Nobles that were professors of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion went not with the King on this iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The Cardinall also of <hi>Lorrayne</hi> taryed behinde in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as we shall hereafter declare.</p>
                  <p>After this, the King came to <hi>Lions</hi> with a very great<note place="margin">The Kings comminge to Lions and what he did there.</note> trayne, and was Royally and sumptuously receyued of the Townesmen of both Religions. Here they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to frame and put in practise many conceyptes and deuises: for that, if they could ouerthrow and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> congregatign that was here, being of all other the chief and most famouse, they shold the easier deface and destroy others that were lesse. For the state of that most florishing &amp; populous church did gréeue the Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papistes at the very hartes. Wherefore they thought it behouable and very expedient, by all wayes possible, to oppresse and disquiet it. Yet contrary to their purpose and meaning, they taryed but a small tyme there, by reason the plage raged so cruelly, that through the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne wilfulnes of the Quéene that meant to haue stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Court longer there, the plague came euen into hir owne chamber, and dispatched one of the Noble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of her own trayne out of the way. Wherefore, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough feare of the pestilence, the Courte remoued from <hi>Lions</hi> to <hi>Rossilon,</hi> a territorie belonging to the howse of <hi>Tarnon,</hi> their howses being very stately garnished be fore with the Kings owne prouision and furniture: and yet the papistes were not idell at <hi>Lions,</hi> although their aboade there was both short and daungerous. For the<note place="margin">An enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones.</note> chief men of the reformed Religion were charged to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne and not to resort any more to Sermons or other
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:27102:317"/>
assemblies. And that this might the better bee done in all places where the Court should passe, there came out a commaundement from the King, forbidding <hi>That the reformed religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should bee exercised in any place where the king should passe, or in any place where he lay, as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as he made his aboade there, and that it should not be pra ctised at any tyme hereafter in any of the kinges howses and pallaces,</hi> (the cause also was added) <hi>least the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, being greeued and offended with it, new troubles should arise.</hi> There was also a p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>face adioined, <hi>That, the same was omitted in the Edict, wherunto the king would all men should vnderstand, he ment not by this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to adde any thing.</hi> So thus they vsed the name of the Edict, where in déed they endeuored to ouerthrowe and abolishe it.</p>
                  <p>A fortresse also by the Kings commaundement was<note place="margin">A fortresse built at Lyons.</note> begonne to be built at <hi>Lions,</hi> to kéepe in subiection and ouerlooke the Townesmen, vpon the hill of <hi>S.

                  <p>Wée declared before how the Citie of <hi>Lions</hi> in the be ginning of the former warre, was kept and fortified with a garrison of the protestantes: and how <hi>Monsieur Saltan,</hi> a noble man, had as then the gouernment &amp; rule ouer the Citie, who being very earnestly requested of the faythfull, that he would in the Kings name goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the administration of their common wealth: notwithstanding refused to do it, and leauing <hi>Lions,</hi> got him quietly home to his owne howse. By his defaulte and negligence the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> when he liued, would say, that <hi>Lions</hi> was taken of the protestants, and many complaintes and accusations as touching that matter, were put vp against him, by the chiefe of the popish No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:27102:318"/>
and certayn <hi>Italians</hi> were suborned to accuse him before the King for betraying <hi>Lions</hi> into the protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts handes. To these complaintes <hi>Monsieur Saltan</hi> maketh aunswere and albeit he had sufficiently proued them to be but méere surmises and false sclaunders, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so quited and discharged by the Kings own Iudgement, of that accusation: yet notwithstanding no punishment (although he complayned diuers tymes to the Kinge therof) was executed vpon these wrongful sclau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derers. Moreouer, intreatie was made with him by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Kinges name, that he would gyue ouer his<note place="margin">Monfieur Saltane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gouern ment of Ly ons &amp; mon suer Lossay succeded him.</note> Presidentship: wherefore beeing nothing desirous of glorie and authoritie, willingly gaue place and resigned his office, in whose roome was placed <hi>Monsieur Lossay,</hi> a man of very craftie and deceiptful disposition, and excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hautie and proud. For it is almost impossible to be told with what intollerable pompe and excessiue pride he vaunted and boasted himselfe, and how great impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and carelesnesse in offending against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts was graunted to the papists by him.

                  <p>About the fourth day of August a new interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Edict was enacted, and called the declaration of Religion, wherein firste was placed a preface at the first vew very goodly.</p>

                  <p>The protestants were greatly endamaged by these exceptions, for they who were scatered abroad through the Prouinces and could not conueniently repayre to those Cities that were appointed for preachinge, were by the first article forbidden to resort to any other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to heare sermons: for thei that sought or resorted to any such place were both in great danger as thei went, and were also charged to be violaters of the Edict.

Wherefore I most humbly beséech your Maiesties that you will not take it in euill parte, that I am come by letters to entreat for them, that are without all law and Iustice most shamefully spoyled &amp; slayne, contrary to your highnesse pleasures declared in your Edict. And for that they could not by any other meanes obtayne remedie and redresse of their wrongs, they are come vnto me for succour, thinking that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of my néere kynred to your Maiestie, &amp; the place whereunto I am called in this realme, I might obtayn for them that ease and reliefe of their griefes, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they could not get. Neyther could I my selfe for these causes and for the obedience I owe to youre Grace, refuse to declare and shew vnto your Maiestie with all humble modestie &amp; reuerence, these so great miseries and calamities.

whatsoeuer onward out by them to whom you haue committed the correction and punishment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors? Your highnes Presidents and Lieuftenants, whose charge aud office is to redres and restrain such disorders, and are for that purpose garded with Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Souldiours, at the cost and charge of those ouer whom they gouerne, do abuse that aide giuen them to maintaine Iustice, alwaies to the fauour of one part of your subiectes, and vtter destruction of the other. And if so be it chaunce now and then that they go to any place to sit vpon any such matters, there is nothinge done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Iustice, but the catholiques defaultes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences cloked and couered: and as for the examination to be had there, it is eyther quight omitted, or els done in hugger mugger and corners that no man can know of it.

                  <p>When these letters of the Princes were brought to the King, and the indignation that hée and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessoures of the reformed religion had conceyued was knowen, the very necessity of the tyme enforced them to make some showe of redresse and correction of these misorders.

Also he trusted that he (who ought to haue speciall regard for the good and safe estate of the Kingdome) would so trauaile and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that no new broiles should bee raised by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reformed religion that complained of their wrongs, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is fit that they should not reuenge themselues of such iniuries as they say are doue vnto them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commit the charge and orderinge of those matters to him, being chief Lord and gouernour ouer both them and their causes, and that vnlesse they did so, they should purchase vnto themselues most greuous and seuere pu nishment: only hee willed him to take héede that none were falsly accused, and that that which they obiected a gainst others might not rightly and worthely be layde to their own charge.

This way pleased the most part: but some feared the seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Inquisition, from the which the Kyng himself was not free: howbeit the most parte of them thoughte it vnreasonable, that the lawes and liberty of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey shoulde be violated and broken, and such tyrannie executed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their bodyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goods, and consciences, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To this the Duches of <hi>Parme</hi> made answere, That she woulde doe any thing that she was able, that was either good or profitable for the common wealth: that she would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour her selfe to bring to passe, that the Inquisitours and officers vnder the King, should wisely behaue them selues, and not deale with any according to the seuerity of the Edictes: and that she woulde wythin sixe mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes vnderstande the Kings pleasure concerning these things.</p>

This was toward the latter end of the moneth of Iune At the first, the people assembled them selues togyther without the Cities, notwithstanding in such number, that a man might see continuall passage of people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the fieldes and euery Citie. In the beginninge, they came togither vnarmed: but when they vnderstood that their méeting waxed daungerouse, and that the In quisitours began to playe their part, they caried wyth them at the first swordes, but afterwardes, more strong and better weapons, to defend themselues as they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from their houses into the fieldes. At <hi>Antwerpe</hi> the Magistrates of the citie gaue leaue to the protestants, to arme themselues so long as they were out of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the fields, but in no wyse to beare the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the citie: to the which the protestants willingly grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ted.

The Magistrats were so amazed and abashed hereat, that although they followed the Catholike religion, yet notwithstanding they set to their handes &amp; furthered the pulling down, defacing and breaking the Images.</p>

                  <p>If any man condemne this rashe zeale of the people, voyd of reason, let him there withall weigh the singular Iudgement of God against those Idols, with the which the world being blinded, had so many wayes dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Maiestie.</p>

                  <p>To this the Noble men dyd condescend and agree: wherevpon the Conditions were solemply confirmed betwéene both partes with an othe, and ingrossed, and sealed with the Kings seale. Commaundement was gyuen to all Gouernours and Magistrates, solemly to proclayme this agréement, and to do all thinges accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenure thereof. There was made also an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,

by which all men were forbidden to do any iniury, eyther by word or déed for Religion, vppon payne of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere punishment. Upon this commaundement the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of euery circuite or shyer, appoynted oute places for the exercising of the reformed religion suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red churches to be buylded for the same purpose: &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both partes to stay themselues vnder their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This was about the Moneth of August.</p>
                  <p>The Religion and the professours therof séemed now to be in good cace, reporte euerywhere being made, that the King was fully purposed to giue licence to the inha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bitants of the low Countrey to vse the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

                  <p>After the proclamation hereof, it séemed to bringe peace to diuers other Cityes, and to abolish quight the remembraunce of other troubles: but yet for all this, the men of the reformed religion were not frée and at such perfect peace as they iudged themselues to be. For the papistes which inclined to the Cardinall <hi>Granuellan</hi> and the inquisitours side, toke occasion by the foresaide casting downe of Images to worke their mischeuouse intent Therefore taking a courage amidest that great and sodame feare &amp; maze, the greatest part of the kings officers, went about to bring in question the throwing downe of the Images, as done againste all order and

the publique authority of Magistrats. They refused al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the letters of the Duches of <hi>Parme,</hi> as to helpe any thing at all the offenders herein.</p>
                  <p>Therefore gatheringe togyther a great number of Souldiers to serue their turne, they toke many in all places of the protestantes, and cast them into prison: and after examination, put them to death.</p>
                  <p>After this also <hi>Norcam Manques</hi> of <hi>Berge,</hi> a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy to the reformed Religion, came with foure bandes of horsmen, &amp; v.

Thys was done in the moneth of Nouember.</p>
                  <p>By these cruell actes of the papistes, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned extreame destruction, the protestants sawe that it was now hygh time to prouide for themselues. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dyuers practised sondry wayes &amp; meanes for theyr defence: but God altering and orderinge all thinges by his prouidence, would not suffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come to good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Great was the multitude of people, and great was their courage: but they wanted Counsayle and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes to guyde them. There were sufficient men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, which could haue gouerned them and conducted them both with wisdome and pollicie: agayn the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Noblemen was not smal that fauoured that side, who, if they had taken parte with them, there had bene good hope of victory, and to haue had more quiet gouern ment. But such as were of highest calling, standing stil as lookers on, and séeking neyther to defende nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the one nor the other, all good occasion to bring any thing happely to passe, was lost: The whiche brought great ruine to the protestantes of the lowe Countrey, and great calamity to those noble men themselues: So
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:27102:338"/>
hard &amp; perillouse a thing it is for a man to séeke to serue two maisters so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary the one to the other. The grea test part of the Nobilitie professed the reformed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and yet there was scarse one of them, which came at any tyme to the sermons of that Religion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must néedes confesse that our sinnes haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Lord not to finish that good worke which he had begonne. Herevpon came the pitiefull calamitie of the churches of the low countrey.</p>
                  <p>The Protestantes therefore were both destitute of counsaile, and also of a goide, but the Catholiques wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neyther of them both. Wherefore their cities were dayly fortified with garrisons, and they besieged as is sayd before, <hi>Valencia,</hi> which was quight voyde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of any Captayne. There came diuers bandes of Souldiours also, as scattered shéepe, to ayde the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants at <hi>Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cia,</hi> and that with good courage: and while they vainly looked for a Captayne, the greatest part co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed themselues away. Therefore al this mouth was spent with diuers troubles, and diuers cities of the pro testantes were wonne, and the inhabitants therof put to flight.</p>

                     <hi>Antwerpe</hi> being vnder the authoritie and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was not pertaker of those troubles that other places felt.

                  <p>All things growing daylye from euill to woorse, the Protestantes offered vp at diuers tymes Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Magistrates, to whom most humbly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently they committed themselues and their cause:

promising vnto them a great summe of money, vppon condition that they might be in safety.

                  <p>The reste of the moneth of February, was spente with diuers troubles, the faithfull Protestants beinge dayly anoyed and vexed more and more, with proscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions banishments, and such lyke. All this while was continued the siege of <hi>Valence,</hi> which at the laste by the letters of the Duches of <hi>Parma,</hi> wherein shée promysed<note place="margin">Valence surrendred</note> all clemeney and fauour, was surrendered to <hi>Noircarm</hi> the xxiii. day of March.

the chief both of the Citie, and also of the Church, were taken prisoners: and among these two ministers, the one called <hi>Guido Bresse,</hi> &amp; the other <hi>Peregrine Grage,</hi> and certayne other honest Citizens were put to death: for that they had Sermones in the Citie without the Kings will and pleasure, and had also vsed the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Sacramentes.

Therfore this yéere they mynded to worke the vtter ruyne and destruction of the Churches of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> So that they hauing theyr consultations at <hi>Marches,</hi> and at <hi>Monseaux,</hi> (at whiche places the King and Quéene moste commonly aboade) determined to prouide out of hande bandes of souldiers, and to require the helpe and ayde of the <hi>Switzers:</hi> all the which they determined to do vnder the collonr, that the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> with the Spaniardes ment to giue some attempte againste the Realme of <hi>Frannce,</hi> or that they mynded to defende Callice against the Quéene of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> They sought also other meanes and waies to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and contende with the Protestantes, mynding to deale with them as giltie of the Edictes broken, and to examine those which had done anye thing contrarye to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:27102:339"/>
the Edicte, specially againste that which was made at <hi>Rossillon:</hi> that is to saye, which had gone to anye other places to beare Sermons than to those which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted them by the Kings commaundement: or if the Noble men had entertayned any other to the hearyng of the sayd Sermons, beside those that were within the compasse of their Iurisdiction: and suche like offences. As these transgressions had anexed vnto them the pain and punishment of exile, so their purpose was to seeke a reformation of these things, by seuere putting the same punishmentes in execution, according to the tenour of the Edict.</p>
                  <p>But least they might séeme to haue no regard to the Counsaile of the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> which was: <hi>It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to haue one Salmons heade, than the heades of a thousand Frogges:</hi> they went about to snare and catch those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, which imbraced the reformed religion, as the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the <hi>Admirall,</hi> the <hi>Andelot,</hi> the <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault,</hi> and other Noble men.

                  <p>In the meane time the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the <hi>Admiral</hi> and diuers other Noble men of the reformed religion, were verye carefull.

                  <p>Concerning the purpose and connfaile of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> of the <hi>Admirall,</hi> and of others of the reformed religion, we haue spoken before. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> therefore, by dyuers messengers prayed and intreated the Kinge concerninge the séeking of a reformation for those troubles, which were lyke shortly to ensue. Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto him that the comming of the <hi>Swirsors</hi> into the Realme againe was so perillouse, that it would cause the people seditiously to rise. The <hi>Admirall</hi> went often tymes to the Constable his vncle, and talked with the Quéene, whom he knew to be at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles house, and fréely declared vnto her, that if the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full were so handled, wherby they had iust cause to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that war was a preparing for him, they could not any longer be kept in peace. Notwithstandinge the Quéene and the Costable pretended a notable cause why it was néedefull to haue the aide of forreiners: for, say they, the Spaniardes beare an olde grudge and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred against the realme of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> so that we haue good cause to feare, least they hauing occasion set vppon vs:

but the King will reforme all thinges so, for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulles sake, that all men shall sée, that he will deale vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly and iustly towardes all men. After this also the Queen made these promises in her letters to the prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding there came sixe thousand <hi>Switsers,</hi> in the beginning of September:: and a greate number of horsemen were armed and prepared. And the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was fully certified, that the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> which was already come to <hi>Belgio,</hi> had moued the King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> in the name of King <hi>Phillip,</hi> to go forward with the holy league, and withall had perswaded him to take present occasion to bring his purpose to passe.

                  <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine</hi> vnderstoode of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> with the rest of the nobles, declared vnto the King and Quéene, what great perill and daunger it was vnto their persons, for the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to come vnto them with so greate a power of men, intending he sayde, nothing else than to take the king, his mother, and his whole family, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then he might doe what him lyst.</p>

                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being sory for this feare of the King and Quéene, stayed at <hi>Rozoi,</hi> a village therabout: to the which place the <hi>Marshall Momorencius</hi> was sent declaring vnto him the causes of his comming, saying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was very sory, that he was fallen into so great suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>After this he remoued from <hi>Clay,</hi> to the Towne of <hi>Sandionyse,</hi> bycause the same beyng néere vnto <hi>Paris,</hi> he might the more conueniently haue conference with the King.

Noble men which séemed to bee of greatest power in these matters, That it séemed good vnto them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the whole matter to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, and the Princes of the <hi>Empyre,</hi> whereby they should be sure to enioye the libertie of the confession of <hi>Ausburg.</hi> But <hi>Valence</hi> being left destitute of ayde, and therefore cruelly spoyled, and the whole countrey being desolat, that, their purpose was frustrate. For the protestantes fledd out from all places of the borders of <hi>Belgio,</hi> by heapes: also the Ministers &amp; chiefe Gouerners of the church of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> yea and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, leauing his sonne at <hi>Louayne,</hi> fled out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and that in good tyme, as the pitiefull deathes of Counte <hi>Egmond</hi> and <hi>Horne</hi> afterwarde declared: of the which we will speake anon. A great parte of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes of the low Countrey fled into <hi>Englande,</hi> and part into <hi>Germany,</hi> and into <hi>Cleueland,</hi> the Quene of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> but specially the Countye <hi>Palatyne,</hi> graunting vnto them Cities to dwell in.

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> therefore came into <hi>Belgio,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse called the Lowe Countrey, where he placed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Cities, garrisons of <hi>Spayniardes:</hi> and then proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Kings Edicte concerninge the establishing of the Inquisition, by whiche hée willed and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the reformed religion to be altered and ordered.</p>
                  <p>Then also he ordeyned a new senate, consisting of twelue men, comonly called the <hi>Bloudy Counsaile,</hi> which should sit vppon all matters concerning lyfe and death. He displaced also dyuers Magistrates, and set others in their roome. After this he tooke a great number and cast them into prison, hauing no regard or consideration of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:27102:345"/>
them what Religion soeuer they professed: to such as were fled the countrey, he appointed a day for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and before the day was fully expired, he adiudged their goodes to be confiscate. Howbeit in the beginning he dissembled this cruelty, and made the people beléeue that whatsoeuer had bin done before tyme for religion should be pardoned by the Kings Edict. And thus were County <hi>Egmond,</hi> &amp; <hi>Horne,</hi> Noble men brought &amp; caught in the snare. And when sharp lawes wer made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inquisition, the inquisitoures were not idle, but played their part, and cast a great number into pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Infantes whych had bin baptised before in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, were constrained to be rebaptised: Women whose husbandes were fled for religion, were constrained to be maried agayn to new husbandes: and at the commaundement of the Duke <hi>de Alba,</hi> many of them were forced to mary with his soulders. Now, the Spanish souldier began to pray and spoile in euery City. Also, when the dissembled clemency of Duke <hi>de Alba,</hi> shewed at the first, had drawen a great many home to their houses againe, the <hi>Bloudy Senate,</hi> was set a worke: some were beheaded, some hanged, and some had their tungues first of all cutte out of their heades, and then a bodkin thrust through their lippes: these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable sightes were dayly to be sene, but specially at <hi>Brusselles</hi> and at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> Diuers Noblemen also were partakers of these punishmentes, as the <hi>Battemburges</hi> which were Bretheren of a noble house, and were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly put to death: but these had more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, for heapes were brought at once to the place of execution. And at the same time, County <hi>Egmond,</hi> and County <hi>Horne,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, and such as afore time had borne great offices, and done to their King and Countrey good seruice, wer also with this bitter reward of cruel tyranny requited: and after they were beheaded, their heades were set vp

It was reported that the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> bare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes both of these an olde grudge, but specially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the County <hi>Egmond</hi> for that which he had done in the affaires of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; not for religions sake, which neyther of them at any tyme had professed.</p>
                  <p>These thinges were done in the yeare of our Lord, 1568: the which we haue heere inserted, though as yet we are not come to that yeare, to the ende the reader might the better vnderstande the order of all the actes and affaires of the lowe Countrey.</p>

of the citie was the County <hi>Daulphin,</hi> of the Kings linage, and of the house of <hi>Borbon,</hi> being a very yonge man, and the sonne of <hi>Monpensier.</hi> Therefore the King and Quéene were sore afrayd least this noble citie shold be wonne: and <hi>Monpensier</hi> being very carefull for his Sonne as well as for the citie, made great mone to the Quéene.

                  <p>This was the end of this second warre, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for the space of halfe a yere, namely, from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of October to March. In the which there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done worthy to be remembred, sauing only that Edict of peace, of the which we haue made mencion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The which was a notable platforme deuised by<note place="margin">The deceit of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks by this Edict.</note> the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> to disarme the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> and the Protestants, and to send away the aid which came out of <hi>Germany,</hi> which hee knew could not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward easely be gotten into <hi>Fraunce</hi> againe, because the Prince had spent his money alreadie, about the affaires past. And yet notwithstanding let all posterities know that the Catholiques had confirmed this Edict by an othe: which they obserued not, but boldly cast aside all reuerence of Gods holy name, the Kings faith, and all the bondes of humane societie: as shall appeare both by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27102:349"/>
that which we will more at large declare, and also by the lamentable effectes, which haue brought great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to this noble Realme.</p>
                  <p>The Edict therfore being brought to the prince of <hi>Condes</hi> Campe, and there solemly proclaimed, euery man reioyced, desiring to sée their wiues, their children and their houshold: and specially they reioyced, because some libertie of Religion was graunted by the Edict. The prince of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de</hi> by and by dismist his Army: <hi>Casmire</hi> after thankes receiued of the prince for so great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, going homeward with his armie: whom the prince very honorably brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on his way. Then he hauing a few attending on him went into <hi>Picardy.</hi> And sending diuers letters vnto the faithfull commaunded them, ac cording to the tenor of the Edict to deliuer vp out of hand the Cities which they held, and the most part of them did so. The King also dismist the <hi>Germanes,</hi> and certaine bandes or<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>French men:</hi> the rest of the armies he commaunded to abide in armour, and appoynted the horsemen a day of payment.</p>
                  <p>But contrary to that which was looked for, these thinges were done, the faithfull being very heauy to sée such lamentable beginnings: nothing lesse than peace séeming to bee meant. For there was great silence eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where of the Edict which was in very few places proclaymed. They which went home to their houses, were either not suffered to enter into the Cities by the commaundement of the gouernours in diuers places: or els such as had leaue to enter into the Cities, were<note place="margin">Greate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iures done to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</note> commaunded to lay downe their armour at the gates of of the Citie: and being entred into their houses were so straitly dealt withall, that they might not come out of their houses nor salute one another without leaue: So that it was better dwelling without the Cities than within.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="484" facs="tcp:27102:350"/>These thinges troubled the faithfull and encreased suspicions, they fearing some new garboyle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both for that there were great garrisons maintained in euery Citie, and also because the Kings armies almost remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whole. Many therfore standing in feare durst not enter into the Cities, but aboade in villages and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey townes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the which notwithstanding a great ma ny were there taken and put to death, by the townes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Therfore they began to straye abrode by heapes through the fieldes and villages: not daring to come within the kenning of any Citie, being feared by other mens harmes: howbeit commaundements came forth willing them to haue leaue to enter into the Cities ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the benifite of the Edict.</p>
                  <p>The Protestants which held any Cities, at the first sight of the princes letters surrendered them vp. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding diuers vnderstanding of this straunge dealinge, were more slow in deliuering vp their Citie. But by the example of the men of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and by the second letters of the prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Dolpheny</hi> gaue vp their Cities: and after them diuers other Cities did the like also. In the which Cities gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons of the Catholiques were presently placed. Now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there were certaine Cities which resisted, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelalbiat, Miliac, Aubenac, Priuac,</hi> and diuers others which were very well reserued: as shalbe hereafter de clared. <hi>Rochel</hi> also refused to receiue any such garrison, pleading for the same their anncient priuiledge, graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by the Kynges of old time. The like also did the men of <hi>Sanserre.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>There was allso a Rescript sent abroade the xix. daie of Maye in the Kinges name, to this effect, Where as I vnderstande that many which professe the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, hauing no regarde to the leaue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repayre to theire Cities, do wander abroade in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fields by heapes, to the greate hurte &amp; disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of many, pretendinge that they shoulde disobeye my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if they shoulde vnarme them selues at the gates of the Citty:</q>

Wherefore I commaunde that those vagrant personnes which walke vp &amp; down through the fieldes, be admonished quietly to goe vnto theire Cities, and to repayr to theire owne houses.

                  <p>Thus the people were brought to tumult, and not only by the meanes aforesayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also by societies and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fraternities made in diuers places, which they called the <hi>Confraternities of the holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> By these Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which confirmed and moderated by consistories, did they prouide money and souldiers for the warre. Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great number of men were gathered togither at <hi>Diuinion</hi> for this confraternitie, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of people, began to cast forth sedicious words, threatening the faithfull that they should haue only thrée monethes vse of their goods to liue by, after that haruest and grape gathering was done: affirming that the Kyng himselfe if he would should not alter there purpose: and, if he once sought to hinder it, they would make a <hi>Moonke</hi> their King. Therfore the raynes of impudent boldnes being losed, all things began to war out of order throughout the whole Realme. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wanted both armour and Cities: all passage both by hill and dale, by water and by land were restrained: the Catholiques were very strong in each condition, with all thinges in a readines for the warre: so that the faithful being thus h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Also, to the end his purpose might haue the better successe, he thought good to followe the counsaile of the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> (with whom he consulted oftentimes by messengers) which was: That the principall heades of those that professed the said Religion should bee taken, and then
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:27102:352"/>
the rest would bee tamed well inough. Wherfore hée sought diligently by al waies possible to take the prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the <hi>Admirall,</hi> the <hi>Andelot,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Odet</hi> his brother, <hi>Rochfoucalt,</hi> and diuers other noble men of the reformed Religion.

                  <p>These great calamities caused the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to complayne oftentymes by his letters vnto the king,<note place="margin">The prince of Conde remoueth to Noyers.</note> but he receyued nothing againe but bare wordes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effecte: and he was dayly admonished, both by mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, and also by the nearenesse of the kings Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to looke to himselfe.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine</hi> was sore offended and gréeued that he fayled of his purpose in takinge of the prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the <hi>Admiral,</hi> which might haue ben<note place="margin">The Card<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Lorrain practiseth to take the Prince of Conde.</note> done so easely and conueniently. But he ment to assaye agayne by other meanes, thinking it best to sée what he could doe, by plain force: notwithstanding so craftely and couertly, that his lying in wayte might not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:27102:354"/>
Therefore he sent some to <hi>Noyers,</hi> to measure the altitute or height of the castle, minding this way too take the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the <hi>Admiral,</hi> who came of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes thyther to conferre with the prince.

                  <p>Moreouer, to weary the prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> there came letters vnto him in the Kings name, straytly chargyng him to make payment of a great su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of money, which the king had payed to the <hi>Germane</hi> horsemen that were souldiours vnder the prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> The summe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted<note place="margin">90000.

Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the King signified vnto him, that he vnderstood not the sayde money was required of all those of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion: but only of those which had borne armor vnder his conducts. And this was vrged agayne with new letters.</p>
                  <p>To the which letters of the king, the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> made aunswere, that in this matter he was greatly vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and to much burthened, complayning of the subtill dealing of his aduersaries: <q>in that they went about too offer vnto him and to all the reste of the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, open and manifest iniuries. The Edictes (sayeth he) are by them broken: the faythfull are worse entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than if they were straungers, and the most wicked creatures in the whole earth: they are neyther in saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in their owne houses, nor in the fields. My house is garded with garrisons of souldiours, which was neuer séene before, that any of the princes (the Kinges kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) should be so handeled. Moreouer of late, a certayn Spye was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which came to take the measure of the

                     <q>And vaunte is made abroad by the Catholiques, that after Haruest &amp; Grape gathering, there shal not be left one Huguenote in Fraunce, without excepting of women and children: yea, they presume so farre, that they dare saye, that if so be your bighnesse wil haue peace, they will make them a new King of a Monke. Furthermore, by the suffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Lieuetenants of the prouinces, there are many conuenticles and brotherhoodes, which they call Confra ternities of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> by which many thinges are wrought contrary to the peace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, among so many iniuries, I beséech your Maiestie and all other Christians, to way and consider, I haue and do behaue my selfe, and not only. I, but also all that are of my profession. Therefore, if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestiè suffer the Edicte (so violently in the sight of all men) to be broken, and the offendours to escape vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished, it cannot be, but there will ensue moste grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouse troubles.</p>
                  <p>This letter was sent by <hi>Theligny,</hi> a noble man, whom he commaunded to declare diuers other particular mat ters which I meane not heare to repeate.</p>
                  <p>About this tyme the King sent to the Lieuetenantes of euery prouince a certain forme of an Othe, according to the which the professours of the reformed Religion, (but specially the Noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) should be caused to swear. To this the Noble men made excuse and sayd, That by this peculiar othe they should haue great iniury done vnto them, as though thei were not to be counted in the number of the rest of the Kings subiectes: whiche also was done contrary to the expresse wordes of the Edict, in the which as the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> is acknowledged too be the Kings faythfull kinsman, and seruaunte, so are they expressely called the Kings faythfull seruaunts.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:27102:355"/>
Therfore thei beséeched the kinge, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they might not bée constrayned hereunto more than other men: if al other men of the contrary religion, were vrged so to sweare, they would not refuse, they sayd, to doe the like, séeinge they could not doe to much in shewinge their obedience to the King.</p>
                  <p>And because this Othe was published in writing, it shall not be amisse to set downe the same accordinge to the very tenour thereof, that all men may sée howe the aduersaries of the trueth go about to abuse the name of God to bring their owne willes to passe. Ye may reade<note place="margin">Victor Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis lib. 3 pers. Afric.</note> of the like in the <hi>African History</hi> in <hi>Hunrich Wandallet</hi> tyme, practised by him agaynst the Christians.</p>
                  <p>The protestantes sayde, that because in the forme of that othe exhibited vnto them, the Catholiques (so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)<note place="margin">the answer of the faith full.</note> were not comprehended, they playnly perecyued, that their fidelitie and obedience past, and to come, was now called in questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and that the security of the kings protection was to them vncertayne. Also they sayd, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were fully perswaded, that the Kings Maiesty had spoken nothing vnto them hytherto, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche was true and vnfayned without all dissimulation, they could not nor would thinke that the same forme of the othe offered vnto them, was knowne to the Kinge, but rather deuised by some notable enemy both to him, and also to the publique peace of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But neuerthelesse, because we desire this one thing (say they) aboue all the reste, namely, to shewe our true and sincere obedience, which we owe to our King, and naturall Prince <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> the ninth, we modestly &amp; humbly desire to make our aunswere to that othe: praying &amp; beséeching the Kings Maiestie, that before he procéede any further in establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the forme of the same othe, it maye please him to consider these our petitions, whiche with all reuerence and submission of mynde wée propose in manner and forme following.</p>

In this therefore there is manifest repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie and contrarietie: because, if I and myne haue borne armour for ani other cause than for the obedience sake which we owe vnto your Maiestie and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the same, then no doubt we should worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be found gilty, both of rebellion and treason. But as we can by no meanes be perswaded that your maiestie would be so manifestly contrary to your selfe, so also I affirme that it may easely appeare that these aunswers were forged and deuised by the Cardinall of <hi>Lorayne</hi> &amp;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27102:361"/>
his fellows, to discharge that poyson which a long time hath lyen in their stomakes, and also to make your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties faithfull and louing subiectes to be suspected of treason and rebellion. Of the which crimes, séeing wee are in no point to be conuinced by the goodnesse of God, we are ready rather to dye, than to suffer the same fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be imputed to vs by the Cardinall and his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: but we wil proue that the matter is far otherwise than they haue falsely and sclaunderously reported the same vnto you. In the meane time I beséeche your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie to consider with what shewe of trueth can these things be spoken, when as I, and others of my brethren were of late admonished of the counsaile had at <hi>Baione</hi> with the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> to the vtter destroying and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of all those, which professe the reformed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within the Realme: if the wayes and meanes, by which I and the <hi>Admiral,</hi> vnder the couller of comming to talke with you at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Castel of <hi>Vincen,</hi> should haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the handes of our aduersaries: of the new mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterings of men at <hi>Paris:</hi> of the letters of <hi>Duke de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> to you, in which you were put in mynde of the holy league: Truly it is not likely that we would haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the comming of the <hi>SwitZers</hi> armies, or the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes,</hi> if we had ment any harme. Can it be denied, but that we haue sought all meanes &amp; wayes possible, that might be for peace? Can it be obiected vnto vs, that at any time from the first beginning of these troubles, we haue required any other thinge of your Maiestie, than the libertie of our consciences, and the conseruation of our liues goods, and dignities? Sauing that among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, when I was at <hi>Saindionyse,</hi> I required of your Maiestie that you would haue some consideration to ease, not onely the Nobilitie, but also the communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of those intollerable burthens laied vpon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And your aunswere being knowne to this our petition, wée
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27102:362"/>
haue not since that time spoken one worde of the same. When we had about vs great power, that if we would haue abused the same, we had not bene able to bee resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, did we then enlarge our petitions? When you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto vs your faith, did not we imbrace the same, making no further request? Was there any other mat ter propounded in the tractatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of peace, than the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our consciences? Did wee not put our liues, oure goodes, and dignities into your handes vppon truste of your promise? Were not we content with the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Edict only? Doth the Edicte of pacification comprehend any other thing, then that which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the conscience? If therefore you haue not tried our mindes in receyuinge the conditions of the peace propounded, and in shewing our selues so tractable: if the sclaunders concerning the violating of your digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, be not sufficiently refuted (as in déede they be in the iudgement of all indifferent men) yet notwithstanding you haue certain and euident arguments of our pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and obedience, when as so redily we vnarmed our selues at your commaundments, and carefully dismist our Armies. Notwithstanding the which sure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted signe of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, we could receiue no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite then that which was contrary to your promises: in so much that your Edictes may séeme to be snares &amp; trappes onely to entangle vs withall, that is to saye, that by the false colour and pretence of peace, we might receiue that iniurie, which by open warre we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sustayne.</q>

                                    <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not that many letters were taken in the tyme of these troubles, by which you commanded your Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, your parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and other of your officers, that they shoulde do cleane contrary to those thinges which were contayned in the Edicte: Let them remember what was aunswered to the writinge sealed in your name by your Secretaries, to the States of <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc:</hi> let them remember what aunswere was made to the parliament of <hi>Tholoz,</hi> against the fower bloudy decréese, by the same commaunded to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for you saide in your letters, that this thinge plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed you well, and woulde alwais be acceptable vnto you, that you greately desired that they woulde deale euer after in that manner, hauinge altogether regarde and respecte to the rescriptes and commaundements, by you allready, or hereafter to be graunted for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions sake: and in suche wise, that all the men of our Religion, and they which by any manner of meanes ayde and assist vs shoulde bee counted as Rebelles. And, to make the matter more plaine by reasons, Is there any City which enioyed the reformed Religion after the proclamation of the Edicte? Naye, is there any City in the which there were any nomber of the faithfull that hathe not had the streates thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with theire bloud? Haue they not in the chiefe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as at <hi>Paris</hi> &amp; <hi>Lions,</hi> soulde the goods of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by porte sale? Was not <hi>Lomen,</hi> one of your priuy counsaile, much abused, first his house spoiled, then, hee himselfe greately oppressed with diuers iniuries, and afterwardes caste into prison, notwithstanding that he earnestly intreated you to haue some consideration
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:27102:363"/>
of him. Is ther any place founde with in your whole Realme, in the which the faithfull at any time till this daie might dwell or slepe in safety? And if any by some miracle escaped the cruel and bloudy handes of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries the former troubles, yet they were caste into prisone, where many starued for lacke of foode, &amp; many as yet remayne in prisone, and are cruelly intreated, as at <hi>Lions,</hi> at <hi>Pny,</hi> at <hi>Tholez,</hi> and in diuers other places. And since the tyme of the Edicte, haue there not some bene cast into prison, at <hi>Cannat, Altisiodore</hi> (or <hi>Auxer</hi>) at <hi>Tholoz,</hi> and at <hi>Belu?</hi> And when your letters are delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them the Iudges make answer that they haue commaundement to deliuer none out of prisone that are in for Religion. What City is it since the peace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Moreouer, is there any one of the reformed Re ligion which hathe not bene in the stelde with me, that is restoared againe to his office from the which before he was depriued? And yet notwithstandinge it was contained in the Edicte proclaymed in your name, that so many of the reformed Religion as had ben depriued from theire offices, shoulde bée restoared to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe. Are not all they banished from your Courte which are suspected for Religion? And to come from the lowest to the highest. What authority haue I in my Lefetena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? what authority hath the <hi>Admiral</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> admiralty? what authority hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

the fielde, banished and depriued of theire Lefetenant ships? Can there be any thinge more contrary to your Edicte tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these thinges? We are sory for these things not because of Ambition, but because we are counted disobedient and breakers of your Edictes: and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are out of hope, to be accounted and handeled as your faithfull seruants &amp; as we deserue, forsomuch as the law is in theire handes, whom we know to be earnest stekers of troubles.</q>

Can it be denied but that after the proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Edicte of peace, there were an infinite sorte of iniuries and murthers committed, of which so many complaints haue bene made to your maiesty? Can it be truly sayde that there hath bene any remedy had, (and muche lesse, that there hath bene any punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) for these thinges? And to proue this thinge, leste I shoulde be tediouse to your Maiesty in expressinge all thinges, I will repeate amonge so many the cheefest, which are not tollerable amonge the heathen and barbarians. And amoungest all other the cruell murther of <hi>Amboyse,</hi> in the which there were a hundered and sortye slayne, of all ages, estates, and sorts of men and women.</q>
                              </p>

                                 <q>If you be remembred, when you could beare with so, cruell a fact, you sent thither <hi>Marshall Cosse,</hi> who, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had found out the authors of so great murthers and had apprehended them, sent worde thereof vnto you. Then the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> like a patrone of theues and murtherers, maintained their cause, and sayde to al your Counsaile, that there ought to be a considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:27102:364"/>
had of those men, which were moued of a zeale to do as they had done: that is to say with such a zeale as his brother <hi>Frances</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had declared aforetyme in the horrible slaughter at <hi>Vasse.</hi> And in deede the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was so handled, by the labour and trauaile of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said Cardinall, that the prison doores were set open, &amp; those abhominable murderers deliuered. And to the ende it might appéere what small dislyke they had of that deed, they brought to passe, that whatsoeuer the men of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys</hi> required, was graunted. But specially they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. That no manner of vse of the reformed Religion shoulde be had at <hi>Amboys,</hi> nor within thrée leagues of the same. The like happened at <hi>Auxer,</hi> where after the peace made were slaine, a hundred and fiftie: where also an infinite sort of mischeues mo were committed: as the taking away of the money which we had proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pay the <hi>Germans</hi> their wages: and the impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and killing of many of those, which were put in trust to carry the same. Thyther <hi>Monpenser</hi> and diuers others were sent to examin the matter: but what was done to reforme this great disorder.</q>

                                 <q>Was not the cruell murther of <hi>Cipierre</hi> with six and thirtie men mo shewed vnto you, <hi>Baron Arci</hi> also na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be the author of the murther? and what other reformation followed them that whiche was wont to be? And yet notwithstanding the Cardinall saith that all things haue bene prouided for. But we affirme, which also is moste true, that there is no reformation prouided any where for any disordered wickednesse, &amp; wicked disorder. But if there hath bene any reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all among so manye cruelties, Murders, Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, forcings of women, Rauishings of virgins, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so many wickednesses of all sortes, commited at <hi>Troy,</hi> at <hi>Orleans, Lions, Valence, Amiens, Theloz,</hi> and in <hi>Maine,</hi> we must then néedes confesse that we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

without cause. But if it be true, shall the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> constraine vs to confesse, that Iustice is there, where iniustice and impunitie doth beare the sway? Shall he make vs beléeue that the Sunne shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at midnight, and the Moone at noontyde? It maye therfore be said, O King, that your Cities are places of refuge for theues &amp; murderers, despoyled of their true and natiue Citizens, full of errors and disolute persons voyde of all order, and depriued of Iustice, and all shew of equitie.</q>

And by those commaundements you shall plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that those warders and souldiers were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to no other ende, than to vexe and oppresse by all meanes the professors of the reformed Religion: and therefore, as they abuse your name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so also they abuse your will most impudently: as the effectes like and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeing with these commaundementes do sufficiently declare: in the writing of the which commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes I do note the style of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine.</hi>

If therefore it were profitable vnto your Maiesty, to appoint Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons to ouersée and watch my house, I would estéeme it for greate honour to spende, not onely my house and landes, but also my life, to obey you. And where as gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons are appointed ouer the Quéenes houses, &amp; ouer the houses of other Noble men, it is done for another consideration. Moreouer I had great iniurie done to me, when I was denied to haue passage into my owne Lieutenantship and circute: the which cannot iustly be done except I were guiltie of Treason, or of some such detestable crime. For wheras I am moued in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene branche, <hi>Not to credit the rumors of neither part,</hi> that truely is very daungerous: for those things which are reported of vs, can be proued by no maner of effecte or déede: as for those things which are reported of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, they are euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proued by déedes.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:27102:365"/>
Therefore he exhorted euerye one to prouide Armour Money, great horse, Gunnes, and all manner of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie: for the which cause, a Treasurie should be made, that therin money might be gathered together for the defence of the <hi>Fraternitie.</hi> And for collecting of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, was appointed the Abbot <hi>Bussier:</hi> and when he had exhorted &amp; perswaded that assembly with many words to be contributors to the Treasurye, he commaunded all that were present to holde vp their hands, vpon that condition, that if warre were moued, euery man shuld to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vttermost of his power séeke to bring those things to passe which were deliberated &amp; deuised by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory appointed to this ende, without hauing any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde or consideration of Father, Mother, Brethren, Sisters, Wife, Children or Kinsfolkes. And when one of those which were present by and by demaunded of him whether your Maiestie would allowe the doing of these things: <hi>Begat,</hi> made answere that you had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die confirmed these things with your letters: and that <hi>Tauuans</hi> had giuen letters vnto his Secretarie, for the better credit whereof, he himselfe being sicke, had sent thither bothe his sonnes to iustifie the same, vntill he could be present himselfe: which he trusted woulde be shortlye. Also he added further, that if your Maiestie should not allow of the same, it were no great matter, because there were others to whom they might safely trust and leane: saying moreouer, that they oughte to haue regarde to those letters, whiche your Maiestie should write to <hi>Tauuans</hi> or to the Parliament concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the obseruation of the Edicte, bycause there was betwene your Grace and them, a speciall and secrete manner of talke, which was not of all men vnderstood. <hi>Tauuans</hi> also sent letters to the men of <hi>Creuan,</hi> whiche were deliuered vnto them the seuen and twenty daye of Iuly: by which his letters he exhorted them to vse

the like societie or brotherhood: promising vnto them that he would bring to passe that your highnesse should confirme and allow the same.</q>

                              <q>The like confraternitie was begonne at <hi>Maine,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble men entering into that societie, being Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, as <hi>Baron Uasse, Tuarsi, Surchi,</hi> and manye others which were either presente themselues, or else confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that societie by their substitutes, whom they sent thither with letters. The like are also to be founde in diuers other places of your Realme. And to the end all men mighte be the more encouraged herevnto, they which were presente at these assemblyes, were tolde, that your highnesse had allowed them by your letters: and to other some which were more subtil, it was said, That the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> wonlde bring to passe that you shoulde allowe all those their doings.

The <hi>Admirall</hi> also caried with him his whole familie, &amp; his brother the <hi>Andelots</hi> wife, with her Sonne, which was then of the age of two yeares: with this weake Army the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> went to <hi>Noyers,</hi> but not without great perill of the garrisons of souldioures wich were at hande.

But being in great perill and necessitie, found out a remedie, though full of daunger &amp; aduenture. Therefore, because the Hauens, Portes, Bridges, and passages were warded with garrisons of souldiours, so that they could not passe, thei determined to goe ouer the Riuer of <hi>Loyer.</hi> This Riuer is in all places for the most part so déepe, that a shippe may passe by the same: Notwithstanding, because the force of the streame fretteth &amp; worketh vp great heapes of sandes oftentimes, there is in certain places the lesse plenty of water. By reason hereof, they found by and by a shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low foorde: ouer the which when an horse had safely passed, the whole multitude followed in like manner. The which passage was wonderfull, séeing the very same place within two dayes after was so depe, that no man might in the same manner passe ouer againe.

you to consider, that we which professe the reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, vse not only one argument, but also almoste one forme of words: and also that it cannot be but that true and sincere fidelitie muste come from so noble a house, as the house of <hi>Borbon</hi> is.

The firste is, the obedience which I owe vnto god, séeyng that I sée, the Cardinal of <hi>Loraine</hi> goyng aboute with the reste of his fellowes, to destroye those which serue the Lorde, and embrace the true religion. The seconde is the obedience of my king, that I may best owe my lyfe and goods, for the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Edict of pacifiation, made by the kings will and consent: and least this <hi>Fraunce</hi> our Countrey, the mother and Nource of so many good men shoulde be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroyed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hir childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

By good right therefore are those things referred and brought before you, which doo appertayne to this defence of the trueth &amp; of the church of God. And truly, as I know that you vnderstand the generall state of our affaires, most noble Quéene, so I pray and beseeche you, perswade your selfe, that there are thrée causes (of the which the least ought to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient) which haue constrayned me to forsake my owne Dominion, and to come hyther.</q>
                  <p>
                     <q>The first cause therfore, is <hi>RELIGION,</hi> the which would haue ben oppressed in this our Realme of <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> by the olde and barbarouse tyrannie of the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> and of those which take his part, that I should (no doubt) haue ben ashamed of my selfe and myne, and to haue had my name reckoned among the faythfull, if so be, to withstand this error and horror, and to defend the trueth, I had not sought all meanes possible, both by my goods, and also with perill of my lyfe: and except al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so my Sonne and I had ioyned our selues with this so honorable a company of Princes and Nobles: All the which are with me determined and fully purposed, by the helpe of the lord God of hoastes, not to spare in thys cause by any maner of meanes, neither lyfe nor goods, nor any thing else which God had lent vnto vs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The seconde cause, whiche also dependeth vpon the first, is, our obedience to the King: bicause the ruyne of religion, is also the ruyne of the King: for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof we are straitly bounde. And bicause my sonne and I haue obtained at the hands of God this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignitie, that we are so néere of bloude to the King, this also, most Noble Quéene, hath constrayned vs to make haste, and to set oure selues against those, which abusing our Kings name and facillitie, doe make him the author of his owne detrement and harme, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:27102:391"/>
(althoughe of himselfe he is moste faithfull and sure of his promises) the breaker of his faith and promises: and that by those subtill meanes and wayes, whiche they haue deuised to breake the Edicte of pacification. The which Edict, as it caused &amp; maintayned peace betweene the king, and his good and faithfull subiectes, so long as it was obserued and kepte, so the same beyng broken, calleth and prouoketh the fidelitie of the subiectes to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and pitifull warre, &amp; so coacted and constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that there is neuer a one of vs, whiche is not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and againste his will drawne therevnto. The thirde cause, moste Noble Quéene, is peculiar to my Sonne and me, namely, for that we sée the olde and sworne enemyes to God and to our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

With these reasons and causes we beyng moued, could not chuse but come together, to the ende that we beyng ioyned in one, mighte lyue and dye together: as also the bonde of consanguinitie wyth the which we are mutually knit together, dothe bynde vs herevnto, that it dothe commaunde vs to doe no lesse. These are the thrée causes (O Quéene) which haue vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to take the sworde in hande. We doe not (as the good catholiques lay to our charge) warre against God and oure King: we thanke God for it, there is no suche treason to be layde to our charge but are faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:27102:392"/>
and subiectes both to God and oure King. Of the which I moste humbly pray and beséeche you to be certifyed and persuaded, and to assist vs with your aide and fauour.

                  <p>And on the contrary part the Kinges Edictes, of the which we spake before, were executed with great rigor against Religion. All the moueable goods of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at the first which were taken in spoyle &amp; reserued by the Magistrate were openly sold: their landes were made to paye great fynes and subsidies, to mainteyne Garrisons and souldiours: Garrisons were set to keepe Noble mens housholdes: and the landes of the faithful by the commaundement of the Kings letters, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be solde.</p>

                  <p>Therefore <hi>Martinenge</hi> when he had wearyed in vayne his souldiers with the extreme coulde of winter he toke vp his caryage, raised the seige, and departed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way secretly in the nighte.

                  <p>Assoone as the said suburbes were abandoned, there was brought down two Canons to beat the foote of the wall, piercing of purpose to make it a house to serue for baskets of earth, the same being perceyued by them in the towne, forthwith discharged certaine volues of the cannon against it, to make it fall, &amp; so enforced the sayd two cannons to be haled away: in the meane while the protestantes laboured to win the suburbes of <hi>Rochreul,</hi> garded by the Captaine <hi>la Uacherie,</hi> skirmishing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually within a vyne, lying directly betwene the sayde suburbes and the castle, where was hoat warre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermission.

                  <p>I haue noted before, that the L. <hi>de Aunoux,</hi> maister of the campe of the regiment of the late Counte <hi>Brissac</hi> was left within <hi>S.

                  <p>The batterie hauing ceassed at the bridge <hi>Anioubert,</hi> from the iiii. of this month, began againe the vii. of the same, albeit not on that syde, but agaynst a towre of the<note place="margin">Battery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Poie</note> bridge <hi>S.

                  <p>After the defences of this tower were raysed, the Princes remoued their péeces to the righte side of the wall of the Abbots meade, thinking that place moste weake of all the towne, and to that effect they planted their canons the nynth of this moneth to make a breach bestowing others in other places to batter the flanke &amp; side, hauing the day before set vp in this quarter vpon the ryuer of <hi>Clyn</hi> a bridge of pypes and boordes tyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with great cables.</p>
                  <p>The batterie was so vehement and fierse, that in small time they had enforced two great breaches, the one neare the other, skowring such defences as anoyed them by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a tower and mylue which were there

                  <p>The breaches thus battered, the Protestants were of mynde to assault them, bestowing (for this purpose) their people in squares and winges, and shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues vpon the hilles in very good order.</p>
                  <p>They first sent certaine Captaines and Souldiers to viewe the breaches, who brought reporte, that they could not be entred without great perill the rather by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the bridge which they had erected vpon <hi>Clyn</hi> (ouer the which they must passe to go to the breach) was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conuenient for the matter, nor sufficient to beare the souldiours that should passe ouer it, neyther coulde the horsemen (what distresse or néede so euer chaunced) goe to the succours of the footemen within the saide Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots meade if it happened that they were charged by the horsemen of the Catholikes.

                     </hi> was taken by night by the L. <hi>de la Roche,</hi> and <hi>Bessonniere,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessoures of the religion in that countrey, accompanied onely with seuen or eyght score men. This was their meane and pollicie: there is in the saide <hi>Orillac,</hi> a gate of quarrie in the wall towardes the ryuer, which the in habitauntes of the place caused to ramme and wall vp, leauinge onely a posterne so straighte, that one person could scarcely enter.</p>
                  <p>This posterne was cloased with two portes or gates of wood, the one within and the other without the town: the saide Lord of <hi>la Roche</hi> and <hi>Bessonniere</hi> came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate without the postern and with a great yron instrument made a hoale or creuish, by the which they cast in about a hundreth poundes of cannon pouder betwéen the said two gates, and then closing vp the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

pouder, they put fire to it, which forthwith flushed with in the saide two gates, and blewe them both vp, the one caried forty pace of, and throwen vppon a house within the towne, and the other inforced with the violence and strength of the pouder, rushed against a wall without the towne, and brake a breach containing his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, by which thei entered the town, wherein was no other garde than of the inhabitantes, whereof they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a hundreth or sixe score resisting them in armoure.

                  <p>The longe continuance of this stéege afore <hi>Poyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> brought the Catholiques in a great necessitie and want of vittailes, aswell for men as horses, and aboue al, forrage was so scant with them, that thei were driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to turne abroade parte of their horses to the vynes, medowes, landes, and other voyde places of the towne, whereof the Princes hauing vnderstanding by certain stragling souldiours issuing out of the towne, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to breake the mylne in the bottome of the medowe néere to the port <hi>de Tyson.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for this purpose planted ouer ii. Canons in that quarter, which they discharged against the sayd mylne, and after retyred them as beyng discouered and anoyed by the Catholikes: who pinched now with an extreme want of vittailes, determined to thrust out of the town a great number of vnprofitable persons, which as they beganne to execute the. xvi. of this moneth, so the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes (to pine and sterue the towne more) driue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> backe with force, to enter the towne againe.</p>
                  <p>For want of pouder and bollets, the batterie ceased for a time, wherof, the Princes hauing receyued a new prouision from <hi>Rochell,</hi> renued also the batterie the. xx.

of August on that side towardes the Abbottes meade, where the breach being forced, they sent in the euening to surueye it by certaine numbers of Souldiers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. xvi. or. xvii. entred by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> breach into the sayd medow, from whence (beyng discouered by the watch in <hi>S.

                  <p>The night following the protestants builded a bridge vpon <hi>Clyn</hi> towardes the suburbes of <hi>S. Sornyns,</hi> to passe to the Byshops meade, stretching towardes the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>S. Rudegonde</hi> and <hi>S.

They made another of the same matter and fashion, and set it likewise vppon the ryuer about. xl. pase distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. These bridges thus made and erected, they bestowed manye baskets wyth earth, aswell neare the first bridge, as on the other side that which was within the Byshops meade, drawing to the suburbes of <hi>S. Sornyn</hi> neare the sayd bridges, part of their artillery beating the defenses of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wall, which are before and right against the sayde temples: Those defenses thus beaten and skowred, the batterie began the morow after being the. xxiii. of August, in that place and the bishops mead. The catholikes labored to their best to repaire their breaches, and had no assaulte that daye: The Lorde of <hi>Briancon,</hi> brother to the countie <hi>Du lude,</hi> goyng the same day to view a platforme neare to <hi>Carmes,</hi> to supply some special want with hys aduise, had his head striken from his shoulders with a bollet: Likewyse the Lorde <hi>a' Aunoux,</hi> stryuing the same daye to driue the protestantes from a Tower which they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed neare the breache of the Abbottes meade, was
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:27102:422"/>
striken in the head with a harquebush, whereof he dyed shortly after.</p>
                  <p>The Lorde of <hi>Prunaye</hi> also beyng amongst his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at the breache, had his lefte legge taken awaye with a Cannon and so dyed. Of the Protestantes syde were killed the Lorde of <hi>Chanay</hi> called <hi>Frauncis du Fay</hi> and one of the Marshals of the campe of the vauntgard hurt with a musket in the arme, broken in two partes.</p>
                  <p>The foure and twentie of this moneth in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Princes renewed eftsones the batterie with twelue or. xiiii. péeces against the wall before the sayde Temples, the same beyng of such vehement furie, that their was discharged that daye more than seuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth shottes of Cannon, which beat a large breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thrée of the clocke in the afternoone, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes ringed in battell vpon the toppe of the hilles towardes the suburbes, ready to gyue the assault, which they entended forthwith to do by the Abbots meade, as hauing disposed most part of their armye on that syde: The Catholikes were busie to reléeue their breaches with beds, faggots, and other matters apt to fill vp.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> beyng at the one breach and the countie <hi>Du-lude</hi> at the other, seyng the enemye prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red strongly and spedely to the assault, rong the alarum bell of the towne, to the ende that euery one myghte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into his quarter. There was a captaine of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes, who beyng followed with ten or twelue and couered onely with his target, ranne ouer one of the bridges within the Byshops meade, and came euen to to the little corner or arme of the ryuer that toucheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wall, and so viewed the breache, whiche he reported to the Admirall not to be sufficiently assaultable, as well bycause the ruyne and breakings of the wal were falne within the towne and had not filled vp the ryuer which runneth at the foote of the wall, as also that they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:27102:423"/>
had raised great trenches and rampiers, whereupon the army retyred in the euening without any assaulte: This daye Captaine <hi>Gascourt</hi> Knighte of <hi>Malta,</hi> was slaine with a cannon, beyng sent by the <hi>Guyse,</hi> to viewe the breache, and consider what was necessary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it.</p>
                  <p>The morrow beyng the xxv. of Angust, the Princes armye was eftsones ringed in order as thoughe they would goe to the assault, the breaches were once again viewed, as well that within the Abbots meade as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>S.

                  <p>The same day the Protestantes bestowed certeyne shot of artillery as well against the Bridge <hi>Anioubert,</hi> as <hi>Rochereul,</hi> wherein were beaten certaine holes or creuisses to auoyde the water out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Abbots mead: the same being filled and stopped againe the same euening by the Catholiques.</p>
                  <p>The rest of this August passed without any great effectes, sauing certain light batteries to purge the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and raze the milne of <hi>Tyson,</hi> togither with certeyn sallies made sometime by the bridge <hi>Achard.</hi> It was thought that the sicknesse of the Admirall and the Lord <hi>de Acier</hi> was the cause why there were no more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts aduaunced.</p>
                  <p>The first of September the princes determined to winne the suburbes of <hi>Rochereul,</hi> to the ende by that meane the sooner to ridde the waters. And bicause they would cut off from such as kept the said suburbes al suc cours and reléefe from the towne, they bent firste cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne Canons against the towre of the bridge of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reul,</hi> discharging vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it aboue an hundreth voleis, which battered a great part of it, winning in the end the vyne whereof is spoken before, which houered and valted on
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:27102:423"/>
highe ouer the streat of the suburbs. This was almost the chiefest place of skirmishe, since, &amp; during the siege.</p>
                  <p>The morrow, they battered the defenses of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle and <hi>Rochereul</hi> bridge, pitching also newe batteries vnder the Nut trées neare the riuer, betwéene the way that goeth to <hi>Hostel-dieu,</hi> at the parting of the suburbes drawing to the meadow towards <hi>Chastelleraut.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Saterday the iii. of September, the battery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the morning against the wall and gate of the sub urbes, which by two of the clock in the after noone had throwen open a wyde breach, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts did spéedely ring themselues in battaill, as well on high <hi>de la Cueil</hi> (where lay a piece that gouerned the Offices of the Castell) as beneath the sayde <hi>Hostel-dieu,</hi> and in thrée squares neare the Nut trées of the place, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> batterie was made. The Catholiques restored the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as much as they could, with vessels, wood, earth, &amp; rampiers: and there were the Captaines <hi>Passac, Nozie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> the Lorde of <hi>Montaill,</hi> and <hi>Carbonieres,</hi> with others, prepared to susteyne the assaulte. They had bestowed about foure hundreth harquebuziers in the Towers, galleries, and offices of the Castell, which flanked all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long as they should come to the assaulte. All which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the Protestants about thrée of the clocke in the afternoone came to the assault, the Lorde <hi>de Pilles</hi> with his regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was the formost, being folowed with<note place="margin">Three as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes of Roell.</note> diuers other regimentes of the French footemen, who valiauntly came vpon the breach, and stood till they had bestowed diuerse blowes with their Curtillaxes: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, they were constrained to turne face in respecte of the flankers, which gréeued them greatly. Immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the second assault giuen by certeyne numbers of horsemen descended on foote with diuers footemen, and they like wise repulsed.</p>
                  <p>These first assaultes being performed by the <hi>French</hi>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:27102:424"/>
men, the <hi>Lansknechts</hi> would néeds followe with a third, which albeit was performed with such courage, as they fought valiauntly vpon the breache, yet séeing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent defense, and general daunger to mayntain it long, they reculed and retired euery one into his quarter.</p>
                  <p>In these assaultes the Protestants lost an hundreth or sixe score souldieurs, with certaine numbers hurt. The Lord <hi>de Pilles</hi> was hurt in the thigh with a small shot, wherof he was spéedely cured. The Lorde <hi>Brique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maux</hi> Sonne, Colonell of the footemen, was also hurte with a harquebush, whereof after certain dayes, dyed. The Lord <hi>de S. Marie Dolphinoys,</hi> with others of mark were also killed. On the Catholiques part were killed, Captain <hi>Passac,</hi> and the Lorde <hi>de Montall,</hi> with a good number of footmen.</p>
                  <p>Before these assaultes, the Catholiques sent two me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the King and his brother for succours, with charge to reueale the estate of the towne and penurie of vittails. The Kings brother hauing assembled as much force as he could, came to <hi>la Haye,</hi> and to <hi>Port de Pilles,</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to beset <hi>Chastelleraut,</hi> to the end to drawe the siege from <hi>Poytiers:</hi> and therefore made to march his vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde right to <hi>Chastelleraut,</hi> lodging the monday, being the v. of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, a quarter of a league from the town The morrow after, his horsemen and part of his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men presented in order of battaill before the towne to view it, all that day being spent in skirmishinge on the other side the riuer of <hi>Vienne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The towne was gouerned by the Lorde <hi>de la Louë,</hi> Marshall of the Campe of the vauntgarde to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: He had first for the defence of it, his owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of light horsemen, and then the Lordes of <hi>Ualauoire, Bressay la Motte,</hi> and <hi>de Royesses,</hi> with vii. companies of footemen, and captayn <hi>Normantes</hi> companie of harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busiers on horsebacke.</p>

                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:27102:424"/>The suburbes defaced by fier, was no place for the catholikes to lodge in, so that they were constrained to encampe further off, which they began to do the same day they viewed the Towne. The artillery brought by the <hi>Swizers,</hi> arriued at midnight, and immediatly appro ches were made, and the Cannons ringed in batterye in two seuerall places, beating notwithstanding al one breach. It beganne the wednesday the vii. of the sayde moneth, very early neare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate <hi>S. Catherine,</hi> betwéene a tower of the said gate, and an other tower more near drawing to the temple <hi>S. Iean.</hi> Such was the furie of the battery as by two of the clocke in the after noone, a breach was forced of thrée or foure score foote wyde: the chaunce fell vppon the <hi>Italians,</hi> to giue the assault, which they did being backed &amp; followed with certain French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. They mounted vpon the breach: wher, albeit they<note place="margin">Assault of Italians.</note> presented xvii.

The <hi>Italians</hi> lost at this assault v. of their Ensignes, which the Protestants tooke from them by force.</p>
                  <p>After this the assault (and the catholikes retired from the breach) Captaine <hi>Bernier d' Auphinoys,</hi> came to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the towne wyth foure hundreth harquebuzears, be ing backt with the horsemen of the Princes uauntgard led by the L. <hi>de la Loue</hi> and <hi>Teligny.</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi> were so crushed at this assault as they had no will to make it good again, neyther was any other thing worthy of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory done that day.</p>
                  <p>The same day, the siéege of <hi>Poitiers</hi> raised to come to xeskue <hi>Ch. stellerant,</hi> marching no further that daye than thrée leagues, by reason one of the cannons misca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and was leste on the place. The morrow after the

                  <p>The Catholikes were also of opinion to go to <hi>Nyort,</hi> and besiege it, and by that meanes to prouoke the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to battell. The Princes campe (according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der resolute aforesayd) was in a perfect readinesse, rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in battels and squares, pitching the nexte morning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third of October, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a little hill néere to <hi>Mont-gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi> well disposed (as is aforesayd) to giue battell if the enemye aduaunced, who also began to appéere and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer on the left hand vpon another round hill, from the bottom whereof they might easily discerne the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Princes armye, which when he had well vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, he retired his marche as though he ment to draw directly to <hi>Nyort,</hi> vsing notwithstanding suche order as his rings and companyes néere together. The Admiral bearing an eye to their doings, espied their pollicie and purpose of procéeding, wherein as he suspected that thei shot at his aduauntage, as labouring to win way vpon him, made descend forthwith the Princes armye from the hill where it was setled, of purpose to gaine and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie the plain afore them, whervpon the Catholiques, in place to march forward, commaunded a sodain stay, holding their pikes vprighte, &amp; ringing them in square and mean battels, turned face to their vauntgard, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by that meanes, the hill from whence the princes army were but now descended. And being maisters in this forte of the hill, aboue the opinion and expectation of the Admirall, began to dispose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to the shock. And at the first descending from the hill, they ordered &amp; ringed their footemen in the valley or side of the foote of the said hill, not without great discretion &amp; iudgement, kéeping by that meanes their footemen in couert, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the storme of the artillerie, which dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vehemently as well on the one as other side. In the meane while the Kings brother dressed and disposed
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:27102:429"/>
two batteries, not sparing his body to trauell from one battell &amp; square to another, with persuasion to the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, to haue good hart: the like also dyd the Princes, visiting in person euery ranke aswell of horsemen as footemen, whose pleasant aspect, &amp; specially in the prince of <hi>Nauarre</hi> gaue cause of singular courage to the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, whose stomakes, besides they were firmely setled in the goodnesse of the cause, yet they séemed to redouble in desire, the rather at the gracious view and persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the yong Prince. Immediatly after two of the clock in the afternoone, the vauntgarde of the Catholy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques went to the charge with a square and wing of 18. cornets of Reisters and great numbers of horsemen, as well French as Italian, who charged altogyther so violently vpon the Lord <hi>de Mouy, and de la Loue,</hi> that they were enforced to endure and take the charge, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thorow the battel of the Lanceknights which grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them sore, notwithstanding the Admirall supplyed the charge, and gaue with such furie vpon the Catholke Reisters, that he cut great numbers of them in péeces, and immediatly with the remainder of his horsmen of the Uauntgard, repulsed with force the vauntgarde of the enemie: whereupon was raised a crye on the Admi rals side, Uictory, victory, the same sounding with such noyse of comfort in the eares of the maine battell, that diuers ranne thither to follow the victorie: when loe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholique mayne battell aduaunced, bending directly vpon the Princes battell, where they were in person. To the Catholiquas battell ioyned a wing of horsemen which came from the vauntgarde. At the beginninge, the battell of the Princes sustayned the charge, albeit, finding and féeling their owne weaknesse, as being not able to fight togyther (as the Catholiques did) were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to disorder and fel out of aray, the horsmen of the vauntgarde dispersed héere and there without order, &amp;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:27102:430"/>
not drawne as yet into any safe pollicie or gard of war, followed also the others, whereby both the <hi>Frenche</hi> and <hi>Almaine</hi> footemen were left naked, whereof the <hi>French men</hi> were first forced to breake aray, and then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes horsemen on the one side, and the <hi>Suyzers</hi> on the other side, began to buckle with the Launceknightes, who séeing themselues enuironed on all sides, neyther present helpe, nor cause of further hope, the rather for that the artillery was planted euen at their féete, let fal their pykes and prostrat themselues vpon their knées, amongst whom rushed with no small fury the horsmen and certayne <hi>Swizers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

After the ouerthrow and spoyle of the Launceknights, the Kings brother pursued the victory half a league and no further, and so encamped in the playn of <hi>Cron</hi> wher the battell was gyuen: he was farre stronger in horsse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and footmen than the Princes, who had not aboue vi. thousand horsemen of all sortes, as well straungers as others: viii. thousand footmen French, and most har quebuziers: and lastly, thrée thousand launceknights. In this battaile the Princes lost their launceknightes, a thousand or xii. hundred French footemen, and about an hundred horses, vi. Canons, two Coluerines, &amp; three little field pieces. The lord <hi>de Autricour</hi> Captayne of a hundred light horsemen, a very foreward and galland Gentleman was there killed: the lorde <hi>de Acier</hi> and <hi>la Noue</hi> taken prisoners, and the lorde Admirall lightly hurt in the chéeke: In the Catholiques army were viii. or ix. thousand horsemen, and xvi. or xviii. thousand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:27102:430"/>
with great store of artillery. They lost few foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men because they fought not, so that their greatest losse consisted in horsemen, which, what with the chaunce of that day, &amp; the encounter before touched, grew to great numbers, with diuers of no small estate, as the Counte <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and the <hi>Ringraue,</hi> the Marques of <hi>Baden,</hi> the yong Counte <hi>Cieremont Daulphinoys,</hi> with many other Lordes and Knightes of the Order: the Duke of <hi>Guyse,</hi> and the <hi>Ringraues</hi> brother hurt.</p>
                  <p>The retraite of the Princes and their army was to <hi>Partenay,</hi> about vii. leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place of the battell, where, as they arriued the night folowing at midnight, so the next morning the iiii. of this moneth, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence with the Admirall, Counte <hi>Mansfelde,</hi> the Counte <hi>Lodowike</hi> and <hi>Henry de Nassau</hi> bretheren, with other great numbers of Lordes, Gentlemen, and Capteynes: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming the same day to <hi>Nyort,</hi> where they found the Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> remayning there euer since they departed: In the meane time they layde the wayes and quarters by the Marshals of the campe, to the ende the dispersed sorte might eftsoones resorte to their Enseignes, which was performed the same daye by the most part of the horssemen.</p>

                  <p>About the eythtéenth day of this moneth, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes made another sally by the gate <hi>d' Aulnis,</hi> and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:27102:435"/>
issuing out aboue the forte, they discended within the ditche by a ladder: there were of this faction (and conduc ted by captaine <hi>la Motte,</hi> (Cl. Souldiours with white shirtes aboue their garmentes, who charging so happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon the Suburbes <hi>d'Aulnis,</hi> found the catholiques playing at cardes, and so without any watch to discouer them, they killed about three score or foure score Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioures, and then retired vppon the false trenche of the ditche by the helpe of their haquehusheares, which were vppon the fort of the gate. They wanne in this exploite two footemen Ensignes. xl. or l. harquebusheares, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Morrions, corcelets, and pollares of stéele, whiche they caried into the town, loosing not aboue two or thrée of their company.</p>
                  <p>The Catholiques in the meane whyle drue néere their artillery which they planted so aptly in a vyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Nyort,</hi> as it mighr beate as well the gate of <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ort,</hi> as the bulwarke of the port <hi>d'Aulnis,</hi> and also the tower betwéene the two gates. Their battery whiche they bestowed there, was foure Canons and a Colue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. Afore they discharged any batterie, they demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to parley, and for that cause would that the lorde of <hi>Pilles</hi> should haue come forth of the towne vppon their faith, which the protestants thought not conuenient for their safetie: albeit, in his place, they sente out of the Towne <hi>la Riuiere,</hi> who was not sooner without, than the Canon began to beat, which caused him to cutte off his further procéeding with spéedy returne.</p>
                  <p>Thus the batterie began the xxii. daye of October, beating the Tower of the Towne neare to the <hi>porte de Aulnis,</hi> and continued all the day, and towarde night it enforced a breach of fortie or fiftie pase wide, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the catholiques sent one of their companie to view it, who being come to the brink of the ditch, and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him selfe to suruey the breach, was killed with a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:27102:435"/>
shot: so that that day passed without assault or any other speciall attempt or acte. In the night the Protestantes with great diligence repaire their breache, &amp; let downe to the ditch certeyne labourers and Souldiours, to ryd away the ruine and broken stuffe of the Wall falne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. These labourers and souldiours afore they came out of the ditche, they set vp a pretie wall of a mannes height, to make the place lesse accessible. Besides, the protestants kéeping still a carefull mynd of their town and estate, considered diligently where, and howe they might be annoyed by the batterie planted in the vyne, which had there remained about eight dayes, withoute discharge of Canon: wherevpon they cast a trench wel flanked behind the breach, vpon the which they bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certeyne Uessells and hoghesheades to pauise their shot. In the effecte, the breache was so supplied, as the place was stronger than afore.</p>
                  <p>From this battery, the morrow after came certeyne thunders of Canon ageinst the fort of the <hi>Port d'Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi> and likewise thrée or foure discharges agaynste the port of <hi>Nyort,</hi> not forbearing notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their first battery. But séeing this battery brought forth smal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte (not many dayes after) they bestowed in place of the canons, fiue coluerines.</p>
                  <p>Remouing the sayd Canons to the entrey of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes <hi>d'Aulnis,</hi> both directly before and also so néere the sayd Fort, that onely the ditch was between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. From thence began a vehement battery against the said fort, as well by these Canons as the Coluerins planted in their place, which bestowed certeyne bollettes flankes wyse, within the sayd breache euen to the Castell The battery continued all the daye, all that night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the next morrow of one violent furye without ceassing, so that both the Fort and the Portall (by which is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie entrie into the Towne) were almost beaten to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:27102:436"/>
pouder.</p>
                  <p>In the meane whyle, the protestants made a couert way betweene the Fort and the gate, to the ende, that the ruine falling from the gate, should not annoye nor hinder the entry of the Fort.</p>
                  <p>After this long and vehement batterie, the Lorde <hi>de Guitiniers</hi> demaunded to speake with the Protestants, and vnder the honour and vertue of their word, entred the Towne the foure and twenty day of this moneth, about two of the Clocke in the afternoone. He laboured to induce them to render the towne, but the L. <hi>de Pilles</hi> remayned constant in his first answere, that ther could no other price buy the Town, than an assured peace, to the profite and quiet of the Realme. Wherevppon the Lord <hi>de Guitinieres</hi> retourned againe and came to the campe without other effect of his purpose.</p>
                  <p>Hée was no sooner out of the said Town, then the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques rushed fiercely to the assault so vnlooked for, that the protestants doubted of their sauetie, the rather bycause the assaulte was maynteyned as well at the breache of the Fort as on the right and lefte side of it within the ditche, the better to come to the gate of the Towne which they had battered (as you haue heard). And for their more easie comming to the breache of the Fort, they had prouided great numbers of pyonners to beare sackes ful of earth and cast them vpon the breach: who besides turning vp the earth, threw stones against the protestants, by which they greatly gréeued diuerse of them. They presented vpon the breach vi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> target men followed with a good number of shot, who albeit ventu red farre to enforce the protestants, yet (being repulsed) they retyred without any great effectes. This assaulte lasted from thrée of the clocke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afternoone til night, during the which was great wast of shot and pouder by the protestantes in sustayning so hoat assault: in the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:27102:436"/>
night they fortified and repayred their breaches as wel as they could, as they also forbare not to do euen in the tyme of the battery, filling them vp as fast as they wer made with sackes of dung. In this night also they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched them selues within the Forte, whereby the breaches, the morrow after, were put in defence.</p>
                  <p>Albeit, the Lord <hi>de Sansac</hi> (after the siege of <hi>Charité</hi>) was sent for to go into <hi>Tourayne</hi> to ioyne with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques camp, as is said, yet (whether it were by cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaundement or other speciall occasion) hee sturred not from where he was: And yet in the same month of October, he besieged the Town of <hi>Noyers</hi> in <hi>Bourgogne,</hi> the which without great resistance he tooke by composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the same notwithstandinge not obserued, bycause forty of the souldiours that defended it, being ledde to <hi>Troy in Champaigne,</hi> and afore they entered into prison, were cut in péeces by the people.</p>
                  <p>After he had taken <hi>Noyers,</hi> he determined to besiege <hi>Vizeley</hi> in <hi>Borgoigne,</hi> gouerned at that tyme by the lorde <hi>de Sarazin.</hi> There was for the garde of it only two com panies of footemen vnder Captayne <hi>Rybaupierre,</hi> &amp; the yong Lord <hi>de Sarazin</hi> with two cornets of horssemen of the Lord <hi>de Blosset,</hi> aud of <hi>Belanseau,</hi> with certayn num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Gentlemen retired thither to ayde the siege.

                  <p>And now, touchinge the siege of <hi>S. Iean de Angely,</hi> it hath ben sayd that the lord <hi>de Pilles</hi> promised to render the towne, if he were not reskewed within ten dayes:

which being passed, and he void of succours, the Lord of <hi>Byron</hi> summoned him to his promisse, to whom the lord <hi>de Pilles</hi> aunswered, that albeit he beléeued that eyther they had stayed the lord <hi>de Personne</hi> there, or else wher, or at least had not sente him to the Princes, yet if they would enlarge his tearme, he would render the town, whereupon they gaue him two dayes more, within the which he dispatched forth of the towne by the port <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> a Gentleman to go to <hi>Angoulesme</hi> and prouide suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.

The lorde <hi>de Pilles</hi> was constant in his opinion, alleadging that of what value or numbers so euer hys succours were, they were such as both suffised his néed and contented him, charging them vpon the instant to drawe backe from the walles. Immediatly the battery began of fresh, as wel vpon the old breach which was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the fort or towre of the wall, as agaynst the fort of the gate <hi>d' Aulnis,</hi> and also against the Castell, agaynst which were bent thrée cannons: this batterie brought downe to the earth the Castell gate, from whiche, they went vppon a bastion or platforme of earth before the Castell: this being well noted of the protestantes, they made another passage within the ditch, beneth the first, and neare to that bastyon of earth, they made an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or window in the wall of the towne, without the which and within the ditch, they set vpp a close pale or couert to flanke the Castell. In the meane while the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes growing cold in their batterie, and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing it eyght dayes, beate downe a part of a towre of the Castel of that side to the suburbes of <hi>Tailebourg,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the hangmans Towre, togither with a great ruine of the walles from the Castell to the old breath.</p>
                  <p>During this batterie, the protestantes made a sally with fifty or forty horsmen, and thrée or foure hundreth footemen by the gate <hi>Nyort,</hi> vpon the which thei erected a bridge of wood to discende to the ditch.</p>
                  <p>The horsemen of this sally were led by Captayne <hi>la Motte,</hi> who charged vppon two cornets of horssemen which were in garde of that syde to <hi>Nyort,</hi> whereof cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne were killed, and some lost their standerds, &amp; one
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:27102:442"/>
of their enseigne bearers led hurt into the town, wher of he dyed foorthwith: the footemen were gouerned by diuers Captaynes, who, charging the papistes in their trenches, made them forsake them, and loose their Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerynes, which were forthwith choked aud fyre put in fyue or sixe barrels of powder.

                  <p>Not many dayes after this sally, the catholiques re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued their canons planted in the entry of the suburbs <hi>d' Aulnis,</hi> and pitched them vpon the brinke of the ditch on the right side of the castell, very neare the battered fort of the gate. There were in this battery six canons, beating as well within the entry of the said forte, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wal from it to the castel which was also bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the other thrée canons aforesaid.

                  <p>This batterie was of such violent force, that in thrée daies and an half (which was the space it endured) there wer discharged aboue xv. or xvi. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth shot of canons, and many killed that laboured to relieue the breach.

                  <p>This peace continued in force, but not in all places, during fiue yeares: for in the moste townes and iurisdictions, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that were affectionate to the Romishe side, whom they commonly call Catholikes, did all the displeasures they could to those of the Religion. Therfore, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Ferdinando Aluares de Toledo,</hi> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly called Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> was leading an armie not farre from the frontiers of Fraunce, against those of the lowe countrey which embraced the reformed Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, against the will of the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Quéene mother, caused to be leuied and brought into Fraunce sixe thousand <hi>Switzers</hi> for a defence, as she caused it to be bruted, but as the successe hathe proued, for this intent, that the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Admirall and other Noble men of the Religion, if they escaped the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons prepared for them, and listed to defende themselues by force, and trie it by battaile, might bée sodeinlye oppressed ere they were prouided. For the courtiers whiche then had the managing of these matters, did not at that time wel trust the souldiers of Fraunce. Many things pertaining to the course of that time, and the renewing of the warre, must here for hast to our present purpose be necessarily omitted.</p>
                  <p>When the warre had endured about sixe monethes, peace was made with the same conditions that wée haue aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, that all men should haue frée libertie to followe and professe the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reformed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For this was euer one and the last condition vpon all the warres. But within fewe dayes or monethes after, it was plainly vnderstoode, that the same peace was full of guile and treason, and finally, that it was no peace, but most cruel warre cloaked vnder the name of peace. For forthwith al those towns which they of the Religion had yelded vp, were possessed and strengthened with garrisons of souldiers of the contrary side, sauing onely one towne on the sea ceast of <hi>Xantoigne</hi> commonly called <hi>Rochell.</hi> For the men of that towne about two hundreth yeares past, had yelded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the kinges power &amp; allegeance, with this condition, that they should neuer be constrayned against their will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27102:453"/>
any garrison souldiers. Also the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the <hi>Admirall,</hi> were aduertised, that there was treason agayne prepared to entrappe them by <hi>Tauaignes,</hi> a man giuen to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mischiefe, which had lately bin made Marshall of Fraunce, and that if they did not spedely auoyde the same, it should shortly come to passe, that they should be deceiued and taken by him, and deliuered vp to the crueltie of their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. Upon the receit of these aduertisementes, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly make haste to <hi>Rochell,</hi> carying with them their wiues &amp; yong children, which was the beginning of the thirde ciuill warre, the most sharpe and miserable of all the rest. There was at that time in the court, <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> whiche (as is aboue saide) was slayne in the first warre, one accompted most subtill and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all the rest, but of a terrible, cruell and troublesome dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, so as he was thought intollerable euen at Rome it selfe. This man, they of the reformed Religion reported to be the most sharpe and hatefull enimie of their profession, and him they abhorred aboue all other for the crueltie of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and named him the firebrand of all ciuill flames. He at the beginning of the third ciuill warre, persuaded the king to publishe an Edict, that no man professe any Religion but the Romishe or Popishe, and that whosoeuer would embrace any other, should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted as traytours. In that same Edict prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Paris,</hi> this sentence was expressely conteined, and for the strangenesse of the matter, and for that it stayned the kyngs name with the most dishonorable spot of periurie and breache of faith, it was in other impressions afterward omitted. And it was further then declared, that albeit the king had in many Edictes before that time permitted the fréedome of Religion, yet his meaning euer was to reteine and cause to be reteined of all men, the onely Romishe or Popishe Religion within his Realme.</p>
                  <p>After many ouerthrowes on both partes giuen and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wheras the end of this third warre was thought likely to be the harder, by reason of the breach of faith in the yéeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and on the other side the state of the Realme by reason of the wast that the Cities were brought vnto, and the extreme
<pb facs="tcp:27102:454"/>
pouertie of the meane people and his husbandmi, did require some treatie of composition, the king sent messengers to the Admirall, to signifie vnto him in the kinges name, that the king himselfe had at length founde out a moste sure waye of peace and concorde, namely, that the armies of both parties ioyned togither, should go into the lowe countrey against the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> which had bin the authour of the late calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Fraunce. He signified further, that he had great causes of querels against the king of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and this principally, that he had inuaded and helde by force, sodenly slaying all the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers there, an Islande of the newe found world, called <hi>Florida,</hi> which had bin taken by the French and kept vnder his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and likewyse the Marquesdome of <hi>Finall,</hi> the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes whereof had but a litle time before yelded themselues to the kinges subiection and allegeance. He saide that the most stedfast band of concord should be that forein warre, and that there could no other better meane be deuised to drowne the memorie of the former dissentions in eternall forgetfulnesse.</p>
                  <p>To the performance herof, he said it was a matter of most apte opportunitie, that <hi>Lodouic</hi> Counte of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> brother to the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> had bin now two yéeres in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles camp, to whom the Admirall gaue principall credit in all things, and that by him and his fellowes of the lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey &amp; other, whom he vnderstoode to fauour his part, it might easily be brought to passe that certaine Cities might be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, and thereby great aduantage be attained to the atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the warre.</p>
                  <p>The Admiral hearing these things was maruellously trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. For albeit he doubted not of the kings fidelitie, yet ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall many thinges fell into his minde to be considered: as the power of the Cardinall &amp; the rest of the <hi>Guisians,</hi> who were well knowne to haue bin at all times most affectionate to the king of <hi>Spayne</hi> For the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had lefte a sonne, a very yong man called <hi>Henry,</hi> to whom the Quéene had giuen al the offices and places of honor that his father had borne before, being vnfit therto by age, and against the ancient lawes and customes, and also through the traiterous infidelitie of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the kinges counsaylers, whom she knewe for their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27102:454"/>
to Popishe Religion to be moste addicted to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish king, and that diuers of them had great yéerely pensions of him, and did disclose vnto him the affaires of the Realme. He remembred howe hereby it came to passe, that the same kinges Embassadour (which among strange nations séemed vtterly incredible) was admitted into the priuie Counsell of Fraunce, and that one <hi>Biragio</hi> a <hi>Lumbard,</hi> and (as it is reported) a traytour to his owne countrey, otherwise altogither vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and specially ignorant of the ciuill lawe, was yet for the subtiltie of his witte aduanced to so g<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>reat honour, that he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Chauncellers office, <hi>Michaell Hospitall</hi> being displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, a man knowen to be such a one, as there was not in all degrées of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any either more wise, or more learned, or more zelously louing his countrey. Herewithall he considered the slaunderous cauillations of his aduersaries, to whom hereby might seme an occasion giuen, as if the Admirall were of a troublesome nature, and could not abide any quietnesse, nor could long reste at home without some tumultuous stirre. Herevnto the messengers replied as they were able, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall alleaged this cause of so sodaine hatred against the Spanishe king, that one <hi>Albenie</hi> late returned out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> had infourmed the king &amp; the Quéene mother for certaintie, that king <hi>Philip</hi> a few monethes before, had poysoned his wife the French kings sister, and had spred rumors of hir through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Spaine, such as for the honour of many persones are méete not to be disclosed. But nothing moued the Admirall so much as the cherefull earnestnesse of <hi>Lodouic</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> who assone as he was aduertised of that purpose of the king, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing that he thought might serue to encourage the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall therevnto.</p>
                  <p>The Admirall perswaded hereby, nothing fearyng the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie of those of the Courte, gaue his mynde to hearken to composition. And so was the thyrde ciuill warre ended, and the peace concluded with the same conditions that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that euery man should haue frée libertie to vse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the Religion.</p>
                  <p>Within few moneths after this, diuers princes of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
<pb facs="tcp:27102:455"/>
that fauoured the Religion refourmed, and among those the thrée Electors, the <hi>Palsgraue,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and the Marques of <hi>Brandeburge,</hi> sent their Embassadours into France to the king, to gratulate vnto him for the newe reconciliation of his subiectes. And bicause they accompted it greatly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe themselues that the same concorde should remaine sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast and of long continuance, they promised, that if any would for that cause procure trouble, or make warre vppon him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within his own dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or without, they and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers should be ready to defend him. To this embassage the king first by wordes, &amp; afterwarde by a booke subscribed with his own hand, answered and gaue his faith, that he would for euer most sacredly and faithfully obserue his Edict of pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hereby so much the more willingly the Admirall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him selfe to be drawne to the said purposes for the lowe countrey, although oftentimes calling to minde the nature of the Quéene mother, he vsed to saye to diuers, and specially to <hi>Theligny,</hi> to whome he afterwarde maried his daughter, that he greatly suspected the rolling wit of that woman. For (saith he) so soone as she hath brought vs into that preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against the lowe countrey, she will leaue vs in the midst.</p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse, the Counte of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> writeth to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they conferring their aduises together, sent messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the king, that if it please him to deale with the matter of the lowe countrey, they will shortly so doe, that he shall by their many and great seruices, well perceiue their affection and deuotion towarde him. The king writeth againe to them in most louing termes, saying that their message most highly pleased him, and he gaue to them both his harty thankes.</p>
                  <p>About the same time <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, pitying the estate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> (as he said) treated by his Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours with the king of Spaine, and had in manner obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the Prince should haue all his goodes restored vnto him, but with this condition, that hée should haue no house within the territorie of the lowe countrie, but settling his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and dwelling elsewhere, he should fréely enioy all his reuenewes. Which matter being reported to the French<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:27102:455"/>
willing him to looke for nothing by that dealing of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, saying that it was but a fraude and guilefull deuise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for this purpose, only to breake vp his leuying of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that he had begon in <hi>Germanie:</hi> and assuring him, that if he would credite and followe him, he would giue him aide suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to recouer his estate.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Aurenge</hi> perswaded by these promises of king <hi>Charles</hi> continued his musters, and determined a whyle to beare the charges though they were heauie to him, whyle such things as were necessarie for the warre, were in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.

Forasmuch as the season of the yéere by this time séemed not commodious to leuie an armie, for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was at hande, by assent they deferred the matter till the next Sommer.</p>
                  <p>These thinges thus hanging, the Prince of <hi>Aurenge</hi> his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines by Sea, did oftentimes set v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And forasmuch as they thought it very auaileable to this enterprise, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Quéene of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, might be brought into league with them, the king committed the dealing in that matter to the Admirall. For a few monethes before, the king had with moste swete alluring letters, gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to the Court, where he was most honorably enterteined: and to take from him all occasion of distrust vpon his aduersaries, or of other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise suspecting of the kinges or Quéene mothers affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him, first, all the <hi>Guisians</hi> of a set purpose departed the Court. Then the king gaue the Admirall free libertie to take with him what companie and with what furniture he would: and bicause it was thought that he had more confidence in the Marshall <hi>Cosse,</hi> than in the rest, therefore the king commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the saide Marshall to be euer at hand with the Admirall, &amp; to assiste him in the kings name if any nede were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:27102:456"/>The matter of the league with Englande, the Admirall so diligently and industriously handled, that within shorte space after by Embassadours sent, and by faithe giuen and receiued, and othes solemnely taken on both parts, it was confirmed. Concerning the procurement of other leagues and amities, such as might séeme to further the enterprise of the low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the Admiral also trauelled in the Kings name, and by his commaundement, and had in a maner brought al these things to an end. And of all those leagues, the first and principall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was, that the libertie of Religion shoulde continue, and that the king should most diligently and sincerely obserue this Edict of pacification.</p>
                  <p>Though these things séemed to be handled secretly, yet by the letters both of <hi>Biragio</hi> the vicechancellor, of whome we made mention before, and of <hi>Moruilliers</hi> whom for his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall leanesse children commonly called the <hi>Chimera</hi> or bugge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, &amp; by aduertisement of Cardinal <hi>de Pelue,</hi> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most fit either to inuent or execute any treason, they were caried to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by aduise of his Cardinals, sent by &amp; by one of their number, called <hi>Alexandrine,</hi> in the midst of most sharp winter into France, with these instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to persuade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king to enter into the societie of the league of <hi>Trent,</hi> whereof the first &amp; principall article was, that the confederats should ioyn their powers &amp; make war against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turkes &amp; Heretikes, meaning by the name of heretikes, al those Princes that did permit the vse of the reformed Religion within their dominions.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinall <hi>Alexandrine</hi> was honorably receiued in the Court, but yet dismissed without atchieuing his purpose. For so was it bruted among the people, and commonly beléeued throughout Fraunce: albeit he himselfe secretly séemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne very mery and chéereful to the Pope: and as it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did somtime say that he receiued such answere of the king as was néedeful not to be published, &amp; that the King &amp; Quéene mother had largely satisfied him.</p>
                  <p>Forasmuch as it was thought a matter greatly auayling to the enterprise of the lowe countrey, to sende certaine shippes into the English Seas, that if any ayde should be sent into the lowe Countrey to the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> out of Spayne, it might
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27102:456"/>
so be stopped, <hi>Strozzi</hi> and the <hi>Baron de la Garde</hi> were appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpose, to whome the King gaue in commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente to rigge forth certayne Shippes of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> and <hi>Rochell,</hi> well armed and well appoynted, and to prouide with al spéede all things néedefull for those Shippes. The Ambassadour of Spayne somewhat moued with this preparation, made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers complaintes to the Kings Councell on the behalfe of the King his master, and yet neuer receiued any other aunswere but that the King thoughte it not likely, and that he woulde sende Commissioners to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> and to <hi>Rochell,</hi> with letters and commaundemente that there shoulde be no preparation made to the Sea, and if any had bene made, it should be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of. What instructions were secretly and closely vnder hande giuen to these two Captaines of that nauie, we do not certainely knowe. But this no man can doubt of, but that they had commission to distresse all such Ships wherein any Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe Souldiers should be transported into the lowe countrie, and that all this preparation to the sea was ordayned against the Spanishe King and the Duke of of <hi>Alua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And moreouer that the Admirall at the same time receiued commaundement from the King, to sende Espials vnto <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which matter was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a certaine Gentleman, one of the Admiralles trayne, who went thyther accompanyed with a certayne Portingall, a man most skilfull of those Nauigations, whome the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had ioyned with him by the Kings commaundemente, and is not yet returned.</p>
                  <p>Nowe it cannot be expressed howe many and howe great tokens of most louing minde the King at that time shewed to the Admirall, and to the Counte <hi>Rochfoucault,</hi> and to <hi>Thelig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and to the rest of the chief noblemen of the Religion. First all such things as in the former warres had bene taken away in the Townes, Fermes, and Castles of the Admirall and <hi>d'Andelot,</hi> the Kyng caused to bée sought oute and restored. If there were any other whome the Kyng vnderstoode to
<pb facs="tcp:27102:457"/>
be beloued and estéemed of the Admirall, or to haue attained any speciall honour in the saide late warres, those he liberally benefited and rewarded. To the Admirall himselfe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded one daye to be giuen a hundred thousand pounds of his owne treasure in recompence of his former losses. When his brother the Cardinall <hi>Chastillio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> endowed with many great and welthy benefices, was departed his life, the king gaue him the fruites of one whole yéere. Also the king wrote to <hi>Philibert</hi> Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> that he should do him a moste acceptable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if he did not onely deale more gently with those that in the former warres had ayded those of the Religion, but also would vse clemencie and mildnesse toward all other that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the same Religion within his dominions.</p>
                  <p>And for that there was old enmitie betwene the <hi>Guisians</hi> &amp; the Admirall, whereby it was to be doubted that perillous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions would arise in the Realme of France, the king wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it to be signified to them both in his name, that they should for his sake and the common weales, giue ouer those displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and he prescribed them a certaine fourme of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and agréement, the same whereof the foundations had bin layed almoste sixe yéeres before in the towne of <hi>Molins,</hi> wher the king calling to him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest estates of his realme, after consultation and deliberation had vpon the matter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the admirall not guiltie of the death of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> wherewith he was charged by the yong Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> and his kinsmen: and so the king by the aduise of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell had ended that controuersie.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the Cardinal of <hi>Loraine</hi> (who as we haue said was the very forger of all the former warres) to take away al ielousie of new practises, was departed to <hi>Rome</hi> and tooke with him his familiar friend the late created Cardinall <hi>Peluey,</hi> one reputed a moste subtill and craftie persone, vnder pretence of going to the election of a newe Pope in place of the old Pope then lately deceassed.</p>
                  <p>But there was none greater and more assured token of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike peace and quietnesse than this, that the king purposed to giue his sister <hi>Margaret,</hi> in mariage to the Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> the sonne of the Quéene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> which Prince had in the last

                  <p>Yea, and also bicause it was alleaged that the said Prince <hi>Henry</hi> was restrained in conscience, so as he might not marrie the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> being of a contrarie Religion, a Catholike and giuen to the rites of the Romishe Church, the king for answere said that he would discharge hir of the Popes lawes, and notwithstanding the crying out of all his courtiers to the contrary, he permitted him, that without all ceremonies, in the porch of the great church of <hi>Paris</hi> the mariage should be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate in such a forme as the ministers of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che mislyked not.</p>

Finally, how muche it reioyced foreine Princes and states that fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the same Religion. But the Admirals minde was muche more stablished by a letter which about the same time <hi>Thelig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> brought him with the Kings own hand and sealed, wherein was conteined, that whatsoeuer the Admiral should do for the matter of the intended warre of the lowe countrey, the Kyng would allowe and ratifie the same, as done by his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. About that time <hi>Lodouic</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quene of <hi>Nauarre</hi> a Lady most zelously affected to the Religion, came to the Frenche Court. The league was made betwene King <hi>Charles</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Aurenge,</hi> and the articles thereof put in writing. The mariage was appointed to be holden in the towne of <hi>Paris.</hi> For which cause the Quene of <hi>Nauarre</hi> during those few dayes repaired thether to prouide things for the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie of the wedding. For the same cause the King sente to the Admirall one <hi>Cauaignes,</hi> a man of an excellent sharp witte whome for the Admirals sake the King had aduanced to great honor, requiring the Admirall to go before to <hi>Paris,</hi> as well for the saide preparation, as also for the matter of the war of the
<pb facs="tcp:27102:458"/>
lowe countrey, promising that he himselfe woulde within few dayes followe after him: assuring him that there was nowe no cause for him to feare the threatnings and mad outrages of the Parisians. For in as much as the same towne is aboue all other giuen to superstitions, and is with seditious prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings of Monkes and Friers dayly enflamed to crueltie, it is harde to expresse howe bitterly they hated the Admirall and the professors of that Religion. Whereto was added a griefe of their minde conceiued certaine dayes before, by reason of a certaine stone crosse gilted and builte after the manner of a spire stéeple, commonly called <hi>Gastignes</hi> crosse, whiche the Admirall with great earnest fute obteyned of the King to be ouerthrowne: for he alleaged, that being erected in the midst of the rage of the ciuill warre, as it were in trumphe to the reproche of one of the Religion, it was a monument of ciuill dissention, and so a matter offensiue to peace and concorde.</p>
                  <p>The King well knowing the deadly hate of the Parisians to the Admirall, wrote his letters to <hi>Marcell</hi> the prouost of the Marchaunts (which is the highest dignitie in <hi>Paris</hi> with sharp thretnings if ther shuld be raised any stir or trouble by reason of the Admirals comming. To the same effect also the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> the Kings brother, and the Quéene mother wrote to the same <hi>Marcell</hi> and the rest of the Magistrates of <hi>Paris,</hi> so that nowe there séemed vtterly no occasion lefte for the Admirall to feare or distrust. And within few dayes after, the King sent <hi>Briquemault</hi> a man of great vertue and estimation, to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, with the same instructions, saying that the matter of the low cuntrey could not wel be delt in without his presence.</p>
                  <p>The Admirall persuaded by thus many meanes, and filled with good hope and courage, determined to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> where so soone as he was ariued, and had ben honorably and louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained of the King and his brethren, and the Quéene mother, and consultation entred among them about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the lowe countrey, he declared to the King at large, howe the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> was in leuying of great power, and preparing an armie, and that if the King should dissemble his purpose, it woulde come to passe that many thereby would shewe themselues slower and slacker to the enterprises, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27102:458"/>
that nowe were offered great meanes to do good, whiche if he let slippe, he should not easily recouer the like againe hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore it was best to take the aduantage of this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie.</p>
                  <p>A fewe dayes before, <hi>Lodouic</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> went secretely into the frontiers of the lowe countrey, and toke with him as part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his iourney and priuie to his councell, thrée Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great credite with the Admirall, namely <hi>Saucourt, la Noue,</hi> and <hi>Genlis,</hi> to whome the King hadde giuen in charge to sée if they coulde by any meanes attempt and possesse any townes bordering vpon his Realme. They gathering diuers other Gentlemen into their companie, wente spéedily into the lowe countrey, the Admirall not knowing of it. Who as soone as he vnderstoode of their going thither, wrote vnto them that he much maruelled what they ment, saying that he well knewe there coulde be no power gotten readie before fortie days end, and that they should be well aduised to do nothing rashly, nor to ouerthrowe with hast their deuises that séemed not ripe to be executed.</p>
                  <p>The Countie of <hi>Nassaw</hi> inflamed with the sight and desire of his countrey, and fearing the mutablenesse of the King, did first at the sodaine set vpon <hi>Valentiennes,</hi> but being repulsed by the Spanishe Souldiers that were in garrison in the Castell, he hastily departed to <hi>Montz</hi> and toke the town, being a place very strong by nature and well furnished with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for the warre. Which thing being by report and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sangers spread abroade into the lowe countrey, and caried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fraunce and Germanie, bothe encouraged all them of the Religion with great hope, and also séemed to haue now plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and openly deciphered and disclosed the mynd of the French King. Moreouer <hi>Genlis</hi> returning to <hi>Paris,</hi> when he had made report to the King of all the matter as it had procéeded, easily obtayned of him, that by his assente he might leuie certaine bandes of footemen and horssemen of Fraunce, and carie them to succoure <hi>Montz.</hi> But by the way when he was entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bounds of the low countrie, hauing with him to the number of 4000. footemen, and about 400. horssemen, they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set by the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> and the most parte of them distressed:
<pb facs="tcp:27102:459"/>
whiche thing was well knowne to haue bene wrought by the meanes of the <hi>Guisians,</hi> whiche by dayly messages and letters, aduertised the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> of their purpose and preparation. Which falsehood of theirs, many moste affectionate to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Religion were highly offended with, bicause a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were addicted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Romish Religion in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie.</p>
                  <p>With this losse, and with the rescue of the towne of <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King semed to be much troubled, for he feared least his counsels being disclosed to the Spanish King, would at length bréede some cause of querell and warre. Howbeit, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to remember, that a great part of his secretes was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die reuealed to the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> he oftentimes resolued to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his minde plainly, and to make open warre. But he was withdrawne from that purpose by certaine men whiche the Admirall had long before conceiued, that they woulde so doe. Howbeit, he gaue the Admirall libertie to sende what soeuer he thought meete to further the Prince of <hi>Aurenge</hi> his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, and as great supply either of footemen or of horssemen as he could to the armie which the Prince of <hi>Aurenge</hi> had leuied in Germanie. When the Admiral for that cause had made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest that he might leuie thirtie troupes of horssemen, and as many ensignes of footemen, he easily obtayned it.</p>
                  <p>For the entertainement of these footmen it behoued to haue money, wherfore at the request of the Admirall, the King cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for his Tresurer and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to deliuer to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall so muche money as the Admirall should thinke méete, and charged him, that he should not in any wise after the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all maner of the accompts of finances, write the causes of the receipt, but onely set it downe in this forme: This summe of money was payde to the Admirall suche a daye by the Kings commaundement, for certaine causes which the King hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded not to be written: and to this warrant the King subscribed with his owne hand.</p>
                  <p>Also the King wrote to <hi>Monducet</hi> his Embassadoure in the lowe countrey, to trauell as earnestly as he could, for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, that were taken at the ouerthrow of <hi>Genlis,</hi> whiche commaundement it is sayde that <hi>Monducet</hi> did most faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diligently execute.</p>

                  <p>When the day came, the mariage was with royall pompe solemnized before the great Churche of <hi>Paris,</hi> and a certaine forme of wordes so framed, as disagréed with the Religion of neither side, was by the Kings commaundement pronounced by the Cardinall of <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of <hi>Conde,</hi> sonne of <hi>Lewes,</hi> and the Admirall, and other noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same Religion, walked without the Churche dore, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the Brides returne.</p>
                  <p>While these thinges were in doing at <hi>
                        <hi>Paris,</hi> Strozzi,</hi> who as we haue sayde, had the charge of the Kings power at the Sea, houering vpon the coast of <hi>Rochel,</hi> did now and then send of his Captains and Souldiers into the towne, vnder colour of buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things necessarie: &amp; sometime he came thither also himself. The like was done at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same time in an other part of France, by the horsmen of <hi>Gonzague</hi> Duke of <hi>Niuers</hi> neare to the town of <hi>la Charite,</hi> whiche hath a bridge ouer the Ryuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> and remained till that time in the power of those of the Religion, by reason of the great number of them there inhabiting. This troupe was of those horssemen whiche the King hath accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to kéepe in ordinarie wages in euery countrey, whereof the moste parte were Italians, countrimen to their Captaine <hi>Lewes Gonzague,</hi> to whome the Quéene mother had giuen the daughter and heire of the Duke of <hi>Niuers</hi> in mariage. They requested of the townesmen, that they might make their mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters within the towne, saying that they had receiued warrant from the King so to do, and shewed the Kings letters therfore. At <hi>Lions</hi> the gouernour of the towne, commaunded a viewe to be taken of all those that professed the Religion, and their names to be written in a boke and brought vnto him: which boke shortely after, according to the successe, was called the bloudie boke.</p>
                  <p>After the mariage ended at <hi>Paris,</hi> whiche was the time that the Admirall had appointed to returne to his owne house, he moued the King concerning his departure. But so great was the preparation of playes, so greate was the magnificence of banquets and shewes, and the King so earnestly bent to those matters, that he had no leysure, not only for waightie affaires but also not so much as to take his naturall sleepe. For in the French Court, Dauncings, Maskings, stageplayes (wherein the King excéedingly delighteth) are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vsed in the night time: and so the time that is fittest for counsell and matters of gouernance, is by reason of nightly riottous sitting vp, of necessitie consumed in sléepe. So great also is the familiaritie

men and the women of the Quéene mothers trayne, and so greate libertie of sporting, entertainement and talking togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to foreine nations may séeme incredible, and be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght of al honest persons a matter not very conuenient for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of noble yong Ladies chastitie. Moreouer, if there come any Pandor or bawde out of Italie, or any Scholmaster of shamefull and filthy lust, he winneth in shorte time maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fauour and credite. And such a multitude is there begon to be of Italians, commonly throughout all Fraunce, specially in the Court, since the Administration of the Realme was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Quéene mother, that many do commonly call it <hi>Fraunce-Italian,</hi> and some terme it a <hi>Colonie</hi> and some a common sinke of <hi>Italie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These madnesses of the Court, were the cause that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral could not haue accesse to the Kings speach, nor entrance to deale in waightie matters. But when they that were sente from the reformed Churches to complaine of iniuries commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done to those of the Religion, vnderstoode of the Admirals purpose to depart, they did with all spéede deliuer to him their bookes and petitions, and besought him, not to depart from the Court till he had dealt in the cause of the Churches, and dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered their petitions to the King and his Counsell. For this cause the Admirall resolued to deferre his going for a while, till he might treat with the Kings Counsell concerning those requests: for the King had promised him that he would shortly entend those matters, &amp; be present with the Counsel himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Besides this delay, there was an other matter that stayed him. There was owing to the Rutters of Germanie, which had serued on the part of the Religion in the last warre, great summes of money for their wages, in whiche matter the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall trauelled with incredible earnestnesse and care.</p>

a window of a house néere adioyning, shot y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admiral with two bullets of leade through both the armes. When the Admirall felte himselfe wounded, nothing at all amazed, but with the same countenance that he was accustomed, he sayde, throughe yonder windowe it was done: goe sée who are in the house: What manner of trecherie is this? Then he sente a certaine gentleman of his company to the King to declare it vnto him. The King at that time was playing at tennise with the duke of <hi>Guise.</hi> Assone as he heard of the Admirals hurt, he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellously moued as it séemed, and threw away his racket that he played with on the grounde, and taking with him his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawe the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> he retired into his Castle.</p>
                  <p>The Gentlemen that were with the Admirall, brake into the house fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he receiued his hurt, there they found on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one woman, the kéeper of the house, and shortely after also a boy, his lackey that had done the déede, and therewithall they founde the harquebuze lying vpon the table in that Chamber from whence the noyse was heard: him that shot they founde not, for he in great hast was runne away out at the back gate, and getting on horssebacke, whiche he hadde wayting for him readie sadled at the dore, he rode a great pace to S. Anthonies gate, where he had a fresh horsse tarying for him, if néed were, and an other at <hi>Marcels</hi> gate. Then by the Kings commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement a great number rode out in post into all parts to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue him: but for that he was slipped into bywayes, and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into a certaine Castle, they could not ouertake him.</p>
                  <p>At the sute of the King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> &amp; other, the King by and by gaue commission for enquirie to be made of the matter, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the examining thereof to thrée chosen persons of the Parliament of <hi>

                  <p>Firste, it was founde that the same house belonged to a Priest a Canon of S.

Then the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we sayd was found in the house, being taken &amp; brought before them, confessed that a fewe dayes before, there came to hir one <hi>Challey</hi> somtime a master <hi>d'hostel</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Guises</hi>

house, and nowe of the Kings Courte, and commaunded hir to make muche of the man that had done this deede, and to lodge him in the same bed &amp; Chamber where <hi>Villemure</hi> was wonte to lye, for that he was his friende and very familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that <hi>Villemure</hi> would be very glad of it. The name of him that shot was very diligently kept secret. Some saye it was <hi>Manreuet,</hi> which in the thirde ciuill war tratorously slew his Captaine <hi>monsieur de Mouy,</hi> a moste valiante and noble Gentleman, and straightway fled into the enimies campe. Some say it was <hi>Bondot,</hi> one of the archers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings guard. When the womans confession was brought to the King, he immediatly called <hi>Monsieur de Nance,</hi> Captaine of his guarde, and commaunded him to apprehend <hi>Challey</hi> and bring him to him. <hi>Challey</hi> assoone as he heard the stroke of the péece, fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings Castle called the <hi>Louure,</hi> and hid him in the duke of <hi>Guises</hi> chamber, from whence he conueyed himselfe awaye assoone as he had heard of the kings commaundement. When <hi>de Nance</hi> was informed of his departure, he aunswered that <hi>Challey</hi> was a Gentleman of good worship, and there was no doubt but when neede were he would appeare before the King and the Magistrates.</p>
                  <p>While these things were doing, and the Admirals wounde in dressing, <hi>Theligny</hi> went by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to the king, and moste humbly besought him in the name of his father in lawe, that his Maiestie would voutsafe to come vnto him, for that his life séemed to be in perill, and that he hadde certaine things to say, greatly importing to the Kings safetie, which he well knewe that none in his Realme durst declare to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie. The King courteously answered that he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go to him, and within a little while after he sette forwarde. The Quéene mother went with him, and the Duke of <hi>Aniow,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monpensier,</hi> a most affectionate subiect to the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Count <hi>de Rhetz,</hi> the Queene mothers great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, <hi>Chauigny</hi> and <hi>Entragny,</hi> whiche afterwarde were chiefe ringleaders in the butcherie of <hi>Paris.</hi>

had answered with such a milde and quiet countenaunce, that all they that were present wondered at his temperance and patience, the King being much moued (as it séemed) sayd, The hurt my Admirall is done to thée, but the dishonour to me: but by the death of God (saith he) I swear I wil so seuerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge bothe the hurte and the dishonor, that it shall neuer be forgotten. He asked him also howe he liked of the Iudges that he had chosen, to whome he had giuen commission for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the matter. The Admirall answered that he coulde not but very well like of those that his maiestie had allowed of, yet he besought him if he thought it good, that <hi>Cauagnes</hi> mighte be called to counsell with them, albeit that it was no hard matter to find out, for it was no doubt (sayde he) that this good turne was done him by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the reuenge whereof he referred to God. This onely he most heartily and humbly besought of his royall maiestie, that the facte might be duely enquired vpon. The King answered that he would take earnest care of it, and reuenge that iniurie with no lesse seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie than if it had bin done to himselfe. Then the Kings bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and their mother withdrawing themselues a while, the Admirall as it was afterwarde knowne by his owne report, began to aduise the King to haue in memorie those things that he had ofte tolde him of the daungerous intentions of certain persons: and he tolde him, that though he himselfe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a great wounde, yet there was no lesse hanging ouer the Kings heade: and that long ago there was treason in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing against his life, which if he would doe wisely he shoulde auoyde betimes. Further he sayd, that though so soone as God should take him to himselfe out of this life, he doubted not but that his fame should be brought into sundrie slaunders by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious persons, and such as ought him euil wil by reason of the late warres, neuerthelesse he had oftentimes disclosed vnto the King the authors of the dissentions, and opened the causes thereof, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherto this speech of the king tended could not then be vnderstoode.

Then the Count <hi>de Rhetz</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to certaine Gentlemen of the Admirals friendes, sayde, I would the Admirall would follow the Kings counsell, for it is to he feared that some suche stirmay aryse in the towne, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king shal not easily be able to appease. Which speach being vttered, although no man did yet suspecte whereto that aduise tended, yet the Admirall and his friendes thought it good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the King to assigne vnto him certaine of the souldiers of the guarde for his safetie. The King answered that he verie well liked of that deuise, and that he was fully determined to prouide aswell for the Admirals safetie as for his owne, and that he would preserue the Admirall as the ball of his eye, and that he had in admiration the constancie and fortitude of the man, and that he neuer before that time beleeued that there could be so great valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tnesse of courage in any mortal person.</p>

For all the chiefe Captaines were fast closed vp in <hi>Paris,</hi> and the rest in other townes were all vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and vnprepared, and that there were scarcely to be found tenne enimies to a thousande Catholikes: that the Parisians were in armour, and were able to make thréescore thousande chosen fighting men, and that within the space of one houre al the enimi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:27102:463"/>The Quéenes opinion was allowed. Howbeit it was thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght best, partely for his age, and partly for the affinities sake, that the King of <hi>Nauars</hi> life should be saued. As for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> it was doubted whether it were best to spare him for his age, or to put him to death for hatred of his fathers name. But herein the opinion of <hi>Gonzague</hi> toke place, that he should with feare of death and torment, be drawne from the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>When the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> thought all things readie enough, he called to him the abouesayde <hi>Marcell,</hi> and charged him that he should a little after midnight assemble togither the masters of the streates, whom they call Diziners, into the townhouse, for he had certaine strange and speciall matters in charge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King, which his pleasure was to haue declared vnto them.

And many other most flourishing yong noblemen and Gentlemen were euery where butcherly murthered in that streat.

                  <p>While these things were thus a doing in the towne, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whome the King had lodged in his owne Castle of the <hi>Louure,</hi> were by the Kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:27102:466"/>
succour, were thrust out of the Chambers, and by the Kyngs guarde of Switzers hewed in pieces and slaughtered in the Kings owne sight. But of that number of persons slayne, no mans case was so much lamented of many, as <hi>Monsieur de Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> in whome it is harde to expresse whether there were more godly zeale in Religion, or prowesse in warre. Whereby ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the late yeres, specially in the defence of the towne of S. Iohn <hi>d'Angeli,</hi> whiche the King then besieged, gotten great honour of Cheualrie, he was thought very well beloued and highly estéemed of the King. Him and <hi>Leranne</hi> the sonne of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dou,</hi> by the Frenche Kings commaundement (which was not then vnderstoode whereto it tended) the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hadde stayed in a Wardrobe adioyning to his owne chamber, and caused<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them to lodge there all night. A little asore daye, hearing of the running of men, and noyse of armour, and cries and killings, they rose in hast, and immediately <hi>de Nance</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue before spoken of, came to them, and commaunded them in the Kings name to come downe into the court, and to leaue their weapons behinde them, and lastly to depart out of the Castle. When <hi>de Pilles</hi> saw himself thrust out among the multitude of the murthering souldiers, and behelde the bodies of them that were slayn, he cryed out with a very loude voyce that the King might wel heare him, protesting vpon the kings fidelitie, and deteu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing his trayterous infidelitie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he toke off a riche cloake which he wore, and gaue it to one of his acquaintance, saying: take here this token of <hi>Pilles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp; hereafter remember <hi>Pilles</hi> moste vnworthily and shamefully slayn. Oh my good <hi>Monsieur de Pilles,</hi> sayd the other, I am none of them: I thanke you for your cloake, but I will not receiue it with that condition, and so refused to take the cloake: and immediatly <hi>de Pilles</hi> was thrust through by one of the guarde with a partisan and dyed And this ende had this most valiant and noble Gentleman. And then his body was throwne into the quarrey with the rest, which when they that passed by dyd beholde, the souldiers cryed out, there they be that made as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault vpon vs, and woulde haue killed the King. <hi>Leranne</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrust through with a sworde, escaped and ranne into the Quéene of <hi>Nauarres</hi> Chamber, and was by hir kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued

from the violence of those that pursued him. Shortly after, she obtayned his pardon of hir brother, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to hir own Phisitions, who restored hym bothe to life and health.</p>
                  <p>While these things were in doing at <hi>
                        <hi>Paris,</hi> Strozzi.</hi> which (as we haue aforesayd) was come with al his power to <hi>Rochel,</hi> sent a great number of his Souldiers into the towne, vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loure of a banket to be made to his friendes in the Castle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>la Cheine:</hi> but by reason of the iealosie and watches of the townes men, by whome he sawe his treason was espied, he went awaye without his purpose. But they of <hi>la Charité,</hi> which as we haue before shewed, were trapped by the Italian horssemen, taking lesse heede to the salfe keeping of their towne, were a little before nyght, surprized, and within fewe dayes after put to the sworde.</p>
                  <p>The next day following, where any that had hidden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in corners at <hi>Paris</hi> coulde be founde out, the slaughter was renewed: also common laborers and porters, and other of the most rascals of the people &amp; desperate villaines, to haue the spoyle of their cloathes, stripped the dead bodies stark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and threwe them into the Ryuer of <hi>Seane</hi> The profit of all the robberies and spoyles came all for the moste parte to the handes of these laborers and the Souldiers, and to the Kings treasurie came very litle or nothing. The onely gaine that came to him, was that whiche might be made of the vacati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as they terme them) of offices, &amp; of places of Magistates, Captaines and other romes of charge, whereof yet he gaue a great part freely away to diuers of the Court. For the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralles office he gaue to the Marques <hi>de Villers,</hi> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellorship of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> after the murther of <hi>Francourt,</hi> he by and by gaue <hi>Henry Memne de Malassise,</hi> which had béene the truch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and messanger in the treatie of the last peace: the office of the master of the Finances after the slaugheer of <hi>Prunes</hi> he gaue to <hi>Villequier:</hi> the office of <hi>President des aides</hi> when <hi>Plateau</hi> was slayne he gaue to <hi>de Nully:</hi> the other offices he solde as his manner is, to such as gaue readie maney for them. For it hath bin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> custome now lately of certen kings of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (such as amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g forein nations hath not bin heard of) to put to sale al

the profits, rights, and benefits of the crowne, and to kéepe an open market for money, of all iudiciall offices, and of all the roomes belonging to his tresure and finances, according to a rate of price set vpon euery one of them: and there is not in manner one in all Fraunce, that doth not openly iustifie that he bought his office for readie money, and that no man ought to maruell if he desire to fill vp the emptie hole of his stocke againe. And therefore Iustice is through all Fraunce vsually bought for money, and though there be neuer so many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders committed, yet is there no processe awarded to enquire thereof, till present coyne be payde to the rakehels &amp; scribes.</p>
                  <p>This butcherly slaughter of <hi>Paris</hi> thus performed, and foure hundred houses (as is abouesayde) sacked, immediatly messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were sent in post into all the partes of the Realme, with oft shifting their horsses for hast, to commaunde all other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Kings name to followe the example of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to cause to be killed as many as they had among them of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion.</p>
                  <p>These commaundements it is wonderfull to tell how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and cherefully the greatest part of the Cities of Fraunce did obey and execute. But the King, fearing (as it was likely) the dishonour of false treacherie and periurie, sent letters to the gouernours of his Prouinces, and also spéedie messangers into England, Germanie, and Switzerland, to declare in his name, that there was a great commotion and seditious stirre happened at <hi>Paris,</hi> which he was very sorie for: that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had raysed the people, and with armed men made as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault vpon the band that was assigned to the Admirall for his guard, and had broken into the house and slayn the Admirall &amp; al his companie and houshold seruants, and that the King had hardly kept safe from those daungers his owne Castle of the <hi>Louure,</hi> where he kept himselfe close with his mother and hys brethren: the true copie of which letters is hereafter inserted. But the same most mightie, and by the consent of all nations commonly called the most Christian King, within two dayes after came into the Parliament, accompanied with a greate trayne of his brethren and other Princes. The Counsell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assembled, he sitting in his throne, began to speake vnto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27102:467"/>
them, he declared that he was certified, that the Admirall with certaine of his complices had conspired his death, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the like purpose against his brethren, the Quéene his mother, and the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and that for this cause he had commaunded his friendes to slay the sayde Admirall and all his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federates, &amp; so to preuent the treason of his enimies.</p>
                  <p>This his testification and declaration, the King commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be written and entred in the recordes of Parliament, and that it shoulde be proclaymed by the heraldes, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by Printers. And he willed a booke to be set forth to this effect, that the slaughter of the Admirall and his adherentes was done by the Kings commaundement, for so was his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties expresse pleasure, bicause they had conspired to kil him and his brethren, and the Quéene his mother and the Kyng of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> And farther, that the King did forbid that from thenceforthe there should be no moe assemblies holden, nor preachings vsed of the Religion.</p>
                  <p>After the Kinges oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ended, <hi>Christopher Thuane</hi> Preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a man very notable for his light brain and his cruell heart, did with very large wordes congratulate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, that he had now with guile and subtiltie ouercom these his enimies, whome he could neuer vanquishe by armes and battell, saying that therein the King had most fully very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the olde saying of <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleuenth his progenitor King of Fraunce, which was wont to say that he knew neuer a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine sentence but this one, <hi>
                        <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare,</hi> He that can not skil to dissemble, can not skil to be a King.</hi> But <hi>Pibrace,</hi> the aduocate of the Fina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, made a short oration, the summe whereof was to this effecte, that although the King hadde iust and great cause to be displeased, yet he thought it more agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with his maiesties clemencie and goodnesse, to make an ende of the slaughters and common spoyle, and not to suffer such outrages to be any longer committed without iudiciall procéeding in the cause: and besought his maiestie that from thenceforth it would please him to vse the lawe, which is well knowne to be the onely stablishment of kingdomes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires: and that there had bene already giuen to the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie too perillous an example to followe. An arrest of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:27102:468"/>
with the Kings royall assent being made to that effect, there were immediately Haroldes and trumpeters sent rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about all the towne, and an Edict proclaimed in the Kings name, that from thenceforth the slaughters and common but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly murtherings should ceasse, and that all persons should abstainc from pillage and robberie.</p>
                  <p>This being knowne, there were diuers speaches vsed of this matter throughout the town, and specially of learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The most part sayd, that they had read many histories, but in all memorie of all ages they neuer heard of any such thing as this. They co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared this case with the horrible doings of King <hi>Mithridates,</hi> which with one messenger and with the aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one letter, caused a hundreth and fiftie thousand Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to be slaine. Some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared it with the doing of <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Arragone,</hi> which slewe eight thousand Frenchmen in <hi>Sicile,</hi> which Isle they had surprised in his absence. But yet this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference appeared betwene those cases and this: that those Kings had exercised their crueltie vpon foreins and strangers: but this King had done his outrage vpon his owne subiectes, being yelded not so much to his power, as to his faith and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Those Kings were bound by no promise, but such as was giuen to the strangers themselues: this King was with newe made league bound to the kings and Princes his neighbors to kepe the peace that he had sworne. Those kings vsed no guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes vnworthie for the maiestie of a King, to deceyue: this king for a baite and allurement abused the mariage of his owne sister, and in a manner besprinkled hir wedding robe with bloud. Which dishonor and indignitie no posteritie of all ages can forget. Some againe discoursed, that though this cruell aduise semed to many Courtiers to haue bene profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet not onely the honor of a King, but also the estimation and good fame of the whole nation was against that shewe of profit. They alleaged how <hi>Aristides</hi> did openly in the audience of all the people, reiect the counsell of <hi>Themistocles</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the burning of the Lacedemonians nauie, although it must needes haue followed, that the power of the Lacedemonians their enimies should therby haue bene vtterly weakened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Some ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the lawe of the twelue tables: <hi>Si patronus clienti fraudem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, sacer esto.</hi> If the patrone or soueraigne defraude his client or vassall, be he out of protection. They disputed also, that like faith as the vassal oweth to his Lord, the Lord oweth also to his vassall: and for what causes and for what fellonies the vassal loseth his tenancie, for the same causes and fellonies the Lord loseth his seigniorie. Some said that the right hand in auncient time was called the pledge of the faith of a King, and that this if a King shall despise, there is no communion of right with him, and he is no more to be accounted a king, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his owne subiects nor of straungers. Kingly vertues in tymes past haue bene reported to be these, iustice, gentlenesse and clemencie: but crueltie and outrage haue euer bene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praised both in all persons and specially in princes. <hi>Scipio</hi> hath in all ages bene praysed, who was wont to say, that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saue one citizen than kill a thousand enimies: whiche sentence <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperor, surnamed <hi>Pius,</hi> the kinde or vertuous, did oft repeate. It was a most shamefull byworde of yong <hi>Tyberius</hi> to be called clay tempered with bloud. They sayd also, that kings haue power of life and death ouer their subiects, but not without hearing the cause, and iudicial procc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: that there cannot be alleaged a greater authoritie, than the Dictators had at <hi>Rome,</hi> in whome was the soueraigne power of peace and warre, of life and death, and without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, yet was it not lawfull for them to execute a citizen his cause vnheard. Only théeues and murderers take away mens liues without order of lawe and hearing their cause. Who can doubt (said they) but that this so great outrage, so great shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bloud is the frute of the curssed life of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers? For (said they) now throughout al Fraunce whoredom &amp; loose leudnesse of life are so frée &amp; vsual, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> now the most part of the women of Fraunce séeme to be in manner common:

                  <p>Nowe as touching the Admirals supposed conspiracie, who can thinke it likely that he shoulde enterprise any suche thing within the walles of <hi>Paris?</hi> For in the Court there is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally watching and warding a garrison of the Kings: and at the entrie of his Castle the guards of Gascoines, Scottes and Switzers, are continually attending: and the King himselfe both alwayes before, and specially at that time, by reason of his sisters mariage, had a great trayn of Princes, great Lords noblemen and Gentlemen about him.

As sone as they were caried into prison, there were presented vnto them all, the tormenter and the hangman, and they were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with torture and tearing their bodies in pieces, vnlesse they woulde presentlye subscribe with their owne hand, that they were of counsell with the Admirall to kill the King and his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the Quéene mother, and the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> They all cryed out that they were readye to suffer deathe most willingly forasmuche as the Kings pleasure was it shuld be so: but so greate torture they coulde not beare, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly besought his royall goodnesse and clemencie too pardon them that torment, and yet trusting vpon the mercie of God, they hoped that they shoulde suffer exceeding greate paynes, rather than staine themselues with so greate shame, or confesse an vntrue crime against themselues. They that were first assigned their iudges, hearing their cries and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and fearing the iudgemente of the world, said plainly, that they would not drawe vpon themselues most assured infamie for condemning them. Therefore there were newe iudges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in their places, to them was adioyned such a tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and notarie, as were thoughte fittest for the purpose.

And there hapned one thing which for the abhominable crueltie is not to be omitted. There came to that spectacle certaine Apothecaries, &amp; amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g those bodies they perceiued some ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fat ones, by &amp; by they went to the butchers, &amp; told them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they did vse to make certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> special medicines of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s greace, that they might make and profit therof.

                  <p>While these thinges were doing at <hi>Lions,</hi> the King being enformed that diuers of the religion had left their wiues &amp; children, and were fled out of the other townes, and lurked some in the woods, and some among their friendes such as toke pitie on them, he practised with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

few of his confederates had entred into any secrete practise, it was no reason, that so many innocents should beare the punishment due to a fewe. Many swetely beguiled wyth these wordes of the King and with the letters of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, retired home againe to their dwellings and houses, specially they of <hi>Rhoan. Diepe,</hi> and <hi>Tholouse.</hi> There were scant two dayes passed when they were againe commaunded to pryson, where they were all shutte vp. Then were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers a newe appoynted of the most base and rascall of the people, to torment them with all kinde of torture, and then to slay them. And throughout the whole realme of France for thirtie dayes togither there was no ende of killing, slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and robbing, so that at this day there are about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thousande little babes, widowes and children, that were wel borne, that nowe fatherlesse and motherlesse liue wandering and in beggerie. About this time the King cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be proclaymed, that such as had any office or place of charge, vnlesse they would spedily return to the Catholike, apostolike and Romish Church, should giue ouer those their temporall roomes. There was no towne nor any so small a village or hamlet wherein all the professors of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were compelled either to goe to Masse, or presently to take the sworde into their bosomes: and in many places it happened that such as being amazed with the sodainenesse of the matter had abiured their Religion, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were afterwarde slayne.</p>
                  <p>And while these things were still in doing, yet the King in the meane while sent abroade his letters and messages into all partes, and caused to be proclaimed with trumpet, that his pleasure was that the Edictes of pacification shuld be obserued: and although they coulde not haue fréedome to vse and exercise their Religion in open places, yet they should haue libertie permitted them to retaine and professe it within their owne houses, and that no man should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Since it is so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that my cousins of the house of Guise, and other Lords and Gentlemen their adherents, which are no smal partie in this towne, as all men know, hauing gotten certaine intelligence that the frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of my sayd cousin the Admirall intended to pursue and execute vpon them the reuenge of this hurte, for that they had them in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion to be the cause and occasion therof, haue made such a stirre this night passed, that among them on both partes hath bene raised a greate and lamentable tumulte: the Garde that was set about the Lorde Admirals house, was distressed, himselfe slayne in his house with diuers other Gentlemen, as also great slaughter hath bene made of other in sundrie places and quarters of this towne: which hath bene done with such furie, that it was impossible for me to giue such remedie as was to be wished, I hauing enough to do to employe my Garde and other forces to keepe my selfe in safetie in the Castle of Louure, to the end to giue order for the appeasing of the whole vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare, which at this houre (thankes be to God) is well quenched, for that the same happened by the particular quarrell that hath of long tyme bene betwene those twoo houses, whereof alwayes hauing some doubt that some vnhappie effecte woulde ensue, I haue (as is well knowne to all men) before this tyme done all that I coulde for to appease it, nothing in this last fact tending too the breache of my Edict of Pacification, which contrarywise I will in all things to bee mainteyned, as at any time heretofore, as I do giue it to vnderstand thorowout my Realme.

                                 <p>NOble Seigniours, Monsieur de la Fontaine, Ambassador for the King, your assured and perfect friend and confederate, and I his Treasorer in this countrey, hauing commaundement of his maiestie too communicate with you, as with them whome be accompteth his chiefe and sure friends, of a chaunce which lately happened in the Citie of Paris, his owne person and court then being there, whereof he receyued so much more griefe and displeasure, bycause it befell on such a time as he least feared, or loked for such a thing. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this. On the xxij. day of August last, the Admirall as he went from Louure, was with an harquebuze shot hurte in the hande and arme, whereof when his maiestie was aduertised, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded incontinent that search and punishment were had of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and the authors of such a mischiefe: whervntoo when he had readilie layde his hande by his officiers, and committed the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes of the house, where the harquebuze was shot, to prison, they which were the cause firste of the mischiefe (as it maye easily bee presupposed) bycause they woulde preuente the inquisition ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, heaping one transgression vpon another, on the. xxiij. and xxiiij. of the sayd moneth assembled a great troupe of people in the

Think therefore ye noble Seigniours, in what a perplexitie this yong and courageous King now standeth, who, as a man may saye, hath helde in his hande thornes in steade of a Scepter euer since his comming to the Crowne, for the greate troubles which haue almost euer since beene in his Realme, and therefore by the good and wise counsell and assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Queene his mother and the Lords his brethren, thought to enioy and establishe a more sure repose in his Realme, and a more happie gouernement for himselfe and his subiectes, after he had taken away (as he thought) al occasions of dissentions amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst his subiectes by the meanes of his Edicts of Pacifications, and of the mariage of the King of Nauarre to the Ladie his sister, and the Prince of Conde to Madame de Neuers.

                              <p>THe King considering the commotion lately happened in Paris, wherin the L. Admirall Chastilion with other Gentlemen of his side were slaine, bicause they had mischeuously conspired to set vpon the Kings maiesties person, the Queene his mother, the Princes his brethren, the King of Nauarre, and other Princes and Lordes neare about them, and vpon his estate: and least they of the Religion called refourmed, not knowing the true causes of the sayde rebellion, shuld arise and put them selues in armes as they haue done in the troubles that be passed, and deuise new practises &amp; fetches against the weale of his Maiestie and tranquillitie of his Realme, if he should not cause the truth of the matter to bee knowne to all Gentlemen and others his subiects of the same religion how it passed, and what his pleasure and mind is in their behalfes. And thinking that for remedie hereof it is verie needefull for the Gouernours of the Prouinces in his Realme to go rounde about their gouernementes: for this occasion he willeth that the Counte of Charnie greate Esquire of Fraunce, and his Maiesties Lieutenant generall for the gouernement of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie, shall go diligently through all Cities and places of the sayde gouernements, and as he arriueth in euery place, he shall deuise tho best wayes that he can to make peace, vnion and quietnesse amongst the Kings subiectes as well of the one Religion as of the other. And to bring it the better about, he shall gently call before him in open or priuate place as he shal see best cause for his Maiesties seruice herein, the Gentlemen of the places, and the Burgeses of the Cities of his gouernement, that be of the Religion, and shal declare vnto them, &amp; cause them to vnderstand the truth of the sayd commotion, least any
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27102:479"/>
haue misreported it too them, otherwise than it was in deede. And shall tell them, that vnder the colour of the L. Admirals hurte, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maiestie would haue caused iustice to be done according to the good order that he had appointed, the sayd Admirall and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his Religion which were in the Citie with him, without looking for the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the sayd Iustice, had made a mischeuous, vnhappie, and detestable conspiracie against the Kings Maiesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the Queene his mother, the Lordes his brethren, the King of Nauarre, and other Princes and Lords with them, and against the whole estate, euen as certaine of the chiefe and adherents of the sayd conspiracie (acknowledging their fault) haue confessed. VVherfore his Maiestie was constrayned (to his greate griefe) to resiste and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent so mischieuous, pernicious and abhominable a purpose. And that which he suffered to bee done on Sunday the. xxiiij. of August vpon the Admiral and his complices, was not for any Religion, nor to goe against the Edict of Pacification, he entending neuerthelesse that they of the Religion should still liue and abyde in al libertie and safetie, with their wiues, children and families in their houses, as he hath and will mainteyne them, if they be content to liue quietly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his obedience as he desireth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the which cause he willeth, that the Counte Charnye shall offer and giue to them his letters of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde in good and authentyke forme, which shall bee of as good force and vertue, as if they should come or be taken from his owne Maiestie: and by the authoritie of them, they shall bee preserued from all wrongs, violences, and oppressions: enioyning and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding most expressely all his catholike subiects whatsoeuer they are, to attempt nothing, vpon the persons, goods, or families of anye of the Religion which kepe themselues quietly in their houses, on paine of death. And if any be so rashe, or euil aduised, to do against this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, or too violate the safegard promysed, his Maiestie wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that readie and rigorous punishment bee done, too the intent that their example may serue too holde in others not too doe the like: which is the true and onely meanes of assurance that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie can giue to them of the Religion, with his worde and promise which he giueth them too bee their good and benigne Prince, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and preseruer of them and of all that toucheth them, so long as they liue and continue vnder his obedience without doing or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising any thing against his will and seruice. And bycause his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
<pb facs="tcp:27102:480"/>
hath often knowne that the enterprises and consultations taken in hand by them of the Religion against his seruice, haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded amongs them at assemblies at sermons which Gentlemen had libertie to cause to bee made in their houses and Lordships, therfore my L. of Charnye shall particularly giue too vnderstand to Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which were wont too haue such sermons, that his Maiestie in consideration that nothing hath more moued and set on the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes against those of the Religion than such preachings and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and if they continue it is certaine that it wil bee a cause too en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and mainteine the said commotions, desireth that they should cause them to cease off vntil he hath otherwise prouided and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that they applie themselues herevnto as a thing greatly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the effect of his intention, which is, gently to bring his sayd sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to a true and perfect amitie, vnion and concord one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, committing all diuisions and partialities to obliuio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And bycause this may seme hard at the beginning, my L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Charnye shal cause it to bee faire and gently spoken to them, least they enter intoo some straunge coniecture or suspition. For so his sayd Maiestie would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in all true sinceritie towardes them which conforme themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to his will and obedience, wherin he exhorteth them to liue, with all the best perswasions that he can, and shall assure them in so doing to be surely maintayned and preserued as his other subiects the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, as his Maiestie would that he should do. And too the intent his sayd subiects the Catholikes should knowe howe to vse and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue them selues herein, my L. of Charnie shall tel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties pleasure neither is nor hath bene that any wrong or oppression should be done to them of the saide religion, which like good and loyall subiects will gently kepe themselues vnder his obedience. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring vnto the sayd Catholikes, that if they forget themselues and burt those of the religion which in such sort behaue themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his maiestie, and those also which for that end haue receiued of his maiestie or of my L. of Charnie letters of safeconduite, he will cause them to be punished and chastised in the fielde, as trangressours of his commaundementes, without any hope of grace, pardon, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. VVhich the said L. of Charnie shal expresse and declare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with as plaine words as is possible, &amp; cause it also to be as streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed. And after that following his Maiesties intent, he hath pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified them by this meanes, which is the waye that his maiestie best
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27102:480"/>
liketh of, and searched the direction to assure a tranquillitie betwixt the subiectes and to set some assuraunce betwixt the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, such as shall conforme themselues herein to his sayde maiesties will, he will comfort, and make them the beste and most gentle inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement that he possibly can. But if any of the Religion become selfe willed and stubborne to his Maiestie, without hauing regarde to his sayde warnings, and shall assemble in armes together, making practises and deuises against the weale of his seruice, then the L. of Charnye shall run vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in pieces before they haue power to fortifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues and ioyne together. And therfore he shal assemble as muche force as he can, as well of the ordinarie, as of other men of warre, Souldiers, Footemen of the garrisons, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Catholikes within the Cities of his gouernement, and shall besiege them which holde and make themselues strong in Cities about of his gouernement, so that the victorie and authoritie may remayne in his maiestie.</p>

This present letter shall serue also for an aduise of the receipt of those letters which you wrote the. 5. of this present, wherby you send me word that you receyued no message by word of mouth from me, but only letters of the. xxij. xxiiij. and. xxviij. of the moneth passed, whereof put your selfe to no further pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of the commotion which happened in my Citie of Paris the xxiiij. day of August last, a thing beyond all measure displeasant and disagreable vnto me, and for the which I would haue prouision and remedie.

And where any wrong or outrage shal bee offered them against my will, as I haue before declared, so doe I nowe by these presentes declare, I will and intend that you shal make some euident and notorious pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of such as are herein culpable, so that their correction may serue for an example to al other, that I may see my self throughly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyd herein as I would be, and my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements receyued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst all my subiects in another sorte than they haue bene heretofore.
