            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am extream ſorry, that my ill health hath ſo long hindred
me from Anſwering thoſe Letters, in which you ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſired to know of me, what their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> thoughts are,
concerning the Repeal of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and more particularly
of that concerning the <hi>Teſt:</hi> I beg you to aſſure your ſelf, that
I will deal very plainly with you in this matter, and without
Reſerve, ſince you ſay that your <hi>Letters</hi> was writ by the <hi>King</hi>'s
knowledge and allowance. I muſt then <hi>firſt</hi> of all aſſure you
very poſitively, that their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> have often declared, as
They did more particularly to the Marquis of <hi>Albeville,</hi> His
Majeſties <hi>Envoy</hi> Extraordinary to the <hi>States,</hi> that it is their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<hi>That no Chriſtian ought to be perſecuted for his Conſcience, or
be ill uſed becauſe he differs from the publick and and eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi>
And therefore, they can <hi>conſent,</hi> that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> be ſuffered to continue in their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
with as much Liberty as is allowed them by the <hi>States</hi>
in theſe <hi>Provinces;</hi> in which it cannot be denied, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y a
full Liberty of Conſcience. And as for the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> Their
<hi>Highneſſes</hi> do not only <hi>conſent,</hi> but do heartily <hi>approve</hi> of their
having an entire <hi>Liberty,</hi> for the full Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi>
without any trouble or hindrance; ſo that none may be able
to give them the leaſt diſturbance upon that account.</p>
            <p>And their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> are very ready, in caſe His Majeſty ſhall
think fit to deſire it, to declare their willingneſs to concur in
the ſettling, and confirming this Liberty, and as far as it lies in
them, they will protect and defend it, and according to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49157:3"/>
Language of Treaties, They will confirm it with their <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,</hi>
of which you made mention in yours.</p>
            <p>And if His Majeſty ſhall think fit fuether to deſire their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
in the Repealing of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> They are ready
to give it; <hi>provided always that thoſe Laws remain ſtill in their full
vigour, by which the R. Catholicks are ſhut out of both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and out of all publick Employments, Eccleſiaſtical, Civil and
Military;</hi> as likewiſe all thoſe other <hi>Laws,</hi> which confirm the
<hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and which ſecures it againſt all the attempts
of the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> cannot agree to the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt,</hi>
or of thoſe other <hi>Penal Laws</hi> laſt mentioned, that tend to the
ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> ſince the <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no other prejudice from theſe, than the being excluded
from Parliaments, or from publick Employments. And that by
them the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> is covered from all the Deſigns of
the <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> againſt it, or againſt the publick ſafety; And
neither the <hi>Teſt</hi> nor theſe other <hi>Laws</hi> can be ſaid to carry in them
any ſeverity againſt the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> upon account of their
Conſciences: They are only Proviſions qualifying men to be
Members of Parliament, or to be capable of bearing Office;
by which they muſt declare before God and Men, that they are
for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> So that indeed, all this amounts to
no more than a ſecuring the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> from any Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
that it may receive from the <hi>R. Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> have thought and do ſtill think, that more
than this ought not to be askt, or expected from Them: ſince
by this means, the <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> and their Poſterity will be for
ever ſecured from all trouble in their Perſons or Eſtates, or in
the Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion;</hi> and that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>
ought to be ſatisfied with this, and not to diſquiet the Kingdom
becauſe they cannot be admitted to ſit in Parliament, or to be
in Employments; or becauſe thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> in which the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> does chiefly conſiſt, are not repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by which they may be put in a condition to overturn it.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> do alſo believe, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will be
fully ſatisfied when they ſhall be for ever covered from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being diſturbed, or puniſhed for the free Exerciſe of their
Religion, upon any ſort of pretence whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49157:3"/>
Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> having declared themſelves ſo poſitively in
theſe matters, it ſeems very plain to me, that They are far from
being any hindrance to the Freeing the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of the <hi>Penal Laws;</hi> ſince they are ready to uſe their utmoſt
endeavours for the eſtabliſhing of it; nor do they at all preſs the
denying to the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> the exerciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi>
provided it be managed modeſtly, and without Pomp or Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
As for my own part, I ever was and ſtill am very much
againſt all thoſe, who would perſecute any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> becauſe he
differs from the publick and eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion:</hi> And I hope by
the Grace of God to continue ſtill in the ſame mind; for ſince
that Light, with which <hi>Religion</hi> illuminates our mind, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my ſenſe of things, purely an effect of the Mercy of
God to us, we ought then, as I think, to render to God all
poſſible Thanks for his Goodneſs to us: and to have Pity for
thoſe who are ſtill ſhut up in Error, even as God has pitied us,
and to put up moſt earneſt prayers to God, for bringing thoſe
into the way of Truth, who ſtray from it, and to uſe all gentle
and friendly methods for reducing them to it.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs, I could never comprehend how any that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that may enjoy their <hi>Religion</hi>
freely and without any diſturbance, can judge it lawful for
them to go about to diſturb the Quiet of any <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>State,</hi>
or to overturn Conſtitutions, that ſo they themſelves may be
admitted to Employments, and that thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> in which the
Security and Quiet of the Eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion</hi> conſiſts, ſhould
be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>It is plain, that the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> is by the Grace of God
and by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, enacted by both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
the publick and eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion</hi> both in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland</hi> and that it is provided by thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> that none
can be admitted either to a place in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or to any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Employment except thoſe that do openly declare, that they
are of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and not <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> and it
is alſo provided by thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> that the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> ſhall
be in all time coming ſecured from the Deſigns of the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
againſt it; in all which I do not ſee, that theſe <hi>Laws</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any Severity, either againſt the Perſons or Eſtates of thoſe
who cannot take thoſe <hi>Teſts,</hi> that are contrary to the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49157:4"/>
Religion;</hi> all the inconveniences that can redound to them
from thence, is, that their Perſons, their Eſtates, and even the
Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion</hi> being aſſured to them, only they can
have no ſhare in the Government, nor in Offices of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruſt, as
long as their Conſciences do not allow them to take theſe <hi>Teſts:</hi>
and they are not ſuffered to do any thing that is to the prejudice
of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since, as I have already told you, Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> are ready
to concur with his <hi>Majeſty</hi> for the Repeal of thoſe <hi>Penal Laws,</hi>
by which men are made liable to fines or other Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>So I ſee there Remains no difficulty concerning the Repealing
the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> but only this, that ſome would have the <hi>Roman
Catholicks,</hi> render'd capable of all publick Truſts and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and that by conſequence, all thoſe ſhould be repealed that
have ſecured the <hi>Protestane Religion</hi> againſt the deſigns of the <hi>R.
Catholicks,</hi> where others at the ſame time are not leſs earneſt to
have thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> maintained in their full and due vigour; and
think, that the chief ſecurity of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion</hi> conſiſts
in the preſerving of them ſacred and unſhaken.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that there is no <hi>Kingdom, Commonwealth,</hi> or any
conſtituted body or Aſſembly whatſoever, in which there are
not <hi>Laws</hi> made for the ſafety thereof; and that provide againſt
all Attempts whatſoever, that diſturb their Peace, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the Conditions and Qualities that they judge neceſſary for
all that ſhall bear Employments in that Kingdom, State or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration:
And no man can pretend, that there is any Injury
done him, that he is not admitted to Imployments when he
doth not ſatisfie the Conditions and Qualities required.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be denied, that there is a great difference to be
obſerved in the conduct of thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and
of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> towards one another: The <hi>Roma Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
not being ſatisfied to exclude the <hi>Reformed</hi> from all places
of profit or of Truſt, they do abſolutely ſuppreſs the whole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of that <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſeverely <hi>perſecute</hi> all that profeſs it;
and this they do in all thoſe places where it is ſafe and without
danger, to carry on that rigour. And I am ſorry that we have
at this preſent ſo many deplorable Inſtances of this ſeverity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, that is at the ſame time put in practice in ſo many
different places.</p>
            <p>I would therefore gladly ſee one ſingle good reaſon to move
a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> that fears God, and that is concerned for his <hi>Religion,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49157:4"/>
to conſent to the Repealing of thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> that have been enacted
by the Authority of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> which have no other
tendency but to the ſecurity of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and to
the reſtraining of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> from a capacity of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
it; theſe <hi>Laws</hi> inflict neither Fines nor Puniſhments,
and do only exclude the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> from a ſhare in the
Government, who by being in Employments muſt needs ſtudy
to increaſe their Party, and to gain to it more Credit and Power,
which by what we ſee every day, we muſt conclude, will be
extreamly dangerous to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and muſt turn to
its great prejudice: ſince in all places, thoſe that are in publick
Employments, do naturally Favour that <hi>Religion</hi> of which they
are, either more or leſs. And who would go about to perſwade
me or any man elſe to endeavour to move Their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi>
whom God hath honoured ſo far as to make them the Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
of his Church, to approve of, or to conſent to things ſo
hurtful, both to the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> and to the publick ſafety.
Nor can I, Sir, with your good leave, in any way grant what
you apprehend, That no prejudice will thereby redound to
the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it is commonly ſaid the number of the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> is very inconſiderable; and that they
are poſſeſſed only of a very ſmall number of the places of Truſt:
tho even as to this, the caſe is quite different in <hi>Ireland:</hi> yet this
you muſt of neceſſity grant me, that if their numbers are ſmall,
then it is not reaſonable that the publick Peace ſhould be diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
on the account of ſo few perſons, eſpecially when ſo great a
favour may be offered to them; ſuch as the free Exerciſe of their
<hi>Religion</hi> would be: and if their numbers are greater, then there
is ſo much the more reaſon to be affraid of them; I do indeed
believe that <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as things at preſent ſtand, will
not be very deſirous to be in publick Offices and Imployments,
nor that they will make any attempts upon the <hi>Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
both becauſe this contrary to Law, and becauſe of the great
Inconveniences that this may bring at ſome other time both on
their Perſons, and their Eſtates: yet if the Reſtraints of the
<hi>Law</hi> were once taken off, you would ſee them brought into
the Government, and the chief Offices and Places of Truſt
would be put in thnir hands; no will it be eaſy to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to
reſiſt them in this, how ſtedfaſt ſoever he may be; for they will
certainly preſs him hard in it, and they will repreſent this to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49157:5"/>
               <hi>King,</hi> as a matter in which His Conſcience will be concerned;
and when they are poſſeſſed of the Publick Offices, what will
be left for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to do, who will find no more the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Law, and can expect little Encouragement from
ſuch Magiſtrates? and on the other hand, the Advantages that
the <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> would find in being thus ſet looſe from all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints,
are ſo plain, that it were a loſs of time to go about the
proving it. I neither can or will doubt of the ſincerity of His
Majeſties intentions, and that He has no other deſign before
Him in this matter, but that all his Subjects may enjoy in all
things the ſame Rights and Freedoms.</p>
            <p>But plain Reaſon, as well as the Experience of all Ages, the
preſent as well as the paſt ſhews, that it will be impoſſible for
<hi>R. Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> when they are mixed together in
places of Truſt and publick Employments, to live together
peaceably, or to maintain a good Correſpondence together. They
will be certainly always jealous of one another; For the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and the Maxims of both <hi>Religions</hi> are ſo oppoſite to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
that in my opinion I do not ſee how it will be in the power
of any Prince or King whatſoever, to keep down thoſe Suſpitions
and Animoſities, which will be apt to ariſe upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p>As for that which you apprehend, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſhall
not be delivered from the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> that are made againſt
them, unleſs at the ſame time the <hi>Teſt</hi> be likewiſe repealed:
This will be indeed a great unhappineſs to them; but the <hi>Roman
Catholicks</hi> are only to blame for it, who will rather be content
that they and their Poſterity ſhould lie ſtill under the weight
of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and expoſed to the hatred of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than be ſtill reſtrained from a capacity of attempting any
thing againſt the Peace and the Security of the <hi>Proteſtans Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
And be deprived of that ſmall advantage (if it is at all
to be reckoned one) of having a ſhare in the Government and
publick Employments; ſince in all places of the World his has
been always the priviledge of the <hi>Religion</hi> that is eſtabliſhed by
Law; and indeed theſe Attempts of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ought
to be ſo much the more ſuſpected and guarded againſt by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
in that they ſee that <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> even when liable
to the Severity of <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> do yet endeavour to perſwade
his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to make the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whether they will or not,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49157:5"/>
diſſolve that Security which they have for their <hi>Religion:</hi>
and to clear a way for bringing in the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to the
Government, and to publick Employments: in which caſe there
would remain no relief for them but what were to be expected
from a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>Such then will be very unjuſt to their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> who ſhall
blame them for any Inconveniency that may ariſe from thence;
ſince they have declared themſelves ſo freely on this ſubject,
and that ſo much to the advantage even of the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi>
And ſince the Settlement of matters ſticks at this ſingle
point, that Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> cannot be brought to conſent to
things that are ſo contrary to <hi>Laws</hi> already in being, and that
are ſo dangerous and ſo hurtful to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as
the admitting of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to a ſhare in the Government,
and to places of Truſt, and the Repealing of thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi>
that can have no other effect but the ſecuring of the <hi>Proteſtant
Religion</hi> from all the Attempts of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> againſt
it would be.</p>
            <p>You write, <hi>That the Roman Catholicks in theſe provinces are not
ſhut out from the Employments and places of Truſt;</hi> But in this
you are much miſtaken. For our <hi>Laws</hi> are expreſs, excluding
them by name from all ſhare in the Government, and from
all Employments either of the Policy or Juſtice of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
It is true, I do not know of any expreſs <hi>Law,</hi> that ſhuts
them out of Military Employments; that had indeed been
hard, ſince in the firſt Formation of our <hi>State</hi> they joyned with
us in defending our publick Liberty, and did us eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
during the Wars; therefore they were not ſhut out from
thoſe Military Employments; for the publick ſafety was no
way endanger'd by this, both becauſe their numbers that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in our Troops were not great, and becauſe the <hi>States</hi>
could eaſily prevent any Inconvenience that might ariſe out of
that; which could not have been done ſo eaſily, if the <hi>Roman
Catholicks</hi> had been admitted to a Share in the Government, and
in the Policy or Juſtice of our <hi>State</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very certain of this, of which I could give very good
proofs, that there is nothing which Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> deſire ſo
much, as that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> may Reign happily, and in an entire
Confidence with his Subjects; and that His ſubjects being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49157:6"/>
of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> fatherly affection to them, may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to make him all the returns of Duty that are in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> Power.
But their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> are convinced in their Conſciences, that
both the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and the ſafety of the <hi>Nation,</hi> will
be expoſed to moſt certain Dangers, if either the <hi>Teſt,</hi> or thoſe
other <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> of which I have made frequent mention,
ſhould be Repealed; <hi>Therefore they cannot conſent to this, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
with His Majeſty's Will; for they believe, they ſhould have much
to Anſwer for to God, if the conſideration of any preſent advantages
ſhould carry them to conſent and concur in things which they believe
would be not only dangerous, but miſchievous to the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> have ever pay'd a moſt profound Duty to
His <hi>Majeſty</hi> whcih they will always continue to do; for they
conſider themſelves bound to it, both by the Laws of God, and
of Nature: But ſince the matter that is now in hand, relates
not to the making of new Laws, but to the total Repealing of
thoſe already made both by King and Parliament: They do
not ſee how it can be expected of them, that they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to ſuch a Repeal, to which they have ſo juſt an averſion,
as being a thing that is contrary to the Laws and Cuſtoms of
all Chriſtian <hi>States,</hi> whether <hi>Proteſtants</hi> or <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who receive

            <p>I do not think it neceſſary to demonſtrate to you how much
their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> are devoted to His Majeſty, of which they have

            <head>Reflexions on Monſieur Fagel's Letter.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall endeavour to anſwer yours as fully and briefly as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>1. You deſire to know whether the Letter I ſent you be
truly <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi>'s or not.</p>
            <p>2. Whether their Highneſſes gave him Commiſſion to
write it.</p>
            <p>3. How far the Diſſenters may relie on their Highneſſes
word.</p>
            <p>4. What effects it has on all ſorts of People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Roman Catholicks may be pardoned if they endeavour
to make that Letter paſs for an Impoſture, it is their Intereſt ſo
to do, and they are ſeldom wanting to promote that, let the
methods be never ſo indirect which they are forced to make
uſe of: It does indeed ſpoil many hopeful projects of theirs.
But how any Proteſtant among us can really doubt the truth
of it, is ſtrange to me. Some things carry their own evidence
along with them: I take this Letter to be one of that kind. I
do not deſire you to believe me upon my bare affirmation that
I know it to be genuine, (tho this be moſt true) but ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my Reaſons to convince you that it cannot be otherways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Letter is like its Author, the Matter is weighty,
the Reaſoning ſolid, the Stile grave, full and clear, like that of
a Lawyer: It has an Air all over, which as well ſhews the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Temper of its Writer, as the Matter and Method
of it do his Capacity and Judgment. Now all theſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
make up the Character of <hi>Monſieur Fagel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are the ſame grounds to believe this Letter
to be <hi>M. Fagel</hi>'s, as there are to believe any thing you have
not ſeen, <hi>viz.</hi> The conſtant Aſſeverations of Perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Credit that come from <hi>Holland,</hi> who all agree in it,
and aſſure us of it. <hi>M. Fagel</hi> own'd it to ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and many both here and in <hi>Holland</hi> knew two months
ago that ſuch a Letter was written; a Forgery would before
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49157:7"/>
this time have been detected, eſecially ſuch a one as ruines the
Deſigns of the Triumphing Party.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was written by M. <hi>Fagel</hi> in Anſwer to Letters
from Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> ſent by His Majeſties ſpecial Orders, and
Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> hath both an <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Copy ſent him:
Therefore the Engliſh Copy is not called a Tranſlation, but it is
a ſort of Original; for you are not to doubt but the matter was
ordered ſo, that her Royal Highneſs might peruſe it as well
as his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>In the next place you would know <hi>whether their Highneſſes
gave Order to Monſieur</hi> Fagel <hi>to write it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh Sir, you would take the pains to read the Letter over
again, and conſider who this <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> is; He is Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of <hi>Holland,</hi> and firſt Miniſtor of State, raiſed to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
by the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Favour, he Anſwers Letters written to him,
which are ordered by His Majeſty to be communicated to their
Highneſſes. In his Anſwer, he gives an Aceount of their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
Opinions about the Repeal of the <hi>Penal Laws and Teſt;</hi>
Matters of a National Concern, and of the greateſt Importance.
Now you muſt have a ſtrange Opinion of <hi>Monſieur Fagel,</hi> if you
think him capable of ſo great an indiſcretion (or rather Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture)
as to write ſuch a Letter of his own Head. The Letter
it ſelf Demonſtrates, that whoever writ it is no Fool, and the
Circumſtances I have marked ſhow that he is no Knave. And
indeed the ſubſtance of it is not new, it only repeats to His
Maieſty the ſame Anſwer which the Prince and Princeſs had
formerly given to His Majeſties Envoy there.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, you may leave the whole Matter to this plain iſſue:
if this Letter be a falſe one it will be diſown'd, if a true one it
will be owned. Their Highneſſes love not to do things that
will not bear the Light. It is Evident, they did not intend
the Matter of it ſhould be a Secret, having told it to <hi>Monſieur
d'Albeville,</hi> as often as he (in his Diſcreet Way) neceſſitated
them to do it. But how it came to be Printed, I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you juſtly; however you ſhall have my conjecture.</p>
            <p>I remember as ſoon as it was noiſed about Town, that Mr.
<hi>Stewart</hi> had received a Letter of ſuch a Nature from <hi>Monſieur
Fagel,</hi> care was taken that the Writer of the Common News
Letters which are diſperſed over the Kingdom, ſhould inſert
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49157:7"/>
in them that their Highneſſes had declared, themſelves for the
Repeal of the Teſt. This <hi>Pias Fraus</hi> might, I ſuppoſe, give
Occaſion to the Printing of the Letter, as the Wiſdom and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of our States-men (in putting Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> on Writing ſuch
Letters) had procured it: I ſay <hi>Letters,</hi> for <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> had
five or ſix on that ſubject before he anſwered, ſo unwilling
were they in <hi>Holland</hi> to return an Anſwer, ſince they could not
give one that was pleaſing, or do any thing that look'd like
meddling.</p>
            <p>The third Thing you deſired to be ſatisfied in, is, <hi>Whether
the Diſſenters may rely on their Highneſſes Word.</hi> I am as apt to
miſtruſt Princes Promiſes as you are. But ſhall now give you
my reaſons, why I think the Diſſenters may ſafely do it. And
at the ſame time, becauſe of the Affinity of the matter, I will
tell you why I think we may all rely on their Highneſſes for
our <hi>Civil Liberties,</hi> as well as the Diſſenters may do for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conſcience.</hi> Much of what I have to ſay is equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to them both, yet becauſe I know you have had an
Account of Her Royal Highneſs, better than I can give you,
I ſhall for the moſt part, ſpeak only of the Prince.</p>
            <p>My firſt Reaſon is the certaineſt of all Reaſons, That it
will be His Highneſſes intereſt to ſettle matters at Home,
which only can be done by a Legal Toleration or Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
in Matters of Religion; and by reſtoring the Civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Nation, ſo much invaded of late. That this will
be his intereſt is Evident, if his Deſigns lye abroad, as it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they do. Deſigns at home and abroad at the ſame time are
ſo inconſiſtent, that we ſee His Majeſty, though raiſed above
his Fears at home by His late Victory; and invited abroad, by
all that can excite his Appetite for Glory, cannot reconcile them:
The truth is, one that would undertake it, is in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with Officers that beat their men, to make them fight,
they have Enemies before and behind.</p>
            <p>But you may happily Object, that Princes do not always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their true Intereſts, of which it is not difficult in this Age
to give ſeveral Fatal Inſtances. I Anſwer, That it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
that Princes, as well as other men, will follow their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
till the contrary appear; and if they be of an Age to
have taken their Fold, and have till ſuch Age kept firm to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49157:8"/>
their Intereſts, the Preſumption grows ſtrong; but if their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
the Maxims of their Families, the Impreſſions of their
Education, and all their other Circumſtances do ſide with their
Intereſt, and lead them the ſame way, it is hardly Credible
they ſhould ever quit it. Now this being the preſent Caſe, we
have all the certainty that can be had in ſuch matters.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has above theſe 15 years given ſo great
proofs of his Firmneſs and Reſolution, as well as of his Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and conduct in oppoſing the Grand Raviſher (I may add
the Betrayers too) of Liberty and Religion, that he is deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(by all Impartial Men) own'd to be the Head of the Proteſtant
Intereſt: A Headſhip, which no Princes but the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſhould have, and none but they would be without it.</p>
            <p>Now one may rationally conclude, That when the Prince
ſhall joyn to his preſent poſſeſſion of this Headſhip, a more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Title, by being in a greater capacity to Act, he will not
degrade himſelf, nor lay aſide Deſigns and Intereſts which
ought to be the Glory of <hi>England,</hi> as they are indeed the Glory
of his Family, acquired and derived to him by the Blood of his
Anceſtors, and carried on and maintained by himſelf with ſo
much Honour and Reputation.</p>
            <p>I might add here, That the Prince is a Man of a ſedate even
Temper, full of Thoughts and Reflection: one that precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
neither in Thinking, Speaking, nor Acting; is cautious
in Reſolving and Promiſing, but firm to his Reſolutions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
in obſerving his Word: inform your ſelf, and you'll find
this a part of his Character, and conclude from hence what
may be preſumed from his Inclinations.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Maxims of his Family, let us compare them
a little where it may be decently done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King broke his Faith to his Proteſtant Subjects,
upon this ſingle point of Vain Glory, that he might ſhew the
World he was greater than moſt of his Predeceſſors, who
though they had the ſame Inclinations, were not Potent enough
to purſue them effectually, as he has done, to the everlaſting
Infamy of his Name and Reign. The maxims of the <hi>French</hi>
Kings have been to outvie each other, in Robbing their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and Oppreſſing their Subjects by perfidiouſneſs and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
But thoſe of the Family of <hi>Orange</hi> on the contrary, have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49157:8"/>
been to Reſcue <hi>Europe</hi> from its Oppreſſors, and maintain the
Proteſtant Intereſt, by Vertue, Truth, Honour and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
knowing that ſuch methods are as neceſſary to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Princes and States flouriſh, as Vice and Oppreſſion are
to maintain Popiſh Government.</p>
            <p>No Popiſh Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> can pretend to have kept his
Word to his Proteſtant Subjects, as the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> have
always done to their Popiſh ſubjects at <hi>Orange,</hi> and elſewhere;
and the Papiſts have often broke their Word to that Family, and
have been, and are its declared Enemies; and though the Princes
two great Grand-Fathers, Admiral <hi>Coligni,</hi> and Prince
<hi>William,</hi> were Aſſaſſinated by the Authority, and with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of that whole party, yet it cannot be made appear,
that ever the Princes of that Family failed in keeping their Word,
even to ſuch Enemies, or uſed their own Popiſh ſubjects the
worſe for it, in making diſtinction between them and their other
ſubjects, or influenc'd the <hi>States</hi> to uſe theirs ſo: I ſay the <hi>States,</hi>
who allow their <hi>R. C.</hi> ſubjects all the priviledges of their other
ſubjects, only they are kept by a Teſt from having any ſhare
in the Government, which is truly a kindneſs done them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that ill-natured Humour of deſtroying all thoſe that
differ from them, which is apt to break out when that Religion
is in power.</p>
            <p>Now the Church of <hi>England</hi> may juſtly expect all ſort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and countenance from the ſucceſſors, when it's their
turn to give it, they have a legal right to it, and Impartial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
muſt acknowledge, that of late they have deſerved it.</p>
            <p>But as for the Proteſtant Diſſenters, I think no honeſt man
amongſt them will Apprehend, that their Highneſſes who keep
their Word to their Popiſh Enemies, will break it to Proteſtant
ſubject, tho differing from the publick Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>The next thing I am to make good, is, That His Highneſſes
Education muſt have infuſed ſuch principles as ſide with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt:
There muſt be a fatal Infection in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown,
if matters miſcarry in his Highneſſes Hands, his Veins are full
of the beſt Proteſtant Blood in the World: The Reformation in
<hi>France</hi> grew up under the Conduct and Influence of <hi>Coligni.</hi>
Prince <hi>William</hi> founded the Government of the United <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
on the Baſis of property and liberty of Conſcience. His
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49157:9"/>
Highneſs was bred and lives in that <hi>State</hi> which ſubſiſts and
flouriſhes by adhering ſteadily to the Maxims of its Founder.</p>
            <p>He himſelf, both in his publick and private concerns, as
well in the Government of his Family, and of ſuch principalities
as belong to him, as in that of the Army, and in the Diſpenſing
of that great power which the States have given him, has as
great regard to Juſtice, Vertue and true Religion, as may
compleat the character of a Prince, qualified to make thoſe he
Governs happy.</p>
            <p>It does not indeed appear, that their Highneſſes have any
ſhare of that devouring Zeal which hath ſo long ſet the World
on fire, and tempted thinking men to have a notion of Religion
it ſelf, like that we have of the Ancient Paradice, as if it had
never been more than an intended Bleſſing, but all who have
the honour to know their Highneſſes and their Inclinations in
matters of Religion, are fully ſatisfied they have a truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Zeal, and as much as is conſiſtent with Knowledge and
Charity.</p>
            <p>As to his Highneſſes circumſtances, they will be ſuch when
his <hi>Stars</hi> make way for him, as may convince our <hi>Scepticks,</hi>
that certain perſons, times and things, are prepared for one
another. I know not why we may not hope, that as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
broke the Yoke of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> from off the
Neck of <hi>Europe;</hi> The honour of breakin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that of the Houſe of
<hi>Bourbon</hi> is reſerved for him. I am confident the Nation will
heartily joyn with him in his Juſt Reſentments. Reſentments
which they have with ſo much Impatience long'd to find, and
have miſs'd with the greateſt indignation in the Hearts of their
Monarchs.</p>
            <p>His Highneſs has at preſent, a greater influence on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
of the moſt part of the Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> than poſſibly
any King of <hi>England</hi> ever had. And this acquired by the weight
of his own perſonal merit, which will no doubt grow up to a
glorious Authority when it is cloath'd with Soveraign power.
May I here mention (to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay the Jealouſies of the moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
of your Friends) that his Highneſs will have only a
borrowed Title, which he may ſuppoſe will make him more
catious in having deſigns at home, and his wanting Children (to
our great misfortune) will make him leſs ſolicitous to have
ſuch Deſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49157:9"/>
But after all, it muſt be acknowledged, that in matters of
this Nature, the premiſes may ſeem very ſtrong, and yet the
concluſion not follow. Humane infirmities are great, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Arbitrarineſs are ſtrong, and often both the Spirit and
Fleſh weak. Such fatal miſtakes have been made of late, that
the Succeſſors themſelves may juſtly pardon mens Jealouſies,
A Widow that has had a bad Husband, will cry on her Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-day,
though ſhe would be married with all her heart.
But I am confident you will grant to me, that in the caſe of
the preſent Succeſſors, the poſſibilities are as remote, and the
Jealouſies as ill grounded, and that there is as much to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
them, as ever there was to be found in the proſpect of
any Succeſſors to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Now may I add,
To conclude the Reaſons that I have given you, why we may
depend on their Highneſſes, that I know conſiderable men, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
great Enquiry and Obſervation, do hope that their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes
(being every way ſo well qualified for ſuch an end) are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated
(if I may ſpeak ſo) to make us happy in putting an end
to our Differences, and in fixing the Prerogative, and in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Glory of the Nation, which is ſo much ſunk, and which
now (when we were big with Expectations) we find Sacrific'd
to unhappy partialities in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing you deſire to know, is, <hi>What Effects this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
has had.</hi> But it is not yet old enough for me to judge of
that, I can better tell you what Effects it ought to have. I
find the moderate wiſe men of all Perſwaſions are much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with it.</p>
            <p>I know <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> that wiſh to God matters were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
on the model given in it; they ſee the great difficulty of
getting the <hi>Teſt</hi> Repealed: And withal, they doubt whether it
is their Intereſt that it ſhould be Repealed or not: They fear
needy violent men might get into Employments who would
put His Majeſty on doing things that might ruine them and
their Poſterity. They are certainly in the right of it. It is
good to provide for the worſt. A Revolution will come with
a Witneſs; and it's like it may come before the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>
be of Age to manage an unruly Spirit, that I fear will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
it. Humane Nature can hardly digeſt what it is already
neceſſitated to ſwallow, ſuch provocations even alters mens
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49157:10"/>
Judgments. I find that men who otherways hate ſeverity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be of opinion that Queen <hi>Elizabeths Lenity</hi> to the <hi>R. C's</hi>
proves now cruelty to the Proteſtants. The whole Body of
Proteſtants in the Nation was lately afraid of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi>
and when they Reflected on Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign, thought we
had already ſufficient Experience of the Spirit of that Religion;
and took Self-preſervation to be a good Argument, for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſecond Tryal. But now a handful of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi>
perhaps reflecting on Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, are not it
ſeems afraid of <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſors.</hi> But if ſome Proteſtants at
that time from an Averſion to the Remedy, hoped that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
was not ſo dangerous as it proves, I am confident at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
all Proteſtants are agreed, that henceforward the Nation
muſt be ſaved, not by Faith. And therefore I would adviſe
the <hi>R. C</hi>'s to conſider that Proteſtants are ſtill men, that late
Experiences at home, and the Cruelties of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Princes abroad,
has given us a very terrible <hi>Idea</hi> of their Religion. That oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
is precious and very ſlippery, and if they let the preſent
occaſion paſs by, they can hardly ever hope that it will be poſſible
for them to recover it. That their Fathers and Grandfathers
would have thought themſelves in Heaven to have had ſuch an
offer as this is, in any of the four laſt Reigns, and therefore, that
they had better be contented with <hi>Half a Loaf, than no Bread.</hi>
I mean it will be their Wiſdom to embrace this Golden Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of putting themſelves on a level with all other <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men;
at leaſt as to their private Capacity; and to diſarm once for all,
the Severity of thoſe Laws; which if ever they ſhould come
to be in good earneſt Executed by a Proteſtant Suceeſſor, will
make <hi>England</hi> too hot for them: And therefore I ſhould parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
adviſe thoſe among them, who have the Honour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
His Majeſty, to uſe their Credit, to prevail with him
to make this ſo neceſſary a ſtep in favour of the Nation; ſince
the Succeſſors have advanc'd two thirds of the way for effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo good and pious a work. Then, and not till then, the
<hi>R. C</hi>'s may think themſelves ſecured, and His Majeſty may
hope to be great by Tranſlating Fear and Anger from the
Breaſts of His Subjects, to the Hearts of His Own and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49157:10"/>
But if an Evil Genius (which ſeems to have hovered over us
now a long time) will have it otherwiſe; if I were a <hi>R. C.</hi> I
would meddle no more, but live quiet at home, and Careſs
my Proteſtant Neighbours; and in ſo doing, I ſhould think my
ſelf better ſecured againſt the Reſentments of the Nation, than
by all the Forces, Forts, Leagues, Garranties, and even <hi>Men
Children</hi> that His Majeſty may hope to leave behind him.</p>
            <p>As for the Proteſtant Diſſenters, I am confident the Body of
them will continue to behave themſelves like men, who to
their great Honour have ever preferred the Love of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Religion to all Dangers and Favours whatſoever, but
there are both Weak and Intereſted men among all great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
I would have them conſider how much the ſtate of things
is altred, upon the coming out of this Letter, for if hitherto
they have been too forward in giving Ear to Propoſals on this
miſtake, that they could never have ſuch a favourable Juncture
for getting the Laws againſt them Repealed; I hope now they
are undeceived, ſince the Succeſſors have pawn'd their Faith
and Honour for it, which I take to be a better ſecurity (as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
go at preſent) than the ſo much talk'd of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for
Liberty of Conſcience would be, though got in a legal way;
for our Judges have declared, That Princes can diſpence with
the Obligation of Laws, but they have not yet given their
Opinion, that they can diſpence with the Honour of their Word;
nor have their Highneſſes any Confeſſor to ſupply ſuch an
Omiſſion.</p>
            <p>However it is not to be charg'd on their Highneſſes, if ſuch
a <hi>Magna Charta</hi> be not at preſent given them, provided the
Teſt be let alone; but I fear the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks Zeal will
have all or nothing; and the Teſt too muſt be Repealed, by
wheedling the Diſſenters to joyn with willing Sheriffs in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Rights of Elections, which are the Root of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>England;</hi> a prudent way of recommending their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to all true <hi>Engliſh-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any of the Diſſenters be ſo deſtitute of Senſe and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
as to prefer a <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſo obtained, Void and Null
in it ſelf, to their own Honour and Conſcience, to the Love and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of their Countrey, to the preſent Kindneſs of all good
Men, and their Countenance at another time, and above all,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49157:11"/>
to the Favour and Word of the Succeſſors, who have now ſo
generouſly declared themſelves for them; We may pronounce,
that they are men abandoned to a Reprobate ſenſe, who will
juſtly deſerve Infamy, and the Hatred of the Nation at preſent,
and its Reſentments hereafter. Is it poſſible, that any Diſſenter,
who either deſerves or loves the Reputation of an Honeſt Man,
can be prevailed with by any pretences of Inſinuations how
plauſible ſoever, to make ſo Odious and pernicious a bargain, as
that of buying a precarious pretended Liberty of Conſcience, at
the price of the Civil Liberties of the Country, and at the price
of removing that which under God is the moſt effectual Bar to
keep us from the Dominion of a Religion, that wouldas ſoon as
it could, force us to abandon our own, or reduce us to the Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Condition of thoſe of our Neighbours, who are glad to forſake
all they have in the World, that they may have their Souls
and Lives for prey.</p>
            <p>As for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> their Clergy have of late op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
themſelves to <hi>Popery,</hi> with ſo much Learning, Vigour,
Danger and Succeſs, that I think all honeſt Diſſenters will lay
down their Reſentments againſt them, and look on that Church,
as the preſent Bulwark and Honour of the Proteſtant Religion.
I wiſh thoſe high men among them, who have ſo long appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to themſelves, the name and Authority of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and have been made Inſtruments to bring about
Deſigns, of which their preſent Behaviour convinces me, they
were ignorant, as I ſuppoſe many of the Diſſenters are, whoſe
turn it is now to be the Tools.</p>
            <p>I ſay, I wiſh ſuch men would conſider, to what a paſs they
have brought Matters by their Violences, or rather the Violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of theſe whoſe Property they were, and at length be wiſe;
They cannot but be ſenſible of the Advantages they receive by
this Letter. I ſuppoſe they apprehend (I am ſure they ought
to do it) that the Ruine of their Church is reſolv'd on: But if
the Diſſenters upon this Letter withdraw themſelves, the <hi>R. C's</hi>
have neither Hearts to keep firm to ſuch a Reſolution, nor Hands
to Execute it.</p>
            <p>Since therefore, They themſelves, have unhappily brought
their Church into ſuch Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pices by provoking the Diſſenters, it
is in a particular manner their Duty, as well as their latereſt,
to endeavour to ſoften them, by aſſiſting the Letter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the Deſign of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49157:11"/>
But if the old leaven ſtill remain, they continue to argue as
formerly, if the Surplice be parted with, the Church of <hi>England</hi>
is loſt; if the Penal Laws be repealed, the Teſt will follow:
and comfort themſelves with this moſt Chriſtian reflection, that the
<hi>R. C.</hi> will not accept of what is offered them; ſuch men deſerve
all the miſery that is preparing for them, and will periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Pity, and give thinking Men occaſion to remember the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>Beat a Fool</hi> (or a Zealot) <hi>in a Morter, yet his Fooliſhneſs
will not depart from him.</hi> But the Diſſenters ought not to be
much concerned at this, they have their own Bigots, and the
Church of <hi>England</hi> theirs; there will be Tools whilſt there are
Workmen.</p>
            <p>This a time for Wiſdom to be juſtified of her Children, when
honeſt men ought to leave off minding the leſſer Intereſts of
this or that particular Church, and joyn in ſecuring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion. And to conclude, I
would particularly beg of the Diſſenters to make uſe of their
beſt Judgment on this ſo critical an occaſion, which they will
do in my opinion, in keeping cloſe to the contents of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by endeavouring to obtain in a fair and legal way ſuch a
Liberty to all Perſwaſions, as is the Natural Right of Freemen,
and as our Proteſtant Succeſſors declare themſelves willing to
joyn in; and if thoſe who have an equal, nay a greater Intereſt
than themſelves, will not agree to ſuch a Liberty, becauſe they
will be Maſters or nothing; the Diſſenters will have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of having diſcharged their own Conſciences, as prudent
Men and good Chriſtians ought to do, and may ſafely truſt
God with the Event.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I thought I had made an end, but looking your Letter
over again, I find I have forgot to anſwer a reaſon or two you
give, why you doubt whether the Letter be truly M. <hi>Fagels:</hi>
You are informed (you ſay) that ſuch and ſuch Great Men
doubted of it; but ſome might as well pretend to doubt of the
Truth of that Letter, (tho they knew it to be true) as believe
Her Majeſty to be with Child, almoſt before ſhe knew it Her
ſelf; and that ſhe was quick, when the Embryo, as Anatomiſts
ſay, is not much above an Inch long; I don't think that Popiſh
Succeſſors, like certain weeds, grow faſter than others: The
Perſons you name may Trim, and preſume on their Merit,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49157:12"/>
leaſt they might be thought capable of Reſentment. A dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Reflection. I ſay their Merit; you have ſeen a long rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the great ſervices ſome (when they were in power) did
their Highneſſes; it is bound up with a relation of the true
cauſes of their ſufferings for their (or rather their Highneſſes)
Religion. You know even how one of them the laſt Summer
payed them his reverence with all the Reſpect and Humility of
a due diſtance, and with the ſame caution with which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Monarch fights out of Cannon ſhot. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> though
the character of a Trimmer be ordinarily the character of a
Prudent Man, there are times and ſeaſons when it is not the
Character of an Honeſt Man.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that ſince their Highneſſes Marriage, nothing
has hapned ſo much for the good of the Proteſtant Intereſt as
this Letter of M. <hi>Fagels,</hi> and if I had been either the Writer or
Adviſer of it, I ſhould be very proud of it, and think the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
much in my debt. But Sir, that was not a very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to make you doubt of it; for a good cauſe will have its
time, tho not ſo often as a bad one, which hath ordinarily the
Majority on its ſide.</p>
            <p>I am confident at preſent we have all the reaſon in the world
to expect it, for my own part, though I am neither young nor
ſtrong, I hope to live to ſee a day of Jubilee in <hi>England</hi> for all
that deſerve it; when honeſt men ſhall have the ſame pleaſure
in thinking on theſe times, that a Woman happily delivered
hath in reflecting on the pain and danger ſhe was in. But
Knaves ſhall remember them, as I am told the damned do their

I was very earneſtly deſired by Mr. <hi>James Stewart</hi> Advocate,
to write to him what were the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>'s
Thoughts concerning the repealing the <hi>Teſt and the Penal Laws:</hi>

at laſt I did according to the mind of their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> draw

I tranſmitted the draught of my <hi>Letter</hi> to their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> and
received upon it their order to ſend it, after that their <hi>Highneſſes</hi>

hitherto concerned my ſelf in all thoſe diſcourſes, or in all that

a <hi>forgery,</hi> ſince as it was truly writ by <hi>me,</hi> ſo it has been avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by me ever ſince it firſt appeared: And it is a baſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Slander, to ſay, that I writ that account of their <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi>
thoughts concerning the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt</hi> and the <hi>Penal
Laws</hi> without their knowledge: which appears ſo much the
more evident, ſince it cannot be imagined, that their <hi>Highneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
would not have expreſſed their juſt reſentments, at ſo high
and extravagant a preſumption as I ſhould have committed,
if I had written any account of their <hi>thoughts,</hi> without their
knowledg: All this has obliged me for my own Vindication to
write the following <hi>Letter,</hi> to the Marqueſs of <hi>Albeville,</hi> His
Majeſties <hi>Envoy to the States:</hi> becauſe I have had much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with him concerning the writing of that <hi>Letter,</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this book called <hi>Parliamentum Pacificum</hi> was publiſhed:
but I will not engage my ſelf any further to examine the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Author of that Phmphlet: for I know well, that
in thoſe matters the world is divided into very different ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and that men are apt to approve or cenſure ſuch things,
according to their preconceived Opinions: Of all this I thought
it neceſſary to advertiſe my Reader, and to order this account
of my Letter to be printed by a known <hi>Printer,</hi> from a Copy
ſigned by my hand. </p>

things of that kind. It is affirmed in that book, that the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
which I writ to Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> the 4th. of <hi>November</hi> laſt year,
concerning the <hi>Teſt</hi> and the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> is a <hi>Pretended Piece,</hi> or
at leaſt that I writ it without <hi>order;</hi> and without the <hi>conſent</hi> of
their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> and more particularly of her <hi>Royal Highneſs the</hi>
PRINCESS of ORANGE: I will not engage my ſelf
to examin and refute the particulars that are in that <hi>Book,</hi> for
that were as unſuteable to the Character I bear, as it is to my
own Inclinations; which do both concur in making it unfit for
me to enter upon a publick diſpute in things of this nature:
But you cannot think it ſtrange, if I deſire you to call to mind,
that it was not of my own head that I was engaged to write
that <hi>Letter</hi> which is now called in queſtion: it was far from that.
I was preſſed by earneſt and often repeated Inſtances for the
ſpace of four months, that were made to me in His <hi>Majeſties</hi>
name, to write upon that ſubject; which at laſt prevailed with
me; yet I went about it with all the caution that a matter of
ſuch Importance required; and I took care not to write one
ſingle period in that whole <hi>Letter,</hi> that I apprehended might
give His Majeſty the leaſt offence: yet after all I ſee this <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
is treated as an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> in a <hi>Book</hi> publiſhed by Authority:
tho both his Majeſty and the whole <hi>Court</hi> know the truth of
this matter; which <hi>Sir,</hi> I have in particular owned to your
ſelf, as being the Kings <hi>Miniſter</hi> here: as I have alſo owned it
to all that have ſpoke to me upon the <hi>Subject.</hi> But that which
troubles more is, that I am accuſed for having made uſe of
their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> name, and in particular of her <hi>Royal Highneſſes</hi>
without their <hi>Order,</hi> as if I were capable of ſo Infamous a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
and of an Impoſture ſo unworthy of any man of honour,
and that chiefly in a matter of ſo great Conſequence. <hi>Sir,</hi> you
muſt not think it ſtrange, if in this I appeal to your ſelf, to
that which you know, and which you have often owned to me
your ſelf: that their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> and particularly Her <hi>Royal
Highneſs</hi> have often expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſed to you their thoughts concerning
the <hi>Teſt and the Penal Laws,</hi> conform to that which I writ in
their names: which you owned to me, that you had writ to
the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> long before I writ that <hi>Letter,</hi> and that
therefore you could not imagin upon what reaſon the <hi>Court</hi>
could preſs me ſo much as they did to write to Mr. <hi>Stewart.</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49157:14"/>
I do aſſure you, I find my ſelf very little concerned in what is
ſaid in this late <hi>Book,</hi> or in any other of that kind: I foreſaw
well enough from the beginning that I ſhould be attackt upon
the account of my <hi>Letter:</hi> in which it was Indifferent to me
what any man thought of it. But this <hi>Book</hi> being publiſhed by
the authoaity of a <hi>Licence</hi> granted by the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,
Preſident of His Majeſties Privy Council and Secretary of State,</hi> I
find my honour is ſo touched in it, that I am obliged to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the world, of the falſe accuſation with which I am charged
in it. And I thought <hi>Sir,</hi> that I could not do this better, than
by writing to you, that are His Majeſtys <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and who
know perfectly the truth of the matter that is now called in
queſtion: and therefore I deſire you will write concerning it,
to the Earl of <hi>Sunderland:</hi> I believe he has not ſeen or at leaſt
that he has not conſidered the paſſages of that <hi>Book</hi> that do
concern me. For I am ſure if he had done that, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have Licenſed it: for my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> knows, as well
as any man alive does, that my <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> is no
<hi>Pretended Piece:</hi> he himſelf ſaw the <hi>Letter,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Tranſlation of it that I ſent along with it: And he could
not but know likewiſe, both by your <hi>Letters,</hi> and by what you
told by <hi>word of mouth,</hi> that their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> and in particular
Her <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> have often owned to you, their ſenſe of the
<hi>Teſt</hi> and the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> conform to that which I writ in their
name to Mr. <hi>Stewart.</hi> So I do perſuade my ſelf, that My Lord
<hi>Sunderland</hi> will have the Juſtice and Goodneſs to recall this <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi>
which has been obtained of him by a ſurpriſe: and that
the <hi>Author</hi> of ſo manifeſt and ſo Injurious a Calumny, ſhall be
puniſhed as he deſerveth. I will not likewiſe conceal from
you, the deſign I have of publiſhing an account of all that has
paſſed in this matter, as well as of this <hi>Letter,</hi> which I take the
liberty now to write to you, in which my deſign is not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

offend any perſon whatſoever, but only to cover my Honour
which is ſtruck at by this <hi>attrocious Calumny.</hi> I am <hi>Sir</hi> your

Together with ſome References to Mr. Stewart's
Printed Letter.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Stewart</hi> ſtaid about ſeven Months, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the <hi>Penſionary's Letter,</hi> before he thought fit to
write any <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it: and then inſtead of ſending one in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the <hi>Penſioner,</hi> or in a Language underſtood by him, he
has thought fit, by a Civility peculiar to himſelf, to Print an
Anſwer in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to ſend it abroad into the World, before
the <hi>Penſioner</hi> had ſo much as ſeen it. The many and great Affairs
that preſs had upon that Eminent Miniſter, together with a
ſad want of Health, by which he has been long afflicted, have
made that he had not the leiſure to procure Mr. <hi>Stewart's</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be tranſlated to him, and to compare the Matters of
Fact related to in it, with the Letters that were writ the laſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49157:15"/>
year by Mr. <hi>Stwatr,</hi> which are in his Poſſeſſion; nor did he
think it neceſſary, to make too much haſte: And therefore if he
has let as many <hi>Weeks</hi> paſs, without ordering an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to be
prepared, as the other had done <hi>Months,</hi> he thought that even
this Slowneſs, might look like one that deſpiſed this indecent
Attempt upon his Honour, that Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> has made in giving
ſo unjuſt a Repreſentation of the matter of Fact. He hopes he
is too well known to the World, to apprehend that any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
would entertain the hard Thoughts of him, which Mr.
<hi>Stewart</hi>'s late Print may have offered to them; and therefore
he has proceeded in this matter, with the Slowneſs that he
thought became his Integrity, ſince a greater Haſte might have
look'd like one that was uneaſy, becauſe he knew himſelf to be
in Fault. As for the reaſoning part of Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi>'s <hi>Paper,</hi> he
has already expreſſed himſelf in his Letter to Mr. <hi>d' Albeville,</hi>
that he will not enter into any Arguing upon thoſe Points, but
will leave the Matter to the Judgement of every Reader; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he has given order only to examine thoſe Matters of Fact,
that are ſet forth in the beginning of Mr. <hi>Stewart's Letters,</hi> that
that ſo the World may have a true Account of the Motives that
induced him to write his <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> from the words
of Mr. <hi>Stewart's</hi> own <hi>Letters:</hi> And then he will leave it to the
Judgment of every Reader, whether Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> has given the
Matter of Fact fairly or not. It is true, the <hi>Penſioner</hi> has not
thought fit to print all Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> at their full length;
there are many Particulars in them for which he is not willing
to expoſe him: And in this he has ſhewed a greater Regard to
Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> than the Uſage that he has met with from him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves:
If Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> has kept Copies of his own <hi>Letters,</hi> he
muſt ſee that the <hi>Penſioners</hi> Reſervedneſs is rather grounded on
what he thought became himſelf, than on what Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi>
has deſerved of him. But if Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> or any in his name,
will take Advantages from this, that the <hi>Letters</hi> themſelves are
not publiſhed, and that here there are only <hi>Extracts</hi> of them
offered to the World, then the <hi>Penſioner</hi> will be excuſed, if he
Prints them all to a Tittle: The Truth is, it is ſcarce concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
how Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> could aſſume the Confidence that appears
in his printed Letter, if he have kept Copies of the Letters that
he writ laſt-Year: And if he engaged himſelf in Affairs of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49157:16"/>
ſuch Importance without keeping. Copies of what he writ, it
was ſomewhat extraordinary: And yet this Cenſure is that
which falls the ſofteſt on him: But I will avoid every thing
that looks like a ſharpneſs of Expreſſion; for the <hi>Penſioner</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
that he who is to give this Account to the <hi>Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
ſhould rather conſider the Dignity of the <hi>Poſt</hi> in which he
is, than the Advantages that Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> may have given for
replying ſharply on him. And in this whole matter the <hi>Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner</hi>'s
chief Concern is, to offer to the World ſuch a Relation of
the Occaſions that drew his <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> from him, as
may juſtify him againſt the falſe Inſinuations that are given:
He owed this likewiſe as an Expreſſion of his Reſpect and Duty
to their Highneſſes, in whoſe Name he wrote his <hi>Letter,</hi> and
at whom all thoſe falſe Repreſentations are levelled, though
they fall firſt and immediately upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Sum of the Matter of Fact, as it is repreſented by Mr.
<hi>Stewart,</hi> amounts to this, <q>That he was ſo ſurpriſed to ſee in
<hi>January</hi> laſt, the <hi>Penſioner's</hi> Letter to him in Print, that he
was inclined to disbelieve his own Eyes, conſidering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteneſs
of the Occaſion that was given for that <hi>Letter:</hi> That
he had never writ to the <hi>Penſioner,</hi> but was expreſly <hi>cautioned
againſt it:</hi> but that ſeeing the Sincerity of the King's Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he was deſirous to contribute his ſmall Endeavours for
the advancing ſo good a Work, and for that end he <hi>obtained leave</hi>
to write to a private Friend, who, he judged might have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to repreſent any thing he could ſay to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
But that of the <hi>Letters</hi> which he writ to his Friend,
there were only two intended for Communication, in which
he ſtudied to evince the Equity and Expediency, of repealing
the <hi>Teſts</hi> and the <hi>Penal Laws:</hi> And that with a peculiar regard,
to the <hi>Prince and Princeſs Orange</hi>'s Intereſt; and he deſired that
this might be imparted to <hi>Friends,</hi> but chiefly to thoſe at the
<hi>Hague.</hi> And that this was the Subſtance of all that he writ
on that Occaſion. But finding that the Prince had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himſelf in thoſe Matters, he reſolved to inſiſt no further:
Yet his F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind inſinuating, That he had ſtill Hopes to get a
more diſtinct and ſatisfying <hi>Anſwer,</hi> from a better Hand, tho
without naming the Perſon, he attended the Iſſue; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> almoſt Three Months after
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49157:16"/>
his firſt writing, he received the <hi>Penſioners Letter,</hi> though he
had not writ to him (which is repeated again and again) and
in it an Account of the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Thoughts
about the <hi>Repeal of the Teſts and Penal Laws</hi> (which he had not
deſired) upon which he took ſome care to prevent the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of it: Put when he ſaw it in Print, he clearly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that it was printed in <hi>Holland;</hi> and ſo wonders how the
<hi>Penſioner</hi> could ſay, that it was printed in <hi>England,</hi> which he
found in his printed Letter to Mr. <hi>d' Albeville;</hi> he knows not
upon what Provocation the <hi>Penſioner</hi> writ that Letter; but
in it he finds that he writ, that he was deſired by himſelf <hi>to
give him an Account of the Prince and Princeſs of</hi> Orange'<hi>s Thoughts,</hi>
and that theſe preſſing Deſires were made to him by His
Majeſties Knowledge and allowance; this being ſo different
from the Letters he had writ, of which he is ſure that the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he has given is true in every point, he was forced to
vindicate the the King's Honour and his own Duty. He writ
not out of any curioſity to know their Highneſſes Though's,
which were already known, they having been ſignified to the
<hi>Marquis of Albeville,</hi> and therefore he had no Orders from the
King for writing on that Subject, but only a Permiſſion to uſe
his little Endeavours for the advancing of his Service; but it
was never moved to him to write, either in the King's Name
or in the Name of any of his Secretaries.</q> This is Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi>'s
Account in the firſt Nince Pages of his Letter, and is ſet down
In his own Words.</p>
            <p>Now in oppoſition to all this, it will appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Extracts,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> writ to his Friend, as the moſt
proper Interpreter for addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Penſioner;</hi> that
he repeated his Propoſition frequently, finding his Friend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing

in one <hi>Leteer, That what he writ was from his Majeſty himſelf,</hi>
and enlarges more fully on this in two other <hi>Letters;</hi> and he
deſires, that the <hi>Prince's Anſwers, with his Reaſons, might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;</hi>
which very probably gave the Occaſion to all the
reaſoning part of the <hi>Penſioner's Letter.</hi> And it appears by that
<hi>Letter,</hi> that the <hi>Return</hi> to all this was expected by the <hi>King,</hi>
and in almoſt every <hi>Letter</hi> he preſſes for a <hi>Return.</hi> And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
upon his receiving the <hi>Penſioner's Letter,</hi> he expreſſes
likewiſe a great ſenſe of the Honour done him in it; that he
had ſo far complied with his inſignificant Endeavours, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
his acquainting both the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Sunderland</hi>
and <hi>Melfort</hi> with it; and in another <hi>Letter,</hi> after new Thanks
for the <hi>Penſioner's Letter,</hi> he <hi>laments that it was ſo long delay'd.</hi>
But all theſe things will appear more evident to the <hi>Reader</hi>
from the Paſſages drawn out of Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi>'s own <hi>Letters,</hi>
which follow. Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> ſeems not to know upon what
Provocation the <hi>Penſioner</hi> writ to Mr. <hi>d' Albeville,</hi> and yet the
<hi>Ponſioner</hi> had ſet that forth in the <hi>Letter</hi> it ſelf; for the Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
entituled <hi>Parliamentum Pacificum,</hi> that was Licenſed by the
<hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> contained ſuch Reflections on his <hi>Letter</hi> to
Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> either as a <hi>Forgery, or as a thing done without the
Princeſs of</hi> Orange'<hi>s Knowledge,</hi> that the <hi>Penſioner</hi> judged himſelf
bound in Honour to do himſelf right. As for Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi>'s cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalneſs,
in knowing that the <hi>Penſioner's Letter</hi> was firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and his Reflection on the <hi>Penſioner</hi> for inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that the <hi>Letter</hi> was firſt Printed in <hi>England;</hi> it is very like
that Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> after ſo long a Practiſe in Libels, knows how
to diſtinguiſh between the Prints of the ſeveral Nations better
than the <hi>Penſioner,</hi> whoſe courſe of Life has raiſed him above all
ſuch Practices. But it is certain, that whereſoever it was firſt
Printed, the <hi>Penſioner</hi> writ ſincerely, and believed really it was

               <p>AND I aſſure you by all I can find here, the eſtabliſhment of this
equal Liberty is his <hi>Majeſty's</hi> utmoſt Deſign—I wiſh your
people at the <hi>Hague</hi> do not miſtake too far both his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and
the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> for as I have already told you his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s utmoſt
Deſign, and have ground to believe, That his <hi>Majeſty</hi> will preſerve
and obſerve the <hi>True Right of Succeſſion,</hi> as a thing moſt ſacred;
ſo I muſt entreat you to remark, That the Offence that ſome of the
<hi>Church of England Men</hi> take at Addreſſing, ſeems to me unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and is apprehended by the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to proceed ſo certainly
from their former and wonted Spirit, that they begin to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in large more Hazard from the <hi>Church of England</hi>'s Re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
than all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> their Advantages. And next, that the
Prince is thought to be abuſed by ſome there to a too great Miſlike of
that which can never wrong him, but will in probability in the event
be wholly in his own power—I hope <hi>you will conſider and
make your beſt uſe of theſe things—I expect an Account
of this per firſt, I mean, an Anſwer to this Letter, and pray
improve it to the beſt Advantage.</hi>

               <head>The Second Letter, without a Date.</head>
               <p>THat it is a thing moſt certain, that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> is reſolved to
obſerve the <hi>Succeſſion to the Crown</hi> as a thing moſt ſacred,
and is far from all Thoughts of altering the ſame; and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is very deſirous to have the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> to
conſent to and concur with him in eſtabliſhing this Liberty—So
that upon the whole it may be feared, that if the Prince continue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
in refuſing his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> he may fall under Suſpicions of the
greateſt part of <hi>England</hi> and of all <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be too great a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently a perſon whom
they have reaſon to dread—And many think that this Compliance
in the Prince, might be further a wiſe part, both as to the Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s greater Favour, and the begetting of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>States;</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi>
will conſent to the Liberty ſo much the rather, that they have a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49157:18"/>
Succeſſor</hi> in proſpect—I cannot on theſe things make any
concluſion, but ſimply leave them to your Reflection, and the beſt uſe
you pleaſe to make of them—<hi>I will expect your Anſwer per

               <p>THE Hints that I gave you in my two former Letters I ſhall now
explain more fully in this—And therefore I heartily wiſh,
that the Prince and Princeſs may underſtand all that you think need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
on this Subject. It troubles his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to find them ſo averſe
from approving this <hi>Liebrty,</hi> and concurring for its Eſtabliſhment
—ſo that in truth I cannot ſee why their Highneſſes ſhould not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
cheerfully ſo fair an Opportunity to gratify both his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and
the far greater and better part of the Nation—Now upon the
whole; I expect that you will make all I have written fully known
at the <hi>Hague,</hi> eſpecially with the Prince—But the main thing I
expect from you, is to have your mind, whether or not his <hi>Highneſs</hi>
may be ſo diſpoſed, as that a well Choſen Informer ſent to himſelf
might perfect the Work. And this Anſwer I will expect per firſt;
where ever the Prince be, you know who are to be ſpoken and how

having failed him, the abuſive <hi>Letter</hi> that he has publiſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it may come in for a ſecond Article: And now the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to which this Diſcovery muſt needs expoſe him, muſt
compleat his <hi>Merit.</hi> If upon all this he is not highly rewarded, he
has ill Luck, and ſmall Encouragement will be given to others
to ſerve the <hi>Court</hi> as he has done. But if he has great Rewards,
it muſt be acknowledged that he has paid dear for them; the
printing and diſtributing 15000 Copies of his <hi>Letter,</hi> is only
the publiſhing his Shame to 15000 perſons, though it is to be
doubted if ſo many could be found in the Nation who would
