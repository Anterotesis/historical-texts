         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is a Childe
of Chance, that
like another <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
in a Wicker
Basket, was lately put to
Sea; and by the Hand of
<pb facs="tcp:99202:3"/>
Providence guided unto
this shore, as unto <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
Daughter; by the
taking of a small <hi>Irish</hi> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
in which it was
found; and appearing a
Babe both promising, and
very beautiful, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
unto me to
Nurse. Of what Birth it
is, I can give no certain
account; all that I can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you of, is this, That
having perused it through,
some very knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have affirmed, That
<pb facs="tcp:99202:3"/>
our Language is yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with nothing upon
this Subject equal unto it.
The Clothes that it was
wrapt in, say little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the discovery of its
Parents; for it was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a present unto <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
the Titular Vice-Roy
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> from one
<hi>Walsingham;</hi> who though
he professes to have given
it this <hi>English</hi> Habit it
now wears, yet he is able
to name no Father for it:
Whether it be some other
<pb facs="tcp:99202:4"/>
nameless Author, as he
affirms, that first gave it
light, I must of necessity
leave that as doubtful as
I found it: And it is a
needless curiosity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
further, since no
man is injured in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment,
but the Author;
who it seems is well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to loose the glory of
it. What value this <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham</hi>
sets upon it, you
may read in a part of his
Letter unto <hi>Ormond,</hi>
which I here insert.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99202:4"/>
YOur Excellency will
herewith receive a
peice, that if not too much
lessened in passing through,
and from the hand that
sends it, truly not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the acceptance of so
great a Person. It is some
years since I first met with
it in a Manuscript, and in
a Foraign Language, when
I took so great a fancy to
it, That it hath ever since
been an inseparable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
a daily <hi>Manual</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99202:5"/>
unto me: I have since that
time found it published in
<hi>Latine,</hi> but still as nameless
as at our first acquaintance.
The divulging of it, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
I did much lament,
and that for a twofold Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
One was, to see it come
abroad so lamely, and so
much injured; another
was, to finde it divulged
at all: For surely, it is a
Tract not intended for the
unskilful palate of the
vulgar; and indeed, onely
meant, and fit for the wisest
<pb facs="tcp:99202:5"/>
souls, and the maturest,
and best tempered Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And the most part
of men are either by nature
so depraved, that they
cannot forbear the practise
of those evils, that they
finde discoursed upon, onely
for their instruction; or
else so sand-blinde and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that they must needs
be scandalized with, and
stumble at those Praecepts
which are here recommended
unto no mans practise, but
laid by the Authors skiful
<pb facs="tcp:99202:6"/>
hand, as necessary Sea-marks
upon the Shelfs of danger
and deceit; of which, the
Ocean of a Publique life,
God knows, is full. <hi>And
a little after he adds,</hi> In
this small Volume, you will
finde (<hi>my Lord</hi>) enchaced
skilfully together as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Iewels, the choicest
Precepts that Story and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
both together, have
produced for the instruction
of those that move within
the sphere of Business, and
the Court: It is a curious
<pb facs="tcp:99202:6"/>
Landskip, wherein that
great Territory, with all the
blemishes and beauties of
it, is all contracted to an
easie view: It is a perfect
Compass fitted to those Seas,
with Points adapted to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wind that blows there:
It is an exact Card, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
all the Coast; and as
there is not a Rode, a Creek,
or Harbor, overpast in all
that Channel; so is there
not a Rock, a Flat, or Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
that is omitted. But
surely it is done to keep us
<pb facs="tcp:99202:7"/>
from, and not to lead us to
those dangers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This, and more delivers
he in commendations of
it; and what he says, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be of some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the case: Since
upon enquiry I do finde,
That he is one, who
though very yong, in a
little time grew up under
the Wings and Favor of
the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> to such
credit with the late King,
That he came to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:99202:7"/>
to the greatest Trusts;
and was prevented onely
by the fall of the Court
it self, from climbing
there unto an eminenter
height.</p>
            <p>This much Reader I
thought fit to say for thy
satisfaction, and by way of
civility to him; contrary
to whose design I have
published this <hi>Treatise,</hi>
and until another Father
can be found for it, have
prefixt his name unto it,

do in the first place,
propose unto themselves, an
<hi>end</hi> whereunto all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
must tend? Those that
<hi>look</hi> towards the <hi>Court,</hi> do not all fix upon
the same ends; some the <hi>hope of gain,</hi> and
others the <hi>desire of honor;</hi> leads; the <hi>Ambition

the <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though their <hi>ends</hi> be diverse, yet the
<hi>way</hi> to attain, to whatever <hi>end</hi> any man there
hath pitcht upon, is but one, and Common
to all that move in that <hi>Sphere,</hi> to wit, the
Favor of the <hi>Prince;</hi> in obtaining <hi>which</hi> the
industry, and labor of all <hi>Courtiers</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.
In order whereunto it is in the first
place necessary, that you be <hi>known</hi> unto your
<hi>Prince;</hi> and then either by your <hi>behavior,</hi>
your <hi>parts,</hi> your <hi>actions,</hi> or some other <hi>laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
means,</hi> that you make your self <hi>Grateful</hi>
in his eye; yet there are <hi>those</hi> for whom the
<hi>splendor</hi> of their <hi>Family,</hi> the <hi>authority</hi> of their
<hi>Office,</hi> or <hi>convenience</hi> of their imployment
(whether it be <hi>high,</hi> or <hi>low,</hi> come unto them
by <hi>inheritance,</hi> or got with money) hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
an access unto the <hi>Princes person;</hi> so
that they being hereby exempted, from the
toil of seeking how to become <hi>known</hi> unto
the <hi>Prince,</hi> finde half their work performed
unto their hands; whilst those to whom
these <hi>introductions</hi> are denyed, finde their
greatest difficulties in their first beginnings:
But when they are once <hi>known</hi> unto the
<hi>Prince,</hi> as he judges them <hi>fit for his Service;</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99202:13"/>
they are often <hi>preferred</hi> and <hi>trusted</hi> before
others; by reason that being lifted up from
a <hi>low Condition,</hi> or a <hi>mean Fortune;</hi> they are
more <hi>addicted</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>Princes will,</hi>
whom they <hi>submissively reverence,</hi> as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Author</hi> of their advancement.</p>
               <p>It is otherwise with <hi>Courtiers</hi> that are
<hi>born Great,</hi> for upon those the <hi>Dignity</hi> either
of their <hi>imployment,</hi> or their <hi>Family,</hi> imposes
a necessity of having a regard unto their <hi>own
Honor,</hi> and of referring sometimes their
<hi>own</hi> to the <hi>Princes opinion;</hi> who besides is
more oft unwilling to promote <hi>these</hi> through
a certain <hi>emulation,</hi> or <hi>fear,</hi> lest their <hi>swelling
greatness</hi> should insult at last against him that
is the <hi>Author</hi> of it; and he not able to repress
them without danger to <hi>himself</hi> and his
<hi>Kingdom;</hi> whilst on the other side, the <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi>
of him that riseth from a <hi>mean Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
is far more easy; onely let the <hi>Prince</hi>
turn his back upon him, or abandon him to
the <hi>great ones</hi> (who for the most part look
with envy upon such) and <hi>he is lost.</hi> I intend
here onely those wise <hi>Princes</hi> that have
known, how to limit within due <hi>bounds,</hi>
the <hi>Power</hi> of those they love, and advance;
not conferring all the authority and trust of
his <hi>Kingdom</hi> upon one of these men, in <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting</hi>
even the <hi>Peers</hi> unto him; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

or as some call him <hi>Stasicrates,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
memorable. He desiring to become known
unto the <hi>Great Alexander,</hi> when all the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi>
had refused to bring him to the King,
bethinks of a way of presenting himself all
naked, anointed with Oyl, a poplar Crown
on his head, upon his left shoulder a Lyons
Skin, and holding a great Club in his Right
hand: And thus Accoutred he comes into
<hi>Alexanders presence,</hi> as he was sitting in his
<hi>Throne.</hi> The novelty of the thing drew the
Eyes of all upon him, and moved <hi>Alexander</hi>
himself so far, as he caused the man to be
brought unto him; And though he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

commanded he should be enrolled amongst

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99202:16"/>
which though by <hi>wary Princes,</hi> they be much
concealed, and smothered, yet it seldom
happens but that sometimes they <hi>break out,</hi>
and as it were laying aside <hi>disguises,</hi> show
themselves. Since all their actions are so
exposed to the eyes of men, it cannot be,
but <hi>some one</hi> or <hi>other,</hi> must observe whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their <hi>inclinations</hi> tend. Sometimes they
are so <hi>opprest</hi> and <hi>vext</hi> with the <hi>weight of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,</hi>
that forgetting their <hi>Artifices,</hi> they <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi>
their dispositions; <hi>Tiberius</hi> himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a most skilful <hi>Master in dissembling,</hi>
could not set so good a face upon it, but
that time would by little and little, bring
all his <hi>Arts to light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But since <hi>those</hi> of other men are so many,
the <hi>propensions of Princes</hi> must needs be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and almost infinite; yet they may be
reduced to <hi>two heads.</hi> The one of which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all that tends to the <hi>greatness of his
State,</hi> The other his <hi>personal pleasures;</hi> His
<hi>greatness</hi> consists either in his <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
or in <hi>Riches;</hi> the duty of his <hi>Subjects;</hi>
or lastly, in the strength and faithfulness of
his <hi>Armies.</hi> In these things he ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
his <hi>endevors</hi> to the nature, and
<hi>disposition</hi> of the <hi>Princes</hi> affairs; which he
that shall with Dexterity and Skill perform,
provided he be neither suspected nor hated
for <hi>other Reasons,</hi> cannot fail of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acceptable unto the <hi>Prince.</hi>

                  <hi>Make the same judgement of the</hi> pleasures,

that a</hi> bold informer <hi>will be grateful unto
him, who sticks not at the displeasure of
the</hi> great ones, <hi>and is ready to</hi> execute <hi>the</hi>
Princes <hi>commands, whatsoever they be; as</hi>
Tacitus <hi>ascribes</hi> Sejanus. He had a body (<hi>says
he,</hi> Annals 4.) patient of toyl, a bold minde; he
was a close concealer of himself, and a rash ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
of others: Composed he was of a mixture
of flattery, and pride, with an exterior face of
modesty; and yet inwardly fraught with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the</hi> Prince <hi>delight in</hi> Drunkenness, <hi>he
will all also take pleasure in men addicted
to the same</hi> vice; <hi>for which cause</hi> Tiberius

Suetonius, <hi>Cap. 24. de Tiberio.</hi> After this,
the Prince to the corruption of publique Maners,
spent two whole days and nights, eating and
drinking with <hi>Pomponius Flaccus,</hi> and <hi>Piso;</hi>
to one of which, he gave immediately the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Syria,</hi> and to the other the Government
of the City, calling them in his Letters, his
most pleasant and familiar Friends. <hi>The same</hi>
Tiberius, <hi>as</hi> Suetonius <hi>relates, preferred a

(saith <hi>Tacitus, Annal. 14) in the bosom of
the Prince, as being admitted to his most private
lusts. So</hi> Petronius, <hi>that Master of elegance</hi>
(for those are the <hi>Historians</hi> words, <hi>Annal.

sweet, but what</hi> Petronius <hi>approved of.</hi> And
according to this example, did <hi>Commodus</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mutianus</hi> was not beloved by <hi>Vespasian</hi> so

               </p>
               <p>Let us see an example or two of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
<hi>Festinus</hi> the Friend of <hi>Maximinus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
during <hi>Valentinians</hi> Reign, governed <hi>Asia</hi>
with a wonderful repute of <hi>Gentleness</hi> and
<hi>Modesty;</hi> being a sharp reprover of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and cruelties of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> and of
the <hi>calumnies</hi> and <hi>frauds,</hi> wherewith he cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented
many: But at last observing
that his <hi>Companion</hi> by these means had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the command of the <hi>Praetorian Bands,</hi>
next in dignity to the <hi>Emperor</hi> himself, he
changed his maner of life, and imitating
<hi>Maximinus,</hi> did many <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>cruel things.
John Pucius</hi> (whom I mentioned but a little
before) administred for a time the <hi>Affairs</hi>
and <hi>Treasures</hi> of the Emperor <hi>Manuel</hi> with
great integrity; which caused, that the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi>
pride and inhumanity was in some
sort tolerable to those that were well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
amongst the <hi>Subjects:</hi> But at last (as <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cetas</hi>
witnesseth) giving himself over to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of wealth, he was in <hi>covetuousness</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to none, that ever had born those
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99202:18"/>
                  <hi>offices</hi> before him; exhorting his very <hi>friends</hi>
and <hi>servants,</hi> to imitate his example, as
many of them did; and the rest, though
better, and incorrupted themselves, yet
were fain silently to suffer <hi>others</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
for fear of the danger that hung
over those that should oppose him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristides</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> both in name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being by the <hi>Athenians</hi> made <hi>Treasurer;</hi>
In the first place, according to his own <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi>
and the duty of an <hi>honest man,</hi> went
about to hinder all those that were under
his <hi>charge,</hi> from robbing the <hi>Treasury;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they presently accused him of <hi>cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>bribery,</hi> as one of the corruptest
persons that ever bore that office; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that he had like to have been <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:</hi>
But being at last <hi>quit,</hi> and his <hi>office</hi>
still continued, he determined to <hi>imitate</hi>
his <hi>Predecessors,</hi> and wink at the thefts of
his <hi>Companions;</hi> by which means, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
reobtained the name of a <hi>good man,</hi> in
the opinion of all.</p>
               <p>Such things often fall out in the <hi>Courts</hi> of
<hi>Princes,</hi> either through the <hi>malice</hi> of those
that are in most <hi>authority,</hi> who can endure
no man more vertuous then themselves; or
else through the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>imprudenee</hi> of the
<hi>Prince.</hi> The <hi>preservation</hi> of our <hi>integrity</hi> in
<hi>Court,</hi> I confess, is therefore very difficult;
yet if any, either through the <hi>necessity</hi> of his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99202:19"/>
                  <hi>Fortune,</hi> the <hi>eminence</hi> of his <hi>Birth,</hi> the <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>

either his <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Country,</hi> is lead unto it,
or called thereunto by the <hi>Prince,</hi> shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
this kinde of life; and as occasion
shall require, seek to do thereby good unto
himself, and serve his Friends; in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he may persist therein, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to his <hi>upright heart,</hi> at least-ways for
a time.</p>
               <p>I speak of the <hi>Courts</hi> of the <hi>worst Princes;</hi>
for to live in the <hi>Court</hi> of a <hi>wise Prince,</hi> that
loves <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>vertuous men,</hi> the difficulty
is not so great. In times past, good men did
not always undergo Publique employments
with a desire of <hi>doing service to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
so much as meerly to keep <hi>wicked</hi> and
<hi>corrupt men</hi> out of those <hi>charges:</hi> And for
the same reasons, ought they to seek access
unto <hi>Tyrannical,</hi> and <hi>voluptuous Princes;</hi> to
the end, That if they durst not <hi>directly,</hi> at
least <hi>obliquely,</hi> and as much as in them lay,
they might impede the evil, and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Counsels</hi> of the <hi>Prince;</hi> either by <hi>fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
delays,</hi> and <hi>contriving difficulties</hi> in his
way, or by offering unto him <hi>more milde</hi> and
<hi>plausible resolutions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Burrhus</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> who according to the
rate of those times, were accounted not
onely good <hi>Courtiers,</hi> but <hi>vertuous men</hi> also;
when being made <hi>Governors</hi> of <hi>Nero</hi>'s youth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99202:19"/>
they observed the humor of this <hi>Prince</hi> apt
and prone to <hi>lust</hi> and <hi>pleasure;</hi> lest he
should break out to the <hi>rapes</hi> of the <hi>Noblest
Women,</hi> they permitted him a <hi>Mistris,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
for a time they kept him in order: Who
took into his familiarity <hi>Annaeus Serenus</hi> for
a cloak unto his <hi>lust, Who faining to be in love
with this freed Woman, did openly own those
gifts to be his</hi> (saith <hi>Tacitus</hi> Annal 13.) <hi>which
the Prince in private bestowed upon her.</hi> This
must a good man do, who not being able to
master the <hi>luxury, liberty,</hi> and <hi>perversness</hi> of
the <hi>Prince,</hi> must at least divert them, and
bend them other ways, whence there is least
danger like to arise, either to the <hi>publike,</hi>
or the <hi>Princes</hi> honor.</p>

                  </hi>
at least drawn thither by their own desire

power of evil men: Who stand their ground
there to that end, through the assistance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the best disposed <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and through the
friendship and patronage of some Great man,
observing carefully there, that wholesome
rule of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> (Annal. 4.)
brings for an example of a good and wise
<hi>Courtier,</hi> who neither with an unseasonable
Contumacy did exasperate the <hi>Prince,</hi> nor
with a sordid flattery sooth him in his vices.
The same <hi>Tacitus</hi> for these reasons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<hi>Capito</hi> and <hi>Labeo. That age</hi> (saith he)
<hi>had at once two Ornaments of peace; But Labeo
was of a more incorrupted liberty, and therefore
more esteemed, whilest Capito's pleasing humor
was more acceptable to the great ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not deny, but a <hi>Courtiers</hi> life will be
far more dificult to an honest man then to
another; But withall I must affirm, that the
advantage of <hi>Glory</hi> and content of <hi>Minde</hi>
that will arise from thence, will much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
the trouble of it. Since that, if he
carry himself wisely and accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to those things that he sees, he cannot
change nor overcome; I dare say, he will
at last become acceptable to the worst of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99202:20"/>
                  <hi>Princes,</hi> and dearer then others that are of
a worse repute; who seldom manage the
<hi>Princes</hi> business with a due fidelity and
care; or at least not equal to that he might
easily promise to himself from the hands of
a vertuous and honest man. And hither
tends the Counsel of <hi>Salust</hi> and <hi>Mecaen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

whereby the first recommended to <hi>Julius
Caesar,</hi> and the latter to <hi>Augustus,</hi> the choice
and friendship of Good men. Because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and care of their reputation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
these more powerfully from disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
things, then the fear of punishment, or
the want of power doth others.</p>
               <p>But as I have said, the vicious are always
in <hi>Court</hi> in greater thrungs; who chiefly by
two ways do ingratiate themselves with
the <hi>Prince</hi> first by flattering and fulfilling
whatever he shall please to command; and
that by so much the more servilely, by how
much the more their hopes of gain are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Next for that, <hi>Princes</hi> are pleased to have
those about them in comparison of whom,
themselves, though bad God knows, seem
to be good. Some there are that think al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
their lives more secure in the company of
those that are most like unto themselves.

grosly, suspects deceipt. It is requisite still
that flattery have something of truth, and
some show of liberty mixed with it, (it is
the opinion of <hi>Aeschines</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi>)
whereby we may perswade not onely the
<hi>Prince,</hi> that we speak heartily, and as we
think, but others also, and so preserve our
Credit.</p>

                  <hi>Craesus,</hi> who whilest he was a King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
had learnt well the humor of Kings, and
what would either please or displease them:
When upon a time <hi>Cambyses,</hi> King of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
demanded of those that were about
him, <hi>What they thought of him in Comparison of
his Father Cyrus:</hi> They all affirmed, That <hi>he
was greater then Cyrus, as who unto his Fathers
Kingdoms had added Egypt, and the dominion of
the Sea.</hi> When <hi>Craesus</hi> (then a Captive)
came to speak, he affirmed, <hi>That he was much
inferior to his Father, by reason that he had as
yet begotten none equal to himself.</hi> This answer
had some taste of freedom, and therfore was
more pleasing to <hi>Cambyses</hi> vanity, then all
the rest had said.</p>

Messala, <hi>recorded by</hi> Tacitus <hi>Annal. 1.</hi> Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
Valerius added, That it was convenient the
Oath of Allegiance should every yeer be renewed
in Tiberius name; who being demanded by Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,
whether he had any commandment from
him to give that advice, he answered, That he
spoke it of his own accord; and that in what
concernd the Common-wealth, he would use no
mans advice but his own, whatever the offence
or danger were: Which was a wonderful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practised
kinde of flattery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Like unto this, is that which the same</hi>
Author <hi>relates of</hi> Ateius Capito, <hi>Annal. 3.</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius
Ennius, a Gentleman of Rome, was accused
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99202:22"/>
of Treason for melting the Image of the Prince,
and making it into Plate; Caesar commanded
he should not be prosecuted for it: <hi>Ateius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pito,</hi>
openly complained with a seeming liberty,
that the power of determining in such a case ought
not to be taken from the <hi>Senate,</hi> nor so great a
Crime pass unpunished; and that he was slow in
resenting his own, least he should also punish an
injury done to the Common-wealth. <hi>It were
easie to bring more examples of this kinde,
but these are sufficient to instruct those up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom there is imposed a necessity of
flattering, that they may take heed, lest
their flattery bring upon themselves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
any Private or Publick damage; it is

one that affirmed, that whatever the King
thought fit to do, was lawful. Thus out
of the Humor of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and the Nature
of the affair, we must first make a judgement,
whether it be fit, or safe, when he asks ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You have <hi>Royall</hi> examples of this already, I
wil now bring you one of a man, who though
he were not a King, yet bore the Office of
a King; not above an Age agoe in <hi>Spain:
Ferdinand</hi> being dead, the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the <hi>Emperor,</hi> exhorted, <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi>
then in <hi>Flanders</hi> to take upon him the title
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99202:23"/>
of King of <hi>Spain;</hi> although his Mother <hi>Ione,
Ferdinands</hi> daughter were still living, but
wholly unfit for Government, by reason of
her want of health. The States were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
assembled, and before them Cardinal
<hi>Ximenes,</hi> to excuse the novelty of the thing,
discoursed excellently of the reasons of
what was done. The <hi>Grandees</hi> more obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of ancient customes, and the <hi>Queen,</hi>
then was fit against a <hi>King</hi> that was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to succeed of Course; Protested very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
against it. <hi>Ximenes</hi> being angry,
rises up and tels them, <hi>the thing that was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of, was not to be called in queston; neither
was there any need of their ndvice in the case:
That Kings being to enter upon their Kingdoms,
are not to expect the consent of their Subjects;
that they who were assembled, were not called out
of any necessity, but that they might have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ccasion
by the Promptitude of their suffrages to endear
their Prince unto them. But since they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
that as a due, which was onely a favor,
they should see that without their approbation he
would proclaim King</hi> Charls <hi>at</hi> Madrid; which
example all the rest of the Cities quickly
followed.</p>
               <p>Such a maner of proceeding, not onely
in these cases, but in all others in a maner
do <hi>Princes</hi> use; scarce asking any mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but either to the end they may Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
their own resolutions with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99202:24"/>
of many, or else to discover the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the person they advise withal, as
<hi>Tacitus</hi> witnesseth that <hi>Tiberius</hi> oft did. The
<hi>Courtier</hi> must therefore sollicitously sift into
the <hi>Princes</hi> Mind, lest otherwise he should
chance to give offensive Counsel. If the
<hi>Princes</hi> inclination in the thing debated be
doubtful unto him, let him seem to discuss
the matter, and so laying down arguments
both for the one, and the other side, let him
leave the <hi>Prince</hi> to his own election: Who
(if the thing advised of, be not unalterably
resolved upon already) having heard the
reasons that may be brought against it, if he
be discreet, will change his Minde.</p>
               <p>Neither in this case will there be any
ground for that bashfulness (of blushing, to
seem so much inferior to any body, as to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their Counsel) which though it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hurtful and unbecoming unto them, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
familiar amongst great men; for having
said what you can, you leave the freedom
of determining all to the <hi>Princes</hi> prudence,
whereby you will also avoid the danger
that many times Counsellors are obnoxious
unto, if their advices succeed ill. And if the
<hi>Prince</hi> following his first resolutions meet
not with success, he will by so much the
more acknowledge and esteem the prudence
of that <hi>Courtier,</hi> who foresaw the approaching
misfortune, when it was yet avoidable.</p>

of delay, or else intreat that some
third person may be called for the better
discussing of the business; whereby the
case being more maturely weighed, it may
appear what is most for the dignity and

her if she were found guilty; But since it was

are taking, <hi>Nero</hi>'s fury asswages,
and his fears grow less, so that his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,

in desperate and ambiguous cases. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,

               <p>Now if so be, that in that headlong course

or straits do occur, he will much
more reflect upon the prudence of him that
would have disswaded him in time, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
for the future, be willing to hearken to
him, propounding milder ways. Besides
this gaining of time doth frequently afford
subject of moderating the <hi>Princes</hi> passion,
and of bridling his desires, or else of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him see, that what he is about is either
wholly impossible, or else cannot be effected
without great absurdity.</p>
               <p>For it after happens, that the ways which
<hi>Princes</hi> propose unto themselves, are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with such circumstances of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as are not to be overcome; and to these
kinde of straits, as I would not have you <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort

much disswade him from them, (rather suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him with a respective silence to take his

these difficult ways, he seek out some more
easie one of compassing his will;) which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
having toild himself out of breath
amongst the Obstacles that he met with, he
would voluntarily give the business over.
But sometimes it falls out that <hi>Princes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the execution of some Wickedness or
Injustice to an honest man: In which case
truly (though all good men ought to suffer
any violence or misfortune rather then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to be made the Minister of villany) I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99202:26"/>
fear the number of these is very few that are
so generously resolved, as by a passive diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to expose themselves to the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for another; especially if the occasion
offered, and the nature of the <hi>Prince</hi> admits
of no denial, or excuse, nor affords any way
of casting that displeasing imployment upon
some third person.</p>
               <p>Which later course <hi>Burrhus</hi> took, <hi>Nero</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
the second time upon his Mothers
murther, full of so much the more care and
eagerness, by how much the danger of her
contrived Shipwrack in the <hi>Tyher</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
no other effect, then that the Woman
always before malicious and greedy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
was after so great an injury become
more inraged then ever. <hi>Burrhus</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi>
being call'd to Counsel, stood long
ambiguous and doubtful what to say, as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
reports <hi>Annal. 14.</hi> saying: <hi>They were
both of them a long time silent, fearing lest they
disswade in vain; At last</hi> Seneca <hi>hitherto the
forwarder man, cast his eye upon</hi> Burrhus, <hi>as if
he would have asked, whether the execution of
that Murther should not be left to the Soldiers;</hi>
Burrhus <hi>prevented him with an answer, and
sayes that the</hi> Pretorian Bands <hi>were all devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to</hi> Caesars <hi>house, and so mindful of</hi> Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,
<hi>that they would act nothing of cruelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Progeny; and therefore that</hi> Anice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus
<hi>should perform his promise.</hi> So he freed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99202:26"/>
both himself and his soldiers, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of that ugly act.</p>
               <p>I confess, he is not beholding unto you,
whom, to save your self innocent, you shall
intangle in such an imployment: But should
such an occasion happen, I think it fitter
that some such man as <hi>Anicetus</hi> was, should
undergo the infamy of such an act, then any
<hi>vertuous</hi> or <hi>honest man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet the safest way of all is in time to <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,</hi>
and in their birth to <hi>prevent,</hi> and occur
to the <hi>unjust desires,</hi> and the unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of the <hi>Prince;</hi> and before they either
take Root, or appear above Ground, to
suppress and pull them up. There are many,
who with <hi>seasonable</hi> and <hi>gentle admonitions,</hi>
and <hi>silken words,</hi> as <hi>Parisates</hi> calls them,
have done much good, and had wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
success in <hi>these cases;</hi> yet it is necessary,
that whosoever would use such remedies as
these be of <hi>great authority</hi> with the <hi>Prince,</hi>
who, must hear as much out of <hi>reverence</hi> as
<hi>love:</hi> And nevertheless, when all is done,
though it may succeed well in <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that
case,</hi> it will hardly do so in <hi>all.</hi> I am much
pleased with the way of those men, who
are of a <hi>conceited</hi> and <hi>pleasant humor,</hi> and for
that faculty, acceptable with the <hi>Prince;</hi>
who as it were, intending something else,
with a fit <hi>similitude,</hi> or a well chosen <hi>story,</hi>
will represent unto the <hi>Prince</hi> the <hi>danger,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99202:27"/>
and <hi>foulness</hi> of those <hi>Counsels,</hi> wherewith
he seems to be <hi>carried headlong</hi> away.</p>
               <p>But to do this, there is a great nimbleness
of <hi>wit,</hi> and pleasantness of <hi>discourse</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
besides, they must take heed the <hi>Prince</hi>
smell not out, that himself is the argument
of the <hi>jest.</hi> As <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who in the Tragedy
of <hi>Atreus,</hi> composed by <hi>Scaurus,</hi> believed he
was reproached of his <hi>Brothers</hi> murther; and
<hi>Domitian,</hi> in that which <hi>Helvidius</hi> had writ
of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Cenon,</hi> thought himself upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his <hi>divorces:</hi> Wherefore it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that these kinde of stories be skilfully
interwoven amongst other things, not <hi>squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
or <hi>applyable</hi> to the <hi>Prince;</hi> and it is very

continuance of the <hi>story,</hi> by how much the

               <p>For this kinde of <hi>moderation,</hi> whereby
you may neither contribute to the <hi>Princes</hi>
vices, nor in vain resist them; there are
many critical times, and means, which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99202:27"/>
those that attend upon the <hi>persons,</hi> and are
Employed in the affairs of <hi>Princes,</hi> cannot
but meet with. If so be that the case be
such, that you must needs contradict the
<hi>disposition</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> you
must seek out some other <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>humor</hi> in
him, whereunto he is equally inclined, and
so beget a <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>contention</hi> in the <hi>Princes</hi>
minde; but we must carefully pretend still,
that what we say, comes from the <hi>duty</hi> and
<hi>reverence</hi> that we bear him. By this means
did <hi>Mutianus</hi> keep <hi>Domitian</hi> in orde, and
hinder him from joyning with <hi>Cerealis,</hi> as
(out of what hopes, I know not) he was
about to do, says <hi>Tacitus, Hist. 4.</hi>

except, that as they are more powerful then
others, so they are less <hi>masters</hi> of their <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>

in them, then in meaner <hi>persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He, in whom <hi>Choler</hi> rules, is, <hi>Hasty, Proud,</hi>
and prone to <hi>Anger;</hi> a lover of <hi>Ceremony,</hi>
and <hi>Respect;</hi> a sore enemy to those that are
but in the least sort refractory; impatient
in <hi>execution,</hi> and rash in <hi>resolution;</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner
of all mens opinions, that differ
from his own; very apt to commit <hi>injuries,</hi>
yet soon friends with those he hath wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if they renew not the memory of <hi>passed
enmities;</hi> but a hater of those that rip up
<hi>old offences,</hi> and to the end, he may prevent
such as he is afraid of, watching all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of doing them a greater mischief.</p>
               <p>Whoever hath to do with such a <hi>Prince,</hi>
must always have his <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>ears</hi> open,
that he may readily <hi>understand</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> the

seem to think himself wiser then he; let
him not stick to submit himself to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
kinde of <hi>imployments,</hi> if need be, though
they suit not with his condition. He must be
<hi>patient of injuries,</hi> and no ways mindful of

                  <hi>officious:</hi> He must not <hi>brag</hi> of his merits,

with them; but rather heap <hi>services</hi> upon
<hi>services,</hi> least the memory of those that are
past should wear out, and to the end, the
pleasure and gratefulness of <hi>fresh ones,</hi> may
<hi>revive</hi> the <hi>remembrance</hi> of the <hi>old.</hi> When
the <hi>Prince</hi> is angry, let him not come near
him, for all things displease him then; nèi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are those that are dearest unto him,
grateful in any thing they can devise, to
say or do. <hi>Familiarity</hi> with such <hi>humors</hi>
as these, turns into <hi>contempt;</hi> which for that
reason, although the <hi>Prince</hi> invite us to it,
is to be <hi>avoided:</hi> Let all things rather tend
to <hi>modesty</hi> and <hi>respect.</hi> For these <hi>Lyons,</hi>
though sometimes they be <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>gentle,</hi>
are at other times <hi>enraged</hi> against those they
<hi>love</hi> best, and who are in most <hi>authority</hi> with
them.</p>
               <p>They that are of a <hi>Sanguine Constitution,</hi>
are for the most part of a pleasant <hi>humor,</hi>
lovers of <hi>mirth,</hi> and <hi>recreation;</hi> flying <hi>sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
the seriousness of <hi>business,</hi> and trouble
of <hi>debates,</hi> lovers of <hi>peace,</hi> leaving the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of their affairs to others, in

               <p>He that lives with such as these, must
omit no circumstances of <hi>veneration</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi>
but very seldom must they treat of
<hi>business,</hi> or serious <hi>affairs.</hi> Those that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the greatest, and most important
<hi>Offices,</hi> and concernments of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
ought not to come near these <hi>Princes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be either <hi>called,</hi> or certain that
the <hi>Prince</hi> is not engaged in any <hi>recreation;</hi>

in his greatest <hi>delights,</hi> and make him blush
to be surprised by those, who, he may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
are <hi>secretly angry,</hi> to see him no better
entertained. For so when <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

as those that manage the greatest affairs of

do exceed <hi>others;</hi> so also are they out-gone
by others, in a familiar and free access to

That whilst they are out of the

<hi>facility</hi> and <hi>complacence,</hi> loose their authority
with <hi>others;</hi> but they must preserve the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of their <hi>rank</hi> intire, for without that
(as the <hi>Proverh</hi> says) <hi>Familiarity breeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi>
and contempt gives encouragement
to quarrels, upon the first appearance of an
<hi>injury:</hi> Which the <hi>Prince</hi> being an enemy

endeavor to remove him that shall appear
most faulty.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Melancholly Prince</hi> is slow in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,

rather to <hi>sound</hi> other mens opinions, then
<hi>deliver</hi> his own; an enemy of <hi>jests,</hi> and <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
a lover of <hi>solitude,</hi> difficult of <hi>access,</hi>

               <p>With these kinde of dispositions, we
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99202:30"/>
cannot deal with too much <hi>wariness</hi> and
<hi>circumspection;</hi> principally we must take
care of our <hi>Tongues,</hi> and call, as it were, a
counsel upon every thing we say; to the
end, we may speak nothing <hi>strange</hi> or <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi>
nor indeed, scarce at all, unless we be
called upon: In our <hi>respect,</hi> we must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

give us <hi>repulses,</hi> especially such a <hi>Prince,</hi>
who being by his nature prone to ill suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
will think that man his enemy, that
he hath given a refusal unto; neither will
you easily afterward, by any skill, take this
<hi>apprehension</hi> out of him; for with such, the

measuring <hi>others</hi> by <hi>themselves,</hi> they believe
all men as <hi>malicious,</hi> and as obstinate in
their <hi>hatred,</hi> as they. In short, these kinde
of men are the <hi>worst,</hi> and most difficult of
all <hi>others;</hi> and whose <hi>temper,</hi> by reason of

The <hi>Phlegmatick Prince</hi> participates of
the heaviness and slowness of the <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly;</hi>
but as in <hi>understanding,</hi> so in <hi>peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>disturst,</hi> is inferior to him; for his
heart is, as it were, <hi>congealed</hi> with <hi>cold;</hi> and
hence it comes to pass, that he is <hi>diffident</hi> of
none so much, as of himself; <hi>fearing</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
great matters, because he <hi>despairs</hi>
of the <hi>success,</hi> and knows not how to go
about it. He is doubtful in his <hi>Counsels,</hi>
fearful in <hi>Execution,</hi> not of a <hi>quick capacity;</hi>
and as his <hi>hate</hi> is not <hi>great,</hi> so his <hi>love</hi> is not
<hi>vehement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To supply the <hi>heaviness</hi> of these <hi>Princes,</hi>
an <hi>active</hi> and <hi>ready Minister</hi> is necessary.
When the <hi>Prince</hi> hath once found him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to effect those things, that himself
thought <hi>desperate,</hi> discovering the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his own wit; he <hi>loves, admires,</hi> and
<hi>cherishes</hi> this man, as necessary unto him.
And that kinde of <hi>favor,</hi> which leans upon
the opinion of <hi>such a necessity,</hi> is of all others
<hi>most durable.</hi> Which our <hi>Courtier</hi> once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
let him make it his business to bring
to a <hi>prosperous issue,</hi> those businesses that
seemed most <hi>difficult,</hi> and from which, the
<hi>Prince</hi> expected little or no success; as it
was the constant practise of that great
<hi>Minister</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Richeleiu,</hi> who
always kept the <hi>King</hi> intangled in such
<hi>dangerous undertakings,</hi> That if he <hi>would,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99202:31"/>
he knew not <hi>how</hi> to be without him.</p>
               <p>Let our <hi>Courtier</hi> also, if it can be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
compass these things, and execute
the most material part of his <hi>business</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
alone, taking heed, however he do,
that he take not to his assistance, a <hi>helper</hi> or
<hi>companion,</hi> more <hi>habile</hi> and <hi>dexterous,</hi> then
<hi>himself:</hi> Withal, let him beware he be not
too long absent from <hi>Court,</hi> least he chance
to loose the <hi>Prince,</hi> who if he shall once
finde one <hi>more able</hi> or useful then <hi>him,</hi> he
will be either less valued, or at least be
held less necessary; and so being laid aside
once or twice, in imployments that shall
succeed in <hi>other hands,</hi> will at last fall into
<hi>contempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore it is an old art of <hi>Courtiers,</hi>
not to take unto themselves any <hi>Companions,</hi>

with such as these, may not easily
know where to finde one, whom he may

under <hi>Augustus</hi> his Government, both his life

               <p>Of <hi>Caligula,</hi> this judgement of <hi>Passienus</hi>

Just as <hi>Leontius</hi> said of <hi>Zeno, That a Serpent

                  <hi>Tryphon,</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> witnesses, whilest he
led a <hi>private life,</hi> to win upon the people,
did <hi>personate a good man;</hi> but being made a

let them see, that all that <hi>vertue</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in him, was forced and <hi>counterfeit:</hi>
And that of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> is not much unlike,
if what <hi>Euripedes</hi> writes of him be true;
he was <hi>modest, affable,</hi> and <hi>easie of access,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was chosen <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of the

                  <hi>An excellent</hi> sentence, <hi>but observed by few.</hi>
Pollio <hi>truly seemed to follow it, if we may
believe</hi> Seneca. Afterwards (<hi>saith he</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
promoted to the highest degrees of honor, he,
never corrupted by any occasion, deviated a whit,
from his former modesty, temperance, and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
He was never pufft up with prosperity, nor
with the variety of business was he so disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as that any one could surprize him in a humor,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99202:33"/>
derogating from the reputation he had gained
before.</p>
               <p>For truly, the defects and blemishes of
<hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Courtiers,</hi> proceed for the most
part out of <hi>Pride,</hi> the inseparable <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid</hi>
of <hi>greatness.</hi> This is that makes them
<hi>despise</hi> other mens <hi>counsels,</hi> being vainly
perswaded, that they do excel other men,
as much in <hi>Prudence,</hi> as they do in <hi>Power.</hi>
And some are so carried away with this
<hi>stream,</hi> that they think it below them to
keep within the limits of <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Reason;</hi>
believing they cannot be <hi>Princes,</hi> to whom
all things are not lawful, they have a minde
unto, according to that of the <hi>Poet.</hi>

with the <hi>witchcraft</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Rule.</hi> No
man ever yet exceeded the <hi>Seven Sages</hi> of
<hi>Greece,</hi> in giving Precepts of <hi>modesty;</hi> nor
ever were there worse <hi>Tyrants,</hi> then such of
<hi>them</hi> as came to Government. <hi>Appianus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to speak of <hi>Aristo,</hi> reckoned up not a
few that bore the name of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> that
had plaid the <hi>Tyrants</hi> at <hi>Athens;</hi> naming
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99202:33"/>
also some of the very <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> who
being called to Government in <hi>Italy,</hi> did
exceedingly abuse their power; which
makes me doubt much, whether most of
those <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who so proudly contemn
<hi>honors</hi> and <hi>dignity,</hi> do it in <hi>good earnest,</hi> or
not rather for a <hi>cloak</hi> and <hi>cover</hi> to their
<hi>small deserts,</hi> their <hi>poverty</hi> and <hi>idleness.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if we will believe <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> they did
not live so <hi>frugally</hi> and neerly, so much out
of <hi>vertue,</hi> as <hi>necessity;</hi> and would not refuse
to <hi>feast</hi> plentifully, when ever they were
invited.</p>

               <p>THere are oftentimes <hi>Impostors,</hi> who with

learnt from these people to <hi>oppress</hi> his <hi>subjects</hi>
with heavy <hi>Tributes,</hi> as the same <hi>Tacitus</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99202:34"/>
affirms: In short, it is certain, that many
who have used the service of these kinde of
men, have sadly degenerated. These <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors</hi>
seek favor unto themselves, by show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Prince</hi> ways to <hi>Greatness, Power,</hi> and
<hi>Profit;</hi> who by so much the more willingly
doth hearken to them, by how much the
less he understands himself. He poor man,
not reflecting, nor observing that these men
praise and sooth him; to the end, they may
at last betray him to <hi>contempt,</hi> and <hi>expose</hi>
him to the <hi>hatred</hi> of his people. And truly,
to humor and comply with the <hi>Cruelty, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,</hi>
and <hi>Lust</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> is of all
others, the securest way to betray him, for
he cannot condemn the <hi>Traytor,</hi> without
discovering his own <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>vices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Franconians,</hi> by the help of <hi>Aegidius,</hi>
at that time governing in <hi>Gaul</hi> for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
had expelled <hi>Clodius Comatus</hi> out of
his Kingdom, whom one of his friends
desiring to see restored, goes over to <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
and <hi>fostered</hi> upon all occasions, as

of the <hi>man,</hi> which was but too notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
before; whence the injuries of this

begin to wish for their <hi>King</hi> again, and
at last <hi>recal</hi> him to his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Thus this
honest <hi>Franconian</hi> made good use of his
<hi>flattery,</hi> and by feeding him in his own <hi>vices,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:99202:34"/>
betrayed his <hi>Masters</hi> enemies. <hi>Sejanus,</hi> who
gaped after the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, see what
arts he used: After he saw that <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
who by his instinct had imprisoned <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi>
and her <hi>children,</hi> grew weary of the
<hi>City;</hi> spur'd that inclination on, hoping,
that when the <hi>Prince</hi> was once retired, the
<hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> should
be cast upon him, as indeed it came to pass;
so that for a time, <hi>Tiberius</hi> was onely <hi>Lord</hi>
of a little <hi>Island,</hi> and <hi>Sejanus</hi> Emperor.
<hi>Perrennius</hi> also thirsting after the <hi>Empire,</hi>
first circumvented and made away all those
that stood in his light, under pretence of a
<hi>conspiracy,</hi> that <hi>Lucilla</hi> had contrived against

to the managing of all things, and at last
attain unto the <hi>Empire.</hi>

               <p>HAving considered all things, that our

making <hi>seasonable</hi> mention of them, or by
<hi>instructing</hi> them of the <hi>ways, times,</hi> and

and who more willingly do <hi>trust</hi> and
<hi>disclose</hi> their thoughts, to such of their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
as they think faithful to <hi>them,</hi> esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lowness of their <hi>condition</hi> incapable
of <hi>treachery,</hi> or <hi>wicked practises:</hi> Who does
not know, that <hi>Claudius</hi> was governed by
his <hi>Freedmen,</hi> one of which, called <hi>Pallas,</hi>
he had so inriched, That upon a time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of <hi>Poverty</hi> to some body, he was
advised to get <hi>Pallas</hi> adopt him for his Heir.
By this mans perswasion, <hi>Claudius</hi> married
<hi>Agrippina,</hi> after by the help of <hi>Narcissus</hi> (a

               </p>
               <p>Who can be ignorant, that during the

<hi>Eunuches</hi> many times governed all? if that
had not been so, it had been impossible for
<hi>Arbetio,</hi> the <hi>cheif Ruler</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to
have escaped with life, when <hi>Verissimus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
him. <hi>Borilus</hi> and <hi>Germanus,</hi> two slaves,
by the absolute authority they had with

an enemy to <hi>Isacius,</hi> and <hi>Alexius Comnenis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet let us suppose, That the <hi>Prince</hi> does
not impart his <hi>Counsels</hi> to these men, they

are more easily <hi>pryed</hi> into by these, then any

the <hi>throng,</hi> and a <hi>publike life,</hi> makes

when he is at liberty, and in private, do
break out. Wherefore, I conclude, it is
very necessary in <hi>Courts, To think all kinde
of men, even the meanest, useful unto you.</hi> And
we must believe for certain, That together
with their <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> their <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>

and his two slaves; The one of which
coming to wait upon the <hi>Emperor</hi> at his

Whence it was, that in the time of

how warily we ought to deal with
inconstant Princes.</head>
               <p>FRom the <hi>Princes Servants,</hi> we come to
the <hi>Nobles</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> which are of
sundry kindes: There are <hi>some illustrious for
their birth, but destitute of the Princes favor;</hi>
others <hi>in favor with the Prince, but not laden
with honors;</hi> a third sort, <hi>that have honors and
offices, far exceeding their Interest and Favor;</hi>
and lastly, <hi>Those who flourish both in Favor,
and great Imployments.</hi> The friendship of the
<hi>first</hi> of these, will perhaps avail our <hi>Courtier</hi>
very little, who are nevertheless to be <hi>honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
and <hi>respected,</hi> according to their quality;
least, though they cannot hurt you them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by their <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>followers,</hi> they
should do it: For in such <hi>Trains of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies</hi>
and <hi>followers, great Families</hi> are
often very powerful, either by reason of <hi>old
benefits,</hi> or reverence to their <hi>greatness;</hi> or
lastly, (since <hi>Princes</hi> mindes are <hi>mutable</hi>)
out of respect to the <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Favor</hi> these
<hi>great men</hi> may yet chance to come into;
with this, or the succeeding <hi>Prince.</hi>

disadvantage, did neglect to Honor and
Court <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he came to <hi>Rhodes;</hi>
for <hi>Tiberius</hi> afterwards meditating <hi>revenge,</hi>
but pretending another <hi>cause,</hi> called him to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where he <hi>perished</hi> miserably: Which
<hi>respect</hi> nevertheless the <hi>Historian</hi> says, <hi>He
omitted not out of pride, but for that he was
warned by some of</hi> Augustus <hi>his Favorites,
That whilst</hi> Cajus Caesar <hi>flourished, and was
sent into the East, the Friendship of</hi> Tiberius
<hi>seemed unsafe.</hi> We must look therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these <hi>great men</hi> of Fortune, though not
able to <hi>deserve well of us,</hi> yet powerful
enough to <hi>hurt us:</hi> And though they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
and suspected by the <hi>Prince,</hi> we
must yet <hi>reverence them,</hi> to avoid the <hi>blam
of others,</hi> and <hi>their emnity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it chance, that the <hi>Prince</hi> will oppose
you to one of these <hi>great ones,</hi> as it is usual
with <hi>Princes</hi> to do; as you must not <hi>refuse
the task,</hi> so you must with great <hi>art, dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and <hi>choice of occasions,</hi> undertake it;
taking care, that you may both <hi>satisfie</hi> the
<hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>justifie</hi> your endeavors to <hi>other
men:</hi> It is an enterprize full of <hi>danger,</hi> but
if at the <hi>Princes</hi> instance, it be taken in
hand, it is the way to rise.</p>
               <p>Yet after you are once ingaged in one of
these <hi>Brigues,</hi> there are the choice of two
ways to be taken, according to the nature
of the <hi>Prince you act for,</hi> the <hi>persons you have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99202:37"/>
to do with,</hi> and the <hi>times you are in:</hi> Some
men <hi>act</hi> all these things in their <hi>own name</hi> so
<hi>boldly,</hi> and with so <hi>high a hand,</hi> That all
kinde of men, except those that are <hi>great</hi>
indeed, strike easily <hi>sail</hi> unto them, for fear
of <hi>offending</hi> the <hi>Prince;</hi> who approves (as
they believe) all these men <hi>say</hi> or <hi>do.</hi> There
are others yet, that take another course
more safe and sweet, by continually <hi>waiting</hi>
upon the <hi>Prince,</hi> their <hi>interest,</hi> in whom
they will <hi>make no shew of,</hi> but upon the <hi>best
opportunities;</hi> neither will they take any
occasion for these <hi>contentions,</hi> but such as
with <hi>great choice</hi> they have <hi>selected,</hi> as both
likely to <hi>succeed;</hi> and having took effect, to
<hi>redound</hi> much to the <hi>advantage</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi>
and <hi>Publike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For you must take great heed you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
nothing you cannot go through with;

all things by the <hi>event,</hi> believing still, that
<hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> are on the side that
<hi>Fortune</hi> is; by <hi>ill successes,</hi> you will soon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
the <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>favor,</hi> you have with
the <hi>Prince.</hi> For he to take away the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi>
received, and by reason, That he fears

               </p>
               <p>When I advise you to oppose these <hi>great

do something that is <hi>unjust,</hi> or against the

<hi>Treasures</hi> of the Kingdom: In which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
you must so comport your self with
<hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Modesty,</hi> that all others that
are <hi>concerned,</hi> and all <hi>honest men</hi> may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that what you do proceeds not out
of any <hi>private emnity,</hi> but onely from your

chosen by <hi>Isabelia,</hi> Queen of <hi>Castile,</hi> on
purpose to <hi>tug</hi> with those <hi>Grandees,</hi> that
were not so subject to the <hi>Kings</hi> pleasure,
as they are now: Of a <hi>Franciscan Frier,</hi> he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99202:38"/>
was first made the Queens <hi>Confessor,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by the advice of Cardinal <hi>Mendoza,</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and Inquisitor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of <hi>Spain;</hi> which <hi>Offices</hi> he bore with
great authority, being there during the
whole Reign of <hi>Isabella,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and
was even to the time of <hi>Charls</hi> the Fift,
the sole <hi>Arbiter</hi> and <hi>Moderator</hi> of all <hi>Affairs;</hi>
ever contending with the <hi>great ones,</hi> but so
discreetly, That he always held both the
<hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>people</hi> fast unto him.</p>
               <p>It is reported that he was <hi>poysoned,</hi> and
he himself suspected it, but the fact could
never be proved. Wherefore it is better
to attribute so <hi>late a death</hi> as his (for he was
very old) to <hi>age</hi> and <hi>nature;</hi> and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reason, since he preserved his <hi>fortune</hi>
and <hi>authority</hi> (both which he owed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to his own industry) <hi>entire</hi> unto his
<hi>end. Chico Simoneta</hi> had not so good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
who whilst <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> ruled in
<hi>Milan,</hi> was called to the helm of <hi>business,</hi>
and afterwards chosen by yong <hi>Galeacius</hi>
Mother, by reason of his known fidelity,
and experience in Publike Affairs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with his <hi>Masters Brethren.</hi> He to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the <hi>Dukedom</hi> for <hi>Galeacius,</hi> banished
<hi>Galeacius</hi> Brothers, and <hi>Robert de St. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
out of <hi>Milan,</hi> with how much envy
you may imagine: Yet see how wickedly
he was afterwards deserted, for the Widow,

                  <hi>Galeacius</hi> his Mother, reconciling her self

(as I said before) who are in <hi>favor</hi>
with the <hi>Prince,</hi> and yet not very eminent
in any <hi>dignity</hi> or <hi>imployment.</hi> These though
they can contribute nothing else unto us,
may <hi>make our way</hi> unto the <hi>King,</hi> seasonable
and easie, besides they may be useful in
<hi>calling</hi> to minde our <hi>deserts,</hi> or if occasion
require, in <hi>excusing our errors;</hi> protecting us
also from the <hi>calumny</hi> and <hi>detractions</hi> of our
<hi>Enemies;</hi> by which means, if they be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our <hi>Friends,</hi> they may serve us <hi>highly;</hi> as
on the contrary side, if they be our <hi>foes,</hi>
they may <hi>prejudice</hi> us exceedingly: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99202:39"/>
we must seek the <hi>friendship of these men,</hi>
by all means, that are not <hi>unworthy</hi> our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and we must consider, that they
seldom stay any long time about a <hi>Prince,</hi>
unexalted to <hi>honor:</hi> Nay, suppose that for
some reason or other, they be not <hi>advanced,</hi>
yet by their <hi>help</hi> and <hi>commendations,</hi> they do
<hi>advance their friends,</hi> and lift them up above
others, though either <hi>equal</hi> or <hi>superior</hi> to
them in <hi>desert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third sort of <hi>Nobles,</hi> are those who
are in great <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> and have a
great share in <hi>publike business,</hi> and yet have
little interest in the <hi>Princes</hi> favor. And
these kinde of men are chiefly found about
such <hi>Princes,</hi> who live quietly, attending to
their <hi>pleasures,</hi> mindless of <hi>Publike business,</hi>
which they commit wholly to one or two
of their <hi>tryed Servants,</hi> abhorring the <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
that is attending it themselves. In such
a <hi>Court</hi> as this, we must rather seek the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
of these <hi>Ministers,</hi> then of the <hi>Prince</hi>
himself; who since he trusts them with the
<hi>administration</hi> of his <hi>Affairs,</hi> leaves also the
choice of his <hi>Officers</hi> to these men, being
himself unfit to chuse <hi>men for duties,</hi> which
he knows nothing what belongs unto.</p>
               <p>There are other <hi>Princes</hi> more <hi>jealous</hi> of
their <hi>Majesty,</hi> and <hi>sparing</hi> in their <hi>Power;</hi>
who though they intrust <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> with
their <hi>Affairs,</hi> do seldom or never admit
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99202:40"/>
those men to their <hi>Presence</hi> or <hi>Conversation,</hi>
but when they are to treat of <hi>weighty busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
and do not leave the <hi>disposal of places</hi>
to them, for fear that by the multitude of
<hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Dependants,</hi> their <hi>power</hi> should
<hi>swell</hi> to that height, that it cannot be <hi>abated,</hi>
if they <hi>transgress.</hi> Wary <hi>Princes</hi> are wont
to keep their <hi>Ministers</hi> in aw, and make
them believe, That they can in a <hi>moment</hi>
cast them from all their <hi>Authority,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
them of all that power, that with the
<hi>services</hi> and <hi>labors</hi> of many years, they have
been <hi>acquiring</hi> towards <hi>such persons</hi> as these;
whose power is thus circumscribed, you
will have a <hi>hard task,</hi> how to <hi>demean</hi> your
self. Their <hi>friendship</hi> can <hi>avail</hi> you little,
nay perhaps if the <hi>Prince</hi> observe it, it will
do you <hi>hurt.</hi> Again, if they <hi>stand in your light,</hi>
you will hardly come to the <hi>management</hi> of
<hi>Affairs,</hi> and yet you must of necessity run
the hazard of <hi>clashing</hi> oftentimes with them.
Wherefore, a most circumspect <hi>gentleness of
Nature</hi> will here be needful, for you must
<hi>render them</hi> all the <hi>duties</hi> of <hi>respect,</hi> and as
occasion presents it self (yet warily) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the <hi>inward devotion</hi> of your minde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them: But in the mean while, without
openly <hi>seeking to,</hi> or <hi>relying upon</hi> the Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of any <hi>other,</hi> you must your self, work
out your <hi>way</hi> unto the <hi>Princes person,</hi> and
his <hi>favor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:99202:40"/>
There remains now unspoke of onely the
last kinde of <hi>Noblemen,</hi> who are in short,
<hi>The Favorites,</hi> as being <hi>hoth highly in the
Princes Favor,</hi> and <hi>great in the administration
of Affairs:</hi> Which kinde of men, are to be
honored with a <hi>respect almost equal</hi> to the
<hi>Prince himself.</hi> Their <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>inclinations</hi>
are to be <hi>pryed</hi> into, as being more necessary
to be <hi>known</hi> and <hi>executed,</hi> then the <hi>Princes</hi>
own. Here you see, what you may expect,
or hope for, from the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi>
of the <hi>Peers,</hi> and <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Court;</hi>
and how you may use each of them in his
several <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>kinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly we must carefully take heed, that
we ask nothing of either the <hi>Prince,</hi> or any
of all these that is <hi>impossible,</hi> or cannot be
<hi>effected</hi> without great <hi>absurdity;</hi> For nothing
is more troublesome to humane nature, then
<hi>not to be able</hi> to fulfil the <hi>requests</hi> of those
we love; and surely, the <hi>friendliest</hi> and
<hi>gentlest dispositions</hi> that are, will be offended
with an <hi>uncivil</hi> and <hi>unreasonable suit.</hi> Know
moreover, that he from whom you have
received such a <hi>repulse,</hi> is not pleased with
<hi>seeing you</hi> again, for fear lest with the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi>
of a like <hi>request,</hi> you should make
him <hi>ashamed;</hi> and also, lest he should seem
to want <hi>Authority</hi> or means to <hi>perform</hi> what
you desire. But you must note by the way,
that <hi>access</hi> unto the <hi>great ones,</hi> is not sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99202:41"/>
obtained, we must by degrees also gain
<hi>that;</hi> and to this end, <hi>all</hi> that have any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in them,</hi> whether they be <hi>Strangers</hi> or
<hi>Domesticks,</hi> and the <hi>Dependants</hi> of these (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their usefulness) are to be <hi>won</hi>
unto you.</p>

which are our <hi>betters,</hi> others our <hi>equals,</hi> and

<hi>two kindes:</hi> The <hi>first,</hi> of those that may help
and <hi>advantage</hi> us; the <hi>second,</hi> of those that
are likely, or able to <hi>hurt us.</hi> The <hi>interest</hi>
and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>both</hi> of them, is diligently to
be weighed, to the end, we may gather
what <hi>help</hi> or <hi>impediment</hi> we are to expect
from them. We must consider also, their
<hi>friendships</hi> and <hi>alliances,</hi> to the end, that if
necessity press us to seek their <hi>votes</hi> for the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99202:41"/>
promotion of our <hi>designs,</hi> if they <hi>themselves</hi>
are through <hi>envy</hi> or any such respect, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or <hi>averse</hi> unto us, we may work upon
them by their <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>dependants:</hi> But
we must be sure to take heed, that we do
not then <hi>begin</hi> to seek their <hi>friendship,</hi> when
we have apparent need of them, or their
<hi>assistance;</hi> we ought to have it prepared
long before, and assured unto us by the
<hi>pledges</hi> of a long professed <hi>kindness,</hi> and
<hi>good will.</hi> Let this suffice for the <hi>first sort,</hi>
(to wit, of those that may help us) for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mans industry will prompt him, <hi>How
to insinuate with such, as he findes may be useful
unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the <hi>second sort</hi> (to wit) those that may
<hi>hurt</hi> us, there are <hi>three kindes;</hi> either those
that are <hi>our enemies,</hi> or those that <hi>envy us,</hi>
or lastly, those that are <hi>our competitors.</hi>
Those I call <hi>enemies</hi> that hate us for our
<hi>own,</hi> or our <hi>friends sake;</hi> but this <hi>latter</hi> kinde
of <hi>hatred,</hi> is not for the most part so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
and sharp as the <hi>first;</hi> and it may
be <hi>mitigated</hi> much by our <hi>civilities</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing,
That we can love our friends, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
our relations to their enemies:</hi> Yet the
<hi>friendships</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> are for the most part
<hi>factious</hi> and <hi>cruel;</hi> compelling us to break
off all <hi>friendship</hi> and <hi>familiarities</hi> that may
bring us into suspicion: For which reason,
many <hi>publikely</hi> pretending a friendship to

                  <hi>one,</hi> have notwithstanding complied <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,</hi>
and kept fair quarter with the <hi>adverse
party;</hi> not out of design to betray their
friend, but to the end, if he should chance
to fall, they may finde a <hi>refuge</hi> and <hi>support.</hi>
And truly, this care of our preservation
may be sometimes <hi>blameless,</hi> but all kinde of
<hi>treachery</hi> is unworthy an <hi>honest man.</hi>

               <p>This kinde of <hi>Prudence</hi> hath not onely

               <head type="sub">How we are to treat with those Enemies
that hate us for our own sakes; also
concerning threats and injuries.</head>
               <p>THose who <hi>hate us</hi> for our <hi>own sakes,</hi> do
so either, because <hi>we</hi> have <hi>offended them,</hi>
or else (as it is frequent from <hi>great men</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their <hi>inferiors</hi>) because <hi>they</hi> have <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
us;</hi> and the <hi>Italian Proverb</hi> says, <hi>He
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99202:43"/>
that offends, never forgives.</hi> It is a custom
amongst mindes, puft up with a prosperous
<hi>Fortune,</hi> to <hi>hate those</hi> themselves have <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
The <hi>injuries</hi> that <hi>these kinde of men</hi> do
us, are best remedied in our seeming <hi>not to
understand them:</hi> But if it chance, that the
greatness of the <hi>wrong,</hi> do wrest out of us
some testimony of our sense of the <hi>injury
received,</hi> we must quickly after our grief is
over, seem to have <hi>lost the memory of all;</hi>
otherwise, if they see us <hi>still impatiently suffer
it,</hi> fearing our <hi>revenge,</hi> they will seek to
<hi>prevent</hi> us with a greater <hi>mischief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cheifly we must beware of <hi>threats,</hi> if that
we <hi>not ready,</hi> and sure to <hi>execute</hi> them; for
<hi>threats</hi> do both <hi>warn</hi> our adversary to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi>
and <hi>provoke his hatred</hi> to <hi>double our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries;</hi>
affording us nothing but <hi>shame,</hi> in
seeming to <hi>breathe revenge,</hi> but to be <hi>destitute
of power.</hi> I know this kinde of moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will not be approved by all kinde of
men, especially such as are greedy after
<hi>vengeance;</hi> who think no injury is to be
passed over without resentment, not onely
by reason of the <hi>sweetness</hi> that is found in
<hi>revenge;</hi> but also, because they say by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one <hi>injury,</hi> you invite another; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must <hi>persecute</hi> those that offend us
with an <hi>immortal hate:</hi> But these men whilst
they desire to <hi>render</hi> themselves <hi>formidable,</hi>
do effect nothing else but make all men flie
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99202:43"/>
their <hi>Company.</hi> For since we <hi>mortals</hi> are
<hi>Creatures</hi> prone to <hi>falls,</hi> and <hi>slips,</hi> and are
carried away sometimes with <hi>affection,</hi> and
at other times with <hi>passion;</hi> and in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
every one for <hi>fear of offending,</hi> will
flie from these kinde of <hi>malignant, rash,</hi> and
<hi>revengeful persons;</hi> and as <hi>wilde beasts,</hi> leave
them to their own <hi>solitude.</hi> Since, if any
one offends one of them, he must expect
all that <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> can afford at his
hands; Lastly, if any one <hi>provoke</hi> one of
the <hi>malicious Hot-spurs,</hi> he expecting a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
resentment,</hi> and fearing a <hi>home revenge,</hi>
will strive to be <hi>aforehand</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>For this Reason therefore, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all <hi>these evils,</hi> I think the contrary way
is to be chosen, and <hi>gentleness</hi> to be <hi>preferred;</hi>
which truly, in the <hi>greatest injuries</hi> is not
hard to be <hi>personated,</hi> when we consider the
<hi>reasons</hi> and <hi>consequences</hi> of a <hi>passionate resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the <hi>condition</hi> of the persons from
whom we receive them. In <hi>lighter injuries,</hi>
that we see arise rather out of <hi>passion,</hi> then
<hi>malice</hi> or <hi>design,</hi> we ought to be so little
offended with them, that it may not be
perceived we are <hi>sensible of them.</hi> If the
<hi>injury</hi> is great and foul, we must not show
our selves wholly careless of our <hi>esteem</hi> and
<hi>reputation;</hi> yet without seeming too implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
towards them that provoked us, as they
may have reason to think there is no <hi>hope of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99202:44"/>
a reconcilement,</hi> or place for <hi>pardon</hi> upon any
<hi>reasonable satisfaction</hi> left them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will be pertinent in this case to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
unto his friends</hi> that hath injured us, of
our <hi>wrongs,</hi> and to make them <hi>judge</hi> of our
<hi>difference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Injuries that are offered in a <hi>petulant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
humor,</hi> I think ought to be presently
vindicated, not so much out of a <hi>desire of
revenge,</hi> as for the <hi>chastisement</hi> of him that
did them; and to <hi>teach</hi> him how to <hi>demean
himself</hi> more modestly hereafter, as well
towards <hi>others,</hi> as our <hi>selves.</hi> But these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
also are not to be prosecuted with an
<hi>inveterate hatred,</hi> nay, we ought to declare,
that the <hi>necessity of complaint,</hi> and seeking
revenge <hi>is put upon us,</hi> and that we are

<hi>more powerful</hi> then our <hi>selves,</hi> and who have
some way or other, great advantage of us:
The <hi>first way</hi> to avoid them, is to <hi>treat</hi> these

               <p>The <hi>second way</hi> will be, as I said more
then once before, to seem <hi>unsensible</hi> of the
<hi>wrong;</hi> for it is neither <hi>safe</hi> nor <hi>prudent</hi> for
us, to strive too much with one that is too

our adversaries,</hi> they would soon <hi>seek unto us,</hi>
and desire to be reconciled; and I do not
deny, that there are some <hi>slie dispositions</hi> that
will <hi>descend</hi> to do so; but believe me, it is
always a <hi>dangerous, unsound,</hi> and faint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation:
And these will seldom or
never omit (if an occasion of <hi>injury</hi> present
it self) to give way to their <hi>disposition;</hi>
which is by so much the more <hi>revengeful,</hi>
by how much their dissembling was the
<hi>tamer;</hi> besides, a <hi>private enemy</hi> is harder to
be <hi>taken heed</hi> of, then one that is <hi>publikely</hi> so.
It is better to have such as these, our <hi>professed
enemies,</hi> then out of <hi>fear,</hi> our <hi>reconciled
friends;</hi> yet I mean, <hi>those</hi> who are not <hi>greater</hi>
then our <hi>selves,</hi> nor whose <hi>friendship</hi> being
lost, can <hi>hurt us notably.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if we have to do with one that is
much <hi>superior to us,</hi> and whose emnities will
stand in our <hi>light,</hi> it is better to have a
<hi>fained friendship,</hi> then open emnity with
him; though he <hi>offer us the wrong,</hi> yet we
must endeavor by the <hi>mediation of friends</hi>
to appease him, as if <hi>we had done the injury.</hi>
To discern who is most able and likely to
<hi>prejudice</hi> us, we must consider not onely
their <hi>power,</hi> but also the nature of their
<hi>malice</hi> towards us; for some have a <hi>desire of
revenge,</hi> like a handmaid, always waiting
upon their <hi>hate;</hi> others a <hi>fear,</hi> lest that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got what we <hi>aspire unto,</hi> we should be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99202:45"/>
more able to hurt them. Though the <hi>sting</hi>
of this <hi>revenge</hi> is very <hi>sharp,</hi> yet the <hi>fear</hi> I
mentioned, is the most violent and frequent
cause of our <hi>Court oppressions,</hi> and far the
most unavoidable. The <hi>first</hi> may be miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
with the satisfaction of a continued
<hi>duty</hi> and <hi>respect;</hi> but you shall hardly ever
perswade <hi>fear,</hi> to put on the <hi>confidence</hi> of
<hi>friendship,</hi> and <hi>good will</hi> again; yet we must
seek by all means possible to effect it: and
<hi>occasion</hi> will better instruct us <hi>how to do it,</hi>
then any <hi>rule</hi> can.</p>

whilst they <hi>ill administred,</hi> bringing <hi>euvy</hi> (as

were compelled to have recourse unto the
<hi>Prince;</hi> who delivering them from the
<hi>danger</hi> and <hi>infamy,</hi> won them by the benefit,
to be afterwards sincerely and heartily his
<hi>friends.</hi> It is an ordinary thing in <hi>Courts</hi> to

supported by <hi>your favor,</hi> he may become
your <hi>Creature.</hi> It is no less frequent as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapelus</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of Envy, how it is to be overcome.</head>
               <p>NOw I must say something of <hi>Envy,</hi>
which is so <hi>great an evil,</hi> that we have
need of a <hi>strange felicity,</hi> and <hi>fortitude</hi> to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99202:47"/>
overcome it; which is not to be <hi>satiated</hi>
with any thing, but the <hi>participation</hi> of that
which it <hi>envies</hi> in another; for every one
eager after its own advantage, desires to
toyl in nothing but that, whence if nor,
the <hi>whole,</hi> at least a <hi>great share</hi> of the <hi>honor,</hi>
and emolument will <hi>redound unto himself.</hi>
Yet although, I confess, it be very hard, yet
this <hi>envy</hi> is nevertheless with <hi>industry</hi> and
<hi>prudence,</hi> to be mastered; and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by this means alone, of <hi>sharing with them,
that very thing we seek for:</hi> For sometimes it
will suffice to perswade them that <hi>envy us,</hi>
That <hi>the thing they desire,</hi> if it chance to
light <hi>upon us,</hi> will turn much to their <hi>honor</hi>
and <hi>profit.</hi> To which end, we must <hi>court
them</hi> with <hi>friendship</hi> and <hi>familiarity;</hi> and
though their <hi>envy to us</hi> be very palpable, yet
must we express on our parts great <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>Affections</hi> towards them; profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
That we wish nothing more, then that
their desires should succeed, and that we
desire this very thing that we now pursue,
for no other end so much, as that we may
become capable to serve our <hi>friends,</hi> and
<hi>principally themselves.</hi> In short, we must act
our part so, as from the augmentation of
our <hi>fortune,</hi> they may conceive hope of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
to <hi>their own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By those that desire to be <hi>free from envy,</hi>
all <hi>pride, over-sumptuous maner of living, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99202:47"/>
feasts,</hi> and <hi>boasting,</hi> is <hi>sedulously</hi> to
be avoided; especially, by those who have
risen from a <hi>mean condition;</hi> unless the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the <hi>Prince,</hi> or the dignity of their
<hi>Office,</hi> require it otherwise; for then a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
magnificence,</hi> will not be unfit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
That in these expences, he lets the
world see, he doth rather comply with the
<hi>pleasure of the Prince,</hi> then follow <hi>his own
inclination.</hi> With this kinde of <hi>modesty</hi> and
<hi>prudence,</hi> the beginnings of Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi>
were very <hi>fortunate,</hi> and notable; for he
was born of so <hi>mean a parentage,</hi> that it was
doubtful, whether he were a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> or
no; although his <hi>prosperous fortune</hi> found
those afterwards, that would undertake to
prove his Nobility. This <hi>Ximenes</hi> whilst
the world went hard with him, became in
his youth a <hi>Frier,</hi> whence soon after for his
<hi>singular endowments,</hi> he was by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of Cardinal <hi>Mendoza,</hi> made
<hi>confessor</hi> to <hi>Isabella,</hi> Queen of <hi>Castile,</hi> and not
long after Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> (as I said
once before) which Archbishoprick upon
<hi>Medoza</hi>'s death, Queen <hi>Isabella</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of the <hi>Pope</hi> for <hi>Ximenes;</hi> he finding
himself too <hi>weak</hi> for the <hi>envy</hi> it would draw
upon him, refused to accept it; and was so
<hi>stiff</hi> in his <hi>refusal,</hi> That he scarce suffered
himself to be <hi>won to the acceptance of it,</hi> by
all the <hi>Nobles of the Court,</hi> who one by one,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99202:48"/>
at the <hi>Queens</hi> direction, prest him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it: And having accepted of it, he was
fain to be so intreated over again, before
he could be perswaded to live in a <hi>condition</hi>
and <hi>splendor</hi> equal to his <hi>dignity;</hi> nay, after
that, he was <hi>personally</hi> so <hi>observant</hi> of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
maner of life, in this great <hi>fortune,</hi> that
no way else, but by the <hi>Popes</hi> express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
could he be induced to change it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>modesty</hi> succeeded so well with him,
that hereby he appeased and avoided that
<hi>great envy,</hi> which must otherwise of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
have oppressed him, being the <hi>possessor</hi> of a
dignity <hi>gaped after,</hi> by all the Grandees of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and of <hi>Revenue,</hi> scarce inferior to
those of the <hi>Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet as this maner of proceeding is in
the <hi>East</hi> of our <hi>fortunes,</hi> an <hi>antidote against
envy,</hi> so it little avails those who have once
already carried themselves <hi>insolently</hi> and
<hi>proudly;</hi> for the <hi>moderation</hi> of these men, is
still looked upon as <hi>counterfeit:</hi> Of which
thing, the <hi>Constantinopolitan History</hi> affords us
an example in a <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine;</hi>
who being banished from the
Courts, both of <hi>Isacius Angelius,</hi> and <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
the Emperors, returned afterwards with
the Empress <hi>Euphrosine;</hi> pretending a great
aversion from <hi>business,</hi> and a Courtiers <hi>life;</hi>
to the end, he might be the more <hi>credited,</hi>
and sought unto the more eagerly, he took
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99202:48"/>
orders upon him: In short, he carried his
business so craftily, That the <hi>Emperor</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
causing him to be absolved from the
<hi>oath of Priesthood,</hi> called him to <hi>Court;</hi> and
trusted him with the management of his
<hi>greatest affairs:</hi> Who presently, not content
with his own <hi>advancement,</hi> introduced his
<hi>two Brothers</hi> to wait upon the <hi>Emperor;</hi> and
as it were, to stand <hi>Centinels</hi> for him, if at
any time his business called him away:
But because his <hi>former prosperity</hi> had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the <hi>insolence</hi> of his <hi>nature,</hi> every
body <hi>feared him still,</hi> although he now made
show of <hi>great temper</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> which
was the cause that he was again <hi>supplanted</hi>
and removed from <hi>Court,</hi> without ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>restored more.</hi>

               <p>HItherto we have observed the <hi>principal
precepts</hi> that are to be observed by our
<hi>Courtier;</hi> if any want, every <hi>rational mans</hi>
(for such onely we intend to instruct)
<hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Dexterity</hi> will supply it. Now
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99202:50"/>
because these kinde of <hi>Rules</hi> are no less
necessary, for the <hi>preserving</hi> our <hi>Greatness</hi> and
<hi>Fortune</hi> in the <hi>Court,</hi> then for the <hi>gaining</hi> of
it; it will not be impertinent to have by
us, the examples of some of those that have
<hi>faln from their power</hi> and <hi>greatness,</hi> to the
end, we may grow <hi>wise</hi> by other mens <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances;</hi>
and learn, if not to <hi>avoid a ruine,</hi>
at least to <hi>arm</hi> and <hi>prepare our selves</hi> for it:
For this <hi>latter</hi> is almost as necessary as the
<hi>first,</hi> since the indeavors of those that seek
to escape their <hi>approaching misfortunes,</hi> are
for the most part <hi>vain;</hi> whilst he that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares</hi>
himself for it <hi>long before,</hi> makes that
<hi>fall,</hi> which few or none of them can <hi>avoid;</hi>
that <hi>fortune</hi> hath lifted up on high, to be
much <hi>more gentle</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> then otherwise
it would.</p>
               <p>These <hi>falls</hi> happen unto us, either
through <hi>our own faults,</hi> through <hi>the arts and
contrivance of our Enemies,</hi> or through <hi>the
perverseness of the Princes nature,</hi> or perhaps
<hi>his death.</hi> Since the lives of all men are
obnoxious to <hi>faults,</hi> and full of <hi>errors,</hi> and
<hi>failings,</hi> it is so especially with <hi>those that are
on high,</hi> who by reason of their <hi>greatness,</hi>
are out of the <hi>lists of reprehension;</hi> all that are
about them, being compelled to approve
of <hi>whatever they do,</hi> be it well or ill. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all which <hi>faults,</hi> the foulest they are
incident unto, is, <hi>A treacherous turning against
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99202:51"/>
their Prince,</hi> who is the Author of their
<hi>Dignity,</hi> and <hi>Power:</hi> A crime marked out
with the <hi>blackest note of an ungrateful and
faithless Soul;</hi> and a most just subject of the
<hi>Princes</hi> hate and indignation. All men that
are in <hi>Authority</hi> ought to flie the very <hi>shadow
of this crime,</hi> and to the end of taking all
ground of <hi>suspicion</hi> from the <hi>Prince,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
those <hi>honors</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> that are oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

               <p>
                  <hi>Paterculus</hi> esteems <hi>Sejanus</hi> to have been
one of the wisest <hi>Courtiers</hi> that ever was;
and truly it is likely, That <hi>he</hi> that flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so long in the <hi>favor</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> so subtil,
and diffident, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> was, did comport
himself with great <hi>modesty</hi> and <hi>wariness.
He was</hi> (saith our Author) <hi>in appearance
given to ease, assuming nothing to himself, and
by that means obtaining all things; Crouching
still willingly beneath the opinion of other men,
and striving to come behinde them in repute;
His countenance and his life, was calm and quiet,
although his minde was restless, and ever a wake;</hi>
yet <hi>ambition</hi> at last transported this <hi>provident</hi>
and <hi>wary man</hi> so far, as to aspire to the
Empire. To which end, <hi>Drusus</hi> being dead,
he married <hi>Livia</hi> his Widow, that so being
linked into the House of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> he
might more easily compass his <hi>desire:</hi> And
although he perceived out of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his
tergiversations, when he demanded his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99202:51"/>
consent in the case, that it had drawn a
<hi>suspicion</hi> upon him; yet did he not change
his minde; but what he had failed of this
way, he sought to compass another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He knew that</hi> Tiberius <hi>was grown weary
of the</hi> City, <hi>whereupon he presently spurs
him on, and perswades him to retire to</hi>
Caprea; <hi>read</hi> Tacitus, <hi>Annal. 4. who says,</hi>
That lest he should either infringe his Power, or
weaken his Authority, by debarring the multitude
from the Court, or minister matter of slander,
and suspicion by entertaining them, he took this
course: He perswaded <hi>Tiberius</hi> to go live in
some pleasant place, far from <hi>Rome;</hi> foreseeing
many conveniencies in it. First, There could be
no access to the Prince, but through him; then,
That the disposal of all Letters would be in his
hands, since the Soldiers, by whom they were to
be conveyed, would be at his devotion; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That <hi>Caesar</hi> now growing old, and waxing
effeminate with the privacy of the place, would
easily transfer the burthen of Affairs, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
upon him. <hi>And truly, his hopes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him not, for in a short time, under</hi>
pretence <hi>of easing</hi> Tiberius <hi>his age, he drew
all the power of the</hi> Empire <hi>into his own
hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet at last, the event showed, That this
way of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> was both <hi>perilous</hi> and <hi>tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi>
to mention which more accurately,
seems worth my labor here, to the end,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99202:52"/>
That both <hi>Courtiers</hi> may be more <hi>wary</hi> in
governing their <hi>Fortune,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> more
<hi>cautious</hi> in exalting their <hi>Mini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns. Tiberius</hi>
did either love or suffer patiently <hi>Sejanus,</hi>
as long as he found <hi>his help useful</hi> to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and her <hi>Children, Nero,</hi>
and <hi>Drusus;</hi> to which kinde of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Sejanus</hi> shewed himself very ready,
knowing, That thereby he should not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
win the <hi>favor</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> but also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
his <hi>own power</hi> and <hi>hopes;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none left of <hi>Caesars</hi> house now but <hi>two
youths,</hi> whose tender age, if they should
come to the <hi>Government,</hi> must needs leave
the <hi>Authority,</hi> and ordering of <hi>Affairs,</hi> to
him; until he saw his opportunity of usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Empire</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>But mark how <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>blinde</hi> ambition
makes us; He did not see, that the nearer
he came to the <hi>top,</hi> the more he became
<hi>suspected</hi> of this jealous <hi>Prince;</hi> who now
sought all means of <hi>lessening,</hi> rather then
<hi>advancing him;</hi> that strove as much on the
other side to <hi>climb still on;</hi> For though he
wanted nothing, but the name of <hi>Emperor</hi>
(which some did not stick to give him)
and the <hi>Tribunes power</hi> (which the <hi>Emperors</hi>
never intrusted to any) yet was he not
content, but daily endeavoured to <hi>augment
his Authority.</hi> By which course, as he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
himself <hi>venerable</hi> to all others, so he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99202:52"/>
made himself <hi>formidable</hi> to <hi>Tiberius;</hi> For
when he saw that <hi>Sejanus</hi> had not onely
won the <hi>Pretorian Guards,</hi> but also very
many of the <hi>Senators,</hi> and principal <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> by either <hi>benefits,</hi> or <hi>hopes,</hi> or
<hi>fears,</hi> unto himself; and likewise, That his
<hi>secrecies</hi> were by his own <hi>servants</hi> told unto
<hi>Sejanus,</hi> and not <hi>Sejanus</hi> his to him again;
he determined his <hi>destruction,</hi> as one that
was become his <hi>rival:</hi> But before he went
about it, he thought fit to <hi>sound the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of those about him,</hi> to the end, That he
might know how to <hi>chuse out some</hi> that
would like of his <hi>design.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lest that <hi>Sejanus</hi> should smell out any
change in <hi>Caesars</hi> affection towards him, he
makes him <hi>Consul,</hi> and calls him both <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
and <hi>absent</hi> in his <hi>Letters</hi> to the <hi>Senate,</hi>
and the <hi>People,</hi> His <hi>friend</hi> and <hi>companion</hi> of
his <hi>labors.</hi> Lastly, he faigns himself <hi>sick,</hi> to
discover thereby, the affections both of
<hi>Sejanus,</hi> and several others. Sometimes he
writes to the <hi>Senate</hi> of his recovering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and that he would shortly come to
Town; sometimes praising, sometimes
blaming <hi>Sejanus;</hi> sometimes receiving those
that came recommended by him, and at
other times refusing others; that thus he
might keep him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>suspended between <hi>hope</hi>
and <hi>fear,</hi> who, whether trusting to his <hi>favor</hi>
with the <hi>Prince,</hi> or for fear of losing of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99202:53"/>
his <hi>hopes,</hi> resolved to attempt nothing by
<hi>force;</hi> hoping, that the disgusts of the
<hi>Prince,</hi> if there were any, would wear out
with time. In this interim, <hi>others</hi> who had
hitherto fawned upon <hi>Sejanus</hi> his <hi>fortune,</hi>
not upon <hi>himself,</hi> seeing <hi>Tiberius</hi> stagger,
began to carry themselves more <hi>warily,</hi> and
the <hi>devotion</hi> of many towards <hi>Sejanus,</hi> grew
cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> having discovered long ago the
<hi>pride</hi> and <hi>insolency</hi> of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> and fearing
withal, lest provoked by contempt, he
should run some <hi>desperate course,</hi> caused it
to be given out, That he intended to confer
the <hi>Tribunical Power</hi> upon <hi>Sejanus;</hi> and
presently after, Commands him to be laid
in <hi>prison,</hi> writing Letters, to that end to the
<hi>Senate,</hi> which were carried by <hi>Macro,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Guards: Who coming to <hi>Rome,</hi>
first communicated the <hi>Princes</hi> pleasure to
<hi>Memmius Regulus,</hi> then Consul (for the
other Consul was more addicted to <hi>Sejanus</hi>)
and then to <hi>Graecinus Laco,</hi> Captain of the
Watch, it being not yet break of day.
Thence going to the <hi>Senate-house,</hi> he met
<hi>Sejanus,</hi> who startled to see him, demanded
if he had brought him any Letters from
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> he whispered in his ear, That he
should anone be saluted <hi>Tribune;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
he entring the <hi>Senate-house,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an inward joy, <hi>Macro</hi> commanded the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99202:53"/>
                  <hi>Pretorian Guards</hi> to go home, showing them
to that end, a Warrant from the <hi>Emperor,</hi>
in which also, he promised them a <hi>Largess.</hi>
The <hi>Pretorian Soldiers</hi> being departed, and
<hi>Laco</hi>'s Company placed there in their
room, <hi>Macro</hi> enters the <hi>Senate,</hi> and delivers
his Letters; immediately going forth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
expecting the reading of them, to bid
<hi>Laco</hi> stand well upon his Guard, lest <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus</hi>
raising a tumult in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Senate,</hi> should
break away; and went thence himself to
the <hi>Pretorian Guards</hi> to hinder them, lest
they should attempt any thing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Letters</hi> that were then a reading,
were spun out into a great length, to the
end, That <hi>Macro</hi> might have time enough
to order his business; and truly they were
interwoven with a wonderful <hi>contrivance.</hi>
In the beginning there was no mention of
<hi>business,</hi> nor any thing concerning <hi>Sejanus;</hi>
a <hi>little after</hi> he was touched upon, as they
say, with a <hi>gentle hand;</hi> then some other
things interlaced, there followed a <hi>more
open,</hi> but that also a <hi>slight accusation</hi> against
him: At last, after sundry excursions about
the <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> two of
<hi>Sejanus</hi> his <hi>favorites</hi> were named, and the
<hi>Senate</hi> commanded to <hi>proceed against them;</hi>
and withal, that <hi>Sejanus</hi> himself should be
<hi>secured.</hi> All mention of his <hi>death</hi> being
purposely left out, to the end, That <hi>hope</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:99202:54"/>
might be left to the accused, of clearing
himself of those <hi>crimes,</hi> and those but <hi>light
ones,</hi> that were there objected against him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Letters</hi> being read, many that had
<hi>waited</hi> upon him into the <hi>Senate,</hi> seeing
things of another <hi>nature</hi> in hand, then
making <hi>Sejanus Tribune,</hi> rose up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
him in, lest he should escape; which
it is believed, that he would at least have
<hi>attempted to do,</hi> if in the beginning, the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi>
Letters had thundered any thing
sharply <hi>against him.</hi> But he then despising
those <hi>slight touches,</hi> sate still in his place;
and being called upon, either two or three
times, by the Consul <hi>Memmius</hi> to rise up,
with much ado he obeyed at last, as being
accustomed <hi>to give, and not receive commands.</hi>
When he was risen, <hi>Laco</hi> followed him
close at the heels, and after him came <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus,</hi>
accompanied with other <hi>Senators,</hi>
who led him from the <hi>Senate</hi> to the <hi>prison;</hi>
and thence, soon after, to <hi>execution</hi> at the
<hi>Scalae Gemoniae,</hi> where he was put to death.</p>
               <p>Behold here the ruine of a great <hi>Courtier,</hi>
and a <hi>Favorite,</hi> who for <hi>craft</hi> and <hi>power</hi> had
scarce ever his equal. The contrivance of
whose fall, though it may seem due to <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
his <hi>Prudence,</hi> yet it is rather to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to <hi>his own greatness</hi> and <hi>prosperity,</hi>
which ruined it self with <hi>its own weight,</hi> so
evidently, That all those <hi>sleights</hi> and <hi>strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:99202:54"/>
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> were not very needful;
as may be gathered out of the example
of <hi>Perennius,</hi> who aspiring to the same
<hi>height</hi> that <hi>Sejanus</hi> did, and by the same
<hi>arts,</hi> was subverted by <hi>Commodus,</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi>
of a judgement far inferior to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> It
may well be, that many will not be moved
with these <hi>examples,</hi> because they will seem
to be <hi>wiser then others,</hi> and to know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then <hi>these did,</hi> whose <hi>misfortunes</hi>
are here recounted. I will not move them
to <hi>passion,</hi> with telling them what I think;
although truly, I will not deny, but in those
latter ages, there have been some, whose
<hi>projects</hi> succeeded less unhappily, as <hi>Boylas,</hi>
whose story we read in the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi>
who being caught in a <hi>conspiracy</hi>
against <hi>Constantinus Monomachus,</hi> then <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
did not undergo so heavy a punishment;
as for such <hi>crimes,</hi> are wont to be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>licted,
the reason being, because he had the <hi>luck</hi>
to transgress against a <hi>milde</hi> and <hi>gentle
Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will not be amiss to recite the <hi>story</hi>
briefly here, to the end, you may see how
the <hi>secretest Counsels,</hi> and undiscoverably by
the eyes of man, are oftentimes <hi>discovered
by the divine Providence,</hi> after an <hi>unlookt for
maner;</hi> not being able to escape punishment,
by whatsoever <hi>Caution</hi> they are managed.
No mortal man would have believed, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99202:55"/>
this <hi>Boylas</hi> should have any <hi>inclination to,</hi> or
could have any <hi>ground for,</hi> so great a <hi>villany.</hi>
The greatness of the <hi>favors,</hi> which were
<hi>heaped upon him,</hi> had possessed the good
<hi>Prince</hi> with a great <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>opinion</hi> of his
<hi>singular fidelity,</hi> who seemed also by nature
unapt for <hi>great undertakings:</hi> He was not
onely of <hi>very mean birth,</hi> but also <hi>stammered</hi>
so much, as he could hardly be understood;
which <hi>stuttering,</hi> since he saw it pleasing to
the <hi>Emperor,</hi> he did afterwards <hi>affect</hi> on
purpose: With this <hi>assentation</hi> and <hi>flattery,</hi>
he so insinuated himself into the <hi>Princes</hi>
familiarity, That the <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet</hi>
of <hi>Constantine,</hi> were always opened
unto him: At last being inriched by the
<hi>Prince,</hi> he was chosen into the number of
the <hi>Senators,</hi> and begins to cast his thoughts
<hi>higher;</hi> wherein he went so far, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the murther of the <hi>Prince,</hi> to
make his own way to the <hi>Scepter.</hi> This
design he first opened to those he knew
surely hated the <hi>Emperor,</hi> promising moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to such as approved it, and offered
him their assistance; and <hi>praising greatly</hi>
those that <hi>disliked it,</hi> and refused it out of
their <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>loyalty</hi> towards the <hi>Prince;</hi>
as whose <hi>spie,</hi> he would seem to propound
<hi>such things,</hi> to discover the <hi>inclinations of his
subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which means he was undescryed by
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99202:55"/>
all, but such, whose <hi>fellowship in the Treason,</hi>
make him <hi>secure of them;</hi> and had at last,
effected that <hi>abominable act,</hi> if at the very
time, when he had the <hi>Weapon in his hand,</hi>
which he had prepared for the <hi>Emperors</hi>
Throat; one of the <hi>Conspirators,</hi> touched
with a sudden remorse of Conscience, had
not seasonably <hi>disclosed,</hi> and discreetly <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it.</hi> The <hi>Emperor</hi> took the injury so
patiently, That having condemned some of
the <hi>Conspirators</hi> to die, he was satisfied in
inflicting <hi>banishment</hi> onely, on the <hi>Author of
the Treason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were too long to recount all those
here, who having undertaken such <hi>Treasons,</hi>
were caught in them, or else, though <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi>
were falsly believed to be guilty of
some such <hi>design,</hi> and made shipwrack in
<hi>Court.</hi> But contenting our selves with what
we have already said, this onely is to be
added, That all <hi>Pride,</hi> whether through
<hi>Ambition, Bragging, Reproaches, Detraction,
Ostentation,</hi> or other pompous maner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
it displease the <hi>Prince,</hi> is the <hi>high rode

               <p>To treat with the <hi>Prince over familiarly,</hi>
or to seem to make one self the <hi>sole Arbiter</hi>
of his <hi>principal cares,</hi> savors of <hi>Pride,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it may proceed onely out of <hi>Vanity</hi>
and <hi>Covetousness;</hi> as it appeareth in the
example of <hi>Zotirus,</hi> once the <hi>favorite</hi> of
<hi>Heliogabalus;</hi> and also of <hi>Turinus,</hi> who
scarce worse then <hi>Zotirus,</hi> yet more unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
was commanded to be stifled to death
with smoke, by <hi>Alexander</hi> the son of <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea;</hi>
the Executioner crying out, <hi>Let him
perish with smoke, who sold smoke.</hi> He was
wont to brag, That the <hi>Prince</hi> was govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his <hi>advices;</hi> and so by intruding upon
the <hi>Princes</hi> retirements, and with imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<hi>senceless whispers in publique,</hi> pretending
to <hi>favor,</hi> was sought unto by very many;
and gathered together great <hi>riches,</hi> through
the <hi>bribes,</hi> and <hi>presents</hi> of those, to whom
all his <hi>interest</hi> in the <hi>Prince,</hi> could not avail
a <hi>straw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Arrogance</hi> of <hi>Plancianus</hi> is also wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of memory, which being accompanied
with great <hi>vanity,</hi> broke out at last into
open <hi>perfidy:</hi> His arrogance was such, That
he did not stick to contend with <hi>Bassianus,</hi>
the <hi>Emperors</hi> Son; who was Author both
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99202:57"/>
of his <hi>Dignity,</hi> and <hi>Fortune;</hi> and he was
withal so <hi>vain,</hi> that as he passed through
the <hi>City,</hi> he would not onely <hi>interdict</hi> all
access unto him, but also would not suffer
them to <hi>behold him;</hi> his Ushers going before
still to <hi>cleer the streets,</hi> of all that they could
see. Becoming a <hi>Traytor</hi> at last against his
<hi>Prince,</hi> and convicted of his <hi>Treason,</hi> he was
Beheaded. In <hi>France,</hi> during the time of
<hi>Philip le Bell, Enguerrandus Marigny,</hi> daring
to contest personally with <hi>Charls de Valoy,</hi>
what misery he did pull upon himself, and
his friends, may be observed in the <hi>French
Histories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Above all things, we must take heed,
That we give not our selves in <hi>Court,</hi> to
sowing of <hi>strife</hi> between <hi>Princes,</hi> and great
men; for they becoming friends, do for
the most part <hi>sacrifice</hi> such unto their <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi>
of which, though the stories of all
Nations are full, yet the <hi>Bavarian History</hi>
furnishes us with one example very memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
of <hi>Otho Crondoferus,</hi> who flourishing
with <hi>Rodulphus</hi> the <hi>Palatine</hi> in singular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
was the Author of <hi>great emnities</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this <hi>Prince</hi> and his <hi>Mother,</hi> for a time;
but the <hi>Mother</hi> afterwards reconciling her
self unto her son, <hi>Crondoferus</hi> had his Eyes
and Tongue pull'd out.</p>

               <head type="sub">How we must, not onely take care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Princes Favor, but also
that of those in Power about him.</head>
               <p>IT is not enough, that the <hi>Princes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
be not <hi>averse</hi> unto us, but we must
also keep our selves <hi>aright</hi> with those that
are in <hi>favor with them. Germanicus</hi> at his
death, gave that advice to <hi>Agrippina</hi> his
Wife, of which <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Annal. 2. speaks
thus. <hi>Then turning to his Wife, he intreated her
by his memory, and for their Children sake,
which were common to them both, That she
would pull down her stomach, and submit her
great heart to the rage of Fortune; lest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the City, she should with emulation
of her greatness, stir up against her, persons more
powerful then her self; Agrippina</hi>'s neglect of
this <hi>document,</hi> ruined her and her children.
I told you before, how much <hi>Eumenes</hi> his
favor was diminished with <hi>Alexander;</hi> after
that, railing against <hi>Hephaestion,</hi> he carried
himself irreverently towards the <hi>Prince;</hi>
and discovered his <hi>spleen</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> to him
that he accused.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when we see any one in the
<hi>Princes</hi> favor, we must carefully weigh his
<hi>Authority,</hi> and compare it, as it were, in a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99202:58"/>
                  <hi>ballance</hi> against our own; that we may
know certainly which weighs down the
other: And in the tryal of this, we are not
so much to observe <hi>outward appearances,</hi> as
the circumstances of <hi>inward causes. Craterus</hi>
and <hi>Hephaestion,</hi> for a time did flourish both
of them, in <hi>great</hi> and <hi>equal favor</hi> with <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi>
until <hi>Alexander</hi> himself determined
the business, in calling one of them, The
<hi>Kings</hi> friend, and the other, <hi>Alexanders</hi>
friend.</p>
               <p>Out of which decision, <hi>Craterus</hi> might
have made this judgement, That since <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
for the most part, are more in love with
their <hi>own wills,</hi> then their <hi>Authority;</hi> they
also are held <hi>more dear</hi> unto them, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adore and worship <hi>Alexander,</hi> that is
their <hi>Person,</hi> then their <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Kingly
Dignity:</hi> And though that afterward upon
a strife that arose between <hi>him</hi> and <hi>Hephaesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
when all the Court was divided into
<hi>factions, Alexander</hi> seemed to incline to
neither side; but chiding them both heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
threatned punishment, if ever they
should <hi>harp upon that string again;</hi> yet his
maner of dealing with them, shewed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his <hi>singular Prudence,</hi> to be imitated by
all <hi>Princes,</hi> then his <hi>equal affection</hi> to them
both. He apprehended, that this discord
might produce <hi>great tumults,</hi> and <hi>mischief;</hi>
For he knew both <hi>Craterus</hi> his great interest
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99202:58"/>
in the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and how much <hi>Hephae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>
was envied for his favor to him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to diminish <hi>Hephaestions</hi> envy, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
him publikely; and to avoid giving
offence to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he reproved
<hi>Craterus</hi> in private.</p>
               <p>Amongst those that in this tryal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen
of the <hi>Princes</hi> favor, between <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
and <hi>others,</hi> were out of <hi>negligence</hi>
and <hi>discretion,</hi> most grosly mistaken: <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Primus</hi> ought to have the first place,
who daring to contend with <hi>Mutianus,</hi>
learnt at last, That he had better have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
with <hi>Vespasian</hi> himself. And in this
maner, you will finde it is a thing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
by the <hi>examples</hi> of all Courts, <hi>To
vindicate more sharply an injury against the
Favorites, then against the Prince himself. Dio</hi>
tells us the reason of it, when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
how the same thing happened to
<hi>Sejanus,</hi> thus, <hi>As those whom vertue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness
of their own deserts, hath lifted up to
dignities, do not much stick upon the vain Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and outward Circumstances of Honor:
So on the contrary side, those who seek to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>limb
by Ambition, Pride, and Vice, thereby to hide
their unworthiness, and meanness, do presently
take ill, and understand as a contempt, the least
neglect of Ceremony, and respect towards them.</hi>
Insomuch, that it is harder to preserve the
<hi>friendship</hi> of these men, then of the <hi>Prince</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:99202:59"/>
himself, for he thinks it a <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
act to forgive <hi>injuries:</hi> When these, lest

Treachery in betraying the Princes

               <p>NEither truly hath it been <hi>destruction</hi> to
<hi>great ones</hi> onely, to have carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>insolently</hi> and <hi>amiss,</hi> but also to men of
the <hi>lower stage. John</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> loved
<hi>Alvarez de Luna</hi> so much, that he trusted
him with all his <hi>Affairs,</hi> and even his <hi>Kingly
power</hi> it self, notwithstanding the repining
of all his <hi>Nobles.</hi> But when he by reason of
his prosperous Fortune, fell into that <hi>pride</hi>
and <hi>presumption,</hi> That he caused a <hi>Nobleman,</hi>
who in the <hi>Kings name</hi> admonished him of
his <hi>duty,</hi> to be <hi>precipitated</hi> and <hi>murthered;</hi> he
was by the <hi>Kings</hi> command beheaded. It is
also an ordinary cause of <hi>shipwrack</hi> in <hi>Court,</hi>
when any one hath rendred, either himself,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99202:59"/>
or the <hi>Prince,</hi> hateful to the <hi>Peers,</hi> or <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
For, either the <hi>Prince</hi> is fain of his own
accord, to cast such a one off, to rid himself
of <hi>envy,</hi> or else others never leave, till they
have <hi>overthrown him.</hi> During the Reign of
<hi>Commodus, Cleander</hi> once armed the <hi>Pretori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Guards</hi> against the <hi>Roman</hi> people; which
was a ground of so great tumults in <hi>Rome,</hi>
that unless the <hi>Emperor</hi> had sacrificed <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
to the peoples fury, he himself could
not have been <hi>secure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same <hi>Commodus,</hi> had rendred himself
odious to all men, by his affection to one
<hi>Anterus;</hi> from which envy, that they might
free their <hi>Master,</hi> some of <hi>Commodus</hi> his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
being very desirous, slew this <hi>Anterus</hi>
as he was coming from <hi>Court. Eutropius</hi>
who had been long dear to <hi>Arcadius,</hi> the
<hi>Emperor;</hi> since, he was believed to be the
Author of the <hi>Sedition</hi> raised by <hi>Tribigildus,</hi>
was given up as a price of the <hi>Peace,</hi> by the
<hi>Prince,</hi> to the <hi>Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongst the evils that subvert Courtiers,
there are <hi>two</hi> remaining yet, as very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
so very frequent; <hi>A betraying of the
Prince's secrets,</hi> and <hi>Conspiracy with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
Crimes, for the most part, arising out
of <hi>perfidy,</hi> but many times also out of <hi>levity,</hi>
and <hi>indiscretion</hi> onely. And forasmuch as
concerns the <hi>secrets of Princes,</hi> I think they
do very well, <hi>who pry not into them;</hi> and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99202:60"/>
who, if their <hi>office exact it not at their hands,</hi>
avoid the <hi>bare knowledge</hi> of them: For if
you be the <hi>onely person,</hi> to whom they are
imparted, and <hi>Fame</hi> (which often makes
<hi>wity conjectures</hi>) chance to scatter any thing
like unto them, you cannot avoid the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
that the <hi>secret</hi> came out by you: And
although the <hi>Prince</hi> perhaps hath imparted
it to some <hi>one else,</hi> yet it may fall out so,
that he hath forgot; or else, that he is more
confident of the <hi>other mans silence,</hi> and so
the foil remain upon you still.</p>
               <p>Not without cause, did <hi>Philippides</hi> the
<hi>Comique Poet,</hi> when he was asked by King
<hi>Lysimachus</hi> (to whom he was very dear) of
what things he did chiefly desire to be
made partaker by his <hi>Prince,</hi> answer, That
he would refuse nothing that came from the
<hi>Prince,</hi> his <hi>secrets</hi> onely excepted; from
which he desired to be excused. Let us
from the example of this man, as much as
we can, and esteem it safer to be ignorant
of <hi>secrets,</hi> so difficult and dangerous to be
kept, then to know them. <hi>Hiero,</hi> Tyrant
of <hi>Syracusa,</hi> was wont to say, That those
who discover <hi>Princes</hi> secrets, do wrong both
<hi>to themselves,</hi> and <hi>to those they impart them
unto,</hi> by exposing them also together with
themselves, to the hatred of the <hi>Prince.</hi>

               <p>When <hi>Jovius</hi> had read these Letters to

or lastly, will by open force <hi>compel the
Prince to remove him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the first kinde of these three; as
there are <hi>divers ways,</hi> so the <hi>ends are divers.</hi>
For some are with <hi>shows of honor,</hi> or with
the desire of <hi>living amongst their friends,</hi>
willingly perswaded to <hi>depart the Court.</hi>
Which course, during the Reign of <hi>Manuel
Comnenus, Styppiota</hi> craftily used, to remove
out of his way <hi>Hagiotheodorita</hi> that stood
in his light: For there arising a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
between <hi>Michael Paedagogus,</hi> and
<hi>Joseph Balsamon, Styppiota</hi> perswaded the
Emperor, That if <hi>Hagiotheodorita</hi> were made
Governor of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> it would put an
end to the contention of these <hi>great ones.
Hagiotheodorita</hi> out of desire of assisting his
<hi>Kinsman,</hi> undertakes the <hi>imployment;</hi> not
dreaming that <hi>Styppiota</hi> having got his <hi>rival</hi>
out of the way, would by this means come
to the <hi>sole management</hi> of <hi>Affairs,</hi> as indeed
it fell out.</p>
               <p>Some men also <hi>tired out</hi> with the <hi>brawls</hi>
and <hi>strifes</hi> of their <hi>Enemies</hi> in <hi>Court,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for their <hi>own quiet,</hi> do easily imbrace
any <hi>plausible imployment</hi> for a <hi>pretence</hi> of their
<hi>departure,</hi> As <hi>Agrippa</hi> did, who, <hi>Velleius</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
went into <hi>Asia,</hi> under the colour of a

                  <hi>great imployment,</hi> onely to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from <hi>Court,</hi> where he had <hi>private grudges</hi>
and <hi>heart-burnings</hi> against <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as the
report goes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius,</hi> whilst <hi>Cajus Caesar</hi> lived, retired
to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> upon pretence of following his

be any <hi>man great</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> in any of the
<hi>Provinces abroad,</hi> and have emulators that
seek to <hi>eclipse him;</hi> they must labor to call
him thence to <hi>Court,</hi> as necessary to the

               </p>
               <p>This art used <hi>Apelles</hi> in <hi>Polybius,</hi> when he
stript <hi>Taurion</hi> of the Government of <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesus.</hi>
So <hi>Darius</hi> by the advice of <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byzus,</hi>
recalled <hi>Hyesteus</hi> out of <hi>Ionia;</hi> not,
that he had any need of his <hi>presence,</hi> as he
pretended, but to <hi>weaken his Authority.</hi> If
these <hi>Courtiers</hi> would rest contented with
removing others <hi>out of their way,</hi> for their
<hi>own advancement,</hi> and proceed no further,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99202:64"/>
in comparison of many <hi>worse,</hi> these <hi>arts</hi> and
<hi>practises</hi> would be something tolerable; but
the most of them rest not here: In the
Reign of <hi>Constantius, Sylvanus,</hi> General of
the Foot (as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> tells us)
by <hi>Arbetio</hi> his procurement, was sent into
<hi>France,</hi> to chastise the <hi>Barbarians</hi> for the
injuries they offered to the <hi>Gauls;</hi> whether
he being once come, and growing into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
with the <hi>Nation,</hi> and also rich; the envy
of <hi>Arbetio</hi> wrought at last his <hi>utter destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
with the <hi>Emperor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Almost the same fortune under this very
<hi>Emperor</hi> had <hi>Vrsicinus,</hi> the General of the
Horse: <hi>Eusebius,</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> had together
with some other <hi>Courtiers,</hi> conspired his
ruine; and by these mens means, to the
end he might be far enough from <hi>Court,</hi> he
was sent upon some expedition to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of <hi>Persia;</hi> where having staid ten
years, <hi>Sabinianus</hi> was sent to succeed him,
neither in <hi>judgement</hi> nor <hi>experience,</hi> equal to
the charge: Whereupon, presently a rumor
being spred, That the <hi>Persians</hi> were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for a <hi>War,</hi> he was commanded to stay
there still, though the <hi>power</hi> was already
given to another. <hi>Eusebius</hi> contriving it
so on purpose, to the end, That whatsoever
<hi>good success</hi> hapned against the <hi>Persians,</hi>
might be attributed to <hi>Sabinianus;</hi> and
what ever <hi>fell out amiss,</hi> might be imputed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99202:64"/>
to <hi>Vrsicinus,</hi> as the event witnessed; for
<hi>Vrsicinus</hi> cast down for another mans faults,
retired and past the rest of his life in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
The Reign of this <hi>Emperor</hi> doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
us yet with another example; For
<hi>Ruffinus,</hi> the Uncle of <hi>Gallus,</hi> Captain of the
Guard, was sent to appease a <hi>mutiny</hi> of the
Soldiers, out of no other intention, but
that he might <hi>perish in the rage of the tumult:</hi>
As <hi>Clytus</hi> did complain, That he was sent
by <hi>Alexander</hi> against the <hi>Sogdians,</hi> to no
other end.</p>

<hi>Calumnies</hi> that are used to render us <hi>hated</hi>

two things are to be observed; the first is,
<hi>Whether it be sufficient to deprive him of the

probable?</hi> Of the first, We must make our
judgement out of the <hi>present state of things,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:99202:65"/>
out of the <hi>humor and inclination of the Prince,</hi>
and out of the <hi>nature of the Calumny intended.</hi>
No kinde of <hi>slander</hi> doth subvert more <hi>great
men,</hi> then that which accuses us of conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy

               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Calumnies</hi> are rendred likely to be
true, not onely by the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of
those that are <hi>accused,</hi> and of their <hi>servants,

               </p>
               <p>There are some men that will put Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
into our heads, to the end, That if we
imbrace them, they may make these very
things, a subject of <hi>Calumny</hi> against us, and
accuse us to the <hi>Prince</hi> of some <hi>wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi>
There was a certain <hi>Magician,</hi>
called <hi>Santabarinus</hi> very much beloved by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99202:65"/>
                  <hi>Basilius,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but as
much hated by <hi>Leo,</hi> the Emperors Son;
who this <hi>Magician</hi> desiring to <hi>overthrow,</hi> did
so besiege him with <hi>counterfeited duties,</hi> and
<hi>feigned respects,</hi> that at last winning upon
him, he grew into credit with the yong
<hi>Prince:</hi> Then having got an <hi>authority</hi> and
<hi>interest</hi> in him, he takes his time, and warns
<hi>Leo,</hi> with great art and solicitude, That
whensoever he went a Hunting with his
<hi>Father,</hi> he should carry a <hi>Poignard</hi> under his
Garments, to defend himself withal: He
obeying this advice, the <hi>Magician</hi> goes to
his <hi>Father,</hi> informing him, That his <hi>Son</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to <hi>murther him,</hi> and for a testimony,
told him, That he always carried a <hi>Dagger</hi>
hidden about him, waiting for an occasion
of performing it. In short, the business
came to that pass, the yong <hi>Prince</hi> was
searched, and the <hi>Poignard</hi> found, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was cast into prison; and though
he were protected by the joynt intercession
of all the <hi>Court,</hi> yet he hardly escaped with
his life.</p>
               <p>Whilst <hi>Valentinian</hi> was Emperor, <hi>Aetius</hi>
accused Earl <hi>Boniface,</hi> who was very dear
unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and Governor of <hi>Africa,</hi>
unto <hi>Placidia,</hi> the Emperors Mother, of
Treachery towards the <hi>Prince,</hi> and of a
design he had of subjecting <hi>Africk</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
perswading her withal, That he should
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99202:66"/>
be <hi>recalled</hi> quickly. At the same time he
warns <hi>Boniface</hi> by his Letters, That he was
accused at <hi>Court,</hi> and for that reason <hi>recalled;</hi>
wherefore he should take heed how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
if he loved his own safety. <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
giving credit unto him, obeyed him so
far, That (resolving to oppose those that
would come to reduce him) he called in
<hi>Gontarus,</hi> King of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and <hi>Gensericus</hi>
his Son, then reigning in <hi>Spain,</hi> unto his
aid; who upon this occasion, possessed
themselves of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> The <hi>deceipt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards found out, to the end the
truth might appear more plainly, they were
permitted the <hi>tryal</hi> of a <hi>combat,</hi> wherein
<hi>Aetius</hi> being vanquished, was banished the
<hi>Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not unlike unto this was the craft of
<hi>Samona,</hi> beloved by <hi>Leo,</hi> Son to the Emperor
<hi>Basilius</hi> (by reason of his detection of the
Treason of <hi>Basilius,</hi> Kinsman to the Empress
<hi>Zoa</hi>) who resolving to ruine <hi>Andronicus,</hi>
that was General against the <hi>Saracens,</hi>
caused him to be warned by a friend, that
he should take heed of <hi>Hymerius,</hi> who
came to <hi>deprive him of his eyes;</hi> which was
in those days a punishment <hi>usual towards
great persons,</hi> whose power was overgrown,
and become formidable: <hi>Andronicus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
this to be true, which was feigned
by <hi>Samona,</hi> withdraws himself from <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:99202:66"/>
unto a place of strength, which he
seized upon. This fact of his, <hi>Samona</hi> did
not omit to exaggerate unto the <hi>Emperor,</hi>
insomuch, that by his procurement, an
Army was sent against him, which forced
<hi>Andronicus,</hi> driven to despair, to quit the
limits of the Empire, and flie unto the
<hi>Saracens.</hi> A little before, we mentioned
<hi>Arbetio,</hi> and it will be worth observing,
how he added <hi>deceit</hi> upon <hi>deceit:</hi> When he
observed the <hi>Emperor</hi> angry with <hi>Sylvanus,</hi>
and feared, that he should come to <hi>Rome</hi>
to clear himself of the <hi>objected crimes;</hi> he
gives the <hi>Emperor</hi> his Letters, wherein he
called <hi>Sylvanus</hi> to his <hi>presence,</hi> to an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his own, called <hi>Apodenius;</hi> who
arriving in <hi>France,</hi> suppressed the Letters as
he was directed, and tells <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> That
<hi>nothing but destruction hung over him;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>Sylvanus</hi> running into <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as the
onely means of his <hi>preservation,</hi> made good
<hi>Arbetio</hi> his calumnies.</p>
               <p>But we have too long been silent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Sejanus</hi> (to whom being expert in
all these <hi>tricks</hi>) this <hi>artifice</hi> we now treat of
was very <hi>usual.</hi> That he might render <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi>
suspected to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> He inveigled her
friends to <hi>puff up her haughty spirit;</hi> and her
<hi>own kinred were inticed</hi> to feed the <hi>swelling
hopes</hi> of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> with crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
discourses; whilst in the interim, he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99202:67"/>
causes <hi>Claudia Pulchra, Agrippina</hi>'s Cosen
German, to be accused by <hi>Domitius Afer;</hi>
which injury, this <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>passionate Woman,</hi>
complaining of heavily to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> did
thereby exceedingly encrease the <hi>suspicions</hi>
of this jealous <hi>Emperor.</hi> Yet <hi>Sejanus</hi> not
content with this, but seeking the <hi>utter
ruine</hi> of this <hi>unwary,</hi> and <hi>sorrowful Lady,</hi> sent
those unto her, who under a show of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
should warn her, That <hi>Tiberius</hi> meant
to poyson her, and that she should beware
of his <hi>Feasts;</hi> whereupon she over <hi>credulous,</hi>
refused to take an Apple out of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his
hand at Table, which grievously incensed
<hi>Caesar</hi> against her. By the same <hi>Sejanus</hi> now,
when Soldiers were set to watch over <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina</hi>
and her <hi>Children,</hi> were men suborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to advise her, <hi>to flie to the German Army,</hi>
or to <hi>run to the Image of</hi> Augustus <hi>for sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;</hi>
and there to invoke the help of the
<hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the same <hi>ugly arts,</hi> whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored
to supplant this <hi>Lady,</hi> by making
her suspected of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> he utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
her friend <hi>Titius Sabinus;</hi> which
thing, as it is described by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> you may
read here in his own words, because the
circumstances are very notable, <hi>Annal. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Junius Silanus</hi> and <hi>Silius Nerva,</hi> being
Consuls, the year had a foul beginning;
for <hi>Titius Sabinus</hi> an honorable Gentleman
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99202:67"/>
or <hi>Rome,</hi> was cast into prison onely for
his friendship to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> which was
such, That he never omitted any occasion
of honoring or serving his Wife and
Children; Of all <hi>Germanicus</hi> his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
being the onely man which visited
them at their house, and accompanied
them abroad; wherefore as he was much
praised by the good, so was he much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liced
by the bad: Against him, <hi>Latinius
Latiani, Porcius Cato, Petilius Rufus,</hi> and
<hi>Marcus Opsius,</hi> who had sometime been
Consuls, bent their spight, through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of the Consulship, which they could
not obtain, but by <hi>Sejanus</hi> his means, and
<hi>Sejanus</hi> his liberty could not be purchased,
but by some notable piece of villany.
Wherefore they plotted amongst them,
That <hi>Latiani,</hi> who was somewhat a kin to
<hi>Sabinus,</hi> should lay the snare, and that
the rest being privately witnesses to what
past, they might begin their accusation.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Latiani</hi> began at first to cast
speeches out at randome, and to extol <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus</hi>
his constancie, that he did not as
others did, fawn in prosperity, and shrink
from a house in adversity; with other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
mention of <hi>Germani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us</hi> bewayling
<hi>Agrippina</hi>'s estate. And seeing <hi>Sabinus</hi>
(as mens mindes are soft and tender in
calamity) to pour down tears, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99202:68"/>
complaints; <hi>Latiani</hi> began more boldly
to touch <hi>Sejanu</hi>'s Cruelty, Pride, and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not forbearing to reproach <hi>Tiberius;</hi>
These seeming dangerous speeches, and
such as durst not be avouched, made a
strict friendship in shew between them:
So far that <hi>Sabinus</hi> often frequented <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anie</hi>'s
house, and as unto his faithful friend
uttered his greifs unto him. Those I
mentioned before, now began to devise
with <hi>Latiani</hi> how these speeches might be
heard by them all: For the place of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
must be in appearance private, and
if they should stand behinde the door
they did apprehend some noise, or other
accident of suspition might discover them;
wherefore between the Seeling and the
Roof the three Senators (in a place no less
unseemly then the Treachery was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable)
hid themselves, laying their ears
close to the holes and chinks, to listen
what was said.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Latiani</hi> having found
<hi>Sabinus</hi> in the Market place (as if he had
some new matter to tell him, inticeth him
home into his chamber, beginning there to
rip up things past and present in a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance;
and to load him with new
feares. <hi>Sabinus</hi> was not behinde hand
with him, the nature of greifs being such,
that when once we enter into them, we
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99202:68"/>
can hardly make an end. This done, they
began immediately their accusation,
and writ unto <hi>Caesar</hi> the whole contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of their own lewd and shameful
act. The city was never in greater perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
and fear then at that time, every man
estranging himself from his nearest Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and acquaintance; avoiding all mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and conferences as well with their
Freinds, as Strangers; yea they grew jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of mute, and sensless things, Prying
into the Roofs and Walls of their houses.
But <hi>Tiberius</hi> requesting in his Letters that
the Solemnities of the new year might be
Celebrated on the <hi>Calends of January,</hi> falls
at last upon <hi>Sabinus,</hi> charging him that he
had corrupted some of his Freed-men to
attempt something against his person,
and therefore boldly demandeth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
which without delay was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sabinus</hi> being condemned, was drawn
and haled away with his Garments over
his head, so that he being almost Throtled
was heard to cry out: <hi>Is this the beginnings
of the new year? be these the sacrifices slain
in</hi> Sejanus <hi>his honor?</hi> Which way soever
he did cast his Eyes they all fled that he
directed his speech unto; the places of
Assembly and the Streets were empty,
some come runing back and showed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99202:69"/>
again afraid for that they were seen
to be afraid. And what days think you
now were exempt from executions, if
amongst the sacrifices, and the vows, when
the custome was to abstain from profane
speeches, Fetters and Manacles were
mentioned. It is beleeved <hi>Tiberius</hi> could
not be ignorant of the envy he should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
for doing so, but that he did it on
purpose, to the end the new Magistrates
might open the prisons, when they set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
their Temples and their Altars. For
after that he sent Letters of thanks, for
that they had punished an enemy to
the State.</p>

vanities, to give credit to the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
the Magicians ceremonie, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation

of his Ancestors: He inticed him to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness,
to borrow money, making himself a
Companion of his Lusts, and Familiarities, the
better to intangle him and convince with many
evidences. That there might be witnesses enough,
he also debauched such of his Servants as knew
any thing of the matter. Then he desires
access to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and by means of <hi>Flaccus
Vescularius,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> one of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

Tacitus <hi>Annal. 2. will tell you at large, to

                  <hi>Styppiota,</hi> whose deceipt in supplanting
<hi>Hagiotheodorita,</hi> I told you of before, could
not avoid being circumvented himself, as
<hi>Sabinus the Roman</hi> was; the contriver of that
plot was <hi>Camaterus Logotheta,</hi> who being an
enemy to <hi>Styppiota,</hi> accused him before the
<hi>Emperor</hi> as an <hi>impostor,</hi> and one that intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>betray Sicily.</hi> And to the end he might
give some face of truth to his Calumny, he
hides the <hi>Emperor</hi> in his Chamber, and in
his hearing begins on purpose to discourse
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99202:70"/>
of the <hi>affairs of Sicily.</hi> At which time
many things fell from the <hi>heedless Styppiota</hi>
that were very displeasing unto <hi>Caesar;</hi> not
content with this, <hi>Camaterus</hi> causes <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Letters</hi> to be mingled amongst <hi>Styppiota</hi>'s
<hi>Papers,</hi> which being searcht by the <hi>Emperors

and the loss of his eyes.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Story</hi> leades me to speak of another
means of rendring slanders probable, to
wit, by <hi>Counterfeiting Letters; A deceit</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that for the most part breaks out at
last to the prejudice of him that uses it, but
nevertheless is of great power to make deep
impressions of suspition in the <hi>Princes</hi> mind,
and to alienate <hi>his favor:</hi> Which being once
observed <hi>by the accused,</hi> will either induce
him to <hi>withdraw himself willingly</hi> from <hi>busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and the <hi>Court,</hi> least something worse
should follow; or else cast him upon such
attempts and practises, as will <hi>Confirm the
slander.</hi> Which appears by that example
of <hi>Sylvanus</hi> I mentioned before.</p>
               <p>The perfidy of <hi>false witnesses</hi> is no slender
confirmation of <hi>slanders,</hi> and this is cheifly

the nearer these reproaches come to truth,

1. <hi>Whom</hi> Caepio Crispinus <hi>accused to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled</hi>
Tiberius, <hi>which was an inevitable accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
for he having chosen out the greatest
blemishes of</hi> Tiberius <hi>his life, did impose them
the accused; which because they were true, were
believed to have been spoken.</hi> This example
have many <hi>slanderers</hi> followed, reproaching
many <hi>Princes</hi> of their vices, under pretence
of informing them of <hi>other mens detractions;</hi>
which one would think should be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
reason to perswade them from giving
ear to these <hi>Calumniators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Tiberius <hi>truly, who though he was a</hi>
lover of informations, <hi>yet he hated his own</hi>
reproaches; <hi>and therefore least he should
hear them in the</hi> Senate, <hi>where they were
occasionally brought in by way of</hi> accusing

of the Senate, least he should be compelled to

hear reproachful, but yet true, uttered of himself
in his own hearing.</p>
               <p>This way also do some take <hi>onely to reprove
Princes for their vices;</hi> as they that would
reprove <hi>Nero</hi> for his <hi>Mothers</hi> murther, did
use to inveigh against others for the like <hi>acts</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> as one was
praising another man unreasonably in his

to a friend said, <hi>Without doubt this fellow seeks

he could not openly oppress; loads him
also with <hi>secret promises,</hi> and points him out
the further <hi>Spain,</hi> left void for him by the

in the Army. And afterward, when he had

Neither is this way <hi>traced by Courtiers

they desire to abate or take down any

upon, and invite to his Table, <hi>Libo,</hi>
(whom he secretly suspected and hated)
without change of <hi>countenance</hi> or showing
<hi>anger</hi> in his words, till he saw his time (he
had so concealed his indignation) as <hi>Tacitus</hi>
tells you, Annal. 2. By the same <hi>artifice,</hi> you
saw he <hi>overthrew Sejanus: Domitian</hi> was

Julius Agricola <hi>was ruined with</hi> Domitian.
The cause of his destruction was no Crime nor
Complaint against him, but the Princes envy to
the vertues and glory of the man, stirred up by
the worst kinde of enemies, unseasonable and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous

               <p>But we see that some have used these

the faithful services of <hi>Maecenas,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
when his <hi>daughters lusts</hi> being discovered;

               <p>The same was <hi>Augustus</hi> his end in praising

writes thus; Augustus <hi>when a few years
before he demanded the Tribunicial power in the

speech touch upon many things of his behavior, his
habit, and maner of living; which, as it were,

               </p>
               <p>But few years since, the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> more
then once, have by sedition deprived the
<hi>Turkish Emperors</hi> of their <hi>Ministers of greatest
trust</hi> and <hi>authority:</hi> Out of more ancient
stories, the time of <hi>Arcadius</hi> will furnish us
with some examples; <hi>Ruffinus</hi> was amongst
others, principally beloved by this <hi>Emperor,</hi>
with whom <hi>Stilico</hi> being offended, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
his <hi>destruction,</hi> sent <hi>Gainas</hi> with
his forces, as it were, to assist the <hi>Emperor,</hi>
but indeed to deprive him of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> as
it came to pass: For <hi>Ruffinus</hi> going to
the Army, the Soldiers of <hi>Gainas</hi> upon
the signal given, <hi>ran together,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99202:75"/>
                  <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in, tore him in pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eutropius</hi> being then put in <hi>Ruffinus</hi>
his place; when the chief <hi>Courtiers</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
grew discontented with him, by the
contrivance of the same <hi>Gainas, Tribigildus</hi>
raises a Rebellion, overrunning and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all <hi>Asia,</hi> and denies to accept any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of a peace, till <hi>Eutropius</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<hi>out of the way;</hi> which by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of <hi>Gainas,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> consented
at last unto: Neither was this enough,
for <hi>Gainas</hi> being afterward openly joyned
with <hi>Tribigildus,</hi> to the end he might suffer
himself to be reconciled to <hi>Arcadius</hi> the
Emperor, demanded, That <hi>Aurelius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnius,</hi>
and <hi>John Chrysostome,</hi> then the
chief <hi>Moderators</hi> of the <hi>Emperors</hi> Affairs,
should be given up to him; which being
done, he sent them into banishment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
himself with giving them (before
their departure out of his presence) the
<hi>Edge of his Sword for to handle,</hi> that they
might feel how <hi>sharp it was.</hi>

These diseases as being incorporated

               <p>The <hi>jealousie and envy of Princes,</hi> hath

                     </gap>sly</hi>
and well. <hi>Publius Ventidius</hi> fearing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99202:76"/>
the envy of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> under whom he
served, contented himself to have beaten
the <hi>Parthians</hi> by three Victories into <hi>Media,</hi>
and would not prosecute his <hi>good fortune</hi>
any farther. <hi>Agathias</hi> tells us, that during
the Reign of <hi>Justinian,</hi> the same was done
by <hi>Bellisarius;</hi> least the greatness of his
Victories, and the acclamations of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
should stir up the <hi>hate</hi> of the <hi>Peers,</hi>
and <hi>envy</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> against him.</p>
               <p>Truly such as these do not minde their
own honor, and the profit of the <hi>Prince,</hi>
as they ought to do; but the fault is not so
much in them, as in the <hi>Prince</hi> himself;
And therefore it was, that <hi>Maecenas</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<hi>Augustus, not to impute his ill successes
to his Ministers, nor envy their prosperous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For</hi> (saith he) <hi>many of them that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
Publique affairs, have done it very negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
for fear of envy, choosing rather to hazard
their glory, then their safety.</hi> Yet I do much
more approve their way, who to avoid <hi>envy,</hi>
whatever great and fortunate actions they
did, would needs <hi>ascribe the glory of it to
the Prince,</hi> though <hi>absent. Agrippa, Augustus</hi>
his Son in Law, perswades us to <hi>undertake
great adventures;</hi> but having performed
them to <hi>attribute the glory of it to the Prince,</hi>
as he himself was always wont to do.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Joab</hi> besiedging <hi>Rabatham,</hi> though he
could, refused to take it in, before <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:99202:76"/>
himself came thither. <hi>Craterus</hi> when the
business of <hi>Artacena</hi> was to be determined,
waits for <hi>Alexanders</hi> coming; <hi>Julius Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi>
(as <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes) <hi>never did boastingly
apply his acts to his own glory, but cast all upon
Fortune, as the author and guide of all he did,
who was but her servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This envy and emulation, though they
are diseases incident to the generousest
<hi>Princes</hi> (such as <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> were)
yet they are more <hi>predominant</hi> and <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
in some, then others. <hi>Theodosius,</hi> the
second <hi>Emperor</hi> of that name, committed
the charge of building a Wall at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
from Sea to Sea unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which
work he effecting in <hi>threescore days;</hi> This
great dispatch was so grateful to the <hi>people,</hi>
that they cryed out in the streets, That
<hi>Constantine</hi> built the City, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> had
restored it; which being heard by the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi>
brought so great an <hi>envy</hi> upon <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
that he could not expiate it any other way,
but by putting on a <hi>Religious habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that hath to do with such <hi>Princes,</hi> is
to consider, That he <hi>walks upon ashes, under

he <hi>still examine their inclinations</hi> with great

               <p>HE is deservedly to be remembred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Darlings of Fortune,</hi> whose
Authority and Interest being great with
one <hi>Prince,</hi> continues so with his <hi>Successor.</hi>
It is truly a thing very rare in <hi>Courts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>he that is to succeed,</hi> is for the most part
<hi>suspected by the present Prince;</hi> and therefore,
they who <hi>manage his affairs,</hi> are necessitated
to be adverse unto the <hi>Heir apparent;</hi> from
whence, commonly <hi>deadly emnities arise.</hi>
Besides this also, the succeeding <hi>Prince</hi> hath
for the most part <hi>Servants</hi> known, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared
unto him, by a <hi>long fidelity,</hi> and <hi>many
services;</hi> for whose advancement to dignity
that he may make way, he will ordinarily,
either of his own accord, or by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of those that desire to succeed, lay
aside the Servants of the deceased
<hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet there are some, whom either the

<hi>Prince</hi> dying, they loose nothing thereby,
but his <hi>person. Macro,</hi> that he might obtain
<hi>Caligula</hi> his favor, sets his own wife <hi>Ennia</hi>
upon him, to inveigle him with <hi>love,</hi> and
binde him in a <hi>marriage.</hi> The same man
commanded <hi>Tiberius</hi> to be <hi>smothered</hi> with
clothes, as he was sick and dying, as <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
affirms. <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperor retained
<hi>Arbetio</hi> still, because he thought him useful,
although he hated him for his <hi>pride,</hi> and

               <p>We have hitherto handled onely such

him, is, <hi>A modesty towards the Prince,</hi> such as
becomes a man, <hi>more mindful of his duty,</hi>
then <hi>of his swelling fortune;</hi> let him never
<hi>boast,</hi> nor do any thing <hi>irreverently;</hi> and as
much as possibly he can, let him <hi>avoid envy;</hi>
which hath been so <hi>dreadful to many,</hi> and
those <hi>great men,</hi> That some of them with
pretending a <hi>love of ease,</hi> others <hi>imbracing a

<hi>averse to publique affairs.</hi> Examples in both

and <hi>Galba.</hi> He must take heed, he pass
not over carelesly, either those <hi>treacherous
kinde of praises</hi> we spoke of before, nor the

<hi>Calumniate us,</hi> do say, That either we are
<hi>wanting in some thing that is necessary to serve
the Prince well;</hi> or else, That we <hi>have said,
or done something,</hi> either <hi>really,</hi> or <hi>intentionally,</hi>
to the <hi>prejudice of him, or his service.</hi> As to
the <hi>defects</hi> imputed unto us, we must either
<hi>modestly excuse,</hi> and <hi>justifie our selves,</hi> or else

there being <hi>no body to gainsay;</hi> takes
such footing at last, That oftentimes the
<hi>Prince hates the person accused,</hi> before <hi>he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the crime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He therefore that will <hi>provide for his safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
must make himself at <hi>Court, one friend or

and such as have <hi>access to the Prince's

the store of such <hi>Friends in Court,</hi> is but
very small, where it is the usual custom,

nor give it out, <hi>That he is governed by us;</hi> for
we have told you before, how ill that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with some. <hi>Princes</hi> whatsoever they
do, desire to be thought <hi>to do it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
without <hi>the help and authority of any
others,</hi> especially their <hi>Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Prince</hi> shall lay any <hi>weighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
upon us, we endeavor to have it in
<hi>writing,</hi> and as <hi>clearly interpreted</hi> unto us, as
is possible: We must not omit to represent
unto him, <hi>such difficulties</hi> before we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the business, as we apprehend will <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur</hi>
unto us in the <hi>execution.</hi> If it be a thing
<hi>committed</hi> to us in <hi>secresie,</hi> and <hi>unfit to be
written,</hi> we are to <hi>repeat the Commands</hi> over
and over (yet without absurdity) in the
<hi>Princes</hi> presence, to the end we may better
understand the <hi>intention of him that gives
them,</hi> and also that <hi>he</hi> may not <hi>forget what
orders he gave us.</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:99202:81"/>
We must also show our selves ready for
the <hi>meanest imployments</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> will cast
upon us; for many times a small matter is
the occasion of a <hi>great fortune;</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi>
would have their commands to be weighed
not by the <hi>importance of the affair,</hi> but by
the <hi>greatness and dignity of him the giver;</hi>
being no less incensed at our refusal of
<hi>sleight enterpises,</hi> then our declining of <hi>great
and hazardous undertakings,</hi> when imposed
by him upon us. When we are attending
upon the <hi>Prince,</hi> we ought to watch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
that we be not <hi>surprised nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with sudden commands;</hi> And to that
end, always as much as may be, we ought
to ruminate before hand all things then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,
and to prepare our minde and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
for whatever may <hi>come in agitation.</hi>
We must likewise take heed, that we <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
not the Prince</hi> with <hi>unseasonable</hi> nor
<hi>impertinent discourses,</hi> but onely with what
we both know to be certain, and judge to
be fit for him to hear. When the <hi>Prince</hi>
speaks, we must appear attentive, not as if
we <hi>thought of something else;</hi> not <hi>sad,</hi> not
<hi>musing,</hi> least we should seem either to <hi>sleight,</hi>
or <hi>dislike what he says.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any one <hi>disgusted,</hi> or <hi>injured by the
Prince,</hi> shall come and make his <hi>complaint</hi>
to us, we must let him see we are <hi>sorry for his
misfortune;</hi> perswading him to <hi>patience,</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99202:81"/>
                  <hi>silence,</hi> and encouraging him <hi>to hope well;</hi>
lessening the <hi>injury,</hi> and <hi>excusing the Prince.</hi>
But with such as these, we must deal wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for there are those that <hi>counterfeit wrongs</hi>
and <hi>discontents,</hi> to see if they can draw any
testimony of an <hi>ill will</hi> to the <hi>Prince</hi> out of
us, that thence they may take an occasion
to <hi>undo us:</hi> Others are <hi>injured indeed,</hi> but
yet are <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>imprudent,</hi> not being able
to <hi>conceal</hi> what is out of <hi>friendship</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to them in secret.</p>
               <p>If our condition be such, that we keep
a <hi>train of servants,</hi> we are to take great
care that none of them speak licentiously,
either of the <hi>Prince,</hi> or his <hi>Favorites;</hi> for
many times the <hi>servants</hi> fault is cast upon
the <hi>Master,</hi> from whom his <hi>words</hi> and <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are often thought to <hi>proceed.</hi> Amongst
the principal rules of a <hi>Courtiers Prudence,</hi>
this is one, To <hi>discover</hi> and <hi>smell out betimes,</hi>
the <hi>change</hi> and <hi>diminution of the Princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
towards us,</hi> to the end, that the <hi>knot
of love</hi> between you, may rather be <hi>gently
untied, then cut in sunder.</hi> For so many times
the <hi>cause of our distaste being removed,</hi> or <hi>worn
away,</hi> there is sometimes an easie return
for us unto our former <hi>favor,</hi> especially, if
we seem, either <hi>not to remember,</hi> or <hi>not to
have understood the injury.</hi>

               <head type="sub">How to make a judgement of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
or change of the Princes
affection to us.</head>
               <p>TO the end our <hi>Courtier</hi> may judge of the
<hi>constancy</hi> of the <hi>Prince's favor</hi> towards
him, It is not enough that he know the
<hi>Princes humor,</hi> with the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>power,</hi>
both of his <hi>friends and enemies in Court;</hi> but,
he must principally weigh the <hi>original cause</hi>
of the <hi>Prince's love</hi> towards him: For, if
<hi>that once cease,</hi> or be found more <hi>prevalent in
another,</hi> without doubt, the affection of the
<hi>Prince</hi> will either wholly <hi>cool,</hi> or at least be
<hi>much diminished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet sometimes it is hard to divine what
is the <hi>reason,</hi> that you are so <hi>beloved;</hi> and
truly, it is sometimes onely a <hi>fortunate felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
for which no reason can be given, though
ordinarily the <hi>Princes</hi> love arises, either out
of <hi>similitude of disposition,</hi> out of the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singness
of your humor and maners,</hi> out of your
<hi>services done him,</hi> or from <hi>your vertue;</hi> or last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from your <hi>obsequious plyableness to his will.</hi>
That love which comes from the <hi>similitude,
or takingness of your maners,</hi> although it seem
very <hi>great for a time,</hi> yet it wears out <hi>soonest
of all;</hi> both, because as we have said before
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99202:82"/>
the nature of man changes daily with age,
or with variety of business; and also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is hard to finde two dispositions so
sympathizing together, as that they differ
in nothing; and many times that wherein
they differ, is of more power to divide
them, then all the rest to unite them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Yet I know not <hi>what Star</hi> doth so <hi>tune</hi>
and <hi>temper</hi> some men still to the <hi>Princes</hi>
liking, and disposition, that they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if they would, do any <hi>dissonant or displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thing to him:</hi> And I do confess, That
these men may make the <hi>best harvest,</hi> with a
<hi>Prince</hi> of all others; especially, if they
know skilfully how to choose and use their
times, and how to take in their sails season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
before a storm.</p>

the <hi>Princes</hi> minde; some also, by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting

their lover; and lastly, some more

               <p>
                  <hi>Which arts</hi> Poppaea <hi>practised upon</hi> Nero,
<hi>For</hi> when she saw that he was enamored of her,
becoming proud, if she entertained him a night
or two, it was all she could afford him; saying,
She was a married wife, and could not abandon
her Husband <hi>Otho,</hi> who for his parts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior
exceeded <hi>Nero:</hi> That in using a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave,
acts for his Concubine, had learned nothing
from that servile familiarity, but baseness and
nigardice: <hi>Thus</hi> Tacitus <hi>reports her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi>
Annal. 13. <hi>And soon after,</hi> Annal. 14.
<hi>the same</hi> Poppaea despairing now of marrying
<hi>Nero,</hi> or of seeing him divorced from <hi>Octavia,</hi>
as long as <hi>Agrippina</hi> lived: Sometimes taunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and sometimes merrily, began to reproach
the Prince, calling him a Ward, and subject to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99202:83"/>
others controulment; and said, he was so far
from the Government of the <hi>Empire,</hi> that he
wanted his own liberty. <hi>Some</hi> Princes <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
have by this means held their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
faster, then by the dallyings and blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishments
of pleasure; yet, as I said before,
there is no constancy in this kinde of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be relied upon long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly one would think that <hi>love,</hi> which
you have gained by your services, should
be <hi>stable</hi> and <hi>more firm,</hi> then what comes
from <hi>flattery</hi> or <hi>pleasure,</hi> as arising out of an
<hi>honest cause;</hi> and which being cherished in
you, is apt to stir up others to merit as well
by <hi>vertuous undertakings.</hi> Yet experience
often teaches us, that very <hi>great services</hi> have
in <hi>Courts</hi> been the ruine of those that have
performed them; by reason, that <hi>Princes</hi>
are wont to hate, whom they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite.
They will not be indebted to a <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
and therefore do <hi>fly the sight</hi> of those
that have exceeding <hi>well deserved of them,</hi> as
if they did with their looks reproach them
of ingratitude; which is the reason, why
the condition of such men in <hi>Courts,</hi> is
much to be pittied; for when they have
obliged the <hi>Prince</hi> by any service, they are
ashamed by and by, to <hi>ask a reward,</hi> least
they should seem not to have giyen, but
<hi>sold the benefit</hi> they did him; who in the
mean time, as <hi>Princes</hi> are often <hi>regardless of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99202:84"/>
the service received,</hi> and <hi>slow to reward,</hi> draws
out, day after day, till the <hi>memory of the
benefit wears out</hi> in the mindes of those that
were privy to it; whose silent reproaches
he feared before.</p>
               <p>Which some men observing, have judged
it fit, <hi>to strike the Iron whilst it was hot;</hi> and
when they were designed for any <hi>business,</hi>
to look to their reward, <hi>before they undertook
the imployment;</hi> knowing well, that with
<hi>Princes</hi> the hope of <hi>future services,</hi> is more
prevalent to <hi>induce reward,</hi> then the <hi>memory</hi>
of those that are <hi>past;</hi> and that it is better
to be obliged to <hi>Princes,</hi> then to have them
obliged to us; because they believe, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they have obliged,</hi> to wish well to them,
whilst he that they are indebted unto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is believed not to love the <hi>Prince</hi>
that hath denied him, what he pretended
unto; is recompenced onely with <hi>hate.</hi>
This <hi>Commines</hi> tells us, was <hi>Lewis</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh
his opinion.</p>
               <p>The love of <hi>Princes</hi> towards the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of their pleasure,</hi> would seem to be sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and truly, it is of some continuance,
as long as the inclinations of the <hi>Prince</hi> to
pleasure continue; but those changing, the
affections to those that fed them, change al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Sometimes likewise, the <hi>Prince</hi> inclining
to the <hi>ove of vertue,</hi> doth reject and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
those that are instruments of his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99202:84"/>
                  <hi>pleasures.</hi> But as some of the inclinations of
<hi>Princes</hi> are more durable then others, so also
is their <hi>favor</hi> (as I said) of a proportioned
continuance, towards the <hi>Servants</hi> of those
veral inclinations.</p>

whereunto the nature of the <hi>Prince</hi> is

it is more vehement then <hi>all the rest,</hi> so it is

               <p>Others that they might binde their <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
unto them, made themselves <hi>Witnesses</hi>
and <hi>Companions</hi> of their <hi>wickedness</hi> and <hi>lusts,</hi>
by the example of <hi>Tigellinus.</hi> These men do
not think that <hi>Princes</hi> have a trick to free

oftentimes such kinde of men unto

               <p>And from the example of this <hi>Remirus,</hi>
we may also read their destiny, who serve

hated <hi>Anicetus,</hi> as one whose face daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
him with his Mothers murther.</p>
               <p>The <hi>affections of Avarice</hi> are least of all
changeable; the diversity of the <hi>object</hi> doth
not vary in these, as in those of <hi>love;</hi> it is
not <hi>diminished,</hi> but <hi>encreases with age;</hi> and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99202:85"/>
although it is as <hi>hateful to the people;</hi> as <hi>cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>

in their <hi>favor,</hi> whilst (which is rare

               <p>
                  <hi>Frowardness,</hi> which for the most part is
likewise <hi>contumelious,</hi> begets hatred both to
the <hi>Prince,</hi> and to it self; The author of
which, the <hi>Prince</hi> will at last cast away, to

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riches</hi> are also obnoxious to <hi>envy,</hi> not of

himself; who if he be <hi>truly avaricious,</hi> will
hardly be content, till he have <hi>squeezed the

how little certainty <hi>is in all the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

it is thought a more generous thing
<hi>to fight,</hi> then <hi>to flie,</hi> when you are once <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

it is not indiscreet <hi>to sound a retreat betimes,</hi>
and in imitation of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> to <hi>fight

               </p>
               <p>As it is also a more glorious thing to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
gently by steps,</hi> and as it were, to <hi>go out
at the door,</hi> then to be <hi>cast headlong out at the

of <hi>some specious and contrived pretences,</hi> to
bid <hi>adieu</hi> to your <hi>Honors</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> then to

side think <hi>That Courtier happy,</hi> who in the

Perhaps he that shall do so, shall not be
applauded by all, but by some that look
upon the <hi>outsides of things,</hi> be judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the <hi>Fortune that he hath so abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Yet he that is wise, not regarding such
