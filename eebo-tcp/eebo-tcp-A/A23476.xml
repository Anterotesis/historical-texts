            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>But when for ſynne of hys owne flocke,</l>
            <l>The Lord in wrath tooke him away:</l>
            <l>Leauing the Fort to his next ſtocke / </l>
            <l>The enmies then ſought out theyr pray.</l>
            <l>Then blew vp tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets of Papiſts ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de</l>
            <l>Souldiers to call / and wages gaue:</l>
            <l>Come who ſo would / was armed rounde,</l>
            <l>None they refuſde, but dreſt them braue.</l>
            <l>The field was pytcht of Papiſts part,</l>
            <l>With corned caps, tippets, and gownes.</l>
            <l>Theyr ordnaunce lay redy in cart,</l>
            <l>To beat the fort of gods truth downe.</l>
            <l>The generall Gardner / braue and ſtone</l>
            <l>And Captaine Boner, marcht foorth amain,</l>
            <l>Bourne with ſtanderd, cryed out,</l>
            <l>Al arme / al arme, our ſhauelinges traine.</l>
            <l>The Auncient which that Bourne bare / </l>
            <l>Were fierce wolues teeth, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> blood beſprent</l>
            <l>Fire and Fagot, whych did declare,</l>
            <l>Their rauenous hartes to Chriſtians ment.</l>
            <l>Then doctour Martin, as clarke of army</l>
            <l>With Doctour Story, the maſter Gonner:</l>
            <l>Theſe two in office, were as truſty,</l>
            <l>As Gardner, Bourne / or byſhop Bonner.</l>
            <l>A cry was made, throughout the hoſt:</l>
            <l>With fire and hempe, all to deſtroy:</l>
            <l>Where euer they were, in al the coſt,</l>
            <l>That dyd the Popes power ſeke to noye.</l>
            <l>The Fort thus ſieged on euery ſyde,</l>
            <l>With crye ſo fierce, to kyll them all:</l>

            <l>But from Gods Fort to them dyd fall.</l>
            <l>Then might ye heare the Canons rore / </l>
            <l>Which Bourne and Watſon falſely ſhot:</l>
            <l>Yelde, yeld theſe cryde, from heretickes lore</l>
            <l>Or batter we ſhal / both wall and fort.</l>
            <l>No / no (quoth they within the Fort)</l>
            <l>We yelde vs not Gods truth to ſtayne:</l>
            <l>Though you deſtroy vs in this ſort / </l>

            <l>Thou Lord of hoſtes, way not our ſynne,</l>
            <l>But ayde thy flocke ſo wo betyde.</l>
            <l>For though with ſume, we cauſde this day</l>
            <l>That our good king y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſhouldſt thus take:</l>
            <l>Yet Lord with bitternes of ſoule we pray,</l>
            <l>Strength vs againſt this firye lake.</l>
            <l>This done they blowde a chereful blaſt,</l>
            <l>Vnto the ſouldiers in the Fort:</l>
            <l>Arme ye / arme ye, in all the haſt,</l>
            <l>Our enmies now to Fort reſort.</l>
            <l>The Auncient which was ſpred on wall,</l>
            <l>Had a white Lambe, with red ſpots thicke:</l>
            <l>And in gold letters were theſe wordes all,</l>
            <l>Why do ye Sauls, againſt me kicke?</l>
            <l>Forth came Rogers, Hooper &amp; Sanders</l>
            <l>Vpon the walles the Fort to fende:</l>
            <l>We yelde not (ſaid they) to ſuch deſtroyers,</l>
            <l>But fight we will vnto the ende.</l>
            <l>To theſe Steuen Gardner, gaue onſet,</l>
            <l>And layde on lode, as wolfe on pray:</l>
            <l>He tooke them priſoners, with his falſe net / </l>
            <l>And ſent them to the fire ſtraightway.</l>
            <l>Then Story the maiſter of the ſhot / </l>
            <l>On Papiſts rampire braue and proude:</l>
            <l>For ſpilling bloud he cared not,</l>
            <l>Aſſault / aſſault he cryde aloude.</l>
            <l>Theſe were no ſooner of the wall,</l>
            <l>But vp lept Rydley and Latimer:</l>
            <l>To reſcue Gods fort, ſo nere to fall.</l>
            <l>And did with force, the foes encounter.</l>
            <l>And biſhop Cranmer / though with gyle,</l>
            <l>The enmies ſtole him from the Fort:</l>
            <l>Yet boldly fought with them a whyle,</l>
            <l>And folowed his mates, in lyke ſort.</l>
            <l>Then doctour Weſton, at theſe out ſhot,</l>
            <l>The pellets of Rome, and them did mayme:</l>
            <l>So that away they paſſed not,</l>
            <l>But were deſtroyed with fire and flame.</l>
            <l>But Bradford then on wall vp lept,</l>
            <l>And Philpot eke by hym did ſtand:</l>
            <l>Cardmaker and Taylour alſo vp crept,</l>
            <l>And theſe by truth dyd neytheyr band.</l>

            <l>But to the death / theſe did withſtand,</l>
            <l>And would not yeld to enmies blaſt.</l>
            <l>Then blewe the Papiſts to aſſault,</l>
            <l>And ſet a watch about the Fort:</l>
            <l>Of knightes and yemen to finde ſome fault / </l>
            <l>To make them yelde after this ſort.</l>
            <l>And ſworen men in euery coſt,</l>

            <l>Now ſcale the walles (quoth Boner then)</l>
            <l>Behold the captaines we haue ſlaine:</l>

            <l>Both wemen &amp; children let none remaine,</l>
            <l>Then ſcaling lathers were vp rearde,</l>

            <l>But they in Fort / did with them play / </l>

            <l>Yet ſome within the Fort alone,</l>
            <l>To God did crye / Lord keepe thy holde.</l>
