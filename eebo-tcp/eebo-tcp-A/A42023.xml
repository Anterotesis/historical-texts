            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore the Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt dreadfull denunciations of Judgment againſt the maine Body of State, inſerts ſome words of comfort to the ſincere hearted who could not but lament to ſee but few good, and thoſe few made every day fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by Death. And therefore in theſe two verſes God by his Prophet tells the People. 1. How greatly he reſents that neglect which his People met with, complaining that their Death was not regarded; nor their loſſe valued as it ought. 2. Tells them what gracious end he had in cutting the thread of their temporall Lives, which was to deliver them from the evill to come. 3. What care God had of them after this life, and what amends he made them for ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſooner then ordinary out of the World. <hi>They enter into peace</hi> &amp;c. Theſe afford us ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry points of Inſtruction. 1. That God would have the Death of his Servants minded and layd to Heart. 2. God ſometimes in much Mercy takes away his Children by Death from the evill to come. 3. That the Death of the Righteous is the beginning and inlett of their happineſs.</p>

Nay it ſavours of ſome unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to our deceaſed friends to be immoderately ſorrowful for their departure; as if we more valued the comfort and benefit we receive by thir bodily preſence, then their ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the face of god and enjoying the pleaſures that run at his right hand for ever more. Do but recollect concerning our friends departed, how many cares and troubles they were encumbred with in this World; what fears within, what terrors without, what anxious &amp; ſollicitous cares for Soules, for Bodyes, for themſelves, their familyes, their friends and relations, and for ihe Church of God, how deep their ſighes, how many their teares, how fervent their prayers and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlings with God, both alone and with others, in private and in publick, and then conſider againe, can we be ſorry
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94122:11"/>
that theſe troubles are at an end, that theſe cares are off, that theſe tears are wiped from their eyes, that their prayers are heard, and their petitions, longings, and hopes are ſwallowed up in fruition and Enjoyment: that their fight is fought, their warfare accompliſht, and that they have receiv'd at the Hands of the Lord, not double, but a thouſand fold, reparation and recompenſe for all their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Faith, and labour of Love, and patience of hope which they have expreſt in this day of their pilgrimage. To me ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>To Dye is gaine.</hi> Oppoſe we not our loſs to their gaine, our temporal to their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. <hi>Non moeremus</hi> &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Hierome.</hi> We grieve not that we have loſt ſuch an one, but we give God thankes that we had him: nay we have him, for to God all are alive, and who ever is returned to the Lord, is yet accompted of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, ſtill a member of the Body of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not loſt but ſhall come againe <hi>when he ſhall be revealed from Heaven with all his Saints.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>I would not have you ignorant Brethren concerning them which are aſleep, that yee ſorrow not as others which have no hope, for if you believe that Jeſus Dyed and Roſe againe, even ſo them that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him.</hi> 2. This ſhould reach us to give all diligence to be of the number of theſe Bleſſed ones, that when we Dye we may enter into peace, we may reſt in our Beds: that our Soules may be admitted to the beatifical viſion of God and Chriſt, and our Bodies may reſt in hope, even ſuch hope as <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth. <hi>Job.</hi> 19. 25. <hi>I know that my redeemer Liveth and ſhall ſtand at the latter day on the Earth and though after my skin wormes destroy this Body, yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee my ſelfe and mine eyes ſhall behold and not anothers, though my reines be conſumed within me.</hi> And if you ask me how we ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this happineſs and hope, I anſwer, The way is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed us in the Text, and a patterne given us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion. The way preſcribed in the Text is this, Every
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94122:11"/>
one walking in his uprightnes. The diſtributive particle (every one) ſeemes to mind us that we muſt not truſt to others merits, but each one expreſs the truth of his faith by the goodneſs of his own perſonall converſation. For though God here may viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children, and ſheweth mercy unto after-generations for their forefathers ſake, yet at the day of Accompt <hi>we must all appeare before the Judgment ſeat of Christ</hi> 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5. 10. <hi>And every one of us ſhall give Account of himſelf to God</hi> Rom: 14. 12. Every one muſt ſtand on his own bottome and be judged by what he hath perſonally done in the fleſh, good or evill. Now this uprightneſs is oppos'd 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>. to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ungodlineſs, and a trade of ſin. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. to diſſimulation &amp; hypocriſy He then walkes uprightly that leads his Life not according to the courſe of the world, nor according to the luſts of his ignorance, but by the guidance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God and the preſcript of his Commandements. He alſo that doth not only take up a forme and make a ſhew of godlineſs, but hath the power of it in an honeſt heart, and expreſſeth it in a blameleſs converſation; that is a <hi>true Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite in whom is no guile. Joh.</hi> 1. 47.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there is more force in examples than there is in rules and precepts, and that you may ſee that what is commanded is practicable, the occaſion gives you a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of an upright Man. I meane the example of our dear Brother departed. You perfectly knew his converſation and manner of Life almoſt from his Youth upward; and though he be Dead his good name Lives, and his example ſpeakes. It is (you know) beſide my cuſtome to turne the Pulpit into a Desk, and Sermons to the Living into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the Dead, yet I ſhould diſpleaſe my ſelf, and injure you if I ſhould not at leaſt point you to ſo faire a Copy for your imitation; and herein I will not walk without my line, or commend him to you for things before my knowledge or beſide my profeſſion. He was one of theſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94122:12"/>
righteous ones in the Text, one that walked in his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes. He was like <hi>Timothy,</hi> well acquainted with the Scriptures from a Child, and having in his youth been train'd up by his pious Anceſtors in the way wherein he ſhould go, when he was Old he departed not from it. He was neither a blazing, nor a wandring, nor a falling Star, but one that ſhone in his owne orbe, and gave a conſtant and a ſteady light.</p>
            <p>A conſtant attender on the publick ordinances and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, a Sincere lover of the Miniſters of Chriſt and all that feare God. A diligent performer of all family wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and that brought up his Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. One feareful of offending God: or giveing Juſt occaſion of offence to any Man, merciful and compaſſionate to all; Liberal to his ability, yea above his ability to thoſe that wanted: eſpecially to the houſhold of Faith. One that minded the one thing neceſſary, ſought the Kingdome of God, and his righteouſniſſe in the firſt place and ſlighted all things in compariſon of theſe. That would often profeſſe to have <hi>[Vitam in patientiâ, mortem in deſiderio,]</hi> To be one that could live, but that would rather Dye, and be with Chriſt which is beſt of all. This I have ſaid (much more I could ſay, but forbear) not with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to Paint the Sepulchre of the Dead, or to flatter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny liveing; but to reſtify my due reſpects for the memory of ſo good and worthy a perſon. With my juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our great loſſe, and to provoke my ſelfe and you to the imitation of his vertues: that walking every one in his uprightneſſe, when we dye we may enter into peace and reſt in our Beds, and then when the Lord the Righteous Judge ſhall come he will give us a Crowne of Glory, and not unto us only, but to all that love and looke for his appearing.</p>

Theſe 4. propoſitions will ſwallow up the ſubſtance of them. 1. That the beſt of Men here on Earth Live by Faith, not by ſight. 2. To be here at home in the Body is to be abſent from the Lord. 3. To be abſent from the Body is to be preſent with the Lord. 4 Holy men have attain'd, and may attaine to this high and Heavenly pitch, to deſire rather to be abſent from the Body and preſent with the Lord. A little of each.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The beſt of Men Live here by faith, not by ſight. This liveing by Faith is mentioned elſewhere partly as a duty, partly as a privilege and promiſe. <hi>Heb:</hi> 2: 4. &amp; <hi>Heb:</hi> 10. 38. It ſeemes brought in in this place as an allay to a Chriſtians preſent condition. Underſtanding by ſight, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyment, it is as if he had ſayd; we enioy not, but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and that ſupports us. We have but the leaſt part of our inheritance and happineſs in our poſſeſſion, more in expectation, reverſion and hope; but that alſo, as ſure as if we had it. For true Faith is an <hi>evidence. Heb:</hi> 11: 1. And Chriſtian <hi>Hope maketh not aſhamed. Rom:</hi> 5. 5. But look as all men had rather be in a condition of haveing then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, of enjoying then deſiring, ſo had we. Now this life of Faith and Senſe differ eſpecially in two reſpects. 1. Sight reaches only to viſible things, Faith to inviſible: the Eye of ſenſe ſees only groſſe and materiall things pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a due diſtance, through a fit medium &amp;c. but <hi>faith is the evidence of things not ſeen. Heb.</hi> 11. 1. If you run through the whole Life of a Chriſtian you ſhall find
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94122:14"/>
it a kind of inviſible and myſterious Life. The actions of it are managed and caryed on by Motives unknown to other Men. The food that maintains it, is ſuch as the world knowes not off. The joyes that cheare and quicken it are ſuch as a ſtranger intermeddles not with. The promiſes which maintaine and ſupport it are of things beyond the kenne of carnal reaſon and ſenſe. Eternal Life is promiſed, but it is hid with <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>God.</hi> We are juſtifyed, but not by a righteouſnes that is in us, but in <hi>Christ,</hi> who ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of our view long before our time, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into Heaven far from our ſight; and yet we look for eternal Life in him as aſſuredly as if we enjoyed it. <hi>Whom having not ſeen yet we love: in whom though we ſee him not, yet believing, we rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sight extends only to preſent things, faith to future: therefore faith is ſaid to be the ſubſtance of things hoped for. <hi>Now hope that is ſeen is not hope, for that which a Man ſees why doth he yet hope for. Rom:</hi> 8. 24. Chriſtians live not by pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent things, or things that periſh with the uſing; but ſuch as will come hereafter, and will laſt for ever. <hi>While we look not at thoſe things which are ſeen but at thoſe which are not ſeene. For thoſe things which are ſeen are temporal, but thoſe which are not ſeen are eternal.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 4. 18. If then a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians life be a life of hope, not of enjoyment, of faith not of ſenſe, it confutes on the one hand the fond imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conceited Perfectioniſts, on the other the brutiſh ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality of worldlings and Epicures. The firſt pretends to live above the life of faith: would make us believe they are already in poſſeſſion and enjoyment of what ever a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can wiſh or hope for: and deſpiſe thoſe that preſſe hard after God in the uſe of his Ordinances, that go groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the burden of their corruptions, and ſighing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the enjoyment of a future happines, as perſons of a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er forme, and meaner attainements: for their parts they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94122:14"/>
are perfect, they are ſinleſſe, they need no ſtaires nor lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they are already at the top: no ordinances, no meanes of grace, they are full, they have attain'd, they are in Heaven allready &amp;c. what ſhall we ſay to theſe Men but what the Apoſtle ſayes to the <hi>Galatians. CH:</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Oh fooliſh Galatians who hath bewitched you?</hi> and certainely if there were not a certaine witchcraft and ſorcery in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy and fond opinions: and if there were not a Spiritual as well as bodily phrenſie we might juſtly wonder at the wild conceits of ſuch Opinioniſts. Have ye ſeene Men in Bedlam ſtrangely enjoying themſelves in their imaginary felicityes? juſt ſuch are theſe, Confuted by the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Scripture, and by the conſtant experience of the beſt of Gods Children who have alway confeſt, they knew but in part and were but Sanctifyed in part. <hi>Now we ſee through a glaſſe darkely</hi> 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 17. 12. for v. 9, 10. <hi>we know but in part, and we Prophecy in part,</hi> &amp;c. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe thought not himſelfe perfect, <hi>nor to have already attaind. Phil.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others live a life as much below, as theſe pretend to live above the Life of faith. It were to be wiſht that all were arrived ſo far, as to follow the dictate of natural and common Reaſon. But alas! Men are degenerated into brutes live not the lives of rational beings. <hi>homines in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem proni &amp; libidinum mancipia</hi> as the Hiſtorian ſpeakes, or as the Apoſtle better. <hi>Their belly is their God; they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their ſhame; they minde earthly things. Phil:</hi> 3. 19. Theſe muſt learne to be Men before they can hope to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And muſt bid adieu to the dreggy deſires of the world and the fleſh, and become <hi>pure</hi> in heart, before they can <hi>ſee God. For without Holines none ſhall ſee the Lord. Heb:</hi> 12. 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Propoſition. They that are at home in the body are abſent from the Lord. For underſtanding thereof, we muſt diſtinguiſh of a 4. fold preſence of God. 1. His eſſential
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94122:15"/>
preſence. Or the preſence of his being. In which reſpect God is boundleſſe and infinite, excluded out of no place: included in none. This is called Gods immenſity, ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and omni preſence. which the ſcripture often aſſerts <hi>Jer:</hi> 22, 23, 24. <hi>Am I a God at hand ſaith the Lord, and not a God afarre off? Can any hide himſelfe in ſecret places that I cannot ſee him, ſaith the Lord. Do not I fill Heaven and Earth?</hi> ſo <hi>Pſ.</hi> 139. 6. &amp;c. <hi>Whether ſhall I flye from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? If I aſcend into Heaven thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, be hold thou art there</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27. <hi>He is not far from any of us</hi> &amp;c. 2 His providential preſence, whereby he is in every buſines, and nothing comes to paſſe without him. This followes from the former. For the eſſence of God being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and that eſſence being a pure Act, is no where i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; but alwayes operative in all Creatures and in all their actions Now thus nothing, no perſon is ever abſent from the Lord. All are ſubject to his eye and government. He ſees all his Creatures, he manageth and over-rules all their wayes and actions. 3. There is a Spiritual or gracious preſence of God. Whereby he is ſaid to be in and with his Church, and every faithful Member thereof. Hees ſayd to be the God of his People, and to dwel in the midſt of them. <hi>Pſa:</hi> 46. 7. <hi>The Lord of Hoasts is with us</hi> &amp;c. So every Child of God hath God graciouſly preſent with him in this life, and every one of them have him ſo much the nearer to them as they have more ſpecial need of his aſſiſting, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encouraging preſence. <hi>Job:</hi> 5. 29. <hi>He is with you in ſix troubles and in ſeven. Matth:</hi> 28. <hi>last. I am with you to the end of the World.</hi> Of all theſe ſeveral ſorts of divine preſence the Apoſtle ſpeaks. <hi>Eph:</hi> 4. 6. <hi>There is one God and Father of all who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> Above all by his power and Soveraignty. through all, by his common providence, and in all his Children by the preſence of his grace and Spirit. The life of faith then excludes none of theſe Divine preſences, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94122:15"/>
them all, and every Chriſtian even in this life is in all theſe reſpects preſent with the Lord. But 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> there is a Celeſtial or a glorious preſence, which the Scripture calls a beholding God face to face, and ſeeing him as he is. God vouchſafeth to <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſee his back parts, but (ſaith he <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 20.) <hi>no Man can ſee my face and Live,</hi> as if be ſhould ſay, this ſinfull and fraile State of Mortality is not capable of, nor can be admitted to the full and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate viſion of the Divine glory and Excellency. While we are in the Body we are abſent from the beatificall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and fruition of him. That State of compleat bliſſe and happineſs is reſerved for hereafter. Toward this the Apoſtle having not yet attain'd, did breath and ſtrive <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>I follow after if I may apprehend that for which I am apprehended of Christ.

            <p n="1">1. Then if this be the ſtate of the Godly in this Life, to be abſent from the Lord, what's the condition of wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. See what little reaſon good Men have to be fond of this State of mortality wherein they are abſent from the Lord. It's true, Life, and Death are in the power of the Lord, and both of them are to be thankfully accepted at his Hands, and meekly ſubmitted to his pleaſure. Man may not quitt his centinell till he be orderly diſcharged: he may not break out of Life, though he account it a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but muſt expect a legall delivery. Yet hath no reaſon to be fond of his impriſonment, or be unwilling to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.

Againe as hee's preſent with the Body, ſo hee's abſent from the Lord.

Pſ:</hi> 42. 1, 2. <hi>As the Hart panteth</hi> &amp;c. <hi>my Soul thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth for God, for the Living God, when ſhall I come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God.</hi> and conclude with <hi>St. Paul, I deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and to be with Christ; which is farre better. Phil.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Propoſition. To be abſent from the Body is to be preſent with the Lord. I do not meane that all men ſo ſoone as they are Dead are in a State of Happineſs and Bliſs: no, this is the portion of the heirs of ſalvation and of them only. Nor do I meane that good Men ſo ſoone as they Dye, are poſſeſt of all the Happineſs that ever they ſhall be: no, the utmoſt conſummation of their Bliſs both in Body and Soul is reſerved to the generall Reſurrection. But I meane, that the Soules of good Men are no ſooner ſeparated from the Body by naturall Death, but they are preſented before Chriſt, and admitted to the beginnings of glory and happineſs. The Apoſtle makes nothing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene between theſe two: being abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord. No third region wherein to lodge and purge departed Soules before they come to the preſence of their Redeemer. No middle State betwixt the Death of the Godly and their Reception into the Armes of Chriſt, and the manſions that he hath prepared for them. This grounded the Prayer of <hi>Stephen</hi> when he was about to Dye, Lord <hi>Jeſus receive my Spirit. Act:</hi> 7. 59. and the promiſe of our Saviour to the penitent Thiefe. <hi>Lu:</hi> 23. 43. <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> In the parable of the Rich Man and <hi>Lazarus. Lu:</hi> 16. the poor Man is immediately carryed into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome where he enjoys his good things, as the other is Tormented, and ſaith <hi>St. John Revel:</hi> 14. 13. <hi>I heard a voyce from Heaven ſaying, Write; Bleſsed are the Dead that dye in the Lord: from henceforth,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) from the moment of their Death and diſſolution <hi>they rest from their labours</hi> &amp;c. The ſenſe and ſubſtance of all which places I can not give you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in the very words of our Church in her office for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94122:17"/>
the Burial of the Dead. viz. The ſoules of the faithful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered from the Burden of the fleſh are with Chriſt in joy and felicity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Propoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Holy Men have attaind, &amp; may attaine to this high and excellent pitch to be willing rather to be abſent from the body and to be preſent with the Lord. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes here of more then his ſingle ſelfe. <hi>We</hi> in the plural Number: and he ſayes it not once, and in a paſſion but deliberately, once and againe. <hi>Phil:</hi> 1. 23 <hi>Having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, which is farre better.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here 1. The deſireable eſtate of a Chriſtian, namely to be with Chriſt, together with the Apoſtles willingneſſe to it. I deſire it, I long for it. And the ſooner the better. 2. The way to come to this happy State: thats by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting hence, by putting off this Earthly Tabernacle, by being abſent from the Body. 3. The judgment he paſſeth upon a compariſon of the two eſtates of Life and Death: this later is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, much, very much, farre, and exceeding better, and more deſirable. So that he is not onely willing to ſubmit to the common neceſſity of dying, but is deſirous to Dye. Not willing only to depart hereafter, but to weigh anchor and away preſently. He ſtood indifferent to any kind of Death, Violent or natural, ſo he might Dye he had his wiſh. Nor was he of this mind onely upon ſome ſudden pang, or ſome extaticall paſſion, or upon a ſullen and diſcontented fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, being rather weary of life then deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Death, or by reaſon of the hard preſſure of ſome preſent affliction, as <hi>Jonah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> wiſht for Death: but out of a more deliberate choyce, a ſincere affection to Chriſt and a pious and earneſt deſire of a fuller enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, and out of ſtrong and invincible apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the bleſſednes of a Future ſtate after Death, And if you ask by what meanes and degrees he attained, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we may attaine to this willingnes, the context will give you the grounds of his choyce and will teach us
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94122:17"/>
how we may arrive at the ſame pitch.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He had a ſtrong apprehenſion and perſwaſion of the great Happines of the life to come compared with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Mortal Life. The vaſt difference of which two ſtates he ſetts forth by ſundry metaphors. v. 1. the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is called an Earthly Houſe; a Mud-wall eaſily cruſht by a ſudden caſualty, or battered with the ſhock of a more lingring diſeaſe; and though it be let alone from external Violence, yet ſtoopes to Time and Age: moulders downe of its owne accord. Againe the body is call'd a tent or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, ſuddenly clapt up, and as eaſily took downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, a moveable habitation fit for a ſojourners and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims ſtate. But our eſtate hereafter is a building of God, an houſe not made with hands. Say then that we are not weary of our Bodies, yet we may be weary of the preſent ſtate and condition of them; which is a ſtate of corruption and infirmity, not comparable to that of glory and immortality that lyes before us. Here we are in continual peril to have our Earthly houſe diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp; our fraile temporal lives ſwallowed up of Death. But here after <hi>this mortal ſhall have put on immortality and Death ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He had a ſure and certaine hope of enjoying a ſhare in that happineſſe which by faith he foreſaw. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. We know it, we are confident of it, we are ſatisfyed and cheareful under the forethoughts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it. Without this hope how ſhall any be ever brought to a willingnes to depart, when he knows not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I wonder not to ſee the Atheiſt and prophane perſon ſhrink and tremble at the approach of Death; to leave a certaine and preſent enjoyment of this Worlds good things upon the propoſal of a future bliſſe, which the one believes not that there is any ſuch thing, the other cannot upon any comfortable grounds conclude that he ſhall have any part in it. Who can be willing to lanch into an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94122:18"/>
Eternity, which he knows not whether it will be of bliſs or miſery. This made the Emperour <hi>Adrians</hi> Heart ake, and his Soul loath to leave its former habitation. <hi>Animul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But on the contrary a Chriſtians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of diſſolution proceeds from an evidence of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt, aſſurance of the remiſſion of Sins, and an undoubted title to thoſe exceeding great and pretious promiſes made to godlineſs of the good things of this Life, and the better which is to come.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

It's God that hath brought us to this purpoſe, reſolution and choyce, that we had rather <hi>be abſent from the Body</hi> &amp;c. the frame of Spirit is beyond the attainment of nature, and proceeds from higher then humane princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

               </gap>. a Metaphor from Carpenters ſquaring and plaining their Timber, or Maſons hewing and poliſhing their Stones, or Goldſmiths ſcouring and burniſhing their Metall, for look as in the building in the Temple at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> the Wood and Stones were framed and fitted in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, that no Axe or Hammer might be heard in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo Chriſtians are fitted in this Life for glory: no ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, purging or poliſhing hereafter, the title to inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ſett forth here, the poſſeſſion is delivered here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Exercis'd, Educated, and train'd up we are in theſe inferiour Schooles of grace; the degrees, and dignities are confer'd in the generall Convocation and Conſiſtory of glory. Now, as no piece of Timber can promiſe it ſelf an honourable place in the building, ſave that which is fitted and carved before it be layd, nor any hope for a Crowne
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94122:18"/>
that hath neither breeding nor title to it. So, nor can any promiſe to themſelves glory, whom God hath not poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and fitted by ſanctification and Grace. The Apoſtle <hi>Col:</hi> 1. 12. thankes the <hi>Father that hath made us fitt, or meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> not that hath put us into a condition to merit Heaven, but hath adopted us undeſerving, and fitted us that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. This God doth by making us partakers of the Divine nature, turning our hearts from Sin to Holineſs, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us new Creatures. Which happy thing and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who ſo ever finds truly, though but weakly, wrought in him, he longs to be in poſſeſſion of that which God of his mercy in Chriſt hath in ſome degree fitted and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him for.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The laſt ground is Gods having given to them <hi>the earnest of the ſpirit. v.</hi> 5. By which we may underſtand the fruits of the Spirit, namely, joy and peace in believing, which are the fruits of the Spirit and the gifts of God not in a way of duty only, as to believe, repent, Love the Father and the Brethren, and the like are fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but in a way of reward or recompenſe of Grace. Theſe prediſcoveries of Gods good will, and manifeſtation of his Love to Men are the hanſells and fore-taſts of Glory. This the Apoſtle calls Joy unſpeakable &amp; full of Glory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd here in a way of believing; the ſure earneſts of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enjoyments in the time to come. 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1. 8. Now as the ſight of the glory of Chriſt in his transfiguration made the Diſciples loath to foregoe that pleaſant rapture. <hi>Master, 'tis good for us to be here. Matt:</hi> 17. 4. ſo ſuch fore-taſts of the Divine Love, and praeſentiments of the happineſs of a future ſtate as, no doubt, the Apoſtles and holy Men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had, makes them long for the full enjoyment, and deſire to be with Chriſt which is beſt of all. But leaſt while I ſpeak of the high attainements of ſtrong Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans I ſhould diſcourage the Hearts of Babes in Chriſt, who

are as dear to him, and he as tender of them, as they that are of greater ſtrongth and fuller growth though from theſe he expects more ſervice and greater obedience: take theſe Cautions. 1.

               </gap> Chriſtians, and that not alwaies, but at ſome ſeaſons, ſuch as have ſtrong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the glory of the other World, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of that eternall reſt which remaines for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; that have good aſſurance through grace of their intereſt therein, and can rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God: others may be weaker and yet true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are pronounced <hi>bleſſed that hunger after Righteouſneſs,</hi> as well as they that long and thirſt for glory. 2. Nor muſt it be ſo taken as if even ſtrong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were without a naturall abhorrence of Death, and a declining from it, the Diſciples in a Tempeſt, and <hi>Peter</hi> when he began to ſink city out upon the apprehenſion of approaching Death; and yet were Chriſts Diſciples for all that The Apoſtle intimates that he and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans could have been glad to have eſcaped Death, if Gods will were ſo, and if they could have arrived at what they aimed at and looked for, without paſſing through the jawes thereof, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>not that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon</hi> &amp;c.

As a Child of God is not without a natural abhornence of Death, ſo nor without a due Care to preſerve his Life, ſo long as God ſees it fitt, and a willingneſs to beare thoſe troubles
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94122:19"/>
and inconvenienoies of life which God ſees good to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe him under. God hath ſett his Children in this World as ſouldiers on their guard, not to runne away at their pleaſure but to wait till they are releaſt and called off. We may go out of Life when God opens a doore, but we may not break priſon. We may depart asking Gods leave. <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy Servant depart Lu:</hi> 2. 29. but muſt be willing to ſtay his leizure, and expect his diſmiſſion. Thus notwithſtanding the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was deſirous to depart, yet he ſits down contented when he ſaw God would have him worke, and ſuffer longer. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe to abide in the fleſh is more needfull for you, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this confidence I know I ſhall abide</hi> &amp;c. <hi>However Christ ſhall be magnified in my Body, whether it be by Life or by Death for to me to Live is Chriſt, to Dye is gaine v.</hi> 20, 21. From what hath been ſaid, gather we courage to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, and to look the King of terrour in the face which is ſo farre from being now a terrour to the Children of God, that it's become the object of their deſires and wiſhes. The frightfull Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which all Mankind fled is in the Hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> become a Rod and a Staffe of ſupport and comfort; I meane Death which is an enemy to nature, and the wages of Sin is by the power of Chriſt, turn'd to a friend and a Servant of all the heires of ſalvation: an end of a Sinful, troubleſome, and uncertaine Life, and a paſſage to a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Glorious immortality. Make then a vertue of neceſſity, and being <hi>its appointed for us all to Dye. Heb:</hi> 9. 27. learne we to <hi>dye daylie</hi> 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 15. 31. ſo ſetting our hearts and Houſes in order that we may rather meet Death, then flye from it: rather wiſh and welcome it, then be affraid of it. <hi>And ſeeing all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved what manner of Perſons ought we to be in all holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and godlines, looking for, and hasting to the coming of the day of God?</hi> 2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 3. 11. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94122:20"/>
And from the occaſion and object before you be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prepare to dye. Nothing that is either great or good ſecures from Death. No Man living can deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the power of the grave. A little time will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne us to our duſt, and ſhut us up in the houſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard for all living. A few Months have put a period to the Mortal lives of two good Brothers, not more united by the bonds of nature then by thoſe of Grace and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection. Of whom we may ſay what <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Saul and Jonathan</hi> 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 1. 23. <hi>They were lovely and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in their lives, and in their Deaths they were not</hi> much <hi>divided.</hi> Such a paire as for ſincerity in Religion, for mutual correſpondence of affection one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for candour and integrity of converſation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Men will ſcarſe be paralleld in this, or, I doubt, in the ſucceeding age.</p>
            <p>As for this worthy Gentleman whoſe funeral hath brought us together I need ſay little, being I ſpeak to an auditory that have knowne him much longer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then my ſelfe. His extraction from Honourable and pious Anceſtors was by him honoured with qualities and converſation worthy ſuch a deſcent. In matters of Religion he was ſerious and fixt, not eccentrick and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine in his motions, but a fixed ſtarre in his owne Orbe, giving a ſteady and a conſtant light. In matters of the world he was juſt, and equitable; tender of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring his God, or injuring his Neighbour, providing things honeſt in the ſight of all Men, ſtudying to give no juſt cauſe of offence to great or ſmall. Of ſo well bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc't a ſoul and a mind ſo prepar'd to all events, that ſcarſe any external accidents whether proſperous or adverſe (of which his life wanted not it's variety) were ever obſerved to reſolve him into any unſeemly expreſſions or immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate effuſions of ſorrow, joy, feare, anger, or any other impotent and unruly paſſion.

An eminent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of wiſdome and goodneſſe in all eſtates of life, in all the imployments he managed, and all relations that he underwent. And all theſe Graces and vertues ſet off with ſo much humility, modeſty, and ſelfe denyal, and ſeaſond with ſo much plainneſſe and ſincerity as made them all ſhine like apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.
