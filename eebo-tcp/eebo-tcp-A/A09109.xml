         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO
THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Could much haue vvished that Sir Francis Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinges,
vvho geueth himself for author of a
certayne iniurious pamphlet, published some
monethes past, agaynst Catholiques, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled:
<hi>Avvache-vvord,</hi> or vvhosoeuer made
that byting libel for him, vvith intention to
dishonor him vvith the title, as on the one syde, he nameth
himself knight (and all men knovv the Hastinges to be of a
verie honorable familie, and one also to be knight of that
name) so on the other, had he obserued some terme and stile
of nobilitie or gentrie in his vvryting: in vvhich case, I had
either vvholy spared this labour of ansvvering him at all,
leauing him only to the censure and rebuke of his equals, for
medling in so base an excercise, as calumniation and rayling
is, in this his old yeares, or at leastvvise, should he haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
his check and refutation, vvith that regard of vvorship
and honor, as othervvise had byn due to his rank, place,
and person.</p>
            <p>But fynding him so far forgetful of all knightly tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in his tongue, and of all ciuil cariage in the drift and
current of his book, as he holdeth no rule or limit of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie
at all, but inraged rather (as it seemeth) vvith a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
veyne of inuectiue spirit, spareth neither God nor man,
so far forth as they concerne the catholique cause, or the cause
them: he must beare vvith me, and lay it to his ovvne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits,
<pb facs="tcp:14532:3"/>
if I be driuen to encounter vvith him in some more
egar and sharp manner, at certayne meetinges, then either
I allovv of by myne ovvne lyking, or then the reuerend res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
I carie to his house and familie, and the particuler affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I feele tovvardes some of his ovvne name and linage,
vvould othervvise haue induced me.</p>
            <p>VVho vvill not confesse, but that lying, forging, and fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
ignorant vaunting, odious scoffyng, malitious calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations,
seditious interpretations, bloodie exaggerations,
Barbarous in sultations ouer them that already are in affliction
and calamitie, ought to be far from the nature, pen, and
tongue of a knight or gentleman? and yet these are the flovvers
or rather furies of this skolding discourse, as aftervvard you
shall see by that vvhich is to be treated. VVherin if the lyues
honors, states, and liuinges, of home-borne subiectes, vvere
only touched, and brought in question (as they be) it vvere
more tolerable, though no vvay tolerable, being don vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly,
but the heat of this hastie knight resteth not here, but
rusheth further, to the open assault of forayne monarches also,
their honors, fame, and reputation, vvhich is lesse tolerable,
and consequently, hath need of some more sharpe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
reiection.</p>
            <p>The violence of the Puritan spirit is not vnknovven to the
vvise of England: vvherunto also France and Scotland vvil
beare sufficient vvitnesse. It hath byn kept dovvne many
yeares, by the valour and prudenee of the Protestant, and
the knovven professors therof haue byn held leane and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
by her Maiestie, to no smale benefyt of publique peace
and so may be stil, vvhyle the Catholique partie hath
also some poyse and svvay in the balance agaynst them. If
Sir Francis be one of them, it may seeme perhaps expedient
in his vvisdome, that (her Maiestie grovving novv fast in
yeares) thinges be brought to some trial by garboile in her
dayes, for that aftervvard, more then one parte may chance
<pb facs="tcp:14532:3"/>
to ioyne agaynst them: vvherfore if they might novv oppresse
the catholique partie by the hand of her Maiestie, their ovvne
vvould serue aftervvardes more easely to do the lyke agaynst
her and hers, and the vvay and meanes to effectuate them
both may seeme perhappes no vvise to be more potent or
speedie, then to dryue many at home to desperation, by
feares and terrors of oppressions, and by opprobrious iniuries,
and personnal slaunders, to inforce forayne princes, of the
same religion, to implacable yre and indignation. And this
is the proper course that Sir Francis taketh, throughout his
vvhole sedious vvach-vvord. VVhich to couer the better, he
falleth to extreme flaterie of the other syde, espetially of
the state, and of her Maiesties person in particuler; vvhich
are the fittest baytes to couer such hookes, as angle after popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
fauor, for a further fetche.</p>
            <p>To this man then I am to ansvver, as the substance and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his accusations, fictions, or calumniations, shall
leade me, reducing all that I am to saie, for better order and
memorie, to eight or nyne principal heades, branches, and
argumentes, vnder the name of encounters, vvherin I dout
not, but the apparent truth of diuers poyntes vvil come to
light, vvhich hitherto haue layen hidden and obscure, in the
vnderstanding of many, hoping that the discret reader vvill
passe ouer these fevv lynes, vvith a beneuolent, or at least,
an indifferent eye; reseruing the final iudgment of all, to the
Lordes of her Maiesties Councell; vvhome, I my self haue
chosen for vmpires and arbitres of the vvhole controuersie,
and so I end this entrance and vvil passe to my first combat
and incounter vvith Sir Francis Hastinges.</p>

by the sayd change: he will either say, that the man lacked witte and
discourse to see the deformitie and contradiction of his owne talke, or
els modestie and shame fastnesse in vttering it.</p>
            <p>For notwithstanding the rare partes, and good intentions, of her
Maiestie in this her gouernement (which no man denieth, nor yet
conioyneth with the euil successe of this alteration of religion, as

            <p>Here Sir Knight, seing you mention our <hi>little Island,</hi> you must take
in Scotland also, or els you erre in Cosmographie, and then your
meaning must be, that Scotland in like manner as well as we, hath
tasted of the same benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by change of religion, as no doubt but
it hath, with all other regions and countryes neere about vs, who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14532:5"/>
being quiet before and setled in one vniuersall and generall religion,
did by Englandes alteration, receyue the like impression and motion
in themselues; yet more then the rest (by their neerenesse) Scotland,
Ireland, Flanders, and Fraunce. Into the enumeration of all which
countryes miseries, tumultes, calamities, and desolations, happened
by that chaunge, if I should enter with Sir Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis to recount them,
I should finde a far more ample subiect to inlarge my self vpon,
then he in recyting his blessinges, though he descended vnto verie

            <p>For to begin with Scotland,<note place="margin">Scotland.</note> and to say nothing of the Battailes,
Murders, destruction of Countries, Prouinces, Townes, Citties,
Howses, and particuler Men, which we haue seen in that Realme
within thes fourtie yeares, that the change of religion hath bin attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted;
no man can deny but that three Princes, two Queenes, and one
King, the Mother, Daughter, and Husband, haue bin all brought
to their bane, by this occasion; besides the ouerthrow and change of
so many Noble Howses and Linages, as Scotish-men can recount,

in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which drew them after vs, or at least-wyse gaue example,
hart, and help, to their change and euersion also.</p>
            <p>But not to steppe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> England<note place="margin">England.</note> it self, wher principally this <hi>blessing
bringer</hi> doth vaunt that his blessings are powred out in abundance,
let vs examine the matter indifferentlie among our selues: we are
English-men, and we talke to men of the same language and nation,
that know the countrie and condition therof: and many haue seen
the change, and knew the stare of thinges therein before the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or at least-wyse haue heard thereof since: by their fatheres
and grandfathers, This is not a contention about <hi>Terra Virginea,</hi> where
only we must beleeue <hi>Sir VValter Rawleighes</hi> Relations, or <hi>Sir Humfrey
Gilbertes</hi> about <hi>Terra Florida.</hi> Let euery man then looke about him,
and say what he findeth or feeleth of these blessings, or maledictions
in himself or others.</p>
            <p>I for my part shal onely for better direction of mens iudgments,
geue this aduertisement, that all blessings of a common-wealth may
seeme to be reduced to two heades or braunches, the one spirituall,
belonging to the soule and conscience; the other temporall, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14532:6"/>
the body and weale-publique. Let the consideration of the
spirituall, goe before, for that they are the worthier and most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
for true Christians to be considered and esteemed.</p>
            <p>There was in England before the alteration,<note place="margin">Spiritual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes by change of religion.</note> one God worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
and adored after one and the self same manner, not onely tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
this little Iland of England, and Scotland, but also of the
whole body of Christendome, one fayth, one beleefe, one forme of
seruice, one number of sacramentes, one tonge in celebration, one
sacryfice, one head of the Church, one obedience, one iudgement in
all,<note place="margin">Ioan. 17. Act. 4. Eph. 4. Gal. 3. 2. Thes. 5. 1. Cor. 4.</note> with other lyke poyntes and circumstances of vnion and vnitie,
which made a generall vniformitie also in the peace of mens myndes,
and is a benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so highlie esteemed &amp; commended by the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and Christ himself as nothing more in Christian doctrine.</p>
            <p>This was in England before the change, but now in these poyntes,
we English of the new profession, are not onelie different &amp; deuided
from the generall body of Catholiques in Christendom (with whome
we were vnited before) but also among our selues and with other
new sectaries sprong vp with vs or after vs, we haue implacable
warres and are deuided in opinions, as from Lutherans in Germanie
and Denmarke, from Zwinglians in Swizer-land, from Caluinistes
in Geneua, Fraunce, Holland, and Scotland; and at whome what
combates our Bishoppes, Counsellors, and moderate sorte of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes,
haue to defend their <hi>Parlament Religion</hi> and Q. proceedings
as they call it, against Puritanes, Brownistes, and other lyke good
fellowes, that by shew of Scriptures doe impugne it: All Englishmen
knowe and see by their bookes daylie, so as this first and greatest spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
blessing of vnity and vniformitie, we haue lost and not gained
by out change of Religion.</p>
            <p>But here our Knight perhappes will say, that the blessing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in that by this change, they who follow the <hi>Parlament Religion</hi>
allowed by the state of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, (I doe say Perhappes, for that I know
not but rather doe doubt much, whether Sir Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis doth followe it
or no) haue the onlie true Religion among all others, that doe erre,
or at least-wyse his puritan Religion, and thereby that they only haue
this blessing by the change.</p>
            <p>And, no doubt, but he saied much if he could proue it of the one
or of the other,<note place="margin">About cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayntie in religion.</note> but this seemeth impossible (I meane) that he should
either proue it to me, or knowe it himself, but onlie by his owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer
ghesse, which maketh not faith, but opinion and fansie; for I
would aske Sir Francis, or any such man as he is, that determineth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14532:6"/>
so resolutely, that his onlie Religion among so many others (as are
extant at this day) is true, and all others false; whereon doth he grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
his certaintie?</p>
            <p>Two only meanes can Sir Francis haue to guide himself in this case,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
first, that he hath receyued his doctryne of such or such persons, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
Ministers, or Doctors, whose learning and knowledge in this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ehalf he trusteth absolutely: &amp; then is his whole fayth builded vpon
the credit of man, as is euident, and consequently is nothing worth,
nor no fayth at all. The other waie is, that he beleeueth it, for that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s founded in scripture; but this waie to Sir Francis must needes be
as vncertayne as the other, if not more; for that to be sure that it is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oundly grounded vpon scripture, he must first reade himself his
whole beleef expresly in scriptures, which is much for a man of Sir
Francis occupation to do, &amp; then he must be able to iudge of manie
other poyntes, belonging to the same, as namely, that the booke is
surely scripture, that he readeth. And then that the translation which
he vseth is trulie made, out of the learned tongues of Hebrue, Greek,
and Latin: And lastelie he must be sure of the true sense and exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which also are hard matters, for a man of Sir Francis learning,
and much more for others that knowe lesse then he.</p>
            <p>Yea and when all is done, if he had all these helpes needfull for
such a matter (as he hath not) yet were it but a priuate mans opinion,
and consequentlie his faith should be grounded but vpon his owne
particuler iudgement, which maketh no faith at all, but opinion only
as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath byn saied, for that faith must haue Gods expresse autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
for her foundation.</p>
            <p>So that to conclude, the first blessing which Sir Francis in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer
thinketh to haue rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yued by this change of his religion, is in
effect, that, wheras before, when he beleeued the Catholique and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal
fayth of Christendome, deliuered vnto him by the vniuersal
churche, as founded on scripture (which churche Christe and his
Apostles, gaue him expresse comission to credit) his beleef was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
fayth and founded vpon a rocke, that could not fayl: now,
hauing left that fortresse, and cast himself into the waues of new
opinions, he hath nothing certayne at all, but so much as he list to
chuse of himself, or of other mens opinions; which choise is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called heresy, for that the woord heresie in Greek (as all learned
men know) signifyeth nothing els, but a certayne election and
choise in matters of religion, to witt, when a man leauing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent of the generall Churche, chuseth only to follow that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14532:7"/>
which his owne priuate iudgement induceth him vnto.</p>
            <p>And to make this more playne,<note place="margin">A playne demonitiation agaynst Sir Francis.</note> how all these people haue no other
rule of beleef but only what their owne fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sie leadeth them vnto, I
aske Sir Francis (not of any Catholyque Doctor, nor of anie auncient
father, as S. Augustin, S. Ierom, or the rest, whome easely he would
contemne) but rather, of his owne Doctors, Martin Luther, Iohn
Caluyn, Theodore Beza, and such others, whome he supposeth to
haue bin seruantes of God, and indued with his holie spirit: and all
the world knoweth that they were more learned then Sir Francis; yet
why should he beleeue his owne iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t more then theirs in poyntes
of faith? wherin they differ from him, as Luther about the real
presence, and the number and forme of Sacraments, and many other
pointes; Caluyn in matter of the Q Supremacie, which he denieth.
Beza in the whole gouernement of their churche. Or why should I
beleeue Sir Francis or his new maisters of England, rather then these
that were more learned then hee or his? or what reason, rule, or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
haue any of these men, to beleeue their owne opinion, more
then others, but only self will and fansie?</p>
            <p>This then is the first and greatest spiritual benediction (or maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
rather) that I fynd to haue happened to our realme and nation
by this wofull alteration of religion, that whereas before we had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
direct rule, squyre and pole-starre to follow, which was the vniuersal
churche; now, euery man being set at libertie, holdeth, beleeueth, and
teacheth what he listeth. Nor is there any waie or meane lefte to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayne
him, for streight way he appealeth boldly and confidently
to the scriptures, and there he wilbe both maister and pilot, and bote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swayne
himself, to gouerne the barke at his pleasure, for he admitte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
no iudge, no interpreter, no authoritie, no antiquitie, nor anie other
manner of triall; which is the greatest madnes and malediction that
euer could happen amonge men of reason.</p>
            <p>And I haue byn the longer in this first blessing, for that it is the
head and welspring of all other spirituall miseries, insued by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
vpon vs, which now in haste I will runne ouer as men are
wont to drinck a medicine with as litle stay or reflexion as may

            <p>After assurance, stabilitie, and vnion in beleef, the next greatest
spiritual benedictions that can be expected of any doctryn,<note place="margin">VVhat effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue nevv re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath vvrought.</note> are the
good effects of vertue which it woorketh in mens myndes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as it was foretold by Esay the prophet, that Christes doctrine,
should so alter mens conditions and natures, that such as were most

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, her Maiestie at this day had had a moste florishing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, England had had her Maiestie at this day by all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

               </gap>
the principall cause of her graces not marying is to be presumed
to haue proceeded of the different Religion of forrayne Princes,
who desired the same on the on side: and on the other, the inequaliti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
of blood in her owne subiectes, for such aduaunceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
this great resolution of her Maiestie, to the onlie loue of sole

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifiable, seing that
among Catholiques where such professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is more praised and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
they vse sometymes to draw out euen vowed Nunnes from their
Cloisters to mariadge, for so weightie a cause, as is the sauing of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14532:8"/>
in so great a crown as England is known to be. And among
protestants virginitie is not of that necessitie or merit, as for it to incurr
so great inconueniences, notwithstanding the base and seruile flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
of this crowching Knight, who casteth in now and then the
memorie of a Mayden Queen, without respecting the deadly wound
which his countrie receiueth thereby.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</note> of this had followed the sure establishment of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of this Imperiall crown in the blood and race of the vnited
Royall Howses of York and Lancaster, and of the lyne of the Noble
King Henry the seuenth, which lyne being now to end with her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
in the direct discent, is lyke to bring great dangers to the realme.
For albeit there want not of collateral branches, yet their causes are
otherwise so implicated for diuerse respects, but espetiallie by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of religion (which had neuer happened if the change had not
byn made) as no man can tell what wilbe the end, and most men do
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eare extreme calamities therby.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, if religion in England had not byn changed, we had had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
no breach with Rome,<note place="margin">Vnion vvith Rome &amp; see Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</note> nor consequently had the excommunication
followed, whereof so great noise hath byn made in the world abroad,
and so great trouble at home. And what the vnion and frendshipp
of the Bishop of Rome may importe, euen as a temporall Prince, the
effects shewed of late in Fraunce, where espetiallie by his indeuour
and authoritie matters haue byn compounded that seemed verie
hard and desperate before, not only between that King and his owne
subiectes, but also between that crown and Spayn and the states of
Flaunders, which without such an arbiter and vmpyre would verie
hardly, haue euer byn accommodated.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, England had continued in her old ancient amitie and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
moste honorable with Spayn and Burg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and consequently had auoyded all these long and costly
warres, which by that breach we haue byn inforced to manteyne with
losse of so many worthie men, and expence of so great treasure, as
easelie maie be imagined, and the quarell not yet ended.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, so great and bloody warres and tumultes in Christian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
kingdomes round about vs,<note place="margin">VVarres abroad.</note> had neuer happened, as before in part
hath byn declared; and all the world doth impute the principal causes
and motions therof, vnto the diuersitie of religion in England.</p>
            <p>And lastly, most dolefull alterations in our own countrie had byn <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
auoyded,<note place="margin">Damages receaued at home.</note> as the depriuation in one day of all the sacred order of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14532:9"/>
would not subscribe to this infortunate change of religion, wroong out
in Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as all men know, by the oddes only of one or two voices
of lay men. The disgrace and abasing of so many noble houses, with
ouerthrow of others, wherof let Norfolk, Arundel, Northumberland,
Oxford, VVestmerland and Dacres giue testimonie. For of the rest
I will not make mention, seing perhaps themselues would be loth I
should, all which had passed otherwise by probabilitie, if religion had
not byn altered. The continual and intollerable affliction also of so
many honorable and worshipfull Gentlemen, had neuer happened,
for perseuering in their fathers fayth, wherto our country was first
conuerted from infidelitie, without any other offence obiected or to
be proued agaynste them, but only refusing to accommodate themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
to this change.<note place="margin">Recusantes.</note> The torturing, hanging, and quartering, of aboue

and youthes of rare witt, learning, and other partes, which
other Common wealthes would highly haue esteemed, and so would
ours too in tymes past, and will agayne in tyme to come, when these
blastes shall once be ouerblown.</p>
            <p>All these inconueniences and calamities had bin auoyded, or the
moste of them, if change of Religion in England had not byn
made; so that the innumerable benedictions, which this poore man
would needs threap vpon vs, by the change, do come to be in effect
these that follow.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">The so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of all that hath byn saide.</note> in Spiritual affayrs to haue no certaynty of Religion at all, as
hath bin proued; no stay, no foundation, no rule, but only euery mans
own priuate iudgment, and fansie, wrangling and iangling without
end, and without iudge or meanes to make an end: Nouelties without
number, and liberty of lyf without feare or force of Ecclesiasticall
disciplyne to restrayn it. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in temporall matters the blessings are
such as haue bin discouered; our Realme deuided and shiuered in a
thowsand peeces; our Princess olde, without children, or hope of any,
our Crown without Succession, our olde frends and allyes made our
enemies, our new frends vncertayn, our own flesh and countrymen
most pitifully deuided within their own bowels, and most miserably
tossed and turmoyled both abroad and at home: abroad and in
other countries, with Prisons, Yrons, Chaynes, Gallyes, and other
Afflictions, euen to Death it self; for being Protestants, Pirats, Spies,
Practisers, or other such imputations incident to enemyes. At home
afflicted with no less persecutions of our own Magistrates for being
Catholiques, or deemed to be such. So as I would fayn know, who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14532:9"/>
are they in our <hi>litle Iland</hi> that feel these <hi>innumerable benifits and blessings
by change of Religion,</hi> which this gentleman talketh of, seeing there are
very few either of one Religion or other, that taste not of the miseries
wherof I haue spoken, either in themselues, their frends, children,
seruants, kinsefolks, goodes, honours, or otherwise, and most of all
the Realm and Commonwealth it self.</p>
            <p>It may be Sir Francis sitteth easier then other men, hauing gotten
som fat morsel to feed on, by this change, yet ought he to haue some
sens and feeling also of other mens greefs, or at least-wise so much wit
as not to put himself to sing in publique, when so many thowsands of
other men do weep and complayn. And so much of his blessings.</p>

For this cause I am moued to make less scruple in that behalf

vntruthes, properly called lyes (for that they are wilfull) are set
downe by him in the woords alleadged, and known to be such to very
children and nouices in the Catholique Religion.</p>
            <p>The first, that it is holden for heresy, or euer was, to read vpon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

euen in vulgar tongues it is permitted to infinite lay people in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
countryes, by lycence of the ordinary, as all men know, and
it can not be denied.</p>
            <p>The otherly is, <hi>that for this fault only men were called before the Romish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Cleargie in England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vntruth.</note> 
               <hi>and brandeled to the slaughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These I say are apparent fictions; let the Knight defend his honor
in auowing them. It remaineth only to me to lay downe what the
Catholique Church did ordayne in this behalf, and what reasons she
might haue to restrayne some of this mans <hi>dim</hi> and <hi>glimmering</hi> people
from reading at their pleasure, vpon vulgar B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bles without lycence,
or without the spectacles of competent learning and vnderstanding
requisit for to profitt thereby; &amp; how far this prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church
streched, and whether this may iustly be accompted <hi>bloody and sauage
proceedings</hi> or rather prudent and prouident circumspection for simple
mens safty.</p>
            <p>First then, most certayn it is, that no man or woman, was euer
forbidden<note place="margin">Hovv rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures vvas forbidden &amp; vvhie.</note> to read any parte of the holy Scriptures in any of the three
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14532:11"/>
learned languages, wherin they were written, to witt Hebrew, Greek,
and Latin. And secondly, the restraynt that was made of vulgar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,
as French, Duch, English and the lyke, was only that no
such translation, should be admitted or vsed, except it were first exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by order of the Bishop, &amp; Ordinary to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were well and truly translated or no. And then such men and
women of the laity were permitted to vse the sayd translation appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
as should haue lycence of the sayd Ordinary, and be thought fit
and able to profit, and not to take hurt or hinderance therby; others
had the same in effect and substans deliuered vnto them by sermons,
bookes, and other means.</p>
            <p>This was the order; let indifferent men iudge and determine what
cruelty or mercy, impiety or piety, might be herein. For first, no man
will deny but if the translator did not put downe truly and sincerely
the wordes of Scriptures in his vulgar translation, then the simple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that cannot discerne, should take mans word for Gods word,
which were great inconuenience, and for this cause only (if none other
were) most necessary was it, that some order should be set downe for
examining of translations, whereby might be distinguished whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God
and when man speaketh in the Scriptures. And seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly though it were
certayn that the words of Scripture were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et downe truly in vulgar
translations, yet if the same reader by ignorance did take out of the
true woords a fals sence; then sucked he poyson in steed of wholesom
doctrine.<note place="margin">Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> If then in a fayr and pleasant garden, there should be this
danger, not only that one hearb taken for another might indaunger

            <p>In King Henries tyme when Tindal had translated and printed

in that tyme to deuulge such Bibles as were sent, especially in the

and to conuey the bookes more safty, she vsed to bynde them in strings
vnder her aparrell, and so to pass them into the courte: but her neerest

But this other <hi>scripturian</hi> profited so wel, as in the fifth yeare of

time, for denying Christe to haue taken flesh of the Virgin Marie.
Who when she was codemned to dye, spake very scornfully to the

her: &amp; now (for sooth) you wil needs burne me for a peece of fleshe, &amp; in the end you
will come to beleeue this also, when you haue red the scriptures and vnderstand

            <p>And thus much may serue for the repelling those <hi>clowds, mists,</hi> and

for that all coblers do not clowt Scriptures in our commonwealth.
But let vs see now what positions and principles he sayth we haue for
our direction amiddest this darknesse.</p>
            <p>In these darke and clowdy dayes <hi>(sayth he)</hi> least the sun-shine of knowledge
should dispers the mists of ignorance, and giue light to the dimm of sight, this posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was set down for their maxime or rule in fallible;<note place="margin">The first forged posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that ignorance is the mother
of deuotion, and that the sacred woord of God, which was giuen to be a lantern to
all our feet, and a light to our steps, was forbidden to the lay sorte (for so they called
them) as matter vnfit for them to looke into, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How manifest a falshood it is that reading of Scriptures is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to all laie men, is sufficiently shewed by that which goeth before;
for in any of the three learned tongues, any laie man or woman may
read them at their pleasure, &amp; in vulgar tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slations also such as haue
lycence. And I think Sir Frauncis will not deny, that many of the lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

so piteouslie or rather hipocritically, <hi>that the sacred worde of God which
was giuen to be a lantern to our feet, &amp;c.</hi> was forbidden to the laye sorte?
Again what malepart ignorance is it in him to scoff (as he doth) at
the worde <hi>laye sorte,</hi> with this parenthesis <hi>(for so they called them)</hi> as
though the Catholiques of late dayes had made this distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

<hi>ignorance to be the mother of deuotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Catholiques did hold that <hi>ignorance were the mother of deuotion,</hi>
then might they hope to see Sir Francis Hastings a deuout knight in
time, for that he is ignorant as euer lightly tooke pen in hand to
write. But we deny this maxime or infallible rule to be ours (Sir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis)
and do say that it is your calumniation only, and that among vs it

               <note place="margin">Maxime.</note> And for you to proue it a maxime you

It may be you haue heard it obiected by some idle or ignorant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

And what he holdeth we all hold; which were a hard thing to finde

And if you will haue also a more auncient author, read S. Augustin
<hi>lib. de Spiritu &amp; anima, ca. 50.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let vs see what S. Thomas sayth, first he sheweth how deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is a spetiall act of religion,<note place="margin">VVhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion is, &amp; vvhence it proceedeth.</note> importing nothing els, but a deuowing of
a mannes hart to the pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt seruice of almightie God. And secondly he
sheweth that the intrinsecal immediate cause of deuotion in vs, is
contemplation and meditation of Gods benefits, and of our owne
defects, according to the saying of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note> 
               <hi>in meditatione mea exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descet

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14532:13"/>
And thirdly he declareth by diuers arguments that the proper effect of
deuotion is gladnes and hilaritie of mynde. So that heer ignorance
entereth neither for mother, nor daughter, nor grandmother, nor sister
of deuotion but rather the contrarie, deuotion proceedeth of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
gotten by meditation, both of Gods perfections and of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,

            <p>VVhen they had thus setled this blinde cours <hi>(saieth our knight)</hi> to keepe the

godlinesse.</p>
            <p>In setting downe of this forged position, there is some subtlety ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with impudencie. For first in the former parte, where he sayth
we hold, <hi>that it is not for lay men to medle with religion,</hi> he subtely leaueth
doubtful this worde <hi>(medle)</hi> either to signifie that lay men must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
or defyne matters of religion, or els not to medle or care for
them at all. In the former sence we graunt, that in Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies of fayth are to be treated, Priests and Clergy-men
haue only authority to define and determine:<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> for that S. Paule
sayth that they are apointed by the holy Ghoste to gouern the church,
though before they come to determine, they do help themselues also
by the learning of lay men, and take their iudgement when they may
giue light, as in all Counsels is seen. But in the second sence it is moste
impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he inferreth, <hi>that hereby we would make lay me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> secure &amp; carele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of God, &amp; all godlinesse.</hi> For how doth it follow? The Queen of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

               </gap>ut going once a year, and a far greater that men of the grossest sinnes

               </gap>re made Saints among vs: and finally nothing els is heer but iests and
lyes.</p>
            <p>Secondly I put Sir knight in mynde, that talking of lay men, S.
Thomas example (that was a Priest and head of Priests) was not to his
purpose. Thirdly moste grosly and ignorantly he erreth in the tymes;
for that S. Thomas his death and canonization was in King Henry
the second and not the thirds, as fondly he affirmeth: but aboue thirty
years before king Henry the third was borne. Fourthly that this poore
man maketh an vnequal match to fight with Saints, and will rest in
the end with a broken head.</p>
            <p>And finally that he sayth S. Thomas his treasons to his prince were
apparent &amp; manifest, is a manifest slaunder. For there is nothing in all
the whole discourse of his controuersie with King Henrie the second,
that sauoureth of treason, or that impugned any one law of the realm
then in vre. For that the recourse he made to Rome, was lawfull at
that day, as it is now in any other Catholique country. The contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14532:15"/>
was only about the liberty of the English Church, which the
king sought to abridge, and the other as primate to defend Nor did
the king or his officers chardge him with treasons, nor could they by
any shew of Iustice. For if in euery contention or dissention that a
spiritual subiect, or Ecclesiastical Prelate may haue with his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
prince, the subiect shalbe condemned of treason (according to
this seruile censure of Protestantes, that to flatter princes make them
absolute lordes both of body and sowl) then Iohn Baptist also must
be accompted a traytour, that dealt so peremptorily with his king
Herod, that was his liege Lorde in temporal affayres. Or if you will
haue examples of Christian princes, S. Ambrose must be a traytor,
first for resisting openly his Lord and king Valentinian the yonger, &amp;
then for handling so hardly the elder Theodosius Emperour,<note place="margin">Theodor. lib. 4. c 6. &amp; lib. 5. c. 17. &amp; deinceps.</note> in Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,
as he shut him out of the church, and made him goe home agayne
with shame and do penance. S. Hilarius also, &amp; S Athanasius shalbe
traitors,<note place="margin">Zozom. lib. 8 fere per to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> for their contentions with Constantius their lawull Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and temporall Lord, who b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nished them from their Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rikes.
And the former of the two wrote two vehement bookes &amp;
inuectiues, agaynst the sayd Emperour, and yet no man euer accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him a traytor for the same, but rather a great Saint, for his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
libertie and constancie. S. Chrysostome in lyke manner shalbe
condemned for a great traytor,<note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 6. c. 16.</note> who had greater contentions with his
temporal Lordes,<note place="margin">Zozom. lib. 8. c. 17.</note> Arcadius, and Honorius, Christian Emperours, and
with their wyues, Theodosia, and Eudoxia, then euer S. Thomas had
with king Henry the second.<note place="margin">Niceph. l. 14 c. 43.</note> For he pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ached agaynst them publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely,
with great vehemencie, and thundred out excomunication
agaynst them, and was twyce banished and driuen out of his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike
by their disfauor, and died in exile. And yet was he neuer called
or accompted a traytor, but a singuler holy man; and Theodosius the
yonger son of Arcadius, brought his body, with great solemnitie,
honour, and reuerence, into Constantinople, and wept most bitterly
for the sinnes of his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in persecuting so blessed a man. And as the
story sayth,<note place="margin">Math. Paris.</note> 
               <hi>made prayer to him now dead for pardon of his fathers sinnes.</hi> As
did also often our king Henry the sonne, for the offence of his father
in being some cause of the death of this iust man, his pastor and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
father.</p>
            <p>Wel then to conclude this matter, treason there was none, nor
could be in this contention of S. Thomas agaynst king Henry; for it
was donn with all due respect of the Archbil hopes parte, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the lawes ecclesiastical, both of churche &amp; realm. And as for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14532:15"/>
the mannes behaueour and actions in the rest of his lyf, if we beleeue
three or foure historiographers together,<note place="margin">Vide apud Lippoman, &amp; Surium Mense De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb.</note> of greate credit and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

the world knoweth. His canonization was presently vpon his death
by diligent inquiry of all factes and circumstances, and by vniuersal
applause of all christendom. King Henry the second excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the murder, admitted his canonization, builded his shryne and
sepulcher, adorned the same with greate giftes, came thither in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

of doctrine, if he were capable of it, and most true, to witt, that the
meaner the substitute is, that is obeyed in the name and place of any

the sayd substitute to obey him, but only for loue, respect, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,

            <p>Thus writeh our knight if you will beleeue him, but hauing taken

I presume that the discree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he next life to be remitted. Neither can the Pope pardon the guilt of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14532:17"/>
sinne it self by any other way then by the means of the Sacrament of
confession, and absolution (which Sacrament hath his force of the
blood of Christe) as euerie ordinarie Priest authorised to heare confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
may do the like.</p>
            <p>And so thirdly, it is great ignorance in our knight if not malice, to
ioine tog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther (as he doth) the Popes pardon and the absolution of his
holy Priests, which haue great difference in this matter; for that the
pardon stretcheth not to remit sinne it self (as hath bin said) but only
the temporal paines depending of sinne, after it is remitted: but priests
absolution in the Sacrament of confession is sufficient to remitt any
sinne,<note place="margin">Ioan. 20.</note> if the penitent be contrite, according to comission giuen by
Christe, <hi>quorum remiseritis peccata remittuntur eis, &amp; quorum retinueritis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenta
sunt,</hi> whose sinnes ye forgiue shalbe forgiuen, and whose sinnes
you shall retaine shalbe reteined. So then absolution is a different
matter from indulgence &amp; pardon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the transgressions against the decrees and ordinance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

Synagogue) be more hardly forgiuen among vs, then greater sinnes
and those namely that be immediatly comitted against God himself
is a shameles slaunder, and neuer taught by any Catholique man i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
the world, and so vnworthy to be further refuted.</p>
            <p>Now then he hauing set down these four absurd grounds of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in our name, feigned by himself, and accompanied with so many o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther
lies and falshoods, as you haue heard: you shall see how he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his conclusion,<note place="margin">A fonde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> and triumpheth as though he had donn somwhat

            <p>Thus haue you the blind cours they sought to hreed vs in, by debarring vs the

            <p>This conclusion to him that hath red the former foolish positions

goeth by pardons with vs, and that pardons may be had for mony, he

to heauen: &amp; so he marueileth how these thinges can stand together.</p>
            <p>To which I might answer, that it seemeth as easy to teach a beare to
play vpon a taber, as to learn Sir Francis to be a good deuine, and that
I would more easily take vpon me to make a camel to goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
any needles eye (in the sence that Christe spake it) or any rich
man in the world to enter into heuen (if he would follow my counsel)
then to frame Sir Francis old head to vnderstand the depth of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
doctrine. And therefore amiddest his doubts, I leaue him to his
ministers, except he will resolue to be a catholique and goe to confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
for then his ghostly father, by the penance he may chaunce to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

nor yet by money among vs. And that there is another more
streight needles eye for him to enter (seeing he is rich) then the buying
of pardons, if he will goe to heauen after the catholique manner; to
witt, by contrition, confession, and satisfaction, which God graunt
him to do, for otherwise he will neuer come there, seeing that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and easie cart way of only fayth, is far different from the needles
eye and narow path that Christe speaketh of.</p>

against Catholiques.</p>
            <p>First then touching perils past by her Maiestie, during the reign of
Qu. Marie, this gentleman writeth thus in recital of the same.</p>
            <p>I hasten to put you in minde of our most blessed and happie delliuerance out of this
spirituall pit and thraldom of popery and superstition, by ladie Queen Elizabeth, as
the instrument: whose perill and danger before she came to that abilitie to performe
this holy woorke among vs, I may not pass ouer; for by Gods goodnesse only and who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
she was preserued, her life being malitiously and with great cunning shot at, by
the Romish clergie, then in place of credit. For Gardener that most prowd and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
monster, left no corner of his wit vnsought (being wise enough to woorke mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief)
but set all his skil and cunning awoorke to shorten her dayes, and to preuent
her by bloody slaughter of her sacred person, from euer being our Queen: and no
reach of man can yeeld me a reason of her doliuerance, but the mighty God of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which woords you may see how our poet to make the succes
of his feigned comedy more wonderfull and plausible, frameth strange

mayn perils auoyded without any means humane at all; neither is
there any reason able to be rendred to him of his riddle as himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
but I shall indeuoure to solue both the one and the other
and that without any miracle, by humane reason only if Sir Francis
can vnderstand it, and now I begin.</p>
            <p>That the state of lady Elizabeth now our Souereign Queen,<note place="margin">The estate of Lady Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth in Q. Maries tyme.</note> was
subiect to diuers suspitions and dangers during the reign of her sister
Queen Marie, no man of discretion in matter of state will deny, or can
greatly merueil at; for she being the next heir to the crown, and her
sister hauing no issue, nor any great probability euer to haue: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
being presumed by many, to be inclined to a different reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
though she shewed it not, &amp; that all the disconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of that state
depended of her, and made their recours vnto her as to their rising sun
&amp; future hope; no marueil though she was bad in ielousie, especially
seeing the often and perilous attemptes of VVyate, Courtney, the
Carews, Cobham, Throgmorton and the like, did seem to leane also
that way (for I will enter no further to discus those affaires) and so did
hold both the Queen and state in suspence and care. VVhich cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
what daungers they are wont to bring to future preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14532:18"/>
diuers examples vnder our former kings, and lastly that of the
Queen of Scots in our days, may easily teach vs.</p>
            <p>But that the life and blood of her grace at that day, should be so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
&amp; malitiously sought after, by so many &amp; so pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as this knight heer and in other places of his booke, doth affirm,
and would haue beleeued, to witt, by Bishop Gardener then Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor,
by B. Bonner, D. Story, and al the Catholique clergy by name:
and furthermore by the King of Spayne himself &amp; by all Spanyards;
by the Queen also then in gouernment, &amp; consequently by her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
and nobility with her, and by all catholiques together, who had
power at that day to doe as they thought best, and no impediment ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at home or from abroad (that I know) to let them in their

               </gap>esignments, and yet all this notwithstanding, that nothing in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire
so much desired should be effectuated; this passeth indeed (if it
were true) all rule of reason, and might set Cicero to schoole again,
who teacheth in his thetoriques, for an euident for me of argument,
that, <hi>qui potuit facere &amp; voluit, fecit.</hi> he that both would and could doe
a thing must needs be presumed to haue donn it. VVhich yet, in this
our case holdeth not, as it seemeth, for that our knight affirming that
the parties aforenamed would haue made away the Lady Elizabeth,
and I assuring that they could; yet is it euident that she was not, and

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:14532:19"/>
as often his neerest about him at that day haue reported since. And
namely the Duke of Feria while he was aliue, who being then but
Count and sent Embassador from the king (then lying in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)
to visit Queen Marie, had such earnest and spetiall charge
to visit and comfort the L. Princesse Elizabeth immediatly after his
Embassage to the Queen, that all of the court of England merueiled
at it and some perhaps did not greatly like of it, and in very deed the
yong lady was so extraordinarily fauored, and affected by his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Maiestie, and all his nobility present with him in England, as it
is most base &amp; barberous ingratitude in this sicophant to deny it now,
and monstrous inciuility to accuse them of cruelty in this behalf, their
affections being so notoriously known to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary in those times,
and this was one cause and perhaps not the least of her graces
safety.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, was the generall hope that moste men had of her graces
being a Catholique, as then she bore herself both in woorde &amp; deed,
hearing two Masses among other things euery day, one for the quick,
and the other for the dead, and receiuing no seruant lightly into her
hows or seruice, nor retaining any towards her, but with this expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

condition, and many other signes and arguments that way.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, was there a great reason of state, that stood mightely also
for her graces safety at that tyme, in that if she had fayled, the next
pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der seemed the Queen of Scots, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maried to the Dolphin
and heir of France; who by this means might haue come to be king
of France, England, and Scotland together, which thing many Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-men
but more Spanish, could not abyde to hear of.</p>
            <p>Now then, let our <hi>miracle-maker</hi> tel me, whether these be no reasons,
<hi>and whether no reach of man can yeeld him any reason of her graces deliuerance.</hi>
If his reach and insight in matters of state be no greater then this, it is
no merueil though he be not of her Maiesties counsell, though he
flatter neuer so deeply for it, and thus much may be said of her graces
dangers in Queen Maries tyme. Let vs see now what hath happened
since. This notable calumniator beginneth thus.</p>

cleer and manifest reasons and treatises, that I mean not to stand at this

gentleman is, in matter of dispute: whose ridiculous proposition in this

            <p>And no doubt, but if such a knight had liued in Nero or Caligula

any malice of man could deuise: all the whole Catholique body of
England enforced to sweare against him, and his authoritie by name,

othe was offered and repeated again and again to all such and as often

so vniuersal and exorbitant, as infinite people are interessed and

English Catholiques are but very tryfles and triuial things, that dayly
happen in moste quiet &amp; peaceable commonwealthes, where no man
is afflicted by the state at all. But that infinite greater and more hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
stirres and breaches haue not bin raysed within the space of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeares, where so deadly differences in religion, and so continual
persecution against so great a body haue bin in vre; this I say (as I
sayd before) that to men of iudgement and indifferencie, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

canonization of the patience, magnanimitie, and fidelity of
English Catholiques; and her Maiestie and the realme are happy
that they haue such subiects. And if they will not beleue me, let
them but turn the leaf a litle against protestants, puritans, and other
new sectaries, and restrain them from their desires, and pinch them
with persecution, but a quarter of that they haue donn to Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,

at certain turnings many blowes and bastinadoes may be giuen him
(as in parte there hath bin I suppose to this man, by conuincing his
falshoods, raylings and calnmniations) yet is it a wearisom exercise

            <p>The recusants <hi>(sayth he)</hi> cannot professe more loyalty and loue to the Queen

               </gap>ces,
neuer rested vntil they had brought in the Spanyard, aud matched him
with Queen Marie, by which they betrayed God, her, and the whole realme.</p>
            <p>It seemeth that this poore seely man is either very ignorant in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of our own realm,<note place="margin">Of Bishop Gardeners fall.</note> or very badly bent to tel manifest vntruthes.
For who knoweth not, that albeit Bishop Gardener at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of king Henryes defection from the church of Rome, being
born away with the stream of the tyme, and with some feare of the
kings violent proceeding, and not very full instructed perhaps in that
controuersie of the Supremacie (for that it was at the very first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to his Bishoprik after the fall of Cardinal VVolsey) shaken
also with the frailty of humane infirmity, he shronk with S. Peter,
and stepped somwhat asyde in that booke of his, <hi>de vera obedientia, &amp;c.</hi>
But yet how soon he did recall himself agayn, and condemned his
owne doing therin, and how much also he preuailed in secret with
the king himself in that poynt of doctrine, you shall hear afterward
by his own testimony. And as for king Edwards raigne, it is a flat
fable and fiction which our knight telleth vs, of Bishop Gardeners
following the sway also of that time: for it is well knowen, that he
being one of the cheifest among those sixteen counsellors that were
apoynted by king Henries testament, and earnest charge of mouth
at his last hower, to gouern his sonne and realme, during the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the yong king, with expresse commaundement also of the
dead king, that neither protector should be chosen, nor yet any
poynt of Luthers, Zwinglius, or Caluins religion brought in, Bishop
Gardener as a faithful counsellor striued what he could at the very
first entrance, to haue both these orders of king Henry obserued. But
ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouerbearing all, first a Protector within 40. howers after the
kings death, and then soone after an innouation also of religion, was
thrust vpon the realme, by violence of some that packed together for
their gaines, more then for deuotion: which Bishop Gardener seeing
and not able to resist, he spake his minde plainly touching religion, in
a sermon before the yong king and councell vpon Saint Peters day
(which was but fiue moneths after king Edwards raign) for which
sermon, he was sent to the tower the morning after, and lay there
prisoner all king Edwards time, and came not out, vntill Queen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14532:27"/>
at her first entrance into the tower of london whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she was Queen,
deliuered him and other catholique prisoners together,<note place="margin">Sto anno 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d 6.</note> and how then
doth our <hi>steel-brow-knight,</hi> write, that Bishop Gardener Hattered
both father and sonne, and neuer shewed himself in religion vntil
both of them were called to their last home, and Queen Marie entred
the crown: let some frend blush for him if he haue not shame to do
it himself.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is as great an vntruth and as grosse ignorance besydes, to
say,<note place="margin">About brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the Spaniard in Q. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries dayes.</note> as this man doth, <hi>that Bishop Gardener and his complices brought in
the Spaniard, and mached him in mariage with Queen Marie.</hi> For that euery
childe acquaynted with that state knoweth or may learne, that
Bishop Gardener was of the contrarie part or faction that fauored
yong Edward Courtney the Earle of deuonshire, and would haue
had him to Marie the Queen, whome Bishop Gardener had held
for his spiritual childe in the tower all king Edwardes tyme. And now
the matter was so far forward as the mariage was held for certayne,
but that the contrarie syde and especially the Lord Paget, partly by
the acquaintance and credit he had gotten with Charles the Emperor
in Flanders during king Edwards tyme, and partely for the ielosie he
had (perhappes) of B. Gardeners great affection to the Duke of Nort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humberland,
his greatest enemie, who in king Edwards reigne had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored
vtterly to disgrace him, they procured (I say) the said
Emperors most earnest and effectual letters to the Queen, about
her mariage with the Prince of Spayne, which they did so vrge to the
sayd Queen, and with so many argumentes against Courtney (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
that he was neither sound in body nor religion) as they got her
consent, and subscription to the sayd letters of the Emperor. And
then there was no further dealing to the contrary; for that Queen
Mary bore such exceeding loue and reuerence to the Emperor
Charles her Cosin, as she would not fayl in her word geuen to him
for all the world. VVherby we may imagin what a mortification
Bishop Gardener and all the rest of his side that fauored Courtney
did receaue by this change of the Queens will and purpose, and
therby also perceyue the folly and temerite of this rashe accuser, who
layeth to there charge the bringing in the Spaniard, which yet if they
had donne, or had byn cause of that greatest and most honorable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that for many ages hath byn in Christendom, and of greatest
consequence, if issue had followed therof; if this (I saie) bad byn so
(as it was not) why did they betray therin both God, the Queen, and
there countrie as this wise Censurer affirmeth, what grownds, what
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14532:27"/>
reason may there be aleaged of this triple treason? God receiued by
this mariage the strengthening of his true religon, the Queen got the
greatest noblest, and richest husband that was extant in Europe, our
countrie got many a thowsaud of Spanish treasure, without losse of
any as heerafter shal be shewed. And wherin then stood this great
offence?</p>

&amp;c. and the rest that followeth there. All which sacred scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
this learned religious knight sayth very peremptorily, that it
was most prophanely and blasphemously peruerted by the said
Bishop, and that to bloody purposes, which we shal now à litle
discusse.</p>
            <p>This famous sermon was preached, as I sayd before, at Paules
crosse,<note place="margin">The Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Bishop Gardener at Pauls Crosse.</note> after the mariage was celebrated between the King and the
Queen, who both were present at this speech of the Bishop nowe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
hygh Chancelor, and there prsent in like maner both Cardinal
Poole legate of the sea Apostolique, as also the Embassadors of the
Emperor, french King, and other Princes, and a marueylous great
learned and noble auditorie besydes, as euer perhaps was at any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in England before or after. The Chancelors discourse was, how
long they had runne astray, and byn in darknes of diuision and stryfe
among themselues, since first king Henry lefte the old troden path
of his ancestors, kinges and Queenes of England in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and brake from the vnion of the church of Rome, and of other
catholique kingdomes round about him, and that now it was time
to arise out of this sleep, and to looke about them.</p>
            <p>And in this discours and sermon, the Chancellor vttered two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
thinges among other, that greatly moued the whole auditory.</p>
            <p>The first was the hartie and humble accusation of himself for his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all, and consenting to King Henryes will in that booke <hi>de vera obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tia,</hi>
which he did vtter with so great vehemencie of spirit and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of teàres, as he could not goe forward, and was forced diuers
tymes to make some pawses; which in such an audience (especially of
strangers, also he being the cheefest person of the realme after the
prince, we may imagin what a temporal shame and confusion it was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14532:28"/>
vnto him, and how greatly it would moue the hearers and lookers on
to see him make such an accusation of himself willingly, of his owne
accord, without compulsion and with such earnestnes as he did. And
that there was no fiction or dissimulation in this act of his, the end
declared; for when he fell sick afterward, and drew neer vnto his
death, he desired that the passion of our Sauiour might be redde vnto
him; and when they came to the denial of Saynt Peter, and how
after Christe had looked back vpon him, he went out and wepte bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly;
the Bishop cried out and bid them stay there,<note place="margin">Bishop Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peutance at his death.</note> and see whether
his sweet Sauiour wold vouchsafe also to looke back vpon him, and
geue him some part of Saynt Peters teares, for (sayth he) <hi>negaui cum
Petro, extui cum Petro sed nondum fleui amare cum Petro,</hi> I haue denied
Christe with Peter (meaning that subscription to the supremacie of
king Henrie, I haue gone out with Peter (meaning the participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
that schisme, but yet I haue not wepte bitterly with Peter; so bitterly
as I should do, and by often repetition of those woordes, and asking
God sorgeuenes with cryes and syghes he intertayned himself vntill
great floodes of teares came downe vpon him, and so gaue vp the
ghost.</p>
            <p>The second notable poynt which the Bishop vttered in this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
was concerning king Henrie the eight his lord and mayster,
which moued the auditorie no lesse then the other. And this was
that the sayd king a litle before his death, had dealt with him verie
secretly and seriously,<note place="margin">K. Henrie the 8. incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to reconcile himselfe.</note> to haue sent him to a certayne dyat in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
vnder pretence to treat other matters, but in deed the cheef
poynt should be, to seeke out some honorable way and meanes (as
from himself, and not from the king) either by the Emperor, legat,
popes Nuntio, or other fit instrument, to reconcyle him agayne to
the church of Rome. And this the Bishop affirmed to be most true
vpon his oath and fidelitie to God and the world, and to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the sayd king his master dead, whome he shewed to loue so
tenderly and dearly, as he wepte most bitterly also in that place, for
that this holie motion had not taken the effect he desired, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the let therof to Gods seuere iudgmentes, and to the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
which the sayd king found of making that reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
his honour and reputation, which temporal honour he lamented
much that it was more regarded by the king and some that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled
him, then in so weightie a woork of eternall saluation ought
to haue bin.</p>
            <p>Thus then was the substance, and these were the circumstances of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14532:28"/>
that sermon. Let vs now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider whether the theam he tooke, <hi>iam, hora
est nos de somno surgere,</hi> were fit and to his purpose or no: or whether it
were prophanely &amp; blasphemously peruerted, as this wise gentleman
affirmeth, who taketh vpon him to censure the matter.</p>
            <p>First let it be considered, that if euer any man of our realm might
take vpon him to talk of a sleep or dream in matters of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth,
as a Counsellor, and of his own knowledge, Bishop Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener
might do it, which had seen such alterations both of religion
and temporalityes within our land, such chopping and chaunging,
such pulling down and setting vp, as he might fitly call the tyme a
time of sleep or dream. For as in a sleep things are represented to a
man confusedly, and out of hand they passe away, and contrarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
come in their place, so had Bishop Gardener seen in
the publique affaires of the realme, no lesse alterations of comicall
and tragical acts, after he came to be a councellor.</p>
            <p>For first he had seen his own king and maister, king Henry the
eight, so earnest in the defence of the catholique faith,<note place="margin">The sleepe and dreame noted by B. Gardener in England.</note> &amp; of the sea of
Rome in perticuler, as he wrote a booke in defence therof, though
he were disswaded by some of his counsell to do it, for reason of state.
And after that again being to send this very man, Gardener (then his
secretarie) to Rome for his Embassador, about soliciting of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce
between himself and Queen Catherine, he commanded him
to tel the Pope and Colledge of Cardinales, that whatsoeuer they
determined in that matter, he would accept it with all indifferencie,
and euer be a most obedient childe of the Romane churche. And this
commission he gaue him in the presence of Cardinal VVolsey, and
yet soone after he saw the same king so chaunged, for the affection he
bare to an other partie, as he brake with the Pope and churche of
Rome, and pulled down the sayd Cardinal, and put to death two of
the men that he esteemed most for vertue and learning of all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme,
or of any other forrain kingdome of Christendom, and whom
he had loued before exceedingly, to wit, Doctor Fisher Bishop of
Rochester, and Sir Thomas More Chancelor.</p>
            <p>Again, Gardener had seen the same king wax weary soone after of
the party, for whose loue he had first begun to make all those stirres,
and to put her to death openly, and yet to continew his former brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and to run from one difficulty to an other, and from one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience
to an other, &amp; neuer to stop the fountain from whence
all this vnquietnes came. He had seen him also passe from on wife to
another, to the number of six, dismissing some and putting others to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14532:29"/>
death, according to the affection or disaffection which he bare to
each of them for the time. He had seen him make diuers and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
actes of parlament,<note place="margin">Seem. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r. 25. cap. 22. &amp; an<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 28. cap. 7. &amp; 17.</note> in preiudice or preferment of his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
now for their legitimation and inheritance, now for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as by the statutes themselues yet extant in print, is euident to the
world. And from the liking or disliking of his said wiues, he passed
also to the liking or suspition of his own kinred, subiects, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds: of which he pulled downe so many, as by the stories may
be seen. And Bishop Gardener was wont to say of him (that knew
him ful well) that after he once left to loue that person, which by
Gods law and mannes he was bound to loue aboue all others (to wit,
his first wife and Queen) he neuer loued any person har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
afterwards.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, he had seen the poore king so combered, and troobled
about matters of religion,<note place="margin">K. Henries perplexitie about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> as was pitiful to behold. For that on the
one side the point of his spiritual Supremacy taken vp in his chole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
against the Pope, seemed to touch his honor so neare, as he might not
shew to yeeld any one iote therin: and consequently he was fain to
put to death all such Catholiques as denyed the same, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he both loued and highly esteemed them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and on the other side,
his iudgement and conscience in matters of the Catholique truthe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the protestants and all new sectaries, conuinced his conscience
and vnderstanding, as he cleerly vttered in the statute of six articles
which iudgement also enforced him to burne as many of that fide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
were conuicted.</p>
            <p>And finally being wearied towards his later end, with these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
of conscience and honor, iudgement and passion, he conferre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with Bishop Gardener as you haue heard, about the mayn remedy and
only sure redresse of all, which was his returning to the vnion of the
Romane churche, and the rest of Christendome.</p>
            <p>And besides all this, Bishop Gardener had seen the same afflicted
king, brought to such streights and doubts in his later howers of life,
about the weightiest affaires that he had in this world, as he could
not tell what to determine ordayne or establish, for the securitie of
his owne children, espe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ially of his only sonne prince Edward, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
had but nyne yeares yet of age and for that cause was the father<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>siue about him. For first he was afeard to leaue any
protector vnto him, remembring the eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of king Edward the four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
his children vnder their vncle protector the Duke of Glocester. And
secondly, he was as greatly afeard and afflicted also to think, least
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14532:29"/>
after his death the perilous waues and fluddes of heresies should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vpon him, by the very same gate that hymself had opened.</p>
            <p>VVhetfore both these poyntes he forbad expresly, and appoynted
for execution therof sixteen gouernours, as I haue sayd, with equal
authoritie, all in his opinion (or the far greater parte) very catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.
But he was no sooner dead, but all these orders of his were
ouerthrowen, and a protector made, the third day after the kinges
death, and sone after religion changed, and the law of six articles abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
and as litle regard had to king Henries will and ordinances,
as if he had neuer byn king of this realme, or mayster to the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
And among other these changes, was displaced Gardener him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
one of the cheef of those sixteen appoynted for gouernours by
king Henry, and not only thrust from all authoritie, but sent also to
the tower of London prisoner, as before I haue shewed; and other
Catholique Lordes remoued in lyke manner from the Councel, for
lyke endes and purposes.</p>
            <p>Then began a new world of making new Lordes,<note place="margin">The stirres in king Edvvardes dayes.</note> new Earles, new
Marqueses, &amp; new Dukes, &amp; in deuiding great states offices &amp; dignites
in good felowship amonge themselues, &amp; all in the name of the childe
king (though he were not yet crowned, nor three weekes past
synce his fathers death) New men also were called out of Germany,
to wit (Peter Martir and Martin Bucer two apostated friars with
their wenches) that had been Nunnes who must come to teache a
new religion in England; but with expresse condition to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to reache that sect &amp; opinion, either of Luther, Swinglius, or Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,
or other that should be determined and agreed vpon by the
Parlament then in gathering together; and so they were contented,
and with that condition they were sent the one to Oxford, and the
other to Cambrige. Then was the new English forme of seruice
drawen out in hast by certayne of the Protectors chaplayns in Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
place in London, not fully agreeing to any of the Captaynes
doctrine aforesaid, but somewhat mingled of them all and much also
of the Catholique ryte and forme, all which was approued soone
after for apostolical and established by the lay part of the Parlament,
(for the cleargie reclaymed) and all men inforced to sweate vnto it,
and so for the old religion receaued by the vniuersal church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in England for aboue a thousand years, and confirmed by so
many miracles at the beginning, as S. Bede and other ancient authors
do affirme, and allowed by the consent of all our learned English for
so many ages, now was there a new religion deuised in corners &amp; set
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14532:30"/>
vp by certayne obscure and hungrie fellowes in hast, within the space
of two monethes, and authorized by a parlament of vnlearned lay
men to be the rule of our saluation.</p>
            <p>But in the meane space the Duke of Somerset now head of this
church (for that the childe king was at play &amp; could think nothing
of it) attended principally to his temporall aduancement &amp; to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
good old land, and caused his seruantes to set forward the new
religion, without troobling him therin, saying that all should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
and approued afterward by the authoritie of the yong king,
as trew head of the Church, and so it was.</p>
            <p>Then followed great tumultes and rebellious in the realme, as also
iarring and falling out of the great protestant Councellors among
themselues. The protector first cut of the head of his brother the
<hi>Admiral,</hi> and then the Earle of <hi>VVarwicke</hi> cut of the head of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
and diuers of his frendes, and made himself duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
and then plotted with the duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> to cut of all king
Henries children, and to bring in Suffolkes daughter and Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlandes
sonne, as they did. For which soone after both their
heades were cut of also by Queen Marie, and Catholique religion
was restored agayne to the state wherin first it was, when king Henry
her father began this tragedie, and first put all out of ioynt.</p>
            <p>Thus passed the matter briefly, and all this Bishop <hi>Gardener</hi> had
seen and passed through, and had plaied his parte in diuers actes, and
pageantes, to wit, as an actor in the beginnyng and as a patient
after, as hath byn shewed. And being now restored to his old estate
agayne, and more ouer made Chancelour of the realme, and looking
back vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dream past, had he not (trow you) iust cause to preache,

we haue slumbered these twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty yeares and more, in suche varietie of

whether this theame &amp; parable were fitly chosen and wel applied by

do testifie, which is nothing els, but a rehersal of their contradictions
and difficulties, and himself discusseth the matter very largely in

He is a chosen vessel vnto me, and I will shew him how great
matters he must suffer for my name, and so he did afterward, laying
so many contradictions and tribulations vpon him, from all handes,
as the poore man could not tell which way to turne him: <hi>vt taederet

               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.</note> that he was wearie euen of his lyf: for that on one syde

            <p>The holy martir of Christe Saint Iustine, that liued before Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,
euen in the first feruor of persecution against good Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,
vseth an argument for their defence in life and manners (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their many slaunders raised against them) which seemeth to
me may be vsed also fitly in this defence of Iesuites: his words be
these.</p>
            <p>VVhen I was a scholer <hi>(sayth he)</hi> in Plato his schoole,<note place="margin">Iustinus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polog. prima.</note> and delighted with
that doctrine, and heard that Christians were accused euerie where of euil lyfe, &amp;
yet saw otherwise that they went to dye willingly and liued poorly, aud feared not
those thinges which to other men are most horrible; I began to think with my
self, that is was impossible for those men to be vitious and geuen to pleasures of
the world, for then would they be loth to dye, and to be depriued of their saied
pleasures.</p>
            <p>Thus argued he, and we may do the lyke of Iesuites now adayes,
of whome we haue seen before, how they professe voluntarie pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
contempte of the world, incapacitie of earthlie promotions, great
labors of studies and other such painful exercises, we read also in
their peculier rules that their chastitie <hi>must imitate the puritie of Angels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Part. 6. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. cap. 1.</note>
               <hi>both in mynde and body,</hi> and as for wordly comodities, <hi>that they must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi>
(those are the very woords of their rule and institute) <hi>altogether and
not in parte from all these thinges which the world doth loue and esteeme (as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi>

               <hi>promotions, riches, pleasures and the lyke) and embrace and desyre with
all their forces the thinges which Iesus their mayster esteemed and loued for our
examples, as contempt, pouertie, persecution and affliction, shewing by this
liuerye of his that they are his true seruantes and followers.</hi> And furthermore
we heare for confirmation of this, &amp; partly also do see their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
sufferinges tortures &amp; martirdomes in the Indies, in Ethiopia, in

these men are dilighted with vitious lyfe, which make so litle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of lyfe, and do handle so roughlie their lyfe in this world.</p>
            <p>An other obiection also was accustomed to be brought against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
men in old time,<note place="margin">Iesuites la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and indeuours for the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</note> as also against all Christians generally of

seeing their manifold labors extant in the world, to the help of all
sortes of christian people, they begin with children as soone as they
are able to speak, teaching them christian doctrine, and elements of
other learing, afterward they read to them artes, tongues, sciences,
and higher professions; they frame their manners and affections as
well as their iudgmentes and vnderstanding to al Christian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and pietie, if they be poore and needie they labour to prouide
for them also temporally what they can; they doe set them forward
and aduance them in learning and pietie, they preache to all, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
sacraments to all, they write bookes, they make peace between
enemies, they visit prisons and hospitales for comfort of the poore
and sick, they procure them fauor, get them almes, help them to dye
in Gods fear that either by sicknes or Iustice are called thervnto, and
finally taking a childe from his christian cradle, they carry him along
and accompanie him with continual assistance, comfort, and help, in
all fortunes, states, &amp; conditions of life and death, vntill they deliuer
him vp agayne into his creators handes, that sent him into the world;
and this without earthly reward or recompence, &amp; often tymes with
ingratitude and enmitie of the parties so benefited, and this is the lyfe
vse and exercise of these men.</p>

            </p>
            <p>These are the wordes of those magistrates, in their printed sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
whereby is manifestly seen, the end that moued them to publish so

at least to induce Peter Panne to confesse it, or to accept and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
so manifest false a confession, without further examination of
the truth and circunstances therof.</p>
            <p>For that since, vpon further tryal of the matter, before other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
of other places,<note place="margin">Refutal of the fable.</note> to wit, of Ypers itself, where the partie dwelt,
and of Doway, wbere the couenant was forged to be treated and
concluded, and of other places in Flanders, it is found that all was a
mere fiction, so far forth as it toucheth the Iesuites, and so is it testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by an answere printed by authoritie of the saied magistrates, the
fyue and twentith of August, next insuing of the same yeare 98. and
by diuers other bookes and declarations afterward set abrode, for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
of the truth, and in one of them, there are obserued aboue
threescore manifest lyes, layd downe agaynst the Iesuites in that
shameful confession: as for example, among other poyntes it is she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
and verefied, that Peter Panne was no catholique at all, nor euer
had doing with the Iesuites; that he was a vagrant cooper giuen to
drunkenes and running vp and downe the country lyke a mad
man, for which faultes, and for his debtes, he was often put into
prison, and sometymes being deliuered, he put in himself agayne of
madnes; that his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des wold haue bound him in chaynes in his owne
house, that he was extremely well affected to Counte Mauris, and
consequently no fit man for Iesuites to deale withal to kill him, if
they had had any such intention, as their was no cause why they
should haue, seing they were to gayne nothing by his death.</p>
            <p>Moreouer that Peter Panne neuer prouyded the Iesuites college in
Doway of butter in his lyfe, as is affirmed in the sentence, nor euer
was seen in that college by any, nor that there was euer any such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of the college named Melchior de val, feigned to haue byn the
messenger to sollicit this matter with Peter Panne, neither was euer
there any treatie with Peter Pannes wyfe in Ypers, to this effect, or
other, as is affirmed in the confession, nor had she euer any acquayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
or dealing in her lyfe with Iesuites, as in the faigned narration
is set downe, that all the tale of Peter Pannes coming to Doway in

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14532:38"/>
to the enterpryse, with making him many offers temporal, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him for his soule, that if he died in the enterpryse, he should
go to heauen presently, both in body and soule, and many other
such circumstances set dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in the printed narration, all I say, are
shewed manifestly to be false and forged, vpon examination and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of catholique magistrates of the places aforenamed, and of
the persons themselues, mentioned in the fable, and among other
poyntes it is proued by many witnesses, that the Prouincial of the
Iesuites in the rogation weeke, which they do name, was in Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xeles,
to wit, aboue threscore myles of, and had departed from Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in the moneth of Ianuarie before, and of Peter Panne also it is
proued, that he was not in Doway at that tyme, nor could be, for
that he was working in his maysters shop at Ypers.</p>
            <p>So as by these and many other most euident demonstrations,
there to be seen, it is made cleer, that this is but an heretical fiction
to defame Iesuites, for their zeal in Gods true religion, in which res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
as they are more dear to almighty God, so ought they to be also
to all good men, that behold these diuelish deuises of Sathan and
his instruments agaynst them.</p>
            <p>But let vs returne to England,<note place="margin">VVhether Iesuites seeke her maiest. blood.</note> where Sir Francis beateth also vpon
the same nayl, as you haue heard, at the beginning of this incounter,
saying, <hi>that he cannot perceiue the thirst that Persons aud his pew-fellowes
haue of seeking her Maiesties blood, to be yet quenched:</hi> but how doth the
poore man proue, that they haue had that thirst? no way. how
doth he proue that it is not yet quenched? for that he perceiueth it
not, nor yet how it may be, the causes still remayning, why they
sought it before; o sillie disputer, how he flieth still from the point
he should proue? I requier that he should proue that Iesuites haue
sought the Queenes Maiesties blood, and he giueth a reason why
they haue not left to seek it; and what is this reason? for that the same
causes of seeking it, do remayn stil, that were before. What are
these causes? he nameth them not, but it seemeth they can be no
other, then the difference of religion, and the persecution made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them for the same. VVel then, all the substance of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is brought to this issue, that for so much, as Sir Faancis old
head cannot perceiue, how Iesuites persecuted for religion by the
Queen, can loue her or pray for her, or cease to hate her, and not
seek her blood, therfore it is so, and must be thought so.</p>
            <p>But to this argument answereth Saint Paule,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> when he saith,
<hi>animalis homo non percipit ea quae spiritus Dei sunt,</hi> a fleshly and sensual
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14532:39"/>
man perceyueth not the thinges that are of Gods spirit, such for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
as are the louing of a mannes enemies, &amp; praying for them,
and rendring good for euil, which yet spiritual men (such as Iesuites
are taken to be) may perhaps both perceyue and practise, and so I
perswade myself they do, and I haue heard in particular by such as
come from English Seminaries beyond the seas, where Iesuites and
especially father persons here accused, hath a hand, that there is a
custome and precept, not only for all in general, to remember her
Maiestie in their ordinarie praiers, but also in the particular deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
assigned to euerie particuler person, at the beginning of euerie
moneth. The Queen of England hath her particuler place of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
among other princes, and before them also, in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them that are assigned to pray for her, so as this practise of
praying for persecutors, so much praysed by Christ though it enter
not into Sir Francis worldly spirit, and fleshly vnderstanding, yet
may it, and doth it (as it seemeth) into Iesuites.</p>
            <p>And this might serue now as well for defence of all Iesuites in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as of father Persons in particuler, seeing no seueral matter is
layd agaynst either of them; but yet I may not let passe by law of
common frendship, to adde some few lynes also in the fathers case
by name, seing that by name he is accused of so odious a cryme, as is
to haue a thirst of shedding the blood of our Soueraigne lady and
Queen.<note place="margin">Defence of F. persons in particuler.</note> About which accusation I would aske this accuser, how
this appeareth? and how it cometh to passe, that in so many yeares,
so many others hauing byn suspected, some apprehended, other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,

crymes, none euer (that is knowen) accused father Persons by name,
to haue induced or perswaded them to the lyke enterpryse? though

priuie to their councels, actions, or attemptes, in this behalf, let the
recordes be sought out of all the preestes declarations that haue byn

euer to haue proposed any such matter vnto them, and yet the most
part of them were acquaynted with him, &amp; many also sent into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14532:39"/>
by his direction, and if he had felt such a deadly thirst of blood,
and of her Maiesties blood, as this accuser sayth, the readiest way
for quenching therof, had byn to persuade some of these men (that
come of purpose to aduenture their lyues for religion, and feare not
the leesing of any thing in this world) to haue taken the enterpryse
vpon them, for the common good, and for setting the vse of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
at libertie ther by.</p>
            <p>But there is no such matter, and these are but fictions and deuyses
of enemies,<note place="margin">An euident demonstration.</note> to make men odious; no preest hitherto nor Iesuite (that
I haue hearde of) hath euer confessed of himself, or others of that
vocation, any such attempt or meaning at all. It seemeth they are
gouerned by an other spirit and rule, to wit, by that of holy Dauid,
who made this vow,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

God stryk him, or that his day come of natural death, or that

vnto me, that I lay not my handes vpon his anoynted.</p>
            <p>So then father Parsons protesteth (as I am credibly informed)
that he was neuer consenting, witting, willing, inducing, yeelding,
nor priuie to any such personal attempt against her Maiestie in his
life. Moreouer he auoucheth, that he hath dissuaded, hindered, and
diuerted some that might perhaps haue had such inclination, and
namely one Gentleman, some yeares past beyond the seas (he sayeth
not of what nation he was) that hauing resolued vpon the only
zeale of religion, and for deliuering of catholique people from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
to leese his own life, or to take away that of her Maiestie;
he was entered some hundreth miles and more into his iorney toward
England, for that purpose, hauing made himself ready to dye, by
discharging his minde of all worldly cares and cogitatons, neither
had he doubt of the effect, for that he pretended not to escape aliue: all
which notwithstanding, vpon father Parsons earnest dissuasion, that
met him on the way, he was content at length to retyre, and giue ouer
the enterprise, principally vpon this reason (for others he persuaded
himself to haue examined sufficiently before) that English catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
themselues desired not to be deliuered from their miseries by
any such attempt; and this to be most true, he affirmeth vpon his
conscience.</p>
            <p>By this then it may seem to appeer, that this father is not so thirstie

donn them good, and I could name some, if <hi>I</hi> thought it would be
no hurt or disgrace vnto them, let those fourscore and fifteen, whom
at one time he deliuered out of the chaynes of galleys of Spayn, in

to the matter it self I answer, that wheras Sir Francis maketh so light

vs to make a far different collection, when in his first sermon on the

               <hi>so doth euerie good tree bringe foorth good frutes,

and I will shew thee my fayth by my workes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iacob. 2.</note> If then here be workes and
good lyf in these Catholiques, it must be presumed to come of good
fayth according to Saynt Iames. And if there be figges, and grapes,
and such other good frutes found in their behaueour, then must the
tree be iudged good also, if Christes rule be not false. And for that
our Sauiour gaue this rule to discerne true and false prophetes by,
it is not euil that Sir Francis and his men do fly from it so openly in
the playne feeld, leauinge good workes to Catholiques, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
only threed-bare fayth to themselues, for therby they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
what prophetes they be.</p>
            <p>And of all this I do not greatly marueyle in Sir Francis, for he seeth
(poore man) how bare a haruest he hath in hand, when he talketh
of workes amonge those of his sect, and how the hare goeth clearly
away on our syde, if he hunt after good life in his new prophetes.
But much I marueyle of his lack of shame, that talking agaynst these

dissemble least, but rather do publish themselues, euen to the face

            <p>My owne experience telleth me <hi>(sayth he)</hi> that when the gentleman and man of wealth refuseth to come to the churche, and is in any sort borne with all, there the meaner sort receyue infection, and draw backe from obedience also, for
<q>Aboue maiori discit arare minor.</q>
               <q>Of the elder oxe, the yonger steer doth learne.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is Sir Francis first charge, which as it is graue and weightie
in it self, so is it as substantially proued, with a poetical verse taken
from his plow and stawle of oxen and from his steeres. Let vs see
what this iustice of peace hath more to saye of his owne experience,
for be-lyke he speaketh of his practise in that office agaynst Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santes
it followeth then in his booke.</p>
            <p>If the man come to thurche and the wyf refuse (which is a cunnning trick
much practised of late yeares) then is the houshold both seruantes and children
in danger wholly to be corrupted. And sure it is, that the wyues of the meaner
sorte are infected greatly by them, and the nightcrowes persuation preuayleth
much, and in myn owne knowledge, within these three yeares, many of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
sort are fallen away, and do fall away daylie, for that, impunitatis spes
magna peccantium in illecebra, the hope of impunitie is a greate bayte to offend.</p>
            <p>Heer is all now that our knight can alleage in particuler concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the hurts (so many and so manyfold) which before he sayd the
recusantes do woork in England, which in effect cometh to be no
more (as you see) but that if the goodman refuse to go to churche
(though the good wife go) then those of the meaner sorte begin to
refuse also; and if the goodwife refuse (though the goodman go)
then are the seruantes and children in danger to do the like. And
then generally he setteh downe this doctrinal assertion, that the
night crowes perswasion preuayleth much, and this knoweth he of
his owne knowledge partely (perhaps) by experience of his own night
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14532:41"/>
crow, and partely by tampering in these affaires: who (as is probable)
hath bin some principal actor in the long persecutions vpon Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
either by playing the parte of Iudas to betray and take them,
or of Caiphas or Pilate, to condemne and afflict them. And so by
this experience he hath found out (as he saith) that many goodwiues
of the meaner sorte are fallen of late, and many other by their
example do fall away dayly: a grieuous accusation, and fit for a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
knight.</p>
            <p>But Sir, you that are such an enemie of night-crowes, and haue
such knowledge of the afayres of all the goodwiues of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
tel me, whereunto do these wiues, or children, or seruantes, or
tenants, or husbands fall, when you say they fall away? is it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
to any enormitie of sinne or to wickednes of life? no, but
to haue a scruple to go to the protestants churches. And why? for
that they are of a different religion. They are Catholiques, and do
think your religion and seruice naught. Wel then, religion and
conscience is cause of this refusal, and not euil wil or rebellion,
as you malitiously interprete and consequently the way of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
is, not to beat, and bynde, and driue them to your churches by
force and punishment, as you do perswade the Magistrate to do
(Sir consciencelesse knight) but first you must make them of your
religion, that they may go of deuotion and conscience: for if they
go otherwise it is a dooble sinne, both to them that go, and to you
that make them go, albeit the act otherwise in it self were neuer so
good and lawful: as all men of learning and conscience do wel know,
that an erronious conscience also bindeth: though your ignorance
be so grosse in all christian learning, as you seme to be both ignorant
and careles of so manifest a truthe.</p>
            <p>I say, it is a manifest truthe, that a mannes conscience<note place="margin">An errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscience also byn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</note> is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
though it did erre, and much more when it erreth not, and
the reason of the former is, that forasmuch as our conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is nothing
els but the voice and determination of our reason and iudgement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
matters to be donn or not to be donne, it followeth that we are
bound to obey that direction (be it right or wrong) so long as we
haue no other light to guyde vs. For that according to this we shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
iudged at the last day, to wit, according as each mannes conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
(sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th Saynt Paule) shal accuse or defend him:<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> and not according
to the nature or qualitie of the thing it self that he doth: which
point, schoolemen (if I be not deceiued) do expresse in these wordes,
that the goodnesse or malice of a mannes will, is to be measured by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14532:42"/>
the obiect that moueth the will, and not by the thing it self that is
donne. As for example, if I apprehend a thing to be euil and yet do
it, I do sinne, albeit the thinge in it self that I do, were not euil: for
that in my apprehension and iudgment it was euil: &amp; so I did it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the conceit and formality of euil, and consequently my wil
and intention was naught, in doing it, though the thing in it self were
lawfull. As for example, if in the night time seeing a beast in a bush
and thinking it to be myn enemy I should kill it, though the thing it
self be no sinne, yet should I commit manslaughter therin before
God, for that, my apprehension was of myn enemy, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
myn action should be iudged according to the obiect I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and not according to the thing in it self.</p>
            <p>This very case determineth S. Paule himself particulerly,<note place="margin">Idolothita.</note> through
out the whole foureteenth chapter of his epistle to the Romanes,
about eating the meates that had bin offered vp to Idols. And the
same matter he handeleth again throughout the eight chapter of his
first epistle to the Corinthians. And in both places he determineth
that to him that either eateth simply without enquiring whether it
were offered to Idols or not, or hath so much true christian knowledge
as he vnderstandeth thereby that an Idol is nothing, and that all
creatures are lawful to be eaten by a christian man (so it be donn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
scandal of others, &amp; with other due circumstances) albeit I say
to such a man it be lawful to eat of those meates that had bin offered
to Idols, yet to him that had a contrarie conscience and iudgement
it should be a greiuous sinne to eate thereof, for that he did it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his own iudgement and beleefe, though it were erroneous.
<hi>I do know and trust iu Iesus Christe</hi> (Saith Saint Paule) <hi>that no meat is vnclean
or vnlawful now, but onely to such as think it vnlawful.</hi> So as onely to
think it vnlawful, maketh it vnlawful, according to Saint Paules
rule. And again the same Apostle, <hi>qui discernit, si manducauerit, damnatus
est, quia non ex fide,</hi> he that discerneth or iudgeth, the said meat to haue
bin offered to Idols,<note place="margin">Roman. 14.</note> and that it is therby made vnfit to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; yet
eateth the same, he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned: for that he doth not according to his
own iudgment and beleef. And after all, he concludeth his speach
with this general proposition <hi>omne autem quod non est ex fide, peccatum est,</hi>
all that is not according to a mannes beleef and conscience, is sinne,
for so expound this sentence, Origen, Saint Ambros, Saint Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ostom,
and other fathers, and not to signifie, that all the woorkes
of Infidels, donne without faith, should be sinne, though Saint
Augustin apply it also to that sense sometimes:<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 4.</note> but the other sense is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14532:42"/>
the literal and most true, as appeareth manifestly by the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
of Saint Paule.<note place="margin">contra Iuda cap. 3.</note> Of all which insueth that no man may do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his conscience though it were awry.<note place="margin">An errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth euer excuse.</note> Not for that a wrong
conscience excuseth in all cases (for that is a different question) but
for that a wrong conscience, byndeth euermore, and some tymes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth
also, when it proceedeth of inuincible ignorance. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it cometh by right or wrong information, no man may go
agaynst it without sin so long as he cannot perswade it to change,
and if this be so, how much more are the recusant Catholiques of
England bound to follow their consciences in the poynt they stand
in, for not going to churche, being founded vpon so sure and euident
growndes as any demonstration in the world can lay downe, for
proof of any manifest truth what so euer, as for example, first, that
the religion they professe is true, and the only truth that among
Christians is to be found, and secondly that they being of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
maie not dissemble or seem to professe any other, by going to
their seruice sermons, or churches, and hereby also appeareth how
great impietie and folly it is for any man to inforce them thereunto,
as our barbarous knight would haue the English magistrate to do:
I saie it is impietie to inforce any Christian to do an acte agaynst his
conscience and beleef, for that it is to inforce him to his damnation,
as Saynt Paul before hath taught vs,<note place="margin">Roman. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> I saie also it is folly, for that
by drawing mens bodies to church by violence (their myndes being
repugnant) nothing is gayned at all, but more internal hatred and
rancor rather enkindled, and the infotcers are made pertakers of the
others sinnes and damnation.</p>
            <p>And further the Protestantes do greatly hereby discredit their
owne doctrin which they were wont to teach,<note place="margin">Protestantes discredit.</note> that no man should
be forced in matters of his conscience. And more ouer they do shew
hereby vnto the world that they seeke not the inward man, but the
vtter shew &amp; body, with what great repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce soeuer it be of the
soule, which is quyt contratie to all pietie, and a most base manner
of proceeding in respect of the Catholique vsage, which albeit it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
such as do wilfully and obstinatly leaue the vniuersal ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
faith of Christendome, which once they haue receyued and sworne
vnto, yet as long as they are euill perswaded of the same, they are
not only not forced to Catholique churches; or to hearing of masses
participation of Sacramentes or to other lyke exercyses of contrarie
religion, but are barred also though they would come, if they be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to come with repugnance, or that there be any least suspition
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14532:43"/>
that they go f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ynedly or agaynst their willes, for that their soule and
mynde is sought in Catholique religion and not the body only.</p>
            <p>And this maie be sufficient for repelling Sir Francis first charge
against English recusantes concerning the present hurt (he saieth)
they do in England, by geuing others example to follow their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
and not to dissemble. And by giuing, them example of good
life of modest behaueor, of patience in aduersitie, of corage in Gods
cause, of contempe of earthly prosperitie, of care of their saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
feare of Gods iudgementes, of fidelitie in following the direction of
their consciences, of magnanimitie in not yelding to betraye their
owne cause and beleefe: all which is conteyned in the most excellent
and heroical act of the refusing to go to churches and seruice of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Religion. In which poynt of refusal also the Puritanes
were wont to concurre with Catholiques for defence of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
but it may be they haue thought it best now to alter that
course, for that as they haue no other grownd of their religion but
their owne iudgment, so it byndeth them no further then they list,
and that it standeth with their comoditie, and it may be, that in this
poynt now they haue thought it best to follow those whome Christ
sayth,<note place="margin">Matti. 13.</note>

            <p>I come then to the second charge, which our knight geueth vpon
our recusantes about the hurtes<note place="margin">About the hurtes that recusantes vvould do.</note> that he will needes haue men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
they would do if they could, of which he writeth thus.</p>
            <p>Touching the hurt they would do, who doubteth but they would haue vp their
masse agayne, and bannish the syncere worship of God, their whole Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
gouernment and religion I am sure they long for. And yet to pronounce these
men to carye holow hartes to Queen Elizabeth is thought to be an vncharitable
sentence.</p>
            <p>Do you see how wyse a charge this is, and how learnedly proued?
Yf a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should reason thus agaynst him, &amp; his brother the Earle, that
died not longe agone in Yorke, you both are puritanes in religion,
as you are taken, and consequently no man can dout but that you
would haue vp your geneuian disciplinarie for me of gouernment,
whereby all the Bishops in England must be pulled downe, and other
Ecclesiastical dignities discomposed, the Queenes Supremacie also
must be taken away, and other like pointes of the English churche
ouerthrowen, whereby a man may pronounce that you cary but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
hartes to the present state, and to the Queen Elizabeth, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all your flatterie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:14532:43"/>
And this is an argument (Sir Francis) which logicians call,<note place="margin">Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem.</note> 
               <hi>ad

scratche your head, towching wishes and bearing hollow hartes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
Queen Elizabeth and her gouernment, if I would follow
presumptions, as you do against recusantes, for that besides your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
if a man consider whence you descend, and what pretences be
or may be about succession, it is not hard to ghesse what your wishes
may be to haue Queen Elizabeth, or some other person to sit in her
place, and yet to pronounce you to carry a hollow harte to Queen
Elizabeth, as you say in iest, that it is thought to be an vncharitable
sentence, and I say it in earnest <hi>quia charitas non cogitat malum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> sayth
Saint Paule, charity iudgeth not the worst of things, and so I wil not
iudge what wishes you haue or may haue: only I wil tel you that if
you haue any in this later kinde, they are more perilous and preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to Queen Elizabeth, then those which you presume catholiques
to haue, for that the thinges, which you imagin catholiques do wish
(as restoring of masse and catholique gouernment and the like) may
stand with her Maiesties life, raigne, securitie, and prosperitie (if it
would please almightie God to inspire her to admit them) euen as
they haue stood with the honor and prosperitie, of all her noble
ancestors, Kings and Queenes of our realme before her: but your wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
cannot preuaile but with her ruine, if they be such as may be
presumed.</p>
            <p>But as I sayd, I wil not vrge you in this behalf what you would
wish, nor is there any well gouerned common wealth in the world,
in my opinion, that vrgeth men vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suche vayne poyntes of inward

for as for the definition of conscience it were easie (I suppose) to pose
Sir Francis, seeing that his bringing vp hath bin rather in court and

of conscience, how little sence he hath, there needeth no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but onely this slanderous libel, stuffed with such monstrous lyes
and calumniations, as no man of any conscience would euer haue set

truly it may be doubted; whether easily there might haue bin found
any so careles or conscienceles an atheist about London, that so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
for any bribe would haue accused so many worshipfull honest
ciuil men, as himself confesseth the recusant catholiques of England
to be (which is so much as any ciuill common-wealth can requier of

to them. As contrarywise the newes of her happie escape was irk some. So
that, where there is only the bare sense of a true English ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, these popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusantes
cannot bewitche or deceyue with their hypocritical holinesse, or ciuil
honestie, and so I leaue them.</p>
            <p>Though you wil leaue them (Sir hoatespur) in this your choler, yet
mean I not to leaue either them or you, vntil this matter be better
examined. And first in this inuectiue, if we take away railing speach
without proof, there is nothing added to that you haue scolded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
against the recusantes. And if in the rest we consider how you
stammer stil at the good opinion of Catholiques, fained holinesse, and
ciuil honest lyf (a hard bone as it seemeth for you to disgest) there is
much to their praise and commendation in this your accusation.
But yet to shift off this matter, and to bring in contempt the persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their good life, and to induce men not to make account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and much lesse to be bewitched (as your phrase is) by the same,
you require the sense only of <hi>a true bare English hart to resist this witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft

               <note place="margin">A bare En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish hart vvhat it is.</note> and what you mean by a bare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish

Gods motions, and as bare of all piety, remorse, and conscience, as
yours seemeth to be, to which also if you do adde the English cutte
(as hartes go there for the most parte among protestantes at this day)
and furthermore if it be so truely and barely English, as it hath seen
no other countries,, nor knowen other paradice then English earth,
nor thought of other blisse then with you is comonly treated, and
that it be as seruilly tyed to oxen, and steeres, and other temporal base
comodities, as your soule sheweth it self to be. And that for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perfection, it be seasoned also with a dram or two of your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish

you repuire, is sufficient not onely to resist the bewitching of recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants

and to condemn their scrupulous standing in defence of their

English recusantes, for refusing to go to churche, but we do measure
the matter by an other ballance, then by the sense of so bare an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish

poyz of that which is weighed.</p>
            <p>And thus I might leaue (Sir Francis) now with some disaduantage
perhaps of his side, as he before in haste would leaue the recusantes,
were it not that I desire to see some proofe also of his skil and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

            <p>I hold it <hi>(saith he)</hi> for a sound ground and not to be controlled, that euery
christian ought to striue to keep these three thinges sound within his brest: his
conscience before God, his loyaltie to his prince, and his loue to his countrie. All
which three (for my parte) I account so nearly conioyned each to other, as they
cannot iustly be seuered.</p>
            <p>Heer I will pose Sir Francis in this his position and grownd, which
he saith is so vniuersally true, as it may not be controlled, and therby
you shal see both the knightes diuinity and conscience together.</p>

defence in all their fancies and follies, is, their shew of some wordes
of Scripture to proue the same, wherin also our knight will needes
proue himself a Rabbyne. Let vs examin briefly how substantially
he performeth the matter.</p>
            <p>Our conscience <hi>(saith he)</hi> cannot but tell vs, that all obedience is dew to the
soueraigne Magistrate, for we are taught it out of the booke of conscience, the
holie scriptures, which teach vs that we must subiect our selues to all manner of

            <p>Thus far Sir Francis. And heerby you shal discern, how whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

man, euen as pretious stones before hogges, as Scripture it self
doth àffirm. For in these few wordes, as Sir Francis alleageth them,
may be founded the perfect sect of the Herodians, that made Herods
pleasure, the rule and platforme of their conscience and actions.
<hi>Our conscience</hi> (sayth he) <hi>must needes tel vs that all obedience is due to the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne

               <hi>ergo,</hi> these mennes
consciences, had not yet told them, that <hi>all obedience</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
was due to the ciuil Magistrate. S. Paules conscience also
told him not so, when he refused to obey the commandement of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
and died for the same, and so did many other Martyrs, for resisting
both him and other princes and lawful magistrates, in Gods cause.
And it is a special praise giuen to Martyrs by the churche in their
feasts, <hi>contempserunt iussa principum,</hi> they contemned the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of princes, for Christes sake. How then saith this Herodian
knight that <hi>all obedience</hi> must be yeelded to them in all matters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception? let vs see how he proueth it.</p>
            <p>VVe are taught it <hi>(saith he)</hi> out of the booke of conscience; by the wordes now
alleaged of Saint Peter,<note place="margin">False taans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> Submit your selues to all manner of ordinance of man.</p>
            <p>But first I would aske him with what conscience, doth he corrupt

Peter are,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Subiecti estote omni humanae creaturae propter Deum, siue Regi quasi

for Gods sake (meaning thereby the ciuil magistrate elected by the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14532:46"/>
comon-wealth) whether it be to the king, as more eminent then the
rest, or vnto captaines and vnder magistrates sent from him: why
doth Sir Francis translate <hi>omni humanae craturae</hi> (which is the very same
also in Greek) all manner of ordinance of man? but that it serued
more to his purpose, and they can make their booke of conscience
to say what they will haue sayd without scruple of conscience: why
doth Sir Francis translate, <hi>siue Regi quasi praecellenti,</hi> whether it be to
the king as superior &amp;c. and why doth he cunningly leaue out the
wordes that follow immediatly, or to the Captaynes (or vnder Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates)
sent by him, &amp;c. but that he would make Saynt Peter to
say, that the king is absolute superior, and that all obedience is due
vnto him, as to the <hi>Soueraigne magistrate</hi> as this sely man hath taken
vpon him to teach vs, though Saynt Peter doth name also the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
magistrates in lyke manner, and sayth only, that the king is to be
obeyed as the more eminent among them, but yet putteth him not
for absolute, or that all obedience is due to him, as our man would
haue men now beleeue, for that it maketh to his purpose, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
euacuateth the precept of Saynt Paule, who appoynteth to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
an other obedience also, far different from that of kinges and
temporal Princes in matters, belonging to their soules, when he
sayth,<note place="margin">Hebrae. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Obedite praepositis vestris &amp; subiacete eis, ipse enim peruigilant, quasi ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem

            <p>And who those Prelates be,<note place="margin">Spiritual go uernours.</note> the same Apostle expoundeth in an

               <hi>ouer which the holie Ghost hath placed you for Bishops
to gouern the churche of God, which he hath purchased with his owne blood.</hi>
VVhich wordes of tender loue and prerogatiue (to be placed in their
dignities by the hand of the holie ghost himself, ouer the chosen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that God had bought with his owne pretious blood) we shal neuer
read to haue bin spoken to temporal kings and princes, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all obedience is not so absolutely due to them, as this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
diuine holdeth, but much is also to be reserued for the others,
and in matters of highest moment.</p>
            <p>First then we see, most manifest falshood and trecherie vsed heer,
by this our <hi>Bible-clerk-knight</hi> in corrupting and translating wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his purpose this litle peece of Scripture alleaged by him, what
would he do think you if he had to alleage many places, seing he
handleth so pittifully this one only? Secondly, we may see the egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14532:47"/>
absurditie and impietie of the sense which he would pick out
thereof, to wit, <hi>that all obedience</hi> absolutely, and in all matters and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
is to be yeilded to the soueraygn temporal magistrate without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint:
and consequently also,<note place="margin">Most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> that all manner of their ordinances and
lawes are to be obeyed without exception. VVhich doctrine if it
be true, then were the Apostles bound to go to the Infidels temples
and sacrifiise also, when they were commanded: for that no man wil
deny, but that this precept of obedience set downe heer by Saint
Peter, was ment expresly and particulerly for obeying the seculer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and princes of that time: all which were Infidels commonly,
and Idolaters. So as if there were no exception of causes, then did
Saint Peter himself (that giueth the precept) verie euil, in not obeying
the magistrates of Iurie first, and after in refusing to obey Nero the
Emperor, when he willed him to consorme himself in matters of
religion.</p>
            <p>And if there be any exception of causes or matters, wherin by
Gods law, princes may be disobeyed, then impiously and fondly is it
set downe heer by Sir Francis so resolutely, as out of Scripture, <hi>that
all obedience is due to the soueraygne magistrate,</hi> and that also (as his words
be) <hi>in all manner of ordinances</hi> without exception, which heath enis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
includeth a thowsand denyals of God himself. And further I
say, that the same is fondly affirmed, for that the Protestantes
greatest contention hath byn hitherto agaynst Catholiques, to the
end, that they should not <hi>obey the preceptes of men,</hi> though they were
set downe by the whole Churche, and now cometh in this guylt
spurre-Doctor with a quy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e contrarie ground, <hi>that we must submit our
selues to all manner of ordinance of man.</hi> VVhich is as far to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
of base seruilitie, as the former was to the contrarie, of pryde,
to obey no ordinance of man at all, they prouing the same then by
that text of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 1. Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>In vayne do they worship me teaching the doctrine
and preceptes of men.</hi> And now the contrarie by Saint Peter, <hi>that we
must obey all manner of mennes ordinance,</hi> which yet Saint Peter sayeth
not, but Sir Francis falsly alleageth him.</p>
            <p>And by this you see how these poor people do range vp &amp; downe
without rule, limit, or certayne ground at all but only their own
will and present fancie. Moreouer I saie that this text of Saynt Peter
of obeying ciuil magistrates (though it were so as he alleageth it)
yet is it verie impertinently alleaged agaynst Catholiques in our
controuersie about their not going to protestantes churches, for that
they do offer all due obedience in temporal and ciuil actions vnto
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14532:47"/>
their temporal magistrate.<note place="margin">Hovv recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santes do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and hovv they may not.</note> And do stand only in matters of religion,
that concerne their soules and consciences, and consequently this text
is nothing to the purpose agaynst them in that behalf. And with this
I will leaue also Sir Francis as simple a soule as I founde him, but yet
somewhat more shufled out of his cloutes, and discouered for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienceles
corrupter of his booke of conscience.</p>
            <p>To Catholique recusantes whome he impugneth I can say no
more, but that they are happie men to haue such an aduersarie,<note place="margin">A speech to catholique recusantes.</note> and
that the course which they haue hitherto held is most honorable and
pious before God and man, I meane in shewing first their dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
God, by standing constantly and suffering for their conscience:
and secondly in offering all loyal obedience in temporal causes to
their liege prince. And lastly in edifying their neighbours by their
good lyfe and behaueour. VVhich is the exhortation of Saynt Peter
in this verie place alleaged. <hi>Hauing your conuersation good</hi> (sayth he) <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
these people, in such sorte, as they considering your good woorkes,</hi>

they go about to slander you as wicked men, God may be glorified therby in the
day of his visitation.</hi> And agayne, <hi>the will of God is, that you by your good
lyf, do stop the mouthes of foolish and ignorant men, that talke agaynst you, &amp;c.</hi>
And yet further, <hi>this is a great grace if any man suffer sorow for his conscience
towardes God, being afflicted vniustly, for if you suffer for sinne (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is no glorie but if while you liue well, you do suffer patiently, it is a great grace

            </p>
            <p>And as for obedience, you are to yeeld it simply (my deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)

Christ altered nothing at all, but left it as he found it.
And for that some Christians after Christes ascention, partly by the

make them free from all temporal subiection, and partly vpon those
woordes of Christe himself in Saint Iohns Ghospel,<note place="margin">Ioan. 8.</note>

verè liberi eritis,</hi> if the sonne of God once deliuer you, you
shal be truely free (which was meant of spirituall freedom) yet
for that some Christians imagined that they were now free from
obedience also of temporal magistrates, the foresayd two chief Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
Saint Peter and Saint Paule,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 2.</note> took vpon them most earnestly to
remoue this error, in the places alleaged, and to persuade all due
temporal obedience also, in all ciuil afaires, to the ciuil magistrate,
of what life or religion soeuer he were.</p>
            <p>I say in temporal and ciuil afaires, for as for matters of religion
and the soule, no man of sence or iudgment, will imagin that the
said Apostles would bynd christians to obey those ciuil magistrates,
that were not yet christians in the Apostles dayes, nor euer ment to
be, but rather persecutors.</p>
            <p>And heerof also insueth, that their must needes be some other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
superioritie and gouernment for matters of the soule,<note place="margin">Spiritual magistrate.</note> whereof
I shewed the commandement before out of Saint Paule, and it is
that which we commonly call Ecclesiasticall or Spiritual gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
concerning afaires of religion and conscience. And this gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ouer soules, Christe himself came properly downe from heauen
to found and erect vpon earth, and to make himself head thereof:
being a gouernment far different from the other, whereof he would
take no parte at all, and so he fled when the people would haue made
him a king: and to Pilate he denyed that his kingdom was of this
world:<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> and being called vpon to deuide the inheritance between two
brethren (which was an act aperteining to the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall magistrate) he
answered,<note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> who hath apointed me a Iudge or a deuider ouer you?
But yet when he talked of the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This superioritie therfore and tribunal ouer soules, for instructing,

Christ did peculierly erect and setle at his being here, making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

substitutes, to guyd the same vnder him vnto the worldes end. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did Christe at his departure commit this authoritie, or any parte
therof, vnto Caesar, or vnto any other temporal prince, but to his
Apostles, geuing them that supreme dignitie in ioynt commission
with his owne person, when he saied, <hi>who heareth you, heareth me, and

               <note place="margin">Luc. 10.</note> Nor did Saynt Paule when he talked

two gouernments and iurisdictions are,<note place="margin">Temporal and spiritual iurisdiction.</note> Christ prouided that this
spiritual gouernment of his Churche should stand in the world for
three hundred yeares together; without any temporal gouernment at
all in the hand of Christian Princes, to wit, vntil the tyme of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantyne
the greate, and then and after, when any temporal kinges
and princes were conuerted and made Christians (as our Ethelbertus
king of kent, king Clodoueus of France, and others) all entered
and submitted them selues vnder this spiritual gouernment of the
Christian Churche and prelates therof, as subiectes and not as superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
as sheep and not as pastors, and as children vnder their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and prelates, and not as commanders in that behalf. And so
they continued still for many ages together, contented with their
princely authoritie in ciuil matters, and with their subiection in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,
vntill certayn libertyne heretiques of our tyme, to put
themselues out of the burthen of obedience to their Ecclesiastical
superiours, haue sought to trooble and confound this holy distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
appoynted by our Sauiour, and to cast both gouernmentes
and iurisdictions into the handes of the temporal magistrate, therby
to make a confusion,<note place="margin">Occham to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> and to be free themselues from correction,

               </note> whereof Daniel, our Sauiour Christe, and his Apostles do
speake, and that Rome is Babilon (in the sense that these goodfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

some pleasant crew at a tauern or alebench, then to moue any learned
auditory or discreet reader, though it be frequent matter in English

so shall the true Antechriste be a particuler man also,<note place="margin">Antich. one man.</note> and not any
succession of men, one after another, as the Popes of Rome are;
and this is euidently gathered by the ancient fathers, out of the
wordes of diuers holy Scriptures, as namely <hi>Daniel. 7. &amp; 11. Ioan. 5.
2. Thess. 2. 1. Ioan. 2. Apoc. 13. &amp;, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer the Iewes shal receiue the true Antechriste for their
Messias, as they refused to receiue Christe, and so Christe sayeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
plainly <hi>Ioan. 5. vers. 43. I came in the name of my father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antichrist declared by the levves.</note>

likely that the Iewes wil receiue the Pope of Rome for their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,
and much lesse so many Popes as are already dead.</p>
            <p>The Gospel and doctrine of Christe must be first preached to all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
nations before the true Antechriste come,<note place="margin">Antichrist vvhen.</note> 
               <hi>Math. 24. &amp;, 2. Thess. 2.</hi> and so
the consent of old Doctors vpon these places do agree, which thing
is not yet fulfilled, as Saint Augustin in his time did largely declare,
Epist. 80. and we may also shew in ours much more, by the vaste in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel
countries daily discouered.</p>
            <p>The proper Antechriste by all reason and likelyhood, must be a
Iew borne, and circumsized, and will professe (at least for a whyle) to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
keep the Iewes Saboth, and the other ceremonies of the old law,<note place="margin">Antichrist a Ievv.</note> to
draw them after him. And they shal accept of him for their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,
as before hath bin shewed out of Christes owne woords,
which they would neuer do, except he were a Iew both by generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and profession. Of which two things neither can be verified of
the Popes of Rome, to wit, that they are either Iewes by birth, or do
professe the Iewish doctrine, and therefore they can not be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christe.</p>
            <p>Antechriste when he cometh shal pitch his kingdome in the citie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
of Hierusalem,<note place="margin">Antichrist in Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</note> and go about to restore the temple of Salomon, as is

he saith, <hi>that the bodies of Hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And the same is deduced out of the same booke. <hi>cap. 17.</hi> and out of
Saint Paules woords 2. <hi>Thess. 2.</hi> and by many ancient writers. And
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14532:50"/>
how then can the Popes of Rome be sayd to be Antechriste?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Three principal heades of Antechristes diuelish doctrine when he
cometh,<note place="margin">Antichrists doctrine.</note> are gathered plainly out of holy Scriptures. The first, that
he shal deny Iesus to be christe, <hi>1. Ioan. 2. vers. 22.</hi> and consequently
shal deny Baptisme, and all other Sacraments and doctrine brought
in by Christe. The second that he shal teach, himself to be true
Christe, and the Iewes shall beleeue him. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 5. The third, that
he shall affirm himself to be God, and so requier to be adored
for God, 2. <hi>Thess 2. v. 4.</hi> but the Popes of Rome do not teach these
pointes of doctrine hitherto and therfore cannot be Antechriste.</p>
            <p>Agayne scriptures do teach vs, that Antichriste when he commeth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> shal woorke many wonderful miracles in the sight of men,<note place="margin">Antichrists miracles.</note> 
               <hi>Math. 24.
&amp; 2. Thess. 2.</hi> and some of those miracles are specified <hi>Apoc. 13.</hi> to wit
that he shall make fyer descend from heauen, and the image of a beast
to speake, and fayne himself to dye and rise agayne, but these mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
no Popes hitherto haue wrought, or do woorke, <hi>ergo &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Anthichrist shall raigne but three yeares and a half, when he
commeth,<note place="margin">Antichrists tyme of raigne.</note> as is gathered by ancient wryters, out of the Prophet
<hi>Daniel, chapter 7.</hi> and 12. and out of the 12. <hi>chapter</hi> of the <hi>Apocalips</hi>
where it is sayd that he <hi>shall reigne a tyme, &amp; tymes, &amp; half a tyme,</hi> for so
S. Iohn himself interpreteth the matter <hi>c. 11. &amp; 13.</hi> saying it shalbe for
42. monethes, which make iust three yeares &amp; a half, but the Popes
of Rome haue raigned for more ages then these are yeares, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
cannot be Antichrist.</p>
            <p>Beside this, the Scripture teacheth vs plainly, that before Antechrist
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> come,<note place="margin">Henoch &amp; Helias.</note> Henoch and Helias shall returne againe, to oppose themselues
against him, and in the end shall conuert the Iewes, <hi>Malach. 4. Ecclesi.
48. Math. 17. Apoc. 11.</hi> but we see not yet this poynt fulfilled, to proue
the Pope to be Antechriste, <hi>ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, (for I will be no longer in this matter) streight after the end
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of Antechristes kingdome (which shall endure but three years and
a half,<note place="margin">Day of iugd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> as before hath bin shewed) shal ensew the day of iudgment
and consummation of the world, as the <hi>Prophet Daniel</hi> foretelleth <hi>cap.</hi>
7. and Saint Iohn in the <hi>Apoc. cap. 20.</hi> and the same is gathered out of
Christes own wordes also, <hi>Math. 24.</hi> and the foresaid <hi>Prophet Daniel</hi>
speaking againe of this matter in the 12. <hi>chapter,</hi> saith, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Antechriste shall endure a thowsand, two hundreth, and
ninetie dayes, which maketh the former number of three years and a
half. And then he addeth these woordes, <hi>happy is he that expecteth and
ariueth vnto a thowsand three hundreth and thirtie and fiue dayes</hi> (which is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14532:50"/>
fourtie and fiue dayes after the death of Antechriste) <hi>for that then Christe
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, shall bring the crownes of iustice for those that are victors &amp;c.</hi>
And seeing that the Popes of Rome haue endured now so long, &amp; yet
the end of world hath not ensued, it is manifest as wel by this reason,
as by all the other before alleaged, that these Popes cannot be properly
Antechriste, as our new malignant raylers do affirm.</p>
            <p>But it may be some wil say (seeing the absurditie of the former
false position) that the Pope of Rome is not properly,<note place="margin">Hovv there are many Antichristes</note> that Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christe
which is foretold by the scriptures, but only a forerunner of
his, and such as disposeth the way to his comming, at the end of the
world, in which sense Saint Iohn hauing sayd, <hi>Children this is the last
houre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Loan. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and as you haue heard Antechriste commeth, or is to come</hi> (for so the
greek verb signifieth plainly, being of the present tense, and not of
the time past,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> venit.</note> where the latin is doubtful, and may be taken both
wayes) Saint Iohn (I say) hauing foretold in his epistle that Antechrist
was to come in this last houre or age of the world after the appearing
of the true Christe, he addeth immediatly these wordes. <hi>And euen
now many Antechristes are made, and therby we know that this is the last houre
&amp;c.</hi> VVhich is, as if he had sayd, that forasmuch as we do see many
become Antechristes (that is to say do become opposite to Christe
both in spirit and operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) and doo begin to worke the misterie of
iniq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itie (as Saint paule calleth it) agaynst true Antechristes comming,
heerby we know that this is the laste age from Christe to Antechriste,<note place="margin">2. Thessal. 2.</note>
and so to the worldes end, which immediatly is to ensew after Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christes
ariual.</p>
            <p>If I say our knight and his compagnions will confesse this, that
the Pope of Rome is not that proper Antechriste foretold heer by
Saint Iohn, to come in the end of the world but only that he is one
of those other forerunning Antechristes, already made and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in S. Iohns dayes to prepare the way (which yet no heretique
nor Sir Francis himself though neuer so shameles, will da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to auow
of the Bishops of Rome of the primitiue churche, when Saint Iohn
wrote those wordes, that they were Antechristes, they being known
to be Saintes and holy martirs for some ages together) if this I say
be graunted; then it followeth, that all these mennes ianglings in
bookes and pulpits, against the Popes of Rome to proue them Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christes,
faleth to the ground, and is made ridiculous, for that in this
sense all euil men whatsoeuer, may be called Antechristes (that is
contrarie to Christe) who do woorke iniquitie and cooperate to the
kingdome of sinne, which Christe came to ouerthrow; and so all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14532:51"/>
Turkes, Moores, Tyrants, Persecutors and other wicked people are
Antechristes in this sense, as forerunners of true Antechriste and
contrarie to Christe, neither is there any thing peculier to the Popes
of Rome, though we should confesse them to be neuer so wicked
in life, but the very truthe is, that principally and aboue others in
this sense the name of Antechriste is proper to heretiques and sectaries
who vnder the name of Christe, do impugne Christe, and leauing the
common receiued vnion of fayth, do finde out contrarie pathes by
themselues. And against such men did Saint Iohn especially speake
those wordes, <hi>that many Antechristes were already made,</hi> to wit, the Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites,
Cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>thians, and Nicholaites then newly sprong vp. And for
this cause also doth he say, <hi>Antichristi facti sunt,</hi> they are made Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christes,
and not borne so, for that by their owne malice they made
themselues such, in departing from vnion. And now whether Popes
or the Protestants do participate more of this qualitie of heretical
Antichriste, by breaking vnion in faith and religion from the whole
bodie of Christendome, I leaue to the discreet reader to ponder.
And thus much may serue about calling the Pope Antichriste.</p>
            <p>As for Rome,<note place="margin">Hovv Rome is Babylon.</note> whether it be Babilon or no, litle importeth it to
the matter we haue in hand, so we agree in the sense: for not only
Saint Iohn in his Apocalips, but Saint Peeter also in his epistle, doth
call Rome Babilon, and we deny it not, for it was in respect of the
great confusion of iniquitie, Idolatrie, and persecution, that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
Emperours vsed, and were to vse against Gods Saints. But that
either Saint Iohn, or Saint Peeter, did call is Babilon in respect of the
Christians that were in it at that tyme, I think Sir Francis himself
will blush to say, and consequently the name of Babilon giuen to
Rome when it was impious and pagan, aperteineth nothing to Rome
now after it is Christian; nor hath this fond obiection need of any
further answere.</p>
            <p>For the rest of the rayling and contumelious speach, wherby the
Pope is termed the <hi>proud Priest &amp; Archeprelat of Rome,</hi> touching the words
<hi>Priest and Prelat,</hi> they are names of his dignitie, as they were in Christe
and the Apostles themselues,<note place="margin">About the Popes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</note> who were both Priests and Prelates,
&amp; Arche-prelates also, in that they were more principal then others.
As for <hi>prowd,</hi> that dependeth of the Popes inward disposition,
which our knight ought to haue knowen in all law of good christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
how it standeth, before he auowch it outwardly. For if he
iudge only by the external shew, and outward honor of his estate, he
may as wel condemn of pride, all other princes and great men in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14532:51"/>
world, for admitting honor according to their degrees, and among
others, our present Bishops of England may be called in question
(as they are by the puritanes) for being termed lords, and for the
lord-lyk honor donn vnto them in outward demeanure. To the
Lords also of her Maiesties counsel may be obiected the like, for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
men to kneel vnto them at the counsel table, and such other like
external honor admitted.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>bloody monster,</hi> it is a monstrous slander, and a great monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ositie
of inciuilitie in a gentlemans mouth, so to speake: for it is wel
knowen that the Bishop of Rome that now is, and many of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
in our dayes and eyes, haue vsed and do vse dayly, great cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies
to infinite protestantes, that passe through their states. And as for
blood, I think verely, that there hath bin more shed in onely Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for religion in one year, within these last twenty that haue passed,
then in all the whole twentie, within all the townes, citties, and
states of the Bishop of Rome, and this is easie to be verefied.</p>
            <p>VVell then (Sir knight) you rayl at randon, and litle do you seem
to think or consider what peril of Godes iustice may hang ouer you
for the same.<note place="margin">The peril of Sir Francis rayling. <hi>Exod. 22. Leuit.</hi> 20.</note> You may remember it is written, <hi>principi populi tui non

in England, vntill with in these few yeares, and so is he still
holden by all Catholique kingdomes round about vs, and in ours also
by such as follow the old vniuersal fayth, which if it be true, then
are you in danger of damnation by this your fury. And you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that Saynt Paule was so respectiue of this danger, that hauing
spoken a hastie worde agaynst Ananias, calling him whyted walle,
for an open iniurie donn vnto him in publique iudgement agaynst the
law,<note place="margin">Act. 23.</note> yet when he vnderstood he was high priest (notwithstanding
S Paule wel knew thar his priesthood now was nothing worth, the
old law being abrogated by the death of Christe, he did openly recall
his word agayne, and shewed to be sorowfull for hauing spoken it
agaynst one that bore that tytle. But Sir Francis hath no such feeling
or remorse of conscience in him, for that he is not gouerned by the
same spirit of humilitie and pietie that Saynt Paule was, wherunto
notwithstanding I would gladly persuade him if I might, and for
that respect do mean to alleage vnto him the considerations insuing,
about the Bishop of Rome.</p>
            <p>First, himself in the 31. page of this his libel hath these wordes,
<hi>The Lord from heauen commandeth to all men vpon earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
               <hi>that euery soule should
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14532:52"/>
be subiect to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God, and euerie
power is ordayned of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hovv povver is to be respected.</note> VVhich wordes if they be true, then must
the Popes power also be of God, seing it hath byn an acknowledged
power by all Christendome for so many yeares and ages, &amp; not only
for a lawful power but also for a holy and supreme spiritual power,
and then let men iudge in what cause Sir Francis standeth that not
only resisteth, but reuileth also this sacred power, notwithstanding
that the illation which Saynt Paule inferreth immediatly after the
former wordes, is this, <hi>wherfore he that resisteth power, resisteth Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
&amp; those that resist Gods ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do purchase damnation vnto themselues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More ouer, that saying of Christ vnto the Apostles, <hi>he that heareth
you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 10.</note> 
               <hi>heareth me,</hi> was not spoken only for them selues, but for all their
successors also, that by succession should gouern the churche vnto
the worlds end, as all men wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seqe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the other parte
also of the same sentence, <hi>he that contemneth you, contemneth me,</hi> must
needes in like manner belong vnto the same man. And that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of Rome be successors in the Apostle Saint Peeters seat, is no
lesse manifest to all men of vnderstanding and learning. And albeit
Sir Francis will say presently, that they follow not Saint Peeters steps
(and wil proue it at leisure) yet if that were true, the princes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is not taken away hy his euil life or deportement, for then should
we haue few true princes in the world. But aboue all others it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Christe himself to take away this obiection touching Popes and

sit both Scribes and Pharisees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 23.</note> 
               <hi>and that we should notwithstanding obserue and do

            <p>I say it is harebrain and headlong dealing,<note place="margin">Harebrayne and hed longe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Sir Francis.</note> to runne so furiously in
so da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous a path as this is. For besides that <hi>maledicus,</hi> a railing tongued

agaynst Magistrates,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. &amp; 6.</note> that represent the power of almightie God, and
far yet greater agaynst spiritual magistrates, that haue this authoritie
in a far higher degree then temporal magistrates, but most of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
him that representeth immediately the person of Christe Iesus

Furthermore if all the holy and learned men of Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dom haue
not bin deceiued for so many ages together, as they haue confessed
this general doctrine, of the Pope of Rome his prerogatiue, without
doubt or contradiction: then is Sir Francis out of his way, then is he
in the open path of perdition, then is he furious, frantik and besides
himself, in rayling as he doth. And that this only vniform consent
of such and so many holy learned men gon before vs, were a sufficient
argument to make any man (that were discreet and fearing God)
to enter into doubt (at least of his doing in this behalf) cannot in
reason be denied: and so without doubt would Sir Francis also do, if
his temporal life lay on the bargain as his eternal doth.</p>
            <p>For let me aske Sir Francis, if an herb should be presented to him

            <p>And yet further though this vniuersall consent of Christendome,

            <p>All these thinges put together do wel argue that Saint Peter well

commission geuen by Christ in two distinct places of scripture that
are recorded, besides other perhaps that are not written, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wilbe more euident.</p>
            <p>The first is,<note place="margin">Commissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saynt Peter.</note> where after that glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession made by S Peter of

gouernment of the churche, as the wordes themselues do shew, and
the consent of ancient fathers both Greek and Latin do expound.</p>
            <p>The second place is in Saynt Ihons ghospel, where Christe after
his resurrection gaue to Saynt Peter that preheminence which before
he had promised,<note place="margin">Ioan. 21.</note> for being in the companie of diuers other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Apostles he asked Peter alone, three seueral tymes whether he
loued him more then the rest or no (which holy fathers say was

and the other answering that he loued, &amp;c. Christ three tymes
sayth to him, <hi>pasce agnos meos pasce oues meas,</hi> feed my lambes and
feed my sheep, making him pastor general of all his flock, and
committing the whole churche to his pastoral charge, by those
wordes, as both the wordes themselues do import (being vttered
to Peter alone and with particuler emphasie for him to feed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
flock aboue the rest of the Apostles, as he had thryce byn asked,
whether he loued more then they) and as all antiquitie with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

               <note place="margin">August. in <hi>Ioan.</hi> 21. Chrisost in <hi>Ioan</hi> 21.</note> Christ

not to gouern with superioritie: and secondly to be a common and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14532:55"/>
indifferent commission giuen to all the Apostles equally, and not
to Saynt Peeter aboue the rest, which is aparently false. For albeit

               </gap>nt that this commission <hi>pasce oues meas,</hi> in a general sense
may be and is vnderstood and spoken not only to Saint Peter but also
to all the rest of the Apostles, and not only to them but to all other
inferior pastors besides: yet in preheminence and highest degree of
special authoritie oueral, it is spoken in this place to S. Peter alone,
as hath bin shewed, and consequently also to his successors: and by
the same consequence it followeth in lyke manner, that if Sir Francis
Hastinges and his people be either lambes or sheep of Christe, or do
any way apertain to his flock and fold, they apertain also to the
gouernment and iurisdiction of this vniuersal pastor Saint Peters
successor; agaynst whome he rayleth and rageth so pitifully as in
his booke appeareth.</p>
            <p>And for that all the Christian world hath made euer this most
certayne and infallible deduction,<note place="margin">Saint Peters successors Popes of Rome.</note> that Christ gaue not to Saint Peter
these eminent prerogatiues of authoritie and superioritie for himself
alone, but for his posteritie and successours also that should ensue
him in his seate and charge ouer the church of Christ vnto the
worldes end, for this cause they haue reuerenced and respected so
much the Bishops of Rome, as by all general Councels, fathers,
and Ecclesiastical stories doth appeare: and only certayn broken
heretiques both in old tymes and ours, as guiltie people fearing
their iudges, haue set themselues agaynst them, but euer to ther owne
perdition: among which rable not withstanding if Sir francis Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinges

England (as this man calleth it) for that it hath receiued more singuler
benifits from thence then any one nation in the world besides, to wit,
it hath bin twice conuerted from paganisme to Christian religion, by
the especial diligence, labour, and industrie of the same sea; once in
the time of the Britans, about a hundreth and ninetie years after
Christe: at what time Elutherius that holy Pope and Martyr conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
king Lucius and his subiects by the preaching of Saint Damianus

and his fellowes, sent from Rome to that effect: and the second time,
about fiue hundreth years after, when our predecessors the English
Saxons were conuerted, by Saint Augustine and his fellow preachers,
sent by Saint Gregorye the great, then Bishop of Rome, to the same
end. And if it be most certayn, and cannot be denyed, that these
two benifits rightly considered are the greatest that vnder heauen our
land could receiue from any mortal men, and that the obligation of
this dooble spiritual birth of ours is so much greater then the band we

            <p>VVhich poynt that we may better consider of,<note place="margin">Raging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the Spanish na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I shall first beginne
with that which he vttereth in diuers partes of his libel, agaynst
the whole nation of Spaniards in general, terming them by the
names of <hi>proud, ambitions, bloody, tyrannical, rauening Spaniards, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cursed by God, for that the Pope that cursed man of sinne hath blessed them,
&amp;c.</hi> And in one place he descrybeth them in these wordes: <hi>I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
vnto you, that it is recorded of the Spaniard, that in dissimulation he
surpasseth all nations, till he haue attayned to his purpose, and when he can
once preuayle, he goeth beyond them all in oppression and tyrannie: also that
he disdayneth all other nations, and that in pryde and carnal voluptuosnes, no
nation cometh neer him, and these be his qualities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This our gentlemans censure, gathered out of recordes (as he sayth)
but I would gladly he had cited the author where he found this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
as he ought to haue donne for discharging his fayth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie
in so greeuous an accusation as this is, and that toucheth so
many, if he had regard or respect therof. And hardly do I beleeue
that he hath euer found, or shall fynd, any writer of credit be he
of what nation soeuer) that will shew himself so fond and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
as to set downe by wryting so preiudicial a censure, and so
general a reproche as this is agaynst any nation:<note place="margin">VVhy Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards are maligned.</note> notwithstanding
I know, that the Spaniardes at this day, haue many emulators and
aduersaries, partely for hatred of Catholique religion (which is their
greatest glorie) and partely by reason of their large dominions, which
is not strange, for so had the Romanes also before them, and the
Graecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; Assyria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s before them agayne, when their Monarchies were
potent, <hi>quia virtutis comes inuidia,</hi> as the common prouerb sayth, enuy
followeth vertue and valour: and in this sense our English prouerb
is also most true, it is better to be enuied then pitied. And when the
Roman monarchie was fallen, and the french also, that was set vp
by Charls the great, our English nation had the greatest of any
one of Christendome, for some ages together, when we possessed our
ample olde states and dominions in france, during which tyme, he
that will see the inuectiues made agaynst our English manners,<note place="margin">Speeches of English, vvhen they vvere pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> and
agaynst our proud and tyrannical kynde of proceeding (as then it
was termed) let him but reade ouer the recordes of the french chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14532:56"/>
extant at this day: and yet no reason that these recordes should
condemn or disgrace our whole nation now, nor then neither, when
they were written, being set downe by our aduersaries and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators,
and by those that were either vnder vs, or feared vs, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
were nothing equally affected vnto vs, as many are not at
this day agaynst Spaniards.</p>
            <p>Moreouer if some Spaniardes should be found in deed to haue
some of those vices or defectes which here by their calumniator Sir
francis are named, (as among other nations no man can deny, but
the lyke are also to be found) what reason or equitie is there (to omit
conscience and christianitie, with which this man seemeth to haue
litle to do) what reason is there (I say) that these defectes should
be attributed vniuersally to the whole Spanish nation, wherin
there are to be found thowsandes that haue no part nor fault, as on
the other syde, if some English-men as they passe ouer other
countries, by sea and land at this daye should behaue themselues
scandalously, by gluttonie and drunkennes, (as diuers haue byn
sayd to do) is it a lawfull consequence to say or think, that all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
are such at home, and that these are the qualities of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
nation, as Sir Francis sayth here of the Spaniardes? or to take a
comparison from himself, if one English knight of a noble familie,
haue byn so madheaded, as to make a fantastical booke, stuffed with
ignorances, lyes, and calumniations, is it reason that foraine nations
should iudge hereby, thar all our knightes and nobilitie of England
are so fond and frantik, and haue so litle respect to their honours and
credit as he? I trow no.</p>
            <p>VVherfore as concerning the Spanish nation in general,<note place="margin">Of the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish nation</note> no such
preiudice or slanderous rule can be geuen, as this malignant spirit
setteth downe, for that they are in this poynt as other nations be,
where all sortes of people may be found, some bad and many good:
and if comparisons may be made without offence (for that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
are odious in such affayres between nations) no nation in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
hath more cause to glorie, and geue God thankes for his giftes,
abundantly powred vpon them, both natural, moral, and Diuyne,
temporal and spiritual, for tymes past and present, then the Spanish,<note place="margin">1. Mach. 8.</note>
who haue a countrie both rich, ample, fertile, and potent, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

and in our age, he that will consider after their valiant deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering

that inuaded and oppressed their countrie what Christian Zelous
Princes, Kinges, Emperours, Captaynes, Knightes, &amp; famous sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
they haue yeelded to the world, and do yeeld daylie, and what
store of singular learned writers do appeare from thence from tyme
to tyme, what countries they haue conquered by the sword, and
how many millions of soules they haue gayned to Christ by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
his word in diuers and most remote partes of the world: all
these thinges (I say) put together do make ridiculous and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
this malignant description set downe by Sir Francis, whose
spetial hatred agaynst them is founded in that which of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
is their greatest, to wit, their constancie and zeale in
defence of the catholique religion, for which probablie God hath so
greatly exalted them alredy, aboue other nations of Europe, &amp; will
do more daylie, if they continue that feruour in defending his cause,
notwithstanding any other humane infirmitie or defect in lyfe that as
to men (of what nation soeuer) may happen, which our merciful
lord in regard &amp; recompence of the other rare vertues of zeale iustice
constancie and feruor in his cause, will pardon (no doubt) and geue
grace of true amendement and rising agayne, whyle the prating here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
that scornfully sitteth downe to score vp other mens synnes,
shall walk for his owne to his eternal habitation, prepared in hel, for
that his one malitious and obstinate sinne of heresie (if it may be
called one) prepondereth with Gods iustice more greeuously then
all other infirmities and sinnes put to gither which catholique men do
or may commit of humane frayltie.</p>
            <p>And thus much of this poynt,<note place="margin">Particular obligations of Spaniards</note> may suffice, for if I should ad
to this the ancient loue and amitie of the Spanish nation towardes
vs in tymes past, the large leagues that England hath held with them
heretofore, the great wealth and gaynes we vsed to gather and
reape by their trafique, the noble and bountefull Queens of that
linage maried into England, which aboue all others taken from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne
countries haue byn most gratefull and beneficial to our land
and people; the exceeding charitie of the present king and of his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14532:57"/>
whole nation shewed to our English catholiques abrode, in this
long tyme of bitter banishment, &amp; persecution for their faith; these
thinges (I say) if I should repeat or set out at large, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
help nothing to the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we haue in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d but rather geue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
(tymes standing as they do) and therfore I recount them not
in particular, but leaue them to be considered with pietie &amp; gratitude
by such as are indifferent in these dayes, and to be recorded in the
honorable monumentes of our posteritie.</p>
            <p>And so hauing answered thus much about the iniurie offered to
the Spanish nation (by Sir Francis) in general,<note place="margin">The defence of the King of Spayne in particuler</note> I will passe to the

that his Catholique Maiestie is most free of, and is indewed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

            <p>If you will geue me leaue <hi>(sayth he)</hi> to call to your remembrance the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and meaning of his coming into England, when he came not as an inuader
to conquer but as a frend to fasten a strong league of amitie by a mariage,
I doubt not but to discouer the trecherous crueltie of his hart. <hi>This is Sir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis

            </p>
            <p>But before I set downe his discouerie vnder his owne hand, I

beare himself, by testimonie of all those that knew him, conuersed
with him, or lyued vnder him. And then shall Sir Francis tell his tale
of that he imagineth or faigneth the king would haue don in

discouerie promised of the trecherous crueltie of the kinges hart, we
shall discouer both trecherous cogging and shameles forgerie in
the hart and hand of this counterfayt knight. Thus then I begin
the declaration.</p>
            <p>The conditions of that most famous and royal mariage between
the two greatest Monarches of Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome,<note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mariage vvith the Spanish King.</note> king Philip and Queen
Marie, and the conuentions agreed vpon between both nations, and
between the princes themselues, Quee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Marie, the Emperour Charles,
(then resyding in Flanders) and king Philip, and eche of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
and Parlaments, are yet extant, and for the most part in print:
wherby it may be seen that all those poyntes that this sely fellow
cometh in withall now after the market ended, about the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our realme, the priuie Councel, of what nation they should
be, the condition of our nobilitie, the Parlament, the lawes of the
realme, the portes, castles and garrisons, the officers of the courte and
household, and other lyke circumstances were particulerly treated,
agreed vpon and prouyded for before hand, by all partes. Neither
was there euer any complaynt that the king or his nation brake any
one of them whyle they were among vs, but added rather diuers
benefytes and courtesies of their owne accord aboue that which they
had promised and were bound vnto.</p>
            <p>As for the expences, and for the furniture of the mariage (so much
I meane as came from abrode) as also for the two Spanish and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
nauies that accompanied the king when he came into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
were at his cost and charges vntill they arryued at Portesmouth,
and the whole trayne from thence to winchester, where he met
with the Queen, and the mariage was celebrated, at the charges of
the same King of Spayne.</p>
            <p>All the Spanish nobles and gentlemen that came with the king,
came so furnished with all necessaries and brought such store of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with them, as within two or three monethes after their arryual,
all England was full of Spanish coyne.<note place="margin">King Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips vsage to made the English.</note> The priuie councel of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
was wholie and intirely as it was before, neither was any
Spaniard euer put into it, the officers of the Queens household were
altogether English, the king for his owne affayres, and his other
kingdomes, had a particuler Councel, which interrupted not ours,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14532:58"/>
the nobilitie of our land was exceedingly honoured by him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them had particuler great pensions also yearly from him,
the captaynes and soldiers that he vsed of our nation as namely at
the warre of Saynt Quintins, he honoured highly, and made them
equall in all poyntes of seruice and honor with Spaniardes, and
payd them himself without further charges to England saue only
geuing them their vpper cassockes with the crosse, according to the
custome. The marchantes commonly he made free to enioy and vse
all priuileges and preferments throughout all his kingdomes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and prouinces: and in England he had such care to yeeld our
nation contentment, as he gaue expresse order that if any English
man and a Spaniard fell out, the English should be fauored and the
Spaniard punished, which he caused to be executed with such rigor
as it cost diuers Spaniardes their lyues, when the English were much
more in fault: and I haue heard it spoken by some of the Councel at
that tyme, that Queen Marie was so afflicted diuers tymes with this
partialitie of the kinges towardes the English agaynst his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as it cost her many a bitter teare for verie compassion &amp; shame.</p>
            <p>And so much the more was she moued therewith for that she
saw many English, partly vpon this indulgence of the kinges,<note place="margin">The vsage of English tovvards Span. in Q. Mariestyme</note> and
partly for that being secretly heretiques, they had auersion and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to the Spanish nation, to abuse themselues intollerably in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
most inhumane and barbarous iniuries vnto them: No Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
could walke by night (nor scars by day alone) but he should
be eyther wounded, or thrust between two or three swashbuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
that attended particulerly to those exercyses, and so put in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his lyf. Villanous wordes were ordinarie salutations to
them in the streetes, as also often tymes in churches, but no remedy
was to be had, nor would any man beare Witnes lightly in behalf of
the Spaniard agaynst the English though the iniurie were neuer so
manifest. If any thing were to be bought in the market, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
must paie dooble for it, and for that most Spaniardes drunk
water, they must buy it also dearly in many places, if they
would drink it, and often could not haue it for mony, and diuers
wells were sayd to be poysoned of malice therby to destroy the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes.
Many deuises were vsed to draw Spaniardes into priuate
houses, and familiaritie was offered them to that end, and if any
entred to talke with the wyf, daughter or seruant (as they were thought
prope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se in that kynde) then rushed forth the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d father brother
or master, that lay in wayte with other catchpoles of thesame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14532:59"/>
to apprehend them, and to threaten death or imprisonment
except they redeemed themselues with good store of money. And I
haue heard from the mouth of a greate noble man a Spaniard that was
in England at that tyme and now is a Vyceroy vnder the king that
some English would send their wyues &amp; daughters of purpose into
the fieldes where Spaniards walked, to allure them to talke with
them, and therby to intrap them and get money from them.</p>
            <p>I omit to name more violent meanes of taking purses and playne
roberies and other lyke artes to get the Spaniards money from them
by force, which yet were many and some most barbarous and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to our nation, and the mention and memorie therof maketh
vs blush when in other countries we are told of them, as namely
this that followeth which my self haue heard recounted from a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
himself that is yet alyue, to wit,<note place="margin">The Count of fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tsalida robbed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> the old Count de Fuensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida
cheef steward at this day of the kinges houshold, who being
in England with the king made a great supper one night to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
noble men of his nation, and to some others, and being at the
table mery and fearing nothing (as in a peaceable and ciuil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
it seemed he had no cause) there came rushing in, some
twentie or thirtie maskared good fellowes with their swordes dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,
and commanded that no man should stirre vnder payne of
death, and so kept them all at the table, and their seruantes shut
vp into diuers houses of offices where they were found, vntill the
theeues had ransaked the whole house, and packed vp the siluer
plate that was in store, and so departed.</p>
            <p>And these are the heroical actes and honorable histories which
these noblemen and other strangers do recount of the ciuilitie
and courtesie of our countriemen towardes Spaniards in those
dayes which being obiected vnto vs in all forayne nations where
we trauayle (the french also recounting as bad or worse donne to
them, to whome at that tyme we were open enemies) it cannot
but make modest Englishmen ashamed, and their eares to burne
in respect of the dishonour of our countrie, as also to consider what
fyne frutes,<note place="margin">First frutes of nevv gho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spellers.</note> our new ghospel then freshly planted, and yet in the
bud began to bring forth: for that all this hatred and barbarous
vsage towardes Spaniards and other Catholique forayners, rose prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
vpon the difference of religion lately begonne within our
realme, and these lads as the first professed proselites therof vpon
heate and zeale committed these holy actions, as the first frutes of
so heauenly a seed. But since that tyme we haue had much larger
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14532:59"/>
experience therof, and I presume that most mennes myndes in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
are sufficiently cleared in this case, and if not, let them behold
the behaueour of Sir Francis in this libel, who is an ancient branche
of that plantation.</p>
            <p>And so hauing seen the state of matters how they stood at that
tyme, and in particuler what king Philip had promised to do, and
what he was bound to do, and then what in deed he performed real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whyle he was among vs (which was more in deed then either he
promised or had obligation to performe, as hath byn shewed) let vs
heare now what Sir Francis sayth he would haue donne if he could,
or if his abode had byn longer in England. The tale shall go in his
owne wordes for better declaring his spirit. Thus then he writeth.</p>
            <p>This mariage was sought for and intended also in shew only to strengthen the
hand of the Queen of England,<note place="margin">A discourse of Sir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, of King Philip secret meaning.</note> to bring in the Romish religion and gouernment
into this land, and to establish it with continuance, with purpose and meaning
to ad strength to all the corners of Christendome to continue Poperie where it
was, and to bring it in, where it was not, that so the Arche-prelate of Rome
might hold the scepters and power of all princes and potentates of Christendome
in his hand, to dispose a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his pleasure: but the plottes and practises layd and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
by the Spanish king, had made a wofull proof to England of a further
mark shot at (which was discouered in a letter to some of our nobles, from
a true harted English-man in Spayne) had not God almightie in his rich mercy
preuented their purposes, and defeated them in their determinations, as it shall
appeare hereafter, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is the preface and entrance which Sir Francis maketh to the
discouerie he promiseth of great hydden mysteries, about plottes
and practises not only layd, but also pursued by king Philip whyle
he was in England, which neuer came to light vntill this day,
though at that tyme they were discouered (as he sayth) in a letter to
some of our nobles, from a true harted English-man in Spayne. But
for the credyt of so new and weightie, and incredible a secret, it had
byn good he had named the parties and particularities therof, as wel
who wrote as also who receyued that letter. For first the English-man
in Spayne though he were true harted to the faction of S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
syde (to wit, to the Protestantes) yet might he perhaps not be
so true handed or true tongued at that tyme, or so truly informed
of thinges, or of that authoritie, that this his letter or report may
beare credyt in so great a busines agaynst so great men, it being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vp perhaps at tauerns or porte townes and market places by
some merchantes seruant or factor, or other lyke wandring compai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnon,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14532:60"/>
as well tipled with Spanish seck as with English heresie,
who might wryt these news from Spayne of K. Philip as Iohn Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cols
the minister brought and printed from Rome, and Italy, in our
dayes, of the Pope and Cardinals.</p>
            <p>And that this discouery (if any such were, and that the tale be
not wholly forged by Sir Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis himself) could haue no better ground
then that I haue sayd,<note place="margin">The letter out of Spayn discredited.</note> to wit, the reporte of some vulgar people, or
the coniecture of some particuler discoursiue head, as is euident in it
self, for that this being a most secret designement and drift of the
king himself, and of his priuie Councel, who were all at that day
remayning in England, and had this proiect within their owne
brestes only; how could it be discouered by an English-man from
Spaynerthink you.</p>
            <p>Agayne the nobles in England to whome he sayth the letter was
written, might be such, as probably it may be iudged to haue byn
written of purpose to feed their humors, or to comfort them in
those dayes, or that themselues did procure it to be written and sent
for their credit, or that themselues deuysed it in England, to make
therby the Spaniards more odious and their doinges more suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;<note place="margin">L. Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</note>and to draw by this meanes more English after themselues
to impugne the present state and gouernment: as when the lord
Courtenay Earle of Deuonshyre for missing the mariage of Queen
Marie, beganne to practise, and to think of leauing the land vpon
discontentment, and when the Carewes and other of that crew
fled the realme for conspiracies, to the same effect,<note place="margin">The Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves.</note> such a letter was
much to their purpose. But I shall not need to call in reasons
and circumstances for shewing the vanitie of this letter, for that the
manifest and shameles falshoodes which it relateth, will easely
discouer the forgerie, as also the forge it self, from which it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:
I will follow then the continuation of Sir Francis narration,
in his own wordes.</p>
            <p>Now to proceed <hi>(sayth he)</hi> to lay open the right mark that in deed this
king shot at,<note place="margin">A malitious forgerie agaynst King Phil.</note> though when he made way to ioyne in mariage with Queen
Marie, he made semblance of great conscience to Catholique religion, and
great care to bring the whole land into the obedience therof, and seemed to
glorie much when it was brought to passe, as his letter to his holy father
at Rome written out of England doth make shew, wherin he expresseth what
a worthie woorke he had donne, when he had drawen the nobles &amp; commons
of the land to submit themselues to his holinesse as their cheef (those are his
wordes) yet litle did the nobles and commons know what was intended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14532:60"/>
them by this catholique childe of Rome, for vnder this colorable name of
catholique religion, was hidden the ambitious humor of a most proud vsurping ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
whose resolution was vpon mature deliberation and consultation with his
machiuilian counsellors to seek by al the possible kinde means he could, to win the
principal of our Nobles to affect him, and in their affection to possesse him of the
crown, and so to establish him in an absolute power ouer poor England, and to
bring this to passe, he decreed to spare neither cost nor kindenes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hetherto is the asseueration of Sir Francis concerning king Philips
intention to gain our crowne, but neuer a syllable more of proofe
then you haue heard before, to wit, his owne woord and bare asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which he taking to be sufficient, passeth ouer presently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
&amp; exaggerate the dangerous effectes that would haue ensued
vpon vs when the king should haue gotten his pretence.</p>
            <p>But I must pul him by the sleeue &amp; request him to stay, &amp; prooue
a litle better, that the king had this intention to get the kingdome
as he sayth, for if it were a mature deliberation and consulted also
with his counsel in England (as this discouerer sayth) then some act
and monument belike is extant to testifie the same, or at leastwise
some witnes, or other firm argument fit to prouè it, or if not, how
could the true harted English-man know it in Spayn, and write it to
the Nobles of England? Or with what face can our rash and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongued
English knight professe to know it now, and to wryte it so
confidently? Shall so great, so greeuous, so haynous a slander, against
so mightie, so munificent, so bountiful a Monarch, passe out to the
world, vpon a bare assertion and malignant interpretation of one
English <hi>hastie-hote-spurre,</hi> that sheweth malice in euery syllable, and
turneth euen the kings loue and fauours to our nation, &amp; his expences
and benifits towards our people, vnto a deceitful meaning? And v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> These are the seuen deadly sinnes which Sir Francis inforceth out
of his Spanish letter as certayne to haue insued, if the king had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the crowne, which yet whyles he had the crowne did not insue,
as the world knoweth, for that they were prouyded for before hand

would haue byn foreseen and prouided for also by the same

them to passe the crowne to the king of Spayn, seing Sir
Francis confesseth that this matter was ment to be wrought not by
force but by sweet meanes and benifites, and by allurement of the
nobilitie by his Maiestie. Most fond therfore or forged is this letter
from the true harted man in Spain, who suggested feares already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented:
but much more ridiculous is he in setting down certain
monstrous bugges of taxes to be imposed vpon the English nation,
which yet by all probability were neuer though vpon, nor past by
mannes imagination, though most childishly he avowcheth, that
they are payed also in Spain. For thus he writeth.</p>
            <p>A taste wherof <hi>(of these intolerable taxes)</hi> I will giue you <hi>(sayth Sir
Francis)</hi> as that for every chimney and other place to make, fier in, as ouens, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,
Smiths forges, and such others, a frinch crown was yearly paid to him.
He had also powling pence for all manner of corn, bread, beef, mutton, capons,
pigges, geese, hennes, ducks, chicken, butter, cheese, egges, aples, peares, nuttes,
beere, wine, and all other things whatsoeuer he feed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if he did it must cost him six shillinges eight pence, though the capon was not
worth twelue pence; and so <hi>toties quoties:</hi> and these be the benifits and blessings
that this catholique king sought to bring in hether by his absolute authoritie sought
for.</p>
            <p>If a man did not see these things written and printed with Sir
Francis Hastinges name vnto them, he would neuer imagin a man of
his name,<note place="margin">About taxes paied to the King of Spayne.</note> howse, and calling, would publish such childish toyes
and manifest vntruthes to the world. For who is there that hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
Spain (as many English-men haue donne in these our dayes)
which knoweth it not to be an open shameles lye, that for euery
place to make fyer in, as ouen, fornace, and the like, a french crown
is to be payed? In the kingdoms of Castil and Andaluzia there is no

downe, nor do they pay for euery place of making fyer, but one

twenty fyers within it.</p>
            <p>Touching his powling pence vpon thinges that are solde, there is

there is litle vse in Spayne, &amp; the simple fellow would needes faine
his account after the English manner, but among other toyes the

it is not probable that they would appoynt such a penaltie

            <p>My author <hi>(sayth he)</hi> doth further vnfold this kinges trecherous purpose to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes

in beggerie, and not to suffer one to lyue here, that was borne in twentie yeares
before, but either to destroy them, or to make them slaues among the Moores,
the colour wherof was because they were borne out of the Catholique churche of
Rome. And to make vp the measure of all impietie, and the faster to set his crowne
vpon his head from remouing (if he had gotten it) he layd his plot to destroy our
deare Soueraigne ladie Queen Elizabeth, hauing decreed with himself, that
neither she nor any of that cursed nation (so he termed it and yet the Popes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines

            <p>And thus you see that vnder the colour of this mariage saluation of soules

            <p>This is your sottish and impudent narration Sir Francis, for what

all the world notwithstanding knoweth the king to haue byn at that

in the third incounter, as also that verie litle plotting of the kinges

I haue alleaged, he fynding her in disgrace and in prison at VVood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock

when he came into England, and hardly pressed about wyats

is most barbarous ingratitude in this vnciuil knight to pay the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
protection of her person, which his Maiestie yealded to her grace
in those dayes of her distresse, with these intolerable slanders, and

to wonder how so infamous a libel could be suffered by supreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to passe to the print, espetially conteyning diuers other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal,
reprochefull, contempteous, and villanous calumniations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
so great and potent a prince, as the king catholique of
Spayne is.</p>
            <p>And namely that where this good fellow hauing told a story how
one Fabritius the Roman Captayne refusing the poysoning of his

he sent the sayd physitian bound to Pirrhus himself, and then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

            <p>But the king of Spain delt not so with the Queen our mistris when her poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

            <p>By which wordes he would haue men to imagin that his catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

probably be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the king of Spain. Neither did euer Lopus giue
any such signification or suspition, at his death, or before, of the king
of Spaines priuitie: nor was he a man to haue correspondence in
Spayn, being knowen to be a Iew in religion &amp; fled from those parts,
and was enimy to the king in all respects as wel touching religion as
the afaires of Portugal, and onely England is the receptacle of such
people at this day: nor had his catholique Maiestie any Embassador
or other agent or correspondence in England, to plot such treaties:
nor euer was it heard, that he would hearken to such base wayes of
reuenge vpon his enimyes. And therefore all this put together doth
make it more then Turkish impietie to put in print such infamous

only treated but concluded also a most honorable peace and frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
and the great most Christian King of France, shewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
worthie of that name, hath remedied the very roote of al ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
springing to his noble realme before, by returning to the
vnion of the Apostolique sea of Rome, which sea (as commonly it
falleth out) hath byn the principal meanes of this so great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
a good to all those nations that are included within that peace
and league, which are many and great as by the articles thereof doth
appeer. And no lesse curteously and honorably is her Maiestie inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
also to the same, and all that desire the true good both of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
state, and crowne, do wish and hope that it may take effect.
And truly neuer could this weightie afaire be treated (as it seemeth)
with more honor or facilitie then at this present instant, times and
matters standing as they do: and so fit a meanes and mediator, as is
the mightie king of France occurring for the purpose, potent and
grateful with all the extremes. For with England and her Maiestie,
he cannot but be so, in respect of matters and frendships past: with
Spain he is also to be presumed now, by meanes and vertue of this
new peace and great league concluded, with his holinesse of Rome,
all christendome knoweth him to be, as well in respect of his being
a catholique, as also for many particuler and extraordinary tokens of
loue, which his holinesse hath shewed towards his person.</p>
            <p>The persons also and qualities of the parties with whome this
atonement is or were to be treated,<note place="margin">Qualities of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be dealt vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> are such as do greatly facilitate
the enterprise, and confirme the hope, that all men haue of good
successe.</p>
            <p>For if for many ages God haue placed in the seat of Saynt Peeter,<note place="margin">Pope Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment viij.</note>
a meek, milde, sweet, and holy man, this Pope Clement the eight
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14532:65"/>
is one, knowen to be a man without gawle, enmitie wrath or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
of singuler pietie &amp; zele in Gods cause, and most tender har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
towards them that are out of the way, especially in heresy, of
whome he suffereth diuers with his owne particuler licence to come
to Rome, and to his owne presence, and vseth them with all manner
of curtesie and fatherly tendernes, dismissing them again with much
kindenes, and diuers benefits, as by experience we haue seene.</p>
            <p>As for the king Catholique of Spain, who knoweth him not to be
<hi>Salomon pacificus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">K. Phillip.</note> that peaceable and wise Salomon of this our age?
who not only hath bin peaceable in himself during the time of his
so long a gouernment, offering molestation and warre to none (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
prouoked in his owne defence) but also hath kept diuers other
states round about him in peace likewise, as by those of Italy hath
bin manifestly seen vpon diuers occasions: and as for his facility to
make peace, where any reasonable conditions are offered, it hath bin
sufficiently seen in this, lastly made with France, with restoring of so
many important townes and states which he possessed of that crown
and for his constancie in keeping peace once made, all former times of
his raigne haue giuen testimony, and so will this (I doubt not) and
the future time also in preseruing inuiolably this peace now knit vp
with the king most christian, and his alyes and dependants.</p>
            <p>So as with neither of these princes is there any cause of dout either
of great difficultie, or of fraud or of breache, if this treatie might be
concluded: and much lesse of the dutifull behaueour of English Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
both at home and abrode, if it please her Maiestie and your
Lordships to come to some moderation and peaceable manner of
proceding with them.<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gland their cheef desyre</note> In which poynt their first and highest desire

which the most Christian king of France hath taken of late; to wit,

of Rome, mother of all true vnion among Christians, for that
by this act only all difficulties and ielousies, both domestical and
forrayn depending of religion were ended &amp; taken away. But if for
our sinnes this cannot be, or not so soone as is desired, then their
humble petition will be that at least they may haue the same libertie
and fauour in England for their consciences, as Protestantes haue in
France and in other states of the Empire at this day vnder catholique
kinges and Emperours; which petition seemeth so reasonable, so
easie, and so profitable to the realme it self, and so honorable to

yet other mennes hope is, that your Lordships and others
of the wiser and grauer sort of the realme will consider and suggest
to her Maiestie what reason and humanitie requireth, and not what
the furious passion of those men demandeth; who cease not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame

would be content for satisfying their malice, so they might obtayne

agaynst our Saueour (espetially if they found a fit Pilate to grant it)
to cry with them, <hi>Sanguis eorum super nos, &amp; super Filios nostros,</hi> let their

            <p>But your Lordships I presume be of a far different mynde and

Aboue a hundreth and thirtie English priestes of the only seminaries
beyond the seas (as most men accounte) haue lost their lyues in this

of some vulgar or passionate people, that consider nothing but the

their consciences clearing them before their sayd mayster, from
all such act, meaning or intention of treasons, as falsly was layd
agaynst them; and so much the more willingly they went to the

haue put the same desyre in foure tymes as many, of their owne

All which groundes and principles, cannot, but lay before your

and the future I feare will declare the same much more, if

            <p>And as these things are manifest in themselues, so is it also no lesse
euident, that the only or principal meane to preuent these dangers,
were to mittigate somwhat these acerbities now, to the end that men

either come to be all of one opinion, or at leastwise to agree in some

which is impossible to do while matters of religion are pursued with
such hostilitie, as for many years they haue bin.</p>
            <p>To which consideration there commeth also an other of no lesse
moment in myn opinion, which is, that her Maiestie hauing raigned
now a goodly number of years (being neer the one and fourtie of her
scepter) as she followeth fast on the rate of Octauianus Augustus
yeares of Empire,<note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Aug. and other kings.</note> so would she imitate his sweetnes and felicitie
also in disposing his later yeares (euen from the number of fourtie
that her Maiestie is now at) to the exhilerating of all her people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
as he did, and therby came to be so deare, &amp; so intirely beloued
of all, as the publique teares of all did testifie at his death, all crying
and wishing, that either he had neuer bin borne, or neuer dyed, neuer
bin their Emperor, or neuer left to be, referring the former parte of
their wish vnto the beginning of his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which had bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicial
to their common wealth, and the second to his latter end,
which was most grateful to all.</p>
            <p>And this particuler point of Augustus his proceeding,<note place="margin">Kings of England.</note> diuers noble,
kings also of her Maiesties progenitors haue indeuored to imitate by
special dissignement, &amp; namely the two famous Henryes the fourth
and seuenth, and Edward also the fourth, who albeit they entered
by dint of sword, and had many sharp bickerings for diuers yeares,
with their oposite factions, yet all three of them so disposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to clemencie towards their later dayes, as they were most dear
euen to them that had bin their enimies, and oposit at their first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

for that she neither entered the crowne by force of armes,
nor had she the catholiques of her realme against her therin,<note place="margin">In the 6. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.</note> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were the people that principally &amp; with most harty affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
assisted her Maiestie to the quiet and peaceable possession of the
same, as in another place more at large hath bin declared. And euer

may deale with their neighbour in loue and confidence; when our
noble and worshipful gentlemen abrode may returne home, &amp; shew

trauel with lyke libertie where it seemeth them best for increase of

may visit forrayne vniuersityes without restraint, and strangers come
