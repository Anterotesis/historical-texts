         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have read your <hi>Anatomy of the Dutch Deſign,</hi> with as much
patience as a <hi>true Member of the Church of England</hi> could
be ſuppoſed to have on ſuch an Occaſion, and I cannot
forbear telling you I am a little Diſſatisfied with it, and in
part the Reaſons why. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would gladly have known the
Name of this <hi>true Member</hi> of our Church, and of his <hi>Perſon of
Quality too,</hi> for whoſe ſatisfaction this piece of <hi>Anatomy</hi> was
compoſed. <hi>2ly.</hi> Why it comes out with <hi>ALLOWANCE</hi> rather
than with a <hi>Licenſe,</hi> which is our legal word. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
Why <hi>Randal Taylor,</hi> and not <hi>H. H.</hi> is the Publiſher? Theſe are
ſmall Queries, but you know we Church of <hi>England-men</hi> have
been ſo long haunted with <hi>Ghoſts</hi> and <hi>Hobgoblins,</hi> and <hi>Wolves
in Sheeps cloathing,</hi> that we are apt to <hi>Anatomize</hi> all Papers that
come forth with <hi>ALLOWANCE;</hi> and if the inſide do not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the outſide, we cry a <hi>Jeſuite in Maſquerade;</hi> and then all the
World is on the Gaze to obſerve what the Bontefeu would be at.</p>
            <p>Well, Sir, I have rubb'd my Eyes this morning, and I am
ready to hear what it is you have to ſay, <hi>To Enquire into the
original Cauſes of the Diſcontent of the Church of</hi> England <hi>at ſome
late Proceedings, or to ſearch into the Grounds, why His Majeſty
deſires to Eſtabliſh Liberty of Conſcience, was ſo ſtifly oppoſed, were
to re-kindle Inteſtine Conteſts, which ever were, and much more
NOW are to be Avoided?</hi> Why, Sir, is it even ſo? Muſt all that
has been done by the <hi>Red-Letter-men</hi> ſince the Defeat of the
<hi>Weſtern</hi> Rebellion, be ſo cleverly conveyed away <hi>Now</hi> as never
more to be thought of? <hi>Some</hi> few <hi>late proceedings</hi> and <hi>Liberty
of Conſcience</hi> are ſoft Words, and ſurely theſe Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-men</hi>
are not ſo hard-hearted, as to remember <hi>Now</hi> ſuch
ſmall matters as theſe, <hi>how ſtifly</hi> ſoever they <hi>oppoſed them.</hi> In
truth, Sir, you are a pleaſant Gentleman, and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to his <hi>Holineſs</hi> for his Confectioner. An <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre,
or a <hi>German</hi> Deſign to ſubvert the Laws of a Nation, or
a <hi>French</hi> gentle re-eſtabliſhment of Catholick Religion thus
ſoftly and ſweetly worded, would go glibly down with a good-Natured
Heretick.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> the <hi>Ferment,</hi> and the <hi>Commotions</hi> in the next
Section are ſhewn in ſuch an huddle of confuſion, as I know not
what you mean, only I perceive it is ſo expreſs'd, becauſe you
were upon the Wing for <hi>Holland,</hi> and had no leiſure to talk of
what had been done in <hi>England;</hi> but <hi>Diſcontents</hi> there were,
and the Plaguy <hi>Dutchmen</hi> were told of them by a Party <hi>of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and Scotch Male contents.</hi> Why had it not been for them,
the <hi>Reverend Fathers</hi> of <hi>England</hi> might have done what they
had pleaſed, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have ſo little ſenſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>they would never have regarded us, or at leaſt not have
put themſelves to the charge of a dozen Flyboats or Herring-Buſſes,
to Propagate it, eſpecially the Church of</hi> England <hi>as by Law Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,</hi>
pag. 8. But theſe Male-contents told them that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm
was to be Ruin'd here under the pretence of <hi>Liberty
of Conſcience;</hi> and beſides, they had a mighty pair of Bellows, and
the Rogues kept ſuch a tooting and blowing, that at laſt they
kindled a Fire in that Wet Country, and a Flame of Zeal burſt
out; for you muſt know the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have ſome <hi>Compaſſion,</hi>
and a little <hi>Zeal,</hi> though they have not one dram of Religion.
Why, who can help this?</p>
            <p>Well, What did the Reverend Fathers in the mean time in
<hi>England?</hi> Why, they made uſe of <hi>Re-enforcements,</hi> when they
perceived neither <hi>His Majeſty's Word, now the Weight</hi> of their
<hi>Reaſons could prevail.</hi> Now, Sir, What do you mean by <hi>Re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements?</hi>
Why, they Turn'd all that would not Comply,
out of all Employments, ſent Soldiers to Quarter in all places
that would not Addreſs; Reformed the Corporations once and
again; and ſent Seven of the Biſhops to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and they
would have ſent all the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge to the
Devil too, but when they would not go, they ſent them a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
as much as in them lay; and were going to Adminiſter
the ſelf ſame Phyſick to all the Inferior Clergy of <hi>England.</hi> I
pray, Sir, were not theſe your Re enforcements? Are not theſe
Excellent Remedies againſt the Fumes of Diſcontent?</p>
            <p>Well, all this was in order to gain it ain Parliamentary Way, but
then the Male-Contents in <hi>Holland, plyed their Correſpondente
here with ſubtle well-penn'd Treatiſes,</hi> and made <hi>ſuch an Allarm,
that neither Church-men nor Diſſenters would cloſe with them.</hi> Alas,
alas! We had taken ſuch care of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preſſes, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Male-content in <hi>England</hi> durſt whiſper; and we had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
Honeſt <hi>Henry Care,</hi> and many—, another Doughty
Scribler, to plague the Nation with fulſome Declamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and the <hi>Teſts;</hi> we had alſo hired ſome
Preachers to inſtruct the Brethren in their Sermons; and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Pen</hi> wrote, and preached, and travell'd, ſpent himſelf, his
money, and his time in this Weighty Affair: We had ſent
Commiſſioners to inſpect the Levies made by Juſtices of the
Peace, and others to reform the Corporations, and ſome Horſe
loads of Pamphlets we had diſtributed into ſeveral Counties of
<hi>England,</hi> and Suborn'd Men to Addreſs in behalf of themſelves
and others; and after all, two or three paultery Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
in <hi>Holland,</hi> put out now and then a ſingle Sheet of Paper
which was well Penn'd, and ſpoild all again. In truth <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father</hi> this is a ſad Story.</p>
            <p>You muſt know the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are a ſort of Pagans who Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
nothing but <hi>TRADE,</hi> and the Rogues took up a conceit
that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were going to ſet up ſuch a <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> as they had lately Erected in <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>this would
prove very prejudicial to them in their Traffick, and draw away their
people.</hi> Now as ſoon as the Butter-Boxes perceived the Wind
was in that Door, they ſmelt out our Deſigns; and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were for obſtructing all good Correſpondence between the
Fathers of the Society and the People of <hi>England,</hi> and fearing
the Church of <hi>England</hi> Party were in the Plot with the Jeſuits,
<hi>their Politicians,</hi> to Out-wit us, <hi>procured ſome Extremities of Tryal
and Diſrepute to be inflicted upon the Church of</hi> England-men. But
who were the Inſtruments imployed, the Lord knows. And
beſides, they buzzed the Diſſenters in the Ear that the Jeſuits
<hi>had no real kindneſs for them,</hi> and that the Severities heretofore
uſed by the Church of <hi>England</hi> Party againſt the Diſſenters,
were very great, and that there was a Lady in <hi>Holland</hi> who
might one day be Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and then it would be a
fitter Seaſon to ſet up Liberty of Conſcience. Thus all our
Proffers were ſlighted, and it was believed the <hi>holy Fathers</hi>
were meer Cheats: And the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in all probability will
keep their Trade and their People too, which poor <hi>England</hi> ſo
much wants.</p>
            <p>Juſt about this time you muſt know the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60860:2"/>
born, and thereupon the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the States being
very Jealous that a Parliament would ſettle <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi>
meerly to prevent that Project, they raiſed a Report the Prince
was a <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> and not Content with this, they took ſpeedy
Reſolves for <hi>the Security of their ſeveral Intereſts,</hi> and <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid the deſign of this Invaſion from that very period.</hi> In truth,
Reverend Father, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are a parcel of Lewd People,
but ſeeing your Intereſt is very great in <hi>France, Spain</hi> atd <hi>Italy,
I</hi> would adviſe you to get a Liberty of Conſcience Setled in
thoſe Countries by way of Repriſals; and <hi>I</hi> dare Warrant you
that you will Seve<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely revenge their Perfidity, and have many
Thanks into the bargain; and go very near to Ruine <hi>Holland,</hi>
which is a little, wet, dirty, cold Country, and not worthy
your Reverences regard.</p>
            <p>You muſt know this Deſign was carried ſo cloſely that our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
not having the cuſtody of their Conſcience, we heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it till the <hi>French Kings</hi> Ambaſſador fonnd out the Project,
and thereupon we fell to Work, and getting a fat Dutchman
into the <hi>Savoy,</hi> we Diſſected him, in one of the Ventricles of
his Heart we found <hi>Trade,</hi> and in the other <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi>
and thereupon we ordered our Secretary, who is a true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to publiſh it in his <hi>Anatomy,</hi>
where you may find it, page the 7th. We diſcovered at the
ſame time that the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> was Ambitious; That he had Aſſum'd
the <q>Glorious Title of Protector of the Proteſtant Religion,
and Defender of the Engliſh Liberties.</q> And laſtly (which is
a Secret) <q>That he deſigned to ſet <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> at a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,
and by an Invaſion by force or ſtratagem, to get ſome
of our Ports.</q> Now, Reverend Father, <hi>I</hi> return you my thanks
for theſe important Diſcoveries. But for what follows about
Invading and Conqueſt, and what dangerous things they are,
your Reverence might have ſpared your Pious labour, for <hi>I</hi> have
read of them elſewhere before. Only <hi>I</hi> am glad there is no
danger of having any of my Neighbours hanged for reading the
Prince's Declaration, becauſe it ſeems he has not vouchſafed
to give <q>any previous intimation of the Grounds of the War,
as the Laws of Honour oblige,</q> pag. 10. So that the Fathers
are forced to diſſect his Deſigns, to find out the Reaſon, and to
hang out the Bloody Towels and Napkins they wiped their
Knives and Fingers on, to ſtir up the Courage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <q>Sythes and Plow-ſhares to oppoſe him.</q> Very Elegant!</p>
            <p>Your Tranſcript out of <hi>Cotton,</hi> concerning the Sufferings of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt; and out of <hi>Camden</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Saxons, I</hi> have no occaſion for. But that about
<hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> is very Edifying, if your Reverence had
been pleaſed to have aſſigned the Cauſe as well as the Effect.
Which was this, The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Dillinghen</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> was not that which in the
Year 1530. was exhibited to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were not to enjoy any Liberty of Conſcience which
was only granted to thoſe who embraced that Confeſſion which
was then exhibited. The Emperor hereupon endeavoured to
re-ſetle the Romiſh Religion <hi>Vi &amp; Armis,</hi> but <hi>Guſtavus</hi> came
into <hi>Germany,</hi> as you ſay, and made foul work: And at laſt the
Emperor was forced to Acknowledge theſe Proteſtants had a
Right to the ſame priviledges had been granted to their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.
So here, dear Sir, the Jeſuits were neither for Liberty
of Conſcience, nor keeping Faith with Hereticks, though our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Fathers have more Grace, thanks to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
and St. <hi>Loyola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page the 17. you tell us they (the <hi>Hollanders)</hi> 
               <q>were never
known to have any more than the outſide and ſhew of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that whilſt they make long Prayers that God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
them to deſtroy Idolatrous Worſhip <hi>(i. e.</hi> Popery) they
commit the Higheſt Sacrilege, and deſign not only to devour
Widdows Houſes, but already have divided amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Eſtates of all ſuch as they know are the Eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
in Loyalty to the King. In truth,</q> Sir, I will neither que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
your Sincerity, nor your Affections to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but
I would be glad to know where you had your Intelligence,
and who thoſe Eminent Gentlemen for Loyalty are, whoſe
Eſtates are ſo much more ſacred than the Widdows Houſes?
This and the Diviſion too, may be true, but where did your
Reverence learn it?</p>
            <p>Your Politick Conſiderations, from pag. 17. to pag. 20. I
return you again juſt as <hi>I</hi> received them, becauſe I have no
Commiſſion to enter into a Treaty with you about things
which perhaps ſhall never exiſt any where but in your luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant
Fancy. But your Reverences Harangue to the Citizens
of <hi>London,</hi> is ſo very pleaſant, I cannot forbear tranſcribing
a little of it. <hi>Theſe come not to bring us Rich Commodities,
but Fire and Sword, and the Hands and Claws of Harpyes.</hi> Now
what are theſe ſame <hi>Harpyes</hi> that have Hands and Claws too?
Reverend Sir, I think I have ſeen a Picture of a Jeſuit with
bloody Hands and <hi>Claws</hi> inſtead of Feet. Now if the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
ſhould bring us a Cargo of theſe Animals, we ſhould
e'n deſire them to carry them back again, no <hi>Monky,</hi> nor <hi>Fire</hi>
and <hi>Sword</hi> being half ſo Miſchievous. <hi>Conſider, I pray you,</hi>
Oh! <hi>Grave and Rich Citizens, what you ſhall barter with them,
do they offer you Security of the Proteſtant Religion? This you
enjoy already and may ſo without their carnal and cruel Swords.</hi>
True, Reverend Sir, to your great Grief we do enjoy it; and
may ſtill do ſo, though neither our Penal Laws nor our Teſts
are repeal'd, which by the grace of God neither their Carnal
Swords nor your Spiritual Shams ſhall deprive us of. <hi>What
is it then you expect from them? Is it not much better that you
are defended by the Trained Bands, a part of your Selves, than
by</hi> Swedes <hi>and</hi> Germains <hi>filling your Streets, and poſſeſſing your
Houſes and Stores?</hi> I pray, Sir, How old is your Reverence?
If you are one of the School-Boys of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> you may in
time prove a pretty tollerable Popiſh Orator at the rate things
now are; but if you are above the diſcipline of a Ferula, I
deſpair of you. We know very well the Convenience of our
Trained-Bands, and have not forgot they ſhould have been
taken away as uſeleſs ſoon after <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, and
that they were ſuppreſs'd when <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and reſtored with the <hi>Charter</hi> the other day: As for the
<hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Germains</hi> poſſeſſing our Houſes and Stores, it is an
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Inſinuation, and worthy of your Reverence. But, dear
Sir, did we enjoy all our Priviledges when our Charter was
in the Kings hands, have your Reverence forgot the late
Changes in <hi>October</hi> and <hi>February</hi> laſt, and the Reaſons of that?
Is it a part of our Priviledges to be turn'd out becauſe we
will not promiſe to repeal our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Tests</hi> which are our
beſt Securities againſt the <hi>holy Society?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A new Set of Traders will fill the Exchange.</hi> Sir, I believe
you are much more concern'd for the <hi>Savoy</hi> than the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</hi>
Page 21. <hi>You ſay they have watched the Critical Seaſon
of our Diſcontents, which they have fomented to Wound us on
our Blind-ſide.</hi> I pray, Sir, who cauſed theſe Diſcontents?
Why ſhould the Church of <hi>England</hi> be more ſuſpected now
than in the beginning of his Majeſties Reign? Why, you will
ſay they are diſcontented, who has done this, they are not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60860:2"/>
diſcontented without great cauſe; private perſons may, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Men never do take pet at ſmall things, never was
Prince received with more Loyalty, or defended with more
Bravery than this King was by the Church of <hi>England-men;</hi>
his Brother only Excepted as to the firſt, whoſe many years
abſence contributed to the Enhancing the value of his Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
Whence then comes this Cloud of Diſcontents?
What, has your Reverences occaſion'd it? Why then a little
Juſtice done upon you, I will undertake, ſhall appeaſe the
Church of <hi>England-men.</hi> God and their King are the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
they worſhip. And I am confident they of all the World
never will have a quarrel againſt the King, it is only a few ſmall
<hi>Politico's,</hi> ſuch as your Reverence, F. P. <hi>R. B.</hi> &amp;c. ſmall Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
for which a Crown ought not to be hazarded, and ſome
others not to be Named by me, but by the Three Eſtates.</p>

Miſtakes or Suſpition that ſome encouragement had been from</hi>
Holland, <hi>that had occaſion'd ſome Obſtinacy, yet ſince now by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Acts of Grace, the King hath made a reparation upon the
full diſcovery of the Dutifulneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 22. If any ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Are we ſtill at Ifs and Ands whether we have been ill
Treated or no? But it was for our <hi>Obſtinacy.</hi> Your humble
Sevant Sir, We might have been more pliant to your Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and then we ſhould have been better treated. But we
were ſuſpected to have borrowed this Obſtinacy from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Yes, we did not know the value of our Religion and our
Laws till <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> ſet the price, and <hi>G. B.</hi> ſent over an
Apology. Well, But we have had <hi>reparation.</hi> Why, Sir, who
was Hanged for this Attempt upon us, who was tried? Is the
Diſpencing Power, or the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion, or the
Mock Tryal declared Illegal; may not all be Acted over again <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Morrow? Sir, we do not deſire reparation from our King, but
We think it reaſonable nevertheleſs, that we ſhould be well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
for the future.</p>
            <p>When this is done Sir, you may aſſure his Majeſty (if you
can come ſo near him) that the Engliſh Loyalty, Valour, and
Bravery, are not dead. But to fight our ſelves into eternal
Slavery; to ruin all the hopes of Redreſs for ever at one blow
in one day, will need a better Orator than you to perſwade
as: We are no Strangers to either your faith or practiſes. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
Q. <hi>Marys</hi> days, and the maxims of another <hi>Mary,</hi> who
was Regent of <hi>Scotland</hi> in her time: <hi>That Promiſes was not to be
kept with Hereticks, and that if ſhe could make an honeſt excuſe after
the fact was committed, ſhe would take it upon her Conſcience to kill
and undo all that Sect,</hi> Spotſwood. pag. 123. And accordingly
ſhe broke her Faith ſo often, that at laſt they eaſed her of that
trouble, by refuſing evermore to truſt her. The ſame maxim
was uſed in the Low-Countrys, by <hi>Philip</hi> the II. In <hi>France,</hi>
in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and indeed where not: So that we
ſhall have good reaſon to expect ſomething more than a bare
Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Sr. you are not to think that the Wheede in your 23. pag.
will ſignifie much: But whereas you tell us, <hi>there has been no
blot upon his</hi> (the Church of Englands Mans) <hi>Scutcheon upon
that account ſince the Reformation:</hi> That is, they were never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal
to the Crown: I muſt refer you to the <hi>NEW TEST</hi> of
the Church of Englands Loyalty, printed with <hi>Allowance;</hi> the
whole deſign of which Paper is to brand us, with Setting up
<hi>Jane Seymore</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom he called a <hi>Known Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi>
I ſuppoſe the Church of England has good reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Repairations for that Slander. If there be <hi>indeed no blot
in her Seutcheon ſince the Reformation.</hi> I aſſure you Sir, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Libel will one day be reckon'd for, if you do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Juſtice, by an Examplary and Voluntary Correction of the
<hi>Author,</hi> the <hi>Allower,</hi> and <hi>Publiſher</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Pag. the 24th. you <hi>tell us it hath hitherto been reputed an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
and Scandalous Cenſure, that We would be no longer Loyal, than
whilſt we had a Prince of our own Religion.</hi> But then this has
been thrown in our Diſh ſeveral times ſince his now Majeſty
came to the Crown, by R. C. with <hi>Allowance,</hi> notwithſtanding
all our Zeal and Fidelity to him; and has any Repairation been
yet made for this Injury? Methinks before you teach our
Clergy what they are to Preach, you ſhould have taken care of
this. It has been reputed injurious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By whom? Oh by
Church of England Men, and not by R. C's, you may be ſure.

            <p>Pag the 25. <hi>he tells us Liberty of Conſcience and the Church of
England are already Setled:</hi> True Sir, and that is the very
very reaſon of all the Strugle; to get our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
becauſe they ſecure both theſe things, tho' not alike
to all Proteſtants. Now theſe Gentlemen pretended to give
the Deſſenters more Liberty to obtain their Aſſiſtance againſt
the Church Party for the Repeal; but the Deſſenters knew
theſe Huckſters, and would not Bite: Hence all the Rage againſt
the whole body of Proteſtants, eſpecially againſt the Diſſentes.</p>
            <p>But Sir, they know very well you have given them what
you can never re-call, and they laugh at your Rage.</p>
            <p>As to the Reports, pag. 26th and your Anſwers, I have
nothing to ſay to them: As for what you <hi>affirm, that ſome of
theſe things the King had reſolved to have granted before the ſitting of
the intended Parliament, and before he had the leaſt intelligence of
the Dutch Preparations, as teſtimonies that he deſigned the Protection
of the Church of England;</hi> And that this was known to ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Honour and Credit, pag. 27. This is the beſt thing in all
your Book, and might perhaps have been believed, if theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Perſons had been named. pag. 28th. We are told the King
<hi>Judgeth that Liberty of Conſcience is the very Fundamental of that
happineſs which he wiſheth to his People;</hi> it is very odly worded,
but let that paſs; His People may enjoy this Liberty without
Repealing either <hi>Laws</hi> or <hi>Teſts,</hi> as they now do: And it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
many refuſed to joyn in the Repeal out of Conſcience,
ſince they parted with All to keep them: Why then ſhould
they not have the Liberty of their Conſciences too? Not to
mention the Caſe of the Biſhops and Inferiour Clergy.</p>
            <p>Pag. 29th. <hi>As to the Forged heads of the Princes Declaration,
and the Biſhops Propoſals, as they are known to be the contrivance
of the Kings Enemies, framed on purpoſe to amuſe the People, and
make them believe the ſetting us at rights, is the only Deſign of the
Dutch, and till thoſe Propoſals be granted, We are not ſafe.</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Sir, your Paſſion here has made you lift your Gown ſo
high, that I can plainly ſee your Tallons, and know you are
an <hi>Harpy.</hi> I know no more of the Princes Declaration, than
his Majeſty has been pleaſed to inſert in his Declaration, of the
7th. Inſtant; But I have ſeen the Biſhops Propoſals, and none
but an Enemy to the Proteſtant Religion, can be ſo Severe
againſt them as you are. But dear Sir, the Suppreſſing the

of England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the 11th, together with the Eccleſiaſtical
Commiſſion in the 2d. and the Diſpencing Power in the 9th.
your two great Ingines, by which you have already wrought
ſuch Wonders in <hi>England;</hi> and by which you hope to Retrieve
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60860:3"/>
all thoſe Advantages, the Invaſion have forced you to Diſgorge:
Theſe, Reverend Sir, are the things which ſo violently moved
your Cholar, that you quite forgot you were to Act the part of
<hi>a true Member of the Church of England;</hi> and in your Paſſion
againſt the Biſhops, thoſe dreadfull Hereticall Biſhops; you
diſcovered your <hi>Claws</hi> ſo very plainly, that I cannot but pity
your Indiſcretion; and <hi>Adviſe</hi> the Men of <hi>Allowance</hi> not to
ſuffer you to appear any more upon the Stage, ſince you can
Act your part no better.</p>
            <p>Pag. the 30th. you are pleaſed to confirm my Conjecture;
What the <hi>King change his Religion, and part with an inſeperable
Prerogative of the Crown: And the Reſt of thoſe Impudant Propoſals

Caſtle; as good no King, as no Jeſuits Schools; no Apoſtolick
Vicars, no Diſpencing Power to take off the Teſts; no R. C.
Zeal. Why dear Sir, are theſe things ſo indiſpenſably Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
that all is to be ventured for them? are theſe the things
for which we muſt Fight it out to the laſt Man. Truly Sir,
General <hi>Monk</hi> was a great man, and a good Subject, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he would not have loſt one Ounce of Blood on this Score.
And his Majeſty came as freely to the Crown as his Brother,
and none of theſe things were ſuſpected then. But now great
Sir, do not inſiſt too violently on any of them if you love the
Church of England. It is good reaſon, all our New Grants,
and all our Old Rights, ſhould be ſecure, before you can expect
we ſhould be ſo wonderful thankful as you are, who ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
we ſhould have any thing, if you may be in a capacity to
pluck it away again when time ſerve.</p>
            <p>Pag. the 31. <q>As to thoſe who decline Acting in Commiſſion
with <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> or mixing with them in the <hi>Militia;</hi>
It is a Sullenneſs little becomes worthy Men: Is it now a time
to remember former Piques, and refuſe joyning all hands for
our Defence,</q> when <hi>Hanibal</hi> is at the Gates? Dear Sir, your
Foot, your Foot: I wonder you ſhould thus forget your ſelf,
and the perſon you are to Act. In the time of <hi>Monmouth's</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,
one of your Society, put out a Remonſtrance by way
of Addreſs, from the Church of England to both Houſes of
Parliament, in two Parts; and in the Concluſion of the laſt,
thus he beſpeaks them.</p>
            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen:</p>
            <p>
               <q>It depends wholly upon your Generous Action, to ſee this
great Thing (the bringing the R. C. to Act freely with the
Proteſtants, without taking the Teſts) effected. We ſee his
Majeſty is not willing to infringe the Laws, or alter any thing
without your Counſel; nor give occaſion to the Diſcontented,
to eſteem him Arbitrary: But you methinks, ſhould prevent
him in this, and before you break up this Aſſembly, freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
him to imploy any that are known to be his Friends.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Stile, Genius, and Temper of thoſe <hi>Remonſtrances,</hi> are
ſo very like this <hi>Anatomie,</hi> that I believe firmly, one perſon
wrote both. But that be as it will, we may obſerve the
<q>Diſpencing Prerogative</q> was not then in being; and therefore
a <q>true member of the Church of England,</q> was forced to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to both Houſes to Wheedle them into a Petition, for you
know Sir, <hi>Hanibal</hi> was then at the Gates too. The Houſes
however did not think fit to take the Advice of this <hi>Wizard;</hi>
but however his Majeſty uſed his Diſcretion; and in the next
Seſſion of Parliament, thoſe very Loyal Gentlemen, were
againſt the Diſpenſing Powers, yet they were willing to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
all that had been ſo imployed contrary to Law, but that
would not ſatisfie; ſo that Parliament was firſt Prerogued, and
then Diſſolved; and the Diſpencing Power ſet on foot. And
now in time of War, you muſt Act with them becauſe <hi>Hanibal</hi>
is at the Gates; and in the time of Peace you ſhall do ſo too,
or turn out. Surely Sir you conceive we have very ill me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There is a very great difference betwixt times of Peace and
War, in Adminiſtration of Affairs of Law and Juſtice. Some
that would keep ſtrictly to the Letter of the Law, in time of
Peace may ſcruple to act with a R. C. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in a time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,</q>
this ſcruple ought no way to concern any man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Pag. 31. Reverend Sir, you may be pleaſed to teach your
Grandame to P—your Politicks are now too thin, to deceive
a Leather Jacket, or a pair of Canvas Breeches.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Pag 33. you tell the Diſſenters the Power they had got in
the time of the Rebellion, under K. <hi>Charles</hi> the I. neceſſitate<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the Government after the late Kings happy Reſtauration, to
continue a ſtanding Army for its defence; and to enact Penal
Laws againſt them.</q> Why Sir, they have been told another
ſtory of late; that the Church of England, out of a Bloody,
proud, perſecuting and implacable Spirit extorted theſe Penal
Laws from <hi>Charles</hi> II. contrary to his Inclination. Now, Sir,
when your Affairs are in any diſorder, you preſently borrow a
Church of <hi>England</hi> Caſſock, and with much Gravity beſpeak
them in favour of the Government, and in excuſe of the
Church, becauſe you need her aſſiſtance; but ſo ſoon as even
you have got what you want, off goes the Diſguiſe, and then
the poor Church of <hi>England</hi> muſt Anſwer both for the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army and the Penal Laws. The Diſſenters do ſo perfectly
underſtand you and your Arts now, that I have no temptation,
to interpoſe between you and the New <hi>Sheriffs, Justices of the
Peace, and Magiſtrates of Corporations,</hi> which the King in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to them has made out of them of late, and it may be, ſet
aſide by this time.</p>
            <p>Whether the Diſſenters are obliged on the ſcore of Gratitude
to aſſiſt the King on the account of the Tolleration, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the preſent War has ariſen purely upon the account of this
Indulgence, as you ſay, <hi>page</hi> 34. is no part of my buſineſs to
inquire. The Diſſenters are a grateful ſort of Gentlemen, and
if you had appeared in your own Shape and Cloaths, you
might have ſaid what you had pleaſed to them, and they might
have done what they had pleaſed for all me.</p>
            <p>The reſt of your Exhortation I leave to the Conſideration
of all Men as I find it, my deſign not being to deprive His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of the Aſſiſtance or Hearts of His People, God forbid I
ſhould, but to pluck off your Mask, and to ſhew you to all
the World what you are. Shall the Diſciples of that <hi>Halting
Hypocrite Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the younger <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Teach us
Loyalty? Shall they print their School-boy Rhetorick in the
Name of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with the <hi>ALLOWANCE</hi>
of the <hi>Apoſtolick Vicars?</hi> You that have imbroild ſo many
Kingdoms, been the occaſion of ſo many Rebellions, Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres,
Plots, Perſecutions, breaches of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Shall you
pretend to be ſo Zealous for Liberty of Conſcience, Trade,
and the peace of the World? You that have brought us and
His Majeſty into this Diſtreſs by your Little Arts and Shams;
Shall you now, like <hi>Solomons</hi> Wanton, Wipe your Mouth,
and <hi>ſay you have done no Evil?</hi> Well Sir, if it muſt be ſo, I
am contented; And ſo farewell.</p>
