            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the Kingdom, Whereby the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for Soundneſs of Faith, Purity of Worship, Excellency of Government, Freedom and Power of the Goſpel, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Order and Unity, was not inferior to any, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to moſt of the Reformed Churches, and therefore was deſervedly famous and eſteemed amongſt them: Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, for an hundred Years, from it's firſt National Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, preſerved the ſame from utter overthrow, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many various and renewed endeavours of men, by force and fraud, to reduce it unto the ſame Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Ignorance and Superſtitions, wherein it ſelf at firſt lay buried, and under which others groaned; And ſeveral times revived and reſtored it, when by it's own Impurity, Indifferency and Formality it began to decline, or by the Treachery, Subtilty, or Violence of others it was oppreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Thereby not only diſappointing, confounding, and many times ruining the Adverſaries, and comforting and ſtrengthening the faithful; But alſo alwayes rebuilding to Himſelf a Temple, the glory whereof did far excell and darken the glory of the former: And having many times engaged the whole Land to Himſelf, by ſeveral moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Obligations, of voluntary Surrender and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by frequently renewed Oaths and Covenants; So that within theſe few Years paſt, there were not many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of age, of whatever degree, and not ſo much as one Preaching Miniſter in all the Land, who not only did not make publick profeſſion of the true Reformed Religion, but alſo ſubject themſelves unto the Presbyterial Form of Church Government and Diſcipline, &amp; who did not (which we deſire to be noted) for that effect in their own perſons ſwear and ſubſcribe with the hand unto the Lord, in the National Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant; In ſo much, that as to the publick Profeſſion of the Truth, and almoſt as to the number of perſons, the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was of equal extent with the Nation, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,

force, Inevitable neceſſity or irreſiſtible temptation (which is neither poſſible nor yet would excuſe it) but when the Lord, by breaking the yoke of forrain Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had given King and Countrey the faireſt opportunity which they ever had, to reſtore, confirm and advance His Work; as if He had delivered us, that we might work all theſe Abominations: And all this for no other end, then the baſe flattering of the Kings humor and inclination, the ſatiating of Prelaticall Pride and Ambition, the indulging of the licentious profanity of ſome Debauched &amp; degenerated Nobles and others, who could not endure the yoke of Chriſt's ſound doctrine and impartiall diſcipline, And the ſuppreſſion of Religion and Righteouſneſs in the ſubverſion of the late work of Reformation: Whereby we have charged our ſelves with all the blood that hath been shed upon either ſide, during the former wars; Have laid a ſtumbling block before all, who shall ſee or hear of it, to blaſpheme Religion as a fiction, to condemn the late Work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as a falſe pretence for Rebellion and Self-Intereſt, and to affirm that there is neither truth nor ingenuity in the Profeſſors thereof. <hi>Paſs over the Iſles of</hi> Chittim <hi>and ſee, and ſend unto</hi> Kedar, <hi>and conſider diligently, and ſee if there be ſuch a thing; hath a Nation changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods?

Be aſtonished, O ye heavens at this, and be horribly afraid:</hi> And ſo much the rather, becauſe few Lands did ever make Defection after this manner, but, as upon the one hand, the Lord gave them up unto more Backſliding, until they abounded more with Atheiſm and all manner of abominations, then ſome Pagan-Nations, who never heard nor made Profeſſion of the Goſpel; So upon the other hand, He alwayes purſued them with ſoreſt plagues, not only of ſubjugation at home, ſcattering and exile abroad, dividing of Kingdomes amongſt themſelves, and from their former Rulers, and final ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb facs="tcp:64759:5"/>
of whole Empires, Kingdomes and Common-wealths; But alſo many times with the Final removal of the Goſpel, and utter diſſolution of all viſible National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation, as might be demonſtrated from Holy Scripture, and other Hiſtories: And indeed, if He, to whom nothing is ſtrange or impoſſible (though they may ſeem both to us) and whoſe wayes and thoughts are as far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ours, as the Heavens are above the Earth, do not in the Soveraignity of His Grace, recede from His ordinary method of dealing with ſuch apoſtatizing People, and now when he hath ſeen our way do not heal us, we have, alas! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If any would, be ſure, his own mouth should condemn him) would draw water and pour it out before the Lord, for quenching thereof, and that the <hi>firſt</hi> reſiclers from our National Acknowledgment of Sins and Engagement to duties, would glorify God by Confeſſion, that he might turn from the fierceneſs of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; But alas!

both ſeen the ſeveral degrees of Motion and advancement, and ſmarted the ſad effects of the ſame, yet I am affray'd, that there is now another Spirit in Perſons and Tendency in affairs then ſome men apprehend. Whether there be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground in the Holy Scriptures to think with ſome, that before the laſt fall of the Roman Antichriſt, the Popish Religion shall once more overshadow the Chriſtian World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not proper here to enquire; But conſidering the great affinity betwixt <hi>Papacy</hi> and <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and the already au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and practized Conformity of the one to the other, not only in Government and Diſcipline, whereby they have, for the moſt part, the ſame Eccleſiaſtical Courts and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; But alſo in Worship, whereby they have the ſame Liturgy, for ſubſtance of Epiſtles, Goſpels, Collects and Letany; The ſame Ceremonies of Riſing, Standing to the Eaſt, Bowing, Kneeling, Croſſing, &amp;c. the ſame ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious &amp; fool-like Veſtments; The ſame obſervation of many dayes, the ſame adorning of Churches and Chappels, with Altars, Books, Candles, Candleſticks, Baſins, Images, and Crucifix's on windows, and the ſame Jeſuitical ſign upon their pulpit cloath; And alſo in ſeveral points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, preached, licenſed and printed, with many other things tedious to be enumerated: Conſidering alſo the conſtitution of the Kingdoms, which by Ignorance, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, diſputing and oppugning of the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, Error, Superſtition, Profaneneſs, Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, Formality and Hypocriſy in many, are much more then formerly diſpoſed to embrace whatſoever shall be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized or indulged: And conſidering the native tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the preſent Courſe of Backſliding, which leadeth unto the great Whore, the mother of all theſe abominations, Nothing but groſs, wilfull or judicial Ignorance, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangement from affairs, can deny that there is too juſt ground of fear, that ere long (if the Lord do not prevent it) <hi>Brittain</hi> may be again precipitated into the old gulf of
<pb facs="tcp:64759:6"/>
Antichriſtianiſm. And ſo much the rather, becauſe it is univerſally obſerved and notourly known, that the number of profeſſed Papiſts, hath increaſed more within theſe ſix Years, then it had for near ſixty before; the conviction whereof made ſome of the Prelates themſelves ſay ſome Years hence, that ſince the Year 1660. there were more thouſands of avowed Papiſts in <hi>Scotland</hi> (compute then what may and muſt be in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>) then before that Year there were hundreds. Whence this is, and whether there be any poſitive Reſolution to reintroduce Popery in theſe Lands, I do not affirm, but remit it to the conſideration of the impartial Reader who underſtandeth the times, and to Time it ſelf, a great ſearcher and diſcoverer of ſecrets, to declare the genuine meaning and tendency of theſe things, That the King should publish in print, that the Papiſts had been faithful Subjects to him and his Father, whileſt others under pretence of Religion had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the Kingdoms in blood; Was that bloody Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereof they were the known and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Actors, though perhaps not the only Authors, ſuch Faithful ſervice? That the execution of penal Statutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Papiſts should be ſuperſeded, whilſt ſevere penal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes are dayly enacted and executed againſt Proteſtants, really, though not under that name and notion: That ſo many known and open Idolatrous Maſſes should be conniv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at &amp; tollerated, whilſt both publick &amp; private meetings of Proteſtants for pure Worship are prohibited by Law, and violently interrupted: That ſo many known profeſſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Prieſts and Jeſuites, who do not publickly counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the Prelatical Worship, are permitted to live peaceably and enjoy all their Liberties, whilſt non-complying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, for ſimple Non-conformity to Prelacy, are impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, fined, confined, ſcourged, ſtigmatized, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny otherwayes oppreſſed and perſecuted, in their Eſtates, Conſciences and Names: That ſo many Papiſts eſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:64759:6"/>
in <hi>England</hi> should enjoy and be dayly advanced to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt places of publick Power and Truſt, not only as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, Council, and Court, but as State-Officers, Lieutenants, Sherifs, Juſtices of Counties, and Officers in Army, whilſt ſtedfaſt Proteſtants, for ſimple non-perjuring, are ſome of them not ſo much as permitted to ſit in Parliament, or any other Iudicatory; others of them diſcourted, diſgraced, diſarmed, impriſoned and proſcribed, and all of them who will not forſwear, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared incapable of publick Power or Truſt in Church or Common-wealth: That a houſe for Fathers or Friers is provided; whilſt many faithful Miniſters are removed and chaſed from place to place, without any certain habitation: That there should be ſuch univerſal Report &amp; ſo much Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, of a Popish hand in burning of <hi>London,</hi> which, for number and ſtrength of Proteſtant Inhabitants, was the moſt conſiderable City in the World, and bulwark againſt the Romish Religion and deſignes, and yet, as if men were affrayed to try the truth in that matter, ſo little ſatisfying &amp; effectual courſe taken, to try and punish the Authors and Actors, and to repreſs their many other inſolent miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; whilſt many thouſands of innocent Proteſtants, who never burnt either houſe or City, for no other alleaged crime but their peaceable forbearance to bow to the Idol which the King hath ſetup, are thrown into a furnace of fiery Triall, ſeven times more heated then ever was known in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World for ſuch a Cauſe, all things being conſidered.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem ſtrange to the Nations about, and to the Generations following, that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> which had been ſo faithful and chaſt, should have ſuffered herſelf to be thus proſtituted, and that (if she would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, after the manner of her Fathers, contend for the Faith which she had receaved) she did not cry to all the World by Declarations and Proteſtations (as the Maid under the Law) that she was forced; And that of all the ſons
<pb facs="tcp:64759:7"/>
which she had brought forth, there were ſo few, either to take her by the hand, and plead openly for her, or to plead with her, that she would put away her whoredoms. This indeed is, and ought to be for a lamentation; But let none therefore conclude (as ſome of the profane and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Prelates, meaſuring others after their own baſeneſs and treachery, had the impudence at firſt to miſrepreſent to the Rulers) that all were or are conſentient unto this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Apoſtacy; for even at the beginning thereof, if Synods (which were then reſolving to bear publick Witneſs for the then eſtablished Government of the Church, and againſt the begun Defection, and further progreſs thereof by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>introduction of Prelacy, which was then deſigned) had not been, ſome of them, by Proclamation prohibited to conveen, and others of them violently interrupted and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Nobles, who, by Order of Parliament, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for that effect; And if ſome of her Watchmen (who were neither profeſſedly driving on, nor ſecretly breathing after Prelacy &amp; Prelatical promotion) had not for Reaſons beſt known to themſelves, too much courted and flattered the Powers by their own ſilence, and withdrawing of their neceſſary and required concurrence in a publick joint Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, there wanted not Faithfulneſs, Zeal, Courage, Reſolutions and ſome Endeavours in others to have emitted ſuch Declarations, as probably might have crushed the bold attempt of the Prelates in it's infancy, and thereby have prevented much Sin and Suffering which hath enſued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and certainly would have witneſſed to all the World, that the Church without &amp; againſt her conſent was treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly betrayed and violently forced. Neither hath the Truth, all along from that time till this, wanted many teſtimonies, though none of them were ſo National, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, Authoritative and Solemn as they should have been; And few of them (perhaps) ſo explicite, full, plain and bold, as the weight of the matter and other circumſtances
<pb facs="tcp:64759:7"/>
required: Yea, the continued fears of the Adverſaries, expreſſed in the Narratives of ſeveral of their own Acts and Proclamations, and their leavying of Military Force, for upholding of them and their Cauſe; The Non-complyance of many thouſands, their ſecret and open complaints and moans becauſe of it, &amp; their daily prayers to God againſt it, bear witneſs againſt this preſent Courſe. Beſides, it is very obſervable, that ſome, who had been chief Authors and Active Promoters thereof and Complyers with the ſame, and others, who had been intimate familiars and favourers of Prelats and their Vice-curats, in Sickneſs and at Death did ſo much abhorre their way and loath their Perſons, that they would not admit their preſence, but called for Non-conforming Miniſters to ſpeak to them and pray for them; Yea ſome Gentlemen upon Death-bed, did with much ſorrow bemoan their own concurrence, and particularly their taking of the Declaration againſt the Covenant, and ſeriouſly warned and exhorted their old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars and companions in that guilt to repent thereof, wishing they were able to go and make publick profeſſion of their own Repentance; and others (whilſt ſome friends offered to bring Prelatical men unto them) profeſſed, that though they had ſported with ſuch men in health, yet they durſt not do ſo at Death; and ſome Miniſters who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, in remorſe thereof, forſook that way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after died with convincing evidence of Repentance therefore, and dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aration againſt the ſame: And indeed, as there was never any Courſe in the Land, which ſo viſibly had the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and Active Concurſe of all and Only the Wicked and Prophane; ſo there was never a more Univerſal concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Wreſtling together by prayer, of all the Godly without Exception, againſt any Party and Cauſe, then now is againſt this; for there needs no more to make any man (though formerly their friend and familiar) to hate their way and deteſt themſelves, but to convince him of his

own Sin, make him thorowly apprehenſive of death and Judgment, and become a ſincere ſeeker of God, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of holineſs in his own Perſon. And further the late Riſing in Armes, is an Argument above contradiction, that Prelacy is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n out-landish and Unnatural weed in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; It is true, that it had it's immediat Riſe from cruell Oppreſſion, but it is as true, that all that Oppreſſion, was Authoriſed by the Rulers, Exerciſed by the Souldiers, and endured by the People, meerly <hi>Becauſe</hi> and upon accompt of their Faithfulneſs and Stedfaſtneſs in the Covenant and Cauſe of God, in a non-complyance with Prelacy, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might have lived as quyetly as others, and ſo ſoon as they were in a probable Capacity, by renewing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they declared Actively for that ſame Cauſe, for which they had ſuffered ſo much: It is true alſo, that the Action is condemned by ſome as Rebellious, and the Ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avour as Indeliberate, Irrational and Preſumputous; But referring the Reader to the following diſcourſe for full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction thereanent, I shall only here hint, that being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together accidentally occaſioned, by an unforſeen emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent difference, betwixt 3 or 4 Souldiers and as many Countrey-men, ariſeing from horrid Oppreſſion, through unjuſt Lawes and cruell military execution thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out premeditated counſel or contrivance, it cannot be imagined that all the formalities, which may be judged neceſſary in a matter of that nature and importance, could have been in it: And yet it is preſumed, that it wanted nothing but ſucceſs to have made many of the ſame perſons account the Action juſt and neceſſary, and the Enterprize, laudable and valorous. And as for the Perſons themſelves, it may be truly and without all vanity affirmed. that theſe many years paſt, there hath not been in <hi>Brittain</hi> ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Company of men joyned in Armes for the Covenant and Cauſe of God: for though where Armies were more numerous, there might be or was the like or greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:64759:8"/>
of perſons truly Godly; Yet where the whole number was ſo ſmall, it will be very hard to parallel ſo many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of ſound Judgement, true Piety, Integrity of heart, fervent zeal, and undaunted Reſolution and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and with ſo ſmall a mixture of perſons of corrupt Mindes, profane Converſations and ſiniſtrous Ends: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we would not be prodigal of mens lives, eſpecially of Saints, at this time, when there is ſo great need and ſcarcity of interceſſors, to ſtand between the dead and the living; yet that ſimple act of <hi>Renewing</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> is more glory to God, and a greater Teſtimony and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to that buried Covenant and Cauſe, then (we hope) the loſs of ſo many men as are faln, shall import of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage thereunto. But above all, take notice of the many Sufferings and <hi>Sufferers</hi> hereafter mentioned, whoſe Blood under the altar, and ſome of wheſe <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt Heaven &amp; Earth, doth not only cry for Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but night and day bear open Witneſs againſt this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous Geaeration. Theſe mens Teſtimony should have the more weight and Credite with all, becauſe of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Matter, and Manner thereof, which was not by Wishing, Words-ſpeaking, or Doing without danger, which is the height of too many men's atchievment in theſe dayes, but by BLOOD, whereunto they reſiſted ſtriving againſt Sin, and thereby, being neither affrayed to Act, nor ashamed to Suffer for their Lord and Maſter, have left behind them a fair Example of both to all, and a Reproof to many, whoſe greater Prudence then Zeall, hath taught them to Save themſelves, by couching betwixt the burdens. That a great Prince, and yet not ſo Great as Good, an Eminent and more then ordinarly Uſeful, and never to be forgotten Inſtrument of the Work of Reformation and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the Church, and a True &amp; Seeing Prophet, did fall in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when <hi>Argile, Wariſton</hi> and <hi>Mr Guthrey,</hi> for no other cauſe but their <hi>Good deeds,</hi> and particularly for Loving

This <hi>Title</hi> being only affirmative of Her, and not Negative of other Churches, as if only She, and not alſo They, had Wreſtled for the Kingdom of Chriſt, let no man offend thereat: For as the Lord Redeemer hath ſeveral Offices, equally Neceſſary in themſelves, and Inſeperable by Man, and as particular Churches, as well as Perſons, have their peculiar gifts and Excellencies, and accordingly their diſtinct work aſſigned unto them, whereby (amongſt other things) they, more or leſs eminently, aſſert and Propugn this or that particular Truth; So in this diſtribution, whereas other Churches have aſſerted and contended for his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> and <hi>Propheticall</hi> Offices, the lot ſeemeth to have fallen upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> to aſſert and wreſtle more eminently then many others, for the <hi>Croun</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.

And if they will Sanctuary themſelves in primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times, let it be cleared what is meant by <hi>Primitive</hi>; For if the two firſt Ages be meant, it is more then they can do, to prove by ſufficient Authority, that there was then ſuch a Prelacy, as is before mentioned, or now uſurped and exerciſed; If after ages be meant, wherein the Church grew more corrupt, and Prelacy did aſpire and exalt itſelf, to an Univerſal Supremacy in the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and eſtablishment of that Antichriſtian Hierarchy, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are like themſelves. for twins were never more like in face, then the preſent Prelats reſemble the Romish, but then it were Candor in them, to tell plainly, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy and Prelacy are of one Original, with this difference, that Prelacy is the firſt born, or rather the Father which begat the other; And if they mean a Middle time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe Periods, wherein indeed Bishops were firſt known in the Church, and will reckon their deſcent from them, why are they ſo unlike unto them, that they look neither like Sons nor Succeſſors? Ask thoſe who have dived into theſe depths of Antiquity, and they will tell, that a preſent Prelat, and a faithful Presbyterian Paſtor (or Moderator at moſt) do little more differ, then the preſent Prelats and theſe firſt Primitive Bishops: For as it was long before ſuch a thing was known in the Church, ſo when thorow the Malice and Subtilty of Sathan, the Ambition of ſome Church-men, the Unwatchfulneſs of others, and Indulgence of ſome Magiſtrats it did creep in, at firſt it was intended and acknowledged for no more, then a Prudential Humane device for greater Unity (a Cure, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant, worſe then the deſeaſe, which, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles never preſcribed in their own times, though there were then many Diviſions, ſo there is alike Reaſon to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend further to Papal Supremacy, in the caſe of diviſions amongſt Prelats and Patriarches) and had never the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to aſpire (with ſome preſent Prelats) ſo high as

Nor live and ride in ſuch ſtate and pomp, claming and taking the preference of the greateſt Peeres of the Land; Ordinarly, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the beginning, they had not ſuch vaſt charges, as now the Prelats have Diocies over Hundreds of Paſtors, and many Thouſands of people, to whom it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to perform Miniſterial duties; Being diligent Preachers themſelves, they were not, as the Prelats are, Idle drons, nor Non-reſidenrs, nor yet of a ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the people, as <hi>Wallace,</hi> through his ignorance of the Irish tongue, and almoſt of all others except his Mothers, muſt be a Barbarian to his Diocy of the Weſtern-Iſles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither did they involve themſelves in Secular affairs and Offices, then which, what is there more abſurd in Reaſon, and repugnant to Scriptural precept and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?

But alſo becauſe (the <hi>Jewes</hi> being ſubdued) the Supreme civil Government was taken out of their hands, and little left them but the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical. And if at any time, in the Old Teſtament, the ſame perſons were members of both Judicatories, it was under diſtinct Notions and conſiderations, as Eccleſiaſtical in the one, and Civil in the Other; As now the Ruling Elder, under ſeveral Conſiderations and Capacities, may be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of an Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Iudicatory. It is true that the High Prieſts and ſome Kings had great hand in both Civil &amp; Eccleſiaſtical affairs, but Extraordinary, and (may be) Typicall inſtances are not an Ordinary and Univerſal Rule; And it may be alſo, that in the New Teſtament theſe Councils meddled in Civil Affairs, for <hi>Matth.</hi> 27: <hi>ver.</hi> 1. they <hi>take counſel againſt Ieſus to put him to death,</hi> but that was by Corrupt Abuſe of their Power, which crept in, in the declining State of the Church, and when the Civil Government was taken from them by ſtrangers, or when, wanting a Magiſtrat, they took more upon them then at another time; for it was not ſo from the beginning, and was by the like Corrupt and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Abuſe, as now the <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> (if it be an Eccleſiaſtical Courr) doth Scourge, Stigmatize, Fine and Banish, or the Prelats now as Members of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Council,</hi> and <hi>Seſſion,</hi> make themſelves Judges of <hi>Blood, Pleas,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb facs="tcp:64759:20"/>
given to the civill Magiſtrat for Regulation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth? And the Church Officers, &amp; not the civil Magiſtrat, are Commended or Diſcommended accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they faithfully or unfaithfully Exerce this Power and follow theſe Directions: So the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> (which I hope none will ſay was the Magiſtrat) is commended for Trying them which ſaid they were Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and were not, <hi>Revel</hi> 2.2. It was not the Emperor, Senat, &amp;c. that tryed theſe falſe Apoſtles, as of late the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Council, High Commiſſion,</hi> ejected many Hundreds of faithful Miniſters without Trial; The <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira</hi> are diſcommended, for tollerating falſe Doctrin and Corrupt Practice, <hi>v.</hi> 14.15.20. ſo is the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> blamed for not timeous Excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Inceſtuous Perſon. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.

            <p>From all which, as the Formal &amp; Specifical Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Power and Government of Church and Common wealth is aboundantly evident; So Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf, &amp; not the civil Magiſtrat, is the <hi>Author &amp; Fountain</hi> of Church-Power and Government; Then which, there can be nothing more clear to them who do not wilfully shut their own eyes, or whom the God of this world hath not blinded: For, beſids that Himſelf telleth us, that He hath receav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Power and Judgement from the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.22. and <hi>Iohn</hi> beareth him that Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.35. And who should derive Power to others, but He who receaved it for that end?

How then can the Magiſtrat be Head of the Church, or ſupream Governor in all cauſes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical? Muſt the Church have two Heads, or a Head above a Head? Why may not a Church Officer or Officers, as well claim (with the Pope) to be Head of the Common-wealth? Will they shew us a Warrant from Scripture or Reaſon for the one, which will not as ſtrongly plead for the other? Well then, let Chriſt be ſtill Head of the Church. And as ſuch.

Or whether they had any Power at all, or were but Uſurpers? Or what the Church shall do for Power when the Magiſtrat is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, Antichriſtian, or a Woman, Child, a Fooll, a Tyrant, or Heretick, &amp;c. Shall the Church all this time want a Head? Or shall the Body of Chriſt, have a Pagan-Head? Shall a Woman, who muſt not ſpeak in the Church, be Head of the Church? shall a child or Idiot, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Govern themſelves, have the External Regulation of the Church? Or shall Cruell Tyrants, who oppreſs or deſtroy the Common-wealth, and Bodies of men, have the Regulation of the Church, &amp; of the Souls of men? We may then go to the Pope, the Turk, the wild Indian-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Savages, for a Head to the Church before She want; for what<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ver belongeth to one man, as a Magiſtrat, belongeth to all Magiſtrats: But we will hold us content with the Head, <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> which the Father hath given us.</p>
            <p>Now from this, that Church-Power and Government are thus diſtinct from the Civil, and that Jeſus Chriſt and not the Magiſtrat, is Author and Fountain thereof, it evidently followeth, that it is not <hi>Subordinat</hi> to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat.
<pb facs="tcp:64759:21"/>
It is true, that the Magiſtrat hath much Power Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Eccleſiaſticall, and that Church Officers, as <hi>Subjects,</hi> are subject to him; yet Eccleſiaſtical Power it-ſelf, is not Properly Subordinat to the Civil. This will the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, not only becauſe it is not Derived from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat, as the Head or Fountain thereof, nor is Exerced in his Name, but alſo if we conſider, that Proper Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is only in things flowing from the ſame Fountain, and of the ſame Nature, whereas civill and Ecceſiaſticall Powers are neither from the ſame Immediat Fountain (if the one be from <hi>Iehovah</hi> Eſſentially conſidered, and as great Lord Creator and Gubernator of the World, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Lord <hi>Redeemer,</hi> Head and King of his Church) nor yet are they of the ſame, but different Natures, as is ſaid before: Again, if it were properly Subordinat to the civil Power, then the Magiſtrat himſelf, might Exerce all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Acts, in the Adminiſtration of Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as well as of Juriſdiction; for as nor aſon can be adduced, why He may Inſtitute or Alter Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Officers, or Exerce the External Regulation thereof, which will not by parity of ſtrength infer his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercing Acts of Order; So, every Superior Power includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Inferior. He may as well Exerce all Eccleſiaſtical Power, as civil, if the One be Subordinat to the Other: And further, the Magiſtrat himſelf, as a Chriſtian, is but a Member of the Church, and Subject to Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcipline, though it should not be practiſed, except for moſt weighty Cauſes, in great neceſſity, and with ſingular Prudence, and all due Reſpect and Reverence to Civil Authority, and the Perſon therewith veſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d; and accordingly many Magiſtrats have been cenſured: Yea in ſome caſes, as if the Magiſtrat should unjuſtly forbid to Preach, Baptiſe, Ordain, Deprive, Excommunicat &amp;c. the Church may Exerce Church Power without and againſt His conſent, which She could not do, if it were Subordinat to
<pb facs="tcp:64759:22"/>
him. I know there are many clamours of the Abſurdity and Inconſiſtency of two Collateral and Co-Ordinat Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Powers and Governments in one Kingdom; And indeed that Abſurdity and Inconſiſtency may hold true, of two Supream Collaterall and Co-Ordinat Powers <hi>ejuſdem Generis,</hi> but not in this caſe where they are <hi>diverſi generis</hi>: Yea of their own Natures, they are ſo far from being hurtful, that, being rightly mannaged, they are ſingularly help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to one another: Neither can theſe two Powers and Governments in a Land, import now under the New Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament greater abſurdity and Inconſiſtancy, then under the Old, when the Jewes had their Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> as well as civil Courts for the affairs of the Commoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Hence alſo it followeth, that as Eccleſiaſtical Power is not Subject to the civil; So, in matters Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, there should be no <hi>Appellation</hi> from the Church to the civil Magiſtrat: For though when Church Judicatories, without their ſphere, meddle in civil Cauſes <hi>as ſuch,</hi> or, for Eccleſiaſtical offences, inflict civil Punishments, they may be Declined as Judges Incompetent in the one caſe, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of an unjuſt or Heterogeneous <hi>Sentence</hi> is lawful in the other; &amp; though the Magiſtrat, before He adde his Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, may require a Reaſon of Eccleſiaſticall proceedings, or, in caſe of an injuſt Sentence, may deſire the Church to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the matter again; &amp; the Church i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bound thus to give a Reaſon, or Conſider the matter, eſpecially in a degenerat or declining time of the Church, when more is permitted to the Faithful Magiſtrat, then otherwiſe; Yet there can be no Appellation from the Church to the Magiſtrat in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Cauſes &amp; Sentences: Not only becauſe all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations are from the Inferior to the Superior in <hi>Eodem genere,</hi> but the Church and State are not ſuch, as is cleared before; but alſo becauſe the Church is indued with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Power of Cognoſcing &amp; Final determining Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs, without dependance upon the State, and theſe
<pb facs="tcp:64759:22"/>
Determinations, being Juſt, the Lord hath promiſed to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18:18. And the Magiſtrat, having no Formal Church Power, cannot pronounce Eccleſiaſtical Sentence, or make Redreſs by Himſelf, &amp; ſo the Appellation is in vain. <hi>Pauls</hi> Appealing to <hi>Caeſar, Act.</hi> 25:11. will not help this weak cauſe; For He did not appeal in an Eccleſiaſtical cauſe, from an Eccleſiaſtical Court, to a Court of another Nature, but in a matter of alleaged Sedition, from <hi>Feſtus</hi> an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Magiſtrat to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Supream. Neither is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſtronger then the former (<hi>Ier.</hi> 26:8.9. &amp;c) for there is no mention of His appealing from the Prieſts to the Magiſtrat, but of his Apology before the Princes, who came to hear the matter, and their Voluntary delivering him from the Uniuſt perſecution of the Prieſts and Prophets, who were not competent Judges of Life and Death. Neither is the Exception of the Difference betwixt a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Chriſtian Magiſtrat more Valid in this matter; for (beſids all that is before ſaid) in the old Teſtament, the Government of the Church was Committed to Church-Officers, even when the Magiſtrat was Religious, and why not in the New? The Government of the Church is not committed to them, <hi>becauſe</hi> the Magiſtrat is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or upon Temporary, but upon other Moral and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table grounds, &amp; therefore should not be taken from them when he becometh Chriſtian: It is ſure, that the Church had power given unto Her to Govern Herſelf, when the Magiſtrat was Heathen, now when and where is that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Repealed? If Church-Govenment belong to the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Magiſtrat, then it is either <hi>as Magiſtrat</hi> or <hi>as Chriſtian,</hi> if <hi>as Magiſtrat</hi> or <hi>as Chriſtian,</hi> then (according to the known maxime) it belongeth to <hi>Every</hi> Magiſtrat, and ſo to the Heathen, and to <hi>Every</hi> Chriſtian, both which are falſe: Was the Magiſtrat no Magiſtrat or Incompleat, when (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heathen) he did not meddle with Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb facs="tcp:64759:23"/>
or did the Church Uſurp and Rob the Heathen Magiſtrat of that Power, in the Apoſtles dayes, and 2 or 300 years after? Shall the Church, by the promiſe of <hi>Nurſing Fathers,</hi> have leſs Power and Priviledge, or be in worſe Condition, by a Chriſtian then Heathen Magiſtrat?

ſome whereof (and not the meaneſt) being as profane as <hi>Machiavel,</hi> who teacheth Rulers to keep promiſe and Oath no longer, then with pretended advantage they can break, and that it is a prejudice to be <hi>Really</hi> Religious, but not ſo honeſt as He, who notwithſtanding affirmeth a Neceſſity of <hi>Seeming</hi> to be Religious, which they are not, accompt no man to be a Man, who, by Whoring, Swearing, Drinking &amp; Spending all or more then they have, do not claſs themſelves into their new Profane Orders, &amp; become as <hi>Carteſian</hi> in their Religion, by Atheiſtical doubtings &amp; diſputings about God, the Holy Scripturs, Heaven, Hell, &amp;c. as others are in their Philoſophy. But here is an Advantage, that by Diſcovery, and diſtinguishing betwixt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and the vile, the Lord hath made this Defection contribut more to the Facility (as well as Neceſſity) of a future Purgation of the Church, then all her Judicatures could ever effectuat without it. And further, as he hath fruſtrated many chief Authors and Promotters thereof of their Hopes and Deſigns, and called Nobles, Prelats and others to an accompt before they well taſted the expected ſweetneſs, or were warm in their Places or Promotions; So though <hi>Herod</hi> &amp; <hi>Pilat</hi> may aggrie againſt the Innocent, yet where men are like <hi>Samſons</hi> foxes, only tied together by the tail of common Corrupt Principles, whilſt their heads, of Self Intereſt and deſigns, look different wayes, what ſuch a Poſition, Conjunction and Aſpect prognoſticateth, let Scripture, Reaſon and Experience be conſulted and they will tell.

It hath been ſaid of me, that I have (in word at least) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiled from my wonted Zeal for Presbyterial Government, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing my ſelf concerning it, as if it were a matter not to be accounted of, &amp; that no man should trouble himſelf in the matter &amp; practice thereof.

Surely any Chriſtian in this Church that knows me, will judge there is a wrong done to me: For ſince the day that the Lord convinced my heart (which was by a ſtrong hand) that it was the Ordinance of God, appointed by Ieſus Chriſt, for governing &amp; ordering his viſible Church, I never had the leaſt change of thoughts, concerning the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it, nor of the neceſſity of the <hi>uſe</hi> of it. And now I declare before God &amp; the World, that I account ſo of it ſtill: And that however there be ſome more precious ordinances, yet that this is ſo precious, that a true Chriſtian is obliged to <hi>lay down his life</hi> for the profeſsion thereof, if the Lord shall ſee it meet to put him to the tryal. And for my ſelf, if I were to live, I would account it my glory, to ſeal this word of my teſtimony <hi>with my blood.</hi> Of this my decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I take God, Angels and Men to be my witneſſes, and have ſubſcribed thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:64759:25"/>AS the <hi>Matter</hi> of this Teſtimony is very conſiderable, eſpecially from <hi>ſo Great</hi> a man as <hi>Mr Wood</hi> was; So the occaſion &amp; conſequents thereof are very obſervable, which were thus: <hi>Mr Sharp,</hi> having formerly been intimately familiar with <hi>Mr Wood,</hi> came to viſite him under his Sickneſs (whereunto <hi>Sharps</hi> Apoſtacy had no ſmall acceſſion) &amp; thereafter did falſely ſpread a report by word &amp; writ, that <hi>Mr Wood</hi> had reſeiled from Presbyterial Government. Whereof when <hi>Mr Wood</hi> was informed, he was of new grievouſly affected and afflicted, and thereupon, for his own Vindication, left this Teſtimony behind him. But <hi>Mr Sharp</hi> finding himſelf thereby made a publlck lyar, (making lyes ſtill his refuge) purſueth <hi>Mr Wood</hi> being dead, as well as alive, with a new ſlander, alleaging his Teſtimony to be Fictitious, or Extorted from him, when, through diſtemper of his ſickneſs, he knew not what he did, and thereupon cauſed ſummond the Witneſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Writter and ſome other perſons before the <hi>High Commiſſion:</hi> But the contrary of this was and is moſt Evident, not only becauſe this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony was written and ſubſcribed, a conſiderable number of dayes before his Death, dureing which intervall (as before) he was ſo compoſed, that he ſpake many gracious words about his own ſoul, Ordered his Civil affairs, and a famous Phyſician was not without hopes of his Recovery; But alſo becauſe, hearing that ſome of his faithful Brethren &amp; Co-Presbyters were in the town, he ſent once &amp; again for them, and before them, and ſome other Miniſters at other times, purged himſelf of that unjuſt Imputation, and did bear witneſs for Presbyterial Government more fully &amp; freely then is in the written Teſtimony, &amp; ſome time thereafter, of his own accord did call for the Writter, &amp; (there being none other preſent in the chamber at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) did indite and cauſe him writ the ſame, as it now is without any Alteration; as alſo in a Letter written ſome conſiderable time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (inviting <hi>Mr Carſtairs</hi> to come and viſite him) he had made mention of the Backſliding, Tryalls and Sufferings of the times, and expreſſed his deſire to Live, that he might give a more free Teſtimony to the Truth. Notwithſtanding all which, <hi>Mr Sharp</hi> (obſtructing the reading of a Letter written by <hi>Mr Carſtairs</hi> to the <hi>Chancelor,</hi> containing and clearing the matter of fact) perſiſted with great Atteſtations before the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> in his former falſe alleagance, and Slandering both of the Dead and the Living, and cauſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon the Writer and one of the witneſſes, and forced the other (whom, for his eminent Parts, Holineſs and Faithfulneſs, he moſt purſued) to a Retirement for his own ſafety. <hi>What ſhall be given to Thee</hi> O Sharp! <hi>Or what shall be done to Thee; O falſe Tongue?

evil and bitter a thing it is to depart away from him, by breaking the Oath and Covenant which we have made with him, and that we may be humbled before him by confeſſing our ſinne, and forſaking the evil of our way.</p>
            <p>Therefore being preſſed with ſo great neceſſities and ſtraits, and warranted by the word of God, and having the example of Gods people of old, who in the time of their troubles, and when they were to ſeek delivery and a right way for themſelves, that the Lord might be with them to proſper them, did humble themſelves before him, and make a free and particular confeſſion of the ſins of their Princes, their Rulers, their Captains, their Prieſts and their people, and did engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do no more ſo, but to reform their wayes and be ſtedfaſt in his Covenant; And remembring the practiſe of our predeceſſours in the year 1596. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the General Aſſembly, and all the Kirk-judicatories, with the concurrence of many of the Nobily, Gentry, and Burgeſſes, did with many tears acknowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God the breach of the National Covenant, and engaged themſelves to a Reformation, even as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors and theirs had before done in the Generall Aſſembly and convention of Eſtates in the year 1567. And perceiving that this duty, when gone about out of conſcience and in ſincerity, hath alwayes been attended with a reviving out of troubles, and with a bleſſing and ſucceſſe from Heaven; We do humbly and ſincerely in his ſight, who is the ſearcher of hearts, acknowledge the many ſins and great tranſgreſſions of the Land; We have done wickedly, our Kings, our Princes, our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, our Judges, our Officers, our Teachers, and our People: Albeit the Lord hath long and clearly ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto us, we have not hearkened to his voice; Albeit he hath followed us with tender mercies, we have not

been allured to wait upon him and walk in his way; And though he hath ſtricken us, yet we have not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Nay though he hath conſumed us, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to receive correction; We have not remembred to render unto the Lord according to his goodneſſe and according to our own vows and promiſes, but have gone away backward by a continued courſe of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding, and have broken all the Articles of that ſolemn League and Covenant which we ſwore before God, Angels and men.</p>
            <p>Albeit there be in the land many of all ranks, who be for a Teſtimony unto the Truth, and for a name of joy and praiſe unto the Lord, by living godly, ſtudying to keep their garments pure, and being ſtedfaſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Cauſe of God; Yet we have reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that moſt of us have not endeavoured with that reality, ſincerity and conſtancy, that did become us, to preſerve the work of Reformation in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi>; Many have ſatisfied themſes with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Ordinances neglecting the power thereof; yea, ſome have turned aſide to crooked wayes deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to both.

perſons much countenanced &amp; many times employed, until iniquity and ungodlineſſe hath gone over the face of the land as a flood; Nay, ſufficient care hath not been had to ſeparate betwixt the precious and the vile, by debarring from the Sacrament all ignorant and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons according to the Ordinances of this Kirk.</p>
            <p>Neither have the Priviledges of the Parliaments and Liberties of the Subject been duly tendered, But ſome amongſt our ſelves have labored to put into the hands of our King an arbitrary and unlimited power deſtructive to both, And many of us have been acceſſory of late to thoſe means and ways, whereby the freedom and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliaments have been encroached upon and the Subjects oppreſſed in their Conſciences, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Eſtates: Neither hath it been our care to avoid theſe things which might harden the King in his evill way; But upon the contrary he hath not onely been permitted, but many of us have been inſtrumentall to make him exerciſe his power in many things tending to the prejudice of Religion and of the Covenant, and of the Peace and ſafety of theſe Kingdoms; Which is ſo farre from the right way of preſerving his Majeſty's Perſon and Authority, that it cannot but provoke the Lord againſt him unto the hazard of both, Nay under a pretence of relieving and doing for the King whilſt he refuſes to do what was neceſſary for the houſe of God, ſome have ranverſed and violated moſt of all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Covenant.</p>

with and pardoned, and themſelves received unto intimate fellowship with our ſelves, and entruſted with our Counſels, admitted unto our Parliaments, and put in places of Power and Authority, for manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the publick affaires of the Kingdome, Whereby in Gods juſtice they got at laſt into their hands the whole power and ſtrength of the Kingdome, both in judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and Armies, And did imploy the ſame unto the enacting and proſecuting an unlawful Engagement in warre againſt the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the diſſent of many conſiderable members of Parliament, who had given conſtant proof of their integrity in the cauſe from the beginning, of many faithful teſtimonies and free warnings of the ſervants of God, of the Supplications of many Synods, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Shyres, and of the Declarations of the Generall Aſſembly and their Commiſſioners to the contrary: Which ingagement as it hath been the cauſe of much ſinne, ſo alſo of much miſery and calamity unto this Land, and holds forth to us, the grievouſneſſe of our ſinne of complying with Malignants, in the greatneſſe of our judgement, that we may be taught never to ſplit again upon the ſame rock, upon which the Lord hath ſet ſo remarkable a Beacon. And after all that is come to paſſe unto us becauſe of this our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and after that grace hath been shewed unto us from the Lord our God, by breaking theſe mens yoke from of our necks, and putting us again into a capacity to act for the good of Religion, our own ſafety, and the Peace and ſafety of this Kingdowe, should we again-break his Commandment and Covenant, by joyning once more with the people of theſe abominations, and taking into our boſome thoſe Serpents which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſtung us almoſt unto death: This as it would
<pb facs="tcp:64759:37"/>
argue great madneſſe and folly upon our part, So no doubt, if it be not avoided. will provoke the Lord againſt us to conſume us untill there be no remnant nor eſcaping in the Land.</p>
            <p>And albeit the Peace and Union betwivt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms be a great bleſſing of God unto both and a Bond which we are obliged to preſerve unviolated, And to endeavour that juſtice may be done upon the oppoſers thereof; Yet ſome in this Land, who have come under the Bond of the Covenant, have made it their great ſtudy how to diſſolve this Union, and few or no endeavours have been uſed by any of us for punishing of ſuch.</p>
            <p>We have ſuffered many of our Brethren in ſeverall parts of the Land to be oppreſſed of the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my without compaſſion or relief; There hath been great murmuring and repining becauſe of expenſe of means and pains in doing of our duty; Many by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion or terror have ſuffered themſelves to be divided and withdrawn to make defection to the contrary part; Many have turned off to a deteſtable indifferency and neutrality in this cauſe, which ſo much concerneth the glory of God and the good of theſe Kingdoms; Nay many have made it their ſtudy to walk ſo, as they might comply with all times and all the revolutions thereof. It hath not been our care to countenance, encourage, intruſt and employ ſuch onely, as from their hearts did affect and mind Gods Work; But the hearts of ſuch many times have been diſcouraged, and their hands weakened, their ſufferings neglected, and themſelves ſlighted, and many who were once open enemies and alwayes ſecret underminers contenanced and employed; Nay even thoſe who had been looked upon as Incendiaries, and upon whom the Lord had
<pb facs="tcp:64759:38"/>
ſet marks of deſperate Malignancy, falshood &amp; deceat were brought in, as fit to manage publick affaires; Many have been the lets and Impediments that have been caſt in the way to retard and obſtruct the Lords work, and ſome have keeped ſecret, what of themſelves they were not able to ſuppreſſe and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe and many other breaches of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Covenant in the matter thereof, which it concerneth every one of us to ſearch out and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge before the Lord, as we would wish his wrath to be turned away from us; So have many of us failed exceedingly in the manner of our following and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duties contained therein, not onely ſeeking great things for our ſelves, and mixing of private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and ends concerning our ſelves and friends and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, with thoſe things which concern the publick good, but many times preferring ſuch to the Honour of God and good of his cauſe, and retarding Gods work until we might carry alongs with us our own intereſts and deſignes. It hath been our way to truſt in the means and to rely upon the arm of flesh for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, Albeit the Lord hath many times made us meet with diſpointment therein, and ſtained the pride of all our Glory, by blaſting every carnall confidence unto us: We have followed for the moſt part the counſels of flesh and blood, and walked more by the rules of policy then Piety, and have hearkened more unto men then unto God.</p>
            <p>Albeit we made ſolemn publick profeſſion before the World of our unfained deſires to be humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord for our own ſinnes, and the ſinnes of theſe Kingdoms, eſpecially for our undervaluing of the ineſtimable benefit of the Goſpel, and that we
<pb facs="tcp:64759:38"/>
have not laboured for the power thereof, and received Chriſt into our hearts, and walked worthy of him in our lives, and of our true and unfained purpoſe, deſire and endeavour for our ſelves, and all other under our power and charge both in publick and private, in all dutyes which we owe to God and man to amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a reall Reformation, that the Lord might turn away his wrath and heavy indignation, and eſtablish theſe Kirks and Kingdoms in truth and peace, Yet we have refuſed to be reformed, and have walked proudly and obſtinatly againſt the Lord, not v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The ignorance of God and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt prevailes exceedingly in the Land; The greateſt part of Maſters of families amongſt Noblemen, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Gentlemen, Burgeſſes and Commons neglect to ſeek God in their families, and to endeavour the the Reformation thereof; And albeit it hath been much preſſed, yet few of our Nobles and great ones ever to his day could be perſwaded to perform family duties themſelves and in their own perſons; which makes ſo neceſſary and uſeful a duty to be miſregarded by others of inferior rank; Nay many of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Gentry, and Burrows who should have been examples of Godlineſſe and ſober walking unto others, have been ring-leaders of exceſſe and rioting. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we be the Lords people engaged to him in a ſolemn way, yet to this day we have not made it our ſtudy
<pb facs="tcp:64759:39"/>
that judicatories &amp; Armies should conſiſt of, and places of power and truſt be filled with men of a blameleſſe and Chriſtian converſation, and of known integrity and approven fidelity, affection and Zeal unto the cauſe of God, but not onely thoſe who have been neutrall and indifferent but diſaffected and Malignant, and others who have been prophane and ſcandalous have been intruſted; By which it hath come to paſſe that judicatories have been the ſeats of injuſtice and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, aad many in our Armies by their miſcarriages have become our plague, unto the great prejudice of the cauſe of God, the great ſcandall of the Goſpel, and the great increaſe of looſeneſſe &amp; prophanity through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Land. It were impoſſible to reckon up all the abominations that are in the Land, but the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of the name of God, ſwearing by the Creatures, prophanation of the Lords Day, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, drunkenneſſe, exceſſe and rioting, vanity of apparrel, lying and deceit, railing and curſing, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and uncontrolled oppreſſion, and grinding of the faces of the poor, by Landlords and others in place and power, are become ordinary and common ſinnes; And beſides all theſe things, there be many other tranſgreſſions, whereof the Land wherein we live are guilty: All which we deſire to acknowledge and to be humbled for, that the world may bear witneſſe with us, that Righteouſneſſe belongeth unto God, and shame &amp; confuſion of face unto us as appears this day.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it is needfull for theſe who find mercy not onely to confeſſe but alſo to forſake their ſinne, Therefore that the reality and ſincerity of our repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may appear, We do Reſolve and ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelves before the Lord, carefully to avoid for the time to come all theſe offences, whereof we have
<pb facs="tcp:64759:39"/>
now made ſolemn publick acknowledgement, and all the ſnares and tentations which tend thereunto: And to teſtifie the integrity of our reſolution herein, and that we may be the better enabled in the power of the Lords ſtrength to perform the ſame, We do again Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue our Solemn League and Covenant, Promiſing hereafter to make conſcience of all the duties whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are obliged in all the heads and Articles thereof, particularly of theſe which follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe Religion is of all things the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and precious, The advancing and promoving the power thereof againſt all ungodlineſſe and profanity, The ſecuring and preſerving the purity thereof againſt all error, hereſy and ſchiſme, and namely <hi>Independency, Anabatiſme, Antinomianiſme, Arminianiſme, Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Familiſme, Libertiniſme, Scepticiſme, and Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſme,</hi> and the carrying on the work of uniformity shall be ſtudied &amp; endeavoured by us before all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſts, whether concerning the King or our ſelves, or any other whatſomever. 2: Becauſe many have of late laboured to ſupplant the liberties of the Kirk, we shall maintain and defend the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in all her liberties and priviledges, againſt all who shall oppoſe or undermine the ſame, or encroach thereupon under any pretext whatſomever. 3. We shall vindicat and maintain the liberties of the Subjects, in all theſe things which concern their conſciences, perſons and Eſtates. 4. We shall carefully maintain and defend the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and avoid every thing that may weaken the ſame, or involve us in any meaſure of acceſſion unto the guilt of thoſe who have invaded the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> 5. As we have been always Loyall to our King, ſo we shall ſtill endeavour to give unto God that which is Gods, and to <hi>Caeſar</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64759:40"/>
the things which are <hi>Ceſars.</hi> 6. We shall be ſo farre from conniving at, complying with, or contenanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Malignancy, injuſtice, iniquity, prophani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impiety, that we shall not onely avoid, and diſcountenance thoſe things, and cherish and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage theſe perſons, who are zealous for the Cauſe of God, and walk according to the Goſpel; But alſo shall take a more effectuall courſe then heretofore in our reſpective Places and Callings, for punishing and ſuppreſſing theſe evils, and faithfully endeavour that the beſt and fitteſt remedies may be applyed for taking away the cauſes thereof, and advancing the knowledge of God, and Holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe in the Land: And therefore in the laſt place, as we shall earneſtly pray unto God that he would give us <hi>able men fearing God, men of truth and hating covetouſneſſe</hi> to judge and bear charge among his people, ſo we shall according to our Places and Callings Endeavour that Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and all places of power and truſt both in Kirk and State may conſiſt of, and be filled with ſuch men as are of known good affection to the cauſe of God, and of a blameleſſe and Chriſtian converſation.</p>
            <p>And becauſe there be many, who heretofore have not made conſcience of the oath of God, but ſome through fear, others by perſwaſion and upon baſe ends and humane intereſts have entered thereinto, who have afterwards diſcovered themſelves to have dealt deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the Lord, in ſwearing falſly by his name, Therefore we, who do now renew our Covenant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to theſe duties, and all other duties contained therein, Do in the ſight of him who is the ſearcher of hearts, ſolemnly Profeſſe that it is not upon any poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique advantage or private intereſt or by-end, or becauſe of any terror or perſwaſion from men, or hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb facs="tcp:64759:40"/>
and deceitfully, that we do again take upon us the oath of God, But honeſtly and ſincerely and from the ſence of our duty, And that therefore denying our ſelves and our own things and laying aſide all ſelf inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and ends, We shall above all things ſeek the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, the good of his Cauſe and the wealth of his people, and that forſaking the counſels of flesh and blood, and not leaning upon carnall confidences, we shall depend upon the Lord, walk by the rule of his word, and hearken to the voice of his ſervants: In all which profeſſing our own weakneſſe We do earneſtly pray to God who is the father of mercies through his Son Jeſus Chriſt, to be merciful unto us, and to enable us by the power of his might, that we may do our duty unto the praiſe of his Grace in the Churches. <hi>Amen.</hi>

this whole Land and Nation, in the conſummation of his fierce anger, to have been poured out in our deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) hath made Light and Salvation to ariſe, and Glory and Praiſe to ſpring forth, in making his grace more manifeſt and commending and aſſerting His Work and Covenant, more in the Sufferings and Death of His faithfull Servants and Witneſſes, then in all the proſperity and Victories, which formerly he vouchſaved upon us. O! bleſſed and exalted be his moſt Holy Name and aboundant Grace, who for the wicked and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany rejoycing of our adverſaries, hath given to his People, ſuch ſweet conſolations and Exuberant Praiſe; and from the depths of our preſent diſtreſſes, and amidſt the feares of ſo imminent and great judgments, hath, in ſtead of an Apology before the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put a ſong of Salvation in our Mouth, that, as well to Teſtify for the Lord againſt the backſliders, as for the comfort and conſolation of all who love and wait for his Salvation, we may call the Heavens to hear and the Earth to give ear, that we may publish the Name of the Lord, and aſcrib Greatneſs to our God, whoſe work is perfect, and all his wayes Iudgment; A God of Truth, and without Iniquity, Juſt and Right is He. We have corrupted ourſelves, our ſpot is not the ſpot of his Children, we are a perverſe and crooked generation: Do we thus requit the Lord, O foolish people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Yet is not He our Father that hath bought us? Hath not He made us and eſtablished us? Let us then remember the dayes of old, when the moſt High did viſit us, and the Lord became Our God, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came His People and Inheritance. This is the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his dying withneſſes, this is the voice of his preſent Diſpenſations. We will therefore call to mind the Years of the right hand of the Moſt High, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64759:44"/>
the wondrous works of the Lord, which He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one did work in our Land: We will alſo declare our manifold Engagements, and our moſt ſelemn and ſacred Covenants, with and to Our God; that the Lord's Loving Kindneſs may be made known; that the Innocency, Strength and Joy of his Servants may appear; that the glory of all his Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are either already come upon us, or which we have reaſon to fear, may be made manifeſt; that wickedneſs may ſtop it's mouth; and that all the Enemies of the Lord may be confounded.</p>
            <p>It is not here intended to reſume theſe debates, which, as the Adverſaries have formerly moved, and pertinaciouſly maintained againſt the Work of God, and almoſt againſt every paſſage and tranſaction thereof; ſo have the Lovers and Owners of it, abundantly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the Lord Himſelf determined with that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Evidence, that, the Converſion of ſome and Conviction of almoſt all, and even of it's moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperat oppoſers, is not the ſmaleſt part of it's Glory: But ſeing the party that now prevaileth, hath diſdained that method, and only by plain force and Violence, in the moſt groſs and deſperat Rebellion, Blaſphemy and Perfidy againſt God and his Cauſe, and the higheſt and moſt determined contempt and miſreguard of all good Conſcience, and ſacred Oathes, that ever the ſun beheld, hath carried on and advanced this preſent Apoſtacy and defection, under which all the Godly do mourn, and the Land perisheth: We shall only here endeavour, the ſincere and candid Repreſentation of theſe things, which, as they were once the Glory of the Lord, and joy of his people in this poor Nation, ſo are they now the Teſtimony and Triumph of his witneſſes, and the Patience and Hope of all his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64759:45"/>
Sufferers, and may be the full Satiſfaction of all, who shall hear of theſe late and preſent troubles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord doth Exerciſe us, and will undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the end prove, etiher the Exaltation and Praiſe, or the Deſolation and perpetuall Confuſion of BACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SLIDEN SCOTLAND.</p>
            <p>When Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through the uſurpation of the Roman Antichriſt, and the contagion of his abominations, and through the Prid, Luſt and Tyranny of Prelacy, (the very root and ſtrength of that Kingdom of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs) had fallen into that groſs and black darkneſs of Ignorance and Superſtition, and into theſe ſtrong Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, (wherewith the Lord as he hath threatned, ſo hath he ever infallibly plagued that Antichriſtian courſe) and for many hundreth Years had lien involved therein; It pleaſed the Lord in his wonderful mercy and free love, to cauſe the glorious Light of the everlaſting Goſpell again to ariſe and shine forth amongſt us: Which, as it is ever beſt witneſſed by its own Power and Purity; So through the Power and Wiſdome of God alone, even by the Weakneſs of very mean inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the midſt of the flames of fiery perſecutions, and againſt the rage and fury of the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of all the powers of Hell, was this Work advanced and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated: As the recordes of theſe times from 1494. until about the Year 1560. do plainly diſcover. Dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which period of time, theſe things are very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> That where and when ever the Light and Truth of God did diſcover &amp; teſtify againſt the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Errors, Idolatry, and Superſtitions of Popery in the ſame manner it teſtified and declared, that the Popes uſurped Tyranny, and the Prid, Idleneſs and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64759:45"/>
of the wicked Prelates, were cheefly the Authors and Maintainers thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> That ſuch as the Lord did from time to time call to, and ſend forth for the work of the Miniſtry, did walk therein, with the ſame Painfulneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Poverty, Simplicity, Humility, and Equality which the Holy command and practiſes of our bleſſed Lord and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, do ſo conſtantly commend: Hence it is, that, in ſo far as this point could fall under the enquiry of theſe times, it is clearly held out, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged no Officer in God's Houſe, Superior to a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſter and according to the ſtandard of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, did they try, reject and crave the Reformation of exorbitant Prelacy. As the examinations and teſtimonies of the faithfull in theſe dayes do witneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That as the love of God and his bleſſed Truth, and the Precepts, Promiſe and Preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chirſt, did enable unto all Patience with joy, ſuch as, by the call of a clear and neceſſary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the Lord ſett forth to be his witneſſes; (who, for the love and Teſtimony of Jeſus, cheerfully embraced the fire and faggott) ſo when the Lord did multiply the faithful to a Reaſonable Capacity, they were ſo far from reſigning themſelves, and abandoning that Firſt, and moſt juſt Priviledge of <hi>Self-defence</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the arbitriment even of the lawful Powers, and of that Authority which they did acknowledge, that they not only owned it and ſtood to it; but did account themſelves ſo much the more obliged to their own Preſervation and eſteemed the ſame ſo much the more endeared to them, that the ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing forth of the Glory of God, in the maintainance of the bleſſed Goſpel and the propagation and continuance thereof, ſeemed ſo neceſſarily to depend thereon: which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, they did alſo further extend, in the bowels and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64759:46"/>
bonds of brotherly affection in Chriſt Jeſus, unto the ſame duty of defence &amp; <hi>Aſſiſtence</hi> to all his members. And in effect, if their Principles and Practices be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it will appear, that, as when God called them to ſuffering, they loved not their lives unto Death that they might witneſs a good confeſſion; ſo when they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to any Probability of <hi>Acting,</hi> they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indiſpenſibly obliged, upon their uttermoſt hazard to defend the Goſpel which they had receaved, and to ſuppreſs all Superſtition and Idolatry contrary therto, although the motive of Self-defence had not been conjoined: And it will alſo appear, that the Neceſſity of Convocations and Combinations (though not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out but even againſt Authority; Yet being in order to ſuch neceſſary and juſt Ends) did ſuffiriently warrand them befor God and all men, from the breach of any Law or Act then ſtanding againſt the ſame, wherewith they might have been charged. For verification here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though the whole courſe of our Reformation be an unqueſtionable evidence, yet let the inſtance of their firſt Appearance be obſerved, wherein both the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Actors and all other circumſtances, do more clearly and beyond all cavillation hold out, that only the Love and Zeal of God, in the ſame Spirit in which they had ſo conſtantly ſuffered, did ſtir them up, from the pure and vive ſenſe of their indiſpenſible duty and certaine Priviledge, againſt all oppoſition whatſomever, to own and ſet themſelves for the Defence of the Goſpel and the true Miniſters thereof. The paſſage is thus.</p>
            <p>In or about the Year 1555 the Queen by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the Prelats, (perceaving the increaſe of the Proteſtants, and fearing ſome inward diſtraction, during the wars then with England, if Shee should
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64759:46"/>
fall upon a more rigorous and general courſe,) did cauſe all the Preachers to be ſummoned: whereupon the body and generality of the whole Proteſtants, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to keep the Dyet. But the Bishops apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hazard, did procure that they should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded inſtantly to the borders: Nevertheleſs God had ſo provided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that upon the ſame day the Weſt-land Quarter returned from it; which conſiſting of many faithful men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſoon as they underſtood the matter, they repaired to the Queen, and plainly in the hearing of the Prelates did charge them, with the cruel device intended, and certified Her' of their reſolution, both to oppoſe it, and defend their Brethren to their utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and ceaſed not, until that She was moved to diſcharge the citation.</p>
            <p>Thereafter in the Year 1557. they entered into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of conſtant mutual Defence of the Goſpel, their Miniſters, and themſelves, againſt all their adverſaries, in theſe words, <hi>VVe perceiving how Sathan in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the Antichriſts of our time, cruelly do rage, ſeeking to overthrow and deſtroy the Goſpel of Chriſt, and his Congregation, ought, according to our bounden duty, to ſtrive in our Maſters Cauſe, even unto the death, being certaine of the Victorie in him: The which our duty being well conſidered, VVe do promiſe before the Majeſty of God, and his Congregation, That we (by his grace) ſhal with all diligence continually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our whole power, ſubſtance, and our very lives, to maintain, ſet forward, and eſtabliſh the most bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed VVord of God, and his Congregation: And ſhall labour according to our power, to have faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64759:47"/>
truly and purely to miniſter Chriſts Goſpel and Sacraments to his people. VVe ſhal maintain them, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them, and defend them; the whole Congregation of Chriſt, and every Member thereof according to our whole powers, and waging of our lives, againſt Sathan and all wicked power that doth intend Tyrranny or trouble against the foreſaid Congregation. Vnto the which holy VVord, and Congregation, we de joyne us; and ſo do forſake and renounce the Congregation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than with all the ſuperſtitious abomination and idolatry thereof. And moreover, ſhall declare our ſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt enemies therto, by this our faithful promiſe before God teſtified to this Congregation, by our Subſcription at theſe Preſents. At Edinburgh the third Day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, Anno</hi> 1557. <hi>God called to witneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like as in the Year 1559. being again neceſſitated to aſſemble for, and ſtand to the defence of the Goſpel and themſelves, at <hi>Perth,</hi> they renewed and enlarged the ſame engagement, according to the good hand and Spirit of God upon his Servants, in theſe words, <hi>At</hi> Perth <hi>the last day of May, the Year of God</hi> 1559. <hi>Yeares, the Congregations of the VVeſt Countrey, with the Congregations of</hi> Fife, Perth, Dundie, Angus, Merns <hi>and</hi> Monroſs, <hi>being conveened in the town of</hi> Perth, <hi>in the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, for ſetting forth of his glory, underſtanding nothing more neceſſary for the ſame, then to keep a conſtant amity, unity, and fellowſhip together, according as they are commanded by God, are confederate, and become bounden and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64759:47"/>
obliged in the preſence of God, to concurre &amp; aſsist together in doing all things required of God in his Scripture, that may be to his glory; And at their whole powers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and put away all things that doth diſhonour to his name, ſo that God may be truly and purely worshipped. And in caſe that any trouble be intended aganst the ſaid Congregation, or any part or member thereof, the whole Congregation shall concurre, aſsiſt, and conveen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the defence of the ſame Congregation or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon troubled: And shall not ſpare Labours, goods, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Bodies and Lives, in maintaining the liberty of the whole Congregation, and every member thereof, againſt whatſoever perſon shall intend the ſaid trouble for cauſe of Religion, or any other cauſe depending thereupon, or lay to their charge under pretence thereof, although it happen to be coloured with any other outward cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again in the Moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the ſame Year, after having ſuſtained and valiantly reſiſted a ſecond aſſault, both of the wicked Prelats and of their other violent adverſaries; by a third band &amp; Oath they added a further caution to their former engagements, to the effect that in ſo juſt and holy a cauſe, they might never by force or fraud be thereafter fainted or divided.</p>
            <p>And laſtly in April <hi>Anno</hi> 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>0. they ingaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a fourth bond in theſe words, <hi>VVe whoſe names are underwritten, have promiſed and oblidged our ſelves faithfully in the preſence of God, and by theſe preſents do promiſe, that we together in Generall, and every one of us in ſpecial by himſelf, with our bodies,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64759:48"/>
goods and friends, and all that we can doe, shall ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Reformation of Religion, according to Gods VVord, and procure by all means poſsible, that the Truth of Gods VVord, my haue free paſsage within this realme, with due adminiſtration of Sacraments, and all things depending upon the ſaid VVord—that we shall each one with another, all of us, effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, joine in one, take &amp; hold one plain part for the, — and recovery of our ancient freedome, Liberties.—that we way be ruled by the Lawes and Cuſtome of the Countrey.—Again that we shall tender the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe, as if it were the Cauſe of every one of us in particular; And that the Cauſes of every one of us now joyned together, being lawfull and honest, shall be all our Cauſe in Generall; And that he that is enemy to the Cauſe foreſaid, shall be Enemy to us all in ſo far.</hi>—Wee have ſuperadded theſe inſtances (as wee might have done two or three more) to the firſt propoſed, becauſe of their great reſemblance, ſince there can be nothing more manifeſt, then that the ſame Provocations the ſame Spirit, the ſame Principles, and the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, did moſt uniformly influence all theſe Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions. Now ſeeing that both the Occaſion, Actors, Aime, and End of the firſt Action, and eſpecially the obſervable Providence of God, that without all contrivance of man did over-rule it, do clearly purge it of any intended Rebellion or other wickedneſs; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to affirm that all theſe things were nevertheleſs acted in, &amp; by a Rebellious Spirit, muſt be a ſinn, at leaſt next unto that of high deſpit and Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and Spirit of grace, by whoſe power
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64759:48"/>
alone, this bleſſed work was effectuated: Neither durſt the Arch-Prelat himſelf though our Arch-Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in this our preſent cauſe, and though he knew that the ſame doth infallibly, either ſtand or fall upon the ſame principles and grounds with theſe caſes now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, proceed any further in his cenſure of theſe courſes and practices; then to diſprove them as Violent and Diſorderly. There is one thing further, which is alſo before touched, that the inſtances above adduced eſpecially the firſt, both for the Meanneſs of it's Actors the unpremeditated plainneſs of its Manner, and the ſinglneſs and purity of its End, doth moſt evidently make out, <hi>viz:</hi> that as theſe men of God, by their ſmall and improbable appearance, did as much witneſs their unfained love of the Truth and zeal of his Glory, in the manifeſt contempt and hazard of their lives and fortuns, As when under the diſpenſation and call of another providence, they did patiently and cheerfully upon the ſame motives, lay down their lives, and ſuffer the loſs of all things; So the end of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, was not only their own juſt and neceſſary Defence, which in ſuch an apparent danger, might rather ſeem to be abandoned then intended, but above all things, the Maintainance &amp; Defence of that bleſſed Evangel, which was dearer to them, then all other intereſts whatſoever. Wee know our great adverſaries, who for the gain and pleaſours of this life (what then would they not do for the preſervation of life it ſelf?) have often renounced, and would again renounce all Conſcience, Alleagance and Truth; and who by their deteſtable Flatterv, in denying the lawfulneſs of Self-defence, (although in effect <hi>Self</hi> be their only Idol) &amp; pretending a fained affection, &amp; illimited ſubmiſſion without reſerve, do only court the Powers, for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64759:49"/>
advanceing of theſe intereſts, which they ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish; as the revolutions of the World, have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently declared their practiſes in prejudice of both Religion and Royalty, and have often reſolved both their practiſes and principles, into that one Devilish poſition, the firſt yea only fixed rule of their Religion <hi>Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will be give for his life</hi>; Theſe, we ſay, are not curious to enquire in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; Yet, ſeeing they leave nothing uneſſayed whereby to promote their deſign, and therefore, do often cavil from ſuch advantages as the work of God afterwards obtained, and particularly the Concurrence of the Peers and <hi>Primores Regni,</hi> and from the defect thereof in the firſt appearances, would infer the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of rhe ſame, eſpecially in order to the deſign of Reformation; Therefore wee further add with theſe noble worthies, that as it cannot be denied, 1. That the right &amp; Priviledge of Self-defence is not only founded in, but is the very firſt inſtinct of pure Nature, and ſpring of all motion and action. 2. That it was competent to, and exerciſed by every individual, before that either Society or Government were known. 3. That it was ſo far from being ſurrendred or ſuppreſſed by the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe, that it was &amp; is the great End &amp; motive, for which all voluntary Societies and Policies were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced and are continued. 4. That it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal rule of Righteouſneſs, whereunto that great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of love to our neightbour, by the Law of God &amp; by our Lord himſelf is reſolved, &amp; whereby it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted; ſo it doth infallibly follow, that the ſame right and Priviledge is yet competent to all men, whither Separatly or Jointly; and needeth no other prerequiſit, but that of intollerable and inevitable injury; (which for a man to ſuffer under pretext of the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64759:49"/>
would be, for the deluſion of an emptie name, only for the luſt of others, really to deprive himſelf of his whole share and intereſt therein) and is compleated for exerciſe by ſuch a Probable Capacity, as may encourage the Aſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ters thereof to undertake it.</p>
            <p>And as for that other, and more noble deſign of the Maintainance and Reformation of Religion, waving the queſtion and Debate. <hi>Whether the ſame can or ought to be by force maintained?</hi> Which may appear ſufficiently determined to rationall men, by the very contrary Practiſes of it's adverſaries, who not only by force do fight aginſt it, but moſt irreligiouſly uſurpe and detort it's own weapons <hi>viz</hi>: the precepts of our Lord, for patience and meeknes under a diſpenſation of ſuffering, to the perſuaſion of a ſtupid ſubmiſſion, and caſting away the opportunity of Deſence and Acting; that without controll they may work it's overthrow; And ſuppoſing with all men, that force is not a proper argument of perſuaſion, and that Religion neither can nor ought to be thereby propagated; Yet are we in conſcience perſuaded, that the grounds follouwing, evidently held out in the records of theſe times, are beyond contradiction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Religion (the higheſt concernment of Gods glory and of mans happineſs both temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall) is the moſt important, dear and precious of all intereſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That to be violented in this (which cannot be without an unjuſt force either or mens Perſons or Goods) is the moſt wicked and inſupportable of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the propelling by force of ſuch injuries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the juſteſt cauſe and quarrell, that men in their Primaeve Liberty could be engaged in.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64759:50"/>4. That, as for the ſecurity of this Intereſt, and no wayes to make an abſolut ſurrender thereof to the arbitriment of any, men were moſtly induced to the appointing of Governours, ſo the glory of God, which is the end of all things, but herein is moſt eſpecially concerned was by the erecting of Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſecurity of Religion, more particularly and eminently intended.</p>

            <p>We are not ignorant of the no leſs wicked then ground leſs cavils of ſome, as if we would make or have every man to be a <hi>Phinehas</hi>: And what then?

But as for that Act of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> the termes following being generall and ambigous, admitting of ſeverall diſtinctions and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctions, as it is not eaſy without diſtinguishing,

               <hi>in theſi</hi> to define an Action and Call Extraordinary, and an Action and Call thereunto, only Heroicall; and to ſtate the true ſpecificall Difference and juſt limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen an Action and Call Extraordinary, and an Action and Call Heroicall, as they are ſtrickly taken and contradiſtinguished; and clearly and convincingly to demonſtrat, what and how much more is required in an Extraordinary Call to an Extraordinary Action, then is required in a ſufficient Call unto an Heroicall Action? and whether an eminent meaſure of Holy Zeal, Magnanimity and Fortitude do conſtitut a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Call unto an Heroicall Action; or do only Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and fit the perſon for the right and better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, as a <hi>Call</hi> unto the Action, and the <hi>Fitneſs</hi> of the Perſon for doing of the ſame are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictinguished; or may not both Diſpoſe and fit the perſon for performance of the Action, and alſo include and give a Call unto the Action it ſelf: So when the matter is fully conſidered, it will be more difficult then perhaps is apprehended, to prove that the Act of <hi>Phinehas</hi> was Extraordinary, ſtrickly taken and in contradiſtinction to that which is only Heroical; or that his Call thereunto was Extraordinary, in contradiſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that which is a ſufficient Call unto an Heroicall Action; and more difficult to determine, otherwiſe then by naked aſſertion, what that Extraordinary Call was? Wherein it did conſiſt? Wherein it did differ from, Exceed or Excell a Call unto an Heroick Action? And therefore, it will be alſo hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly to demonſtrat, that it might not have been lawfully done by another of the Children of Iſrael, whom the Lord had animated thereunto, by the ſame Holy Zeall and Reſolution.

Good of the Church and Common-wealth, or of any particular perſon's juſt Right and ſecurity; but alſo in the caſe of the Magiſtrat, and others, their wilfull and perverſe neglecting of their duty, is neceſſarly undertaken, and is not only formally intended by the Actor, but alſo natively and really doth conduce to the Glory of God, the Good of Religion, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and eſtablishment of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and of every particular perſon's Juſt Rights and Security, by ſuppreſſing of Impiety, promoving of Truth and Holineſs, doing of Juſtice, Turning away of wrath and removing of preſent and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of future Jugdments. And as for the particular inſtance of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> if the Lord did not only raiſe him up to that particular Act of Juſtice, but alſo warrant and accept him therein, and reward him therefore, upon the accompt of his Zeall, when there was a Godly and Zealous Magiſtrat, able, &amp; whom we cannot without breach of charity preſume, but alſo willing to Execute Juſtice; How much more may it be pleaded, that the Lord, who is the ſame, yeſterday, to day and for ever, will, not only pour out of that ſame Spirit upon others, but alſo when he gives it, both Allow them though they be but private perſons, and alſo Call them being otherwiſe in a Phyſical and probable Capacity, to do theſe things in an Extremely neceſſitous, and otherwiſe irrecoverable State of the Church, to which in a more intire condition thereof, he doth not Call them; and particularly when there is not only the like or worſe provocations, the like Neceſſity of the Execution of juſtice and of Reformation, for the turning away of Wrath and Removall of Judgments, that was in <hi>Phinehas</hi> caſe; but alſo when the Supreme
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64759:54"/>
Civil Magiſtrat, the <hi>Primores Regni</hi> and other inferior Rulers, are not only unwilling to do their duty, but ſo far corrupted and perverted, that they are become the Authors and patronizers of theſe abominations. Which is alſo the more conſiderable, becauſe, if upon the fear or ſuſpicion of the Accidental hazard of Private mens uſurping of the Office, or doing of the duty of Publick perſons, every vertue and vertous Action, which may be ſo abuſed, shall be utterly neglected, Impiety shall quickly gain an Univerſall Empire, to the extermination of all Goodneſs. It is true, that the God of Order hath aſſigned to every man his Station and Calling, within the bounds whereof he should keep, without tranſgreſſing by Defect or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and therein wait and act, in ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit as He is pleaſed to comunicate: And we do not hold ſuch inſtances for Regulare &amp; ordinary precedents for all times and perſons univerſally; which while ſome have fancyed, and heeding more the glory and fame of the Action, then the ſound and ſolid Rule of the Holy Scriptures, they have been tempted and carried to fearfull Extravagancies: Neither are inſolent or diſorderly much leſs Wicked attempts, which ſometimes have covered and yet may mask themſelves with a pretence of Zeal, upon this or any other ground to be licenced or approved; But on the other hand, as theſe inſtances hold forth, for the conviction and reproof of our ſtupidity and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, what an high pitch of Holy Zeall and Courage, the Servants of the Lord have ſometimes attained, and do further demonſtrat, that He doth ſometimes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant even Private perſons, in their doing of theſe things in an Extream Neceſſity and collapſed ſtate of the Church, to which at other times He doth not

call them: So when the Lord, with whom is the reſidue of the Spirit, doth breath upon his people more or fewer, to the exciting of more then Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Zeal, Courage and Reſolution, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of an Apoſtat Church, for the Execution of juſtice upon the Adverſaries, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing and eſtablishing of Truth and Holineſs in the Earth, wee should rather ascribe glory and praiſe to Him, whoſe hand is not shortened, but many times choiſeth the Weak and Foolish things of the World to confound the Mighty and the Wiſe, then condemn His Inſtruments for Rebels and Uſurpers, as it is like <hi>Phin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="10">10. As the Right of Self-Defence, mutual Aſſiſtance and Reformation, is properly and only derivable from the grounds adduced; ſo the Concurſe of the Nobles and <hi>Primores Regni,</hi> is no wayes of <hi>abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> though indeed ſingularly conducible for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on thereof.

            <p>Theſe are a part of the grounds, whereupon theſe Noble Worrhies, raiſed up by God &amp; eminently by him inſpired, did ſingly act for His own glory: which as they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64759:55"/>
have left upon record for their own perpetual vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo thereby they did clearly purge themſelves from all imputation of Rebellion. Nor were their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and practiſes ever by any ſo much as termed diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, except by ſuch who being altogether indifferent in the Work of God, endeavour by all means to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniat and shame them, from being made precedents to their own prejudice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> It is obſervable, that though the practiſes of theſe firſt times were Extraordinary, and to many may appear Diſorderly, Yet the faithful men whom the Lord honoured both to Suffer &amp; to Do for His name, did conſtantly and boldly charge both the Riſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of theſe diſorders, upon the Perſons then in Power &amp; Authority, who, being ordained &amp; entruſted by God, for the defence &amp; maintenance of Truth and Righteouſneſs, (as the only true foundations and ſolid grounds of the Peoples felicity whither temporal or eternal; and including all the ends, for which either the Power or Perſons of Governours are appointed; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the principal bonds of all obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, for which all theſe engadgements are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to which they do ultimatly refer) by reſiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtarting out from this moſt ſacred and fixed line of ſubordination; As they could not claim Obedience to their unjuſt commands, ſo, far-leſs could they oblidge the people, to that more then ſlavish and brutish ſubjection, in the ſubmitting of their ſouls, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; goods to the arbitriment of their cruel Tyranny, directly contrary unto, and deſtructive of all theſe holy &amp; great Ends, both of Gods Glory, and the Peoples ſpiritual and temporal Good, for which they were conſtituted Governours.</p>
            <p>That this was the ſource and fountain of all diſorders
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64759:55"/>
in theſe times, and that it was ſo reputed to be, by theſe valiant Worthies who then oppoſed them, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory thereof doth plainly verify. Wee are not forgetful, how vehemently the Powers on earth, which ſet themſelves againſt the Lord, and their creaturs and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, have in all times decryed ſuch aſſertions: The noiſe, belshings, &amp; thundering, of <hi>Treaſon, Treaſon,</hi> wherewith the very mentioning of ſuch poſitions, uſeth at once to be attended and condemned, do already ſound in our ears: Let ſuch as are thereby alarmed, read the debats and controverſies, both of former &amp; later times; Eſpecially theſe two <hi>Martyrs</hi> againſt Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> and <hi>the Apologetical Narration</hi> upon this ſubject. This is our peace and eſtablishment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord and all men; that wee with our Noble Reformers do acknowledge and honour Authority as the great Ordinance of God, for the uphold and maintainance of Truth and Righteouſneſs; and the Perſons therewith veſted, not only as eminently thereby dignified, but alſo as moſt ſignally impreſſed, by a very ſacred and illuſtrious Character of the glorious Majeſty of the Moſt High, who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted them: But on the orher hand, wee cannot but wish, that theſe ſame perſons would conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that not only they are the Miniſters of God, and to Him accountable; but alſo his Miniſters to the People for their Good, whom they neither ought to Tyrannize over at their own Pleaſure, nor Rule only for their own Profit. O! that theſe ſacred Boundaries had ever been obſerved, &amp; that both Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Rebellion with all their Antidots and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, had been perpetually unknown. But shall Tyranny, unto which, Power, both in it's ſelf is ſo eaſily corrupted, and by the flattery of others more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64759:56"/>
frequently abuſed, be not only shrouded under the priviledge and impunity of a Divine Exemption; but thereby, in effect be more intollerably licenced, to the acting of all wickedneſs and violence, and the perverting and overturning of all the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And in the mean time, shall the Peoples moſt juſt &amp; neceſſary Defence of themſelves, (whereunto they are ſeldome and very hardly provocked, even by the moſt extream neceſſity) &amp; of all their moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious concernments, the very ends for which the Powers are ordained, be continually at the Arbitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Court-Creature or flatterer, proſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perſecuted under theſe odious names of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi>? Certainly, neither the All-wiſe Providence of God; not yet the frame of nature can endure ſuch a Soleciſme. For our part, as wee are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that none pleadeth for this Abſolut Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the People and Exemption of the Prince but ſuch as for advancing of their own intereſt, have firſt proſtrated their Conſciences to the Princes arbitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a blind &amp; Abſolut Obedience; whereby they know themſelves ſufficiently ſecured from all ſmart &amp; inconvenience, of that more Brutall then Rationall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion contended for: So are wee confident, that ſeing Subjection is principally enjoyned, for and in order to Obedience, whatſoever Reaſon or Authority can be adduced to perſwad an abſolut &amp; indiſpenſible Subjection, will far more rationally and plauſibly infer an illimited and Abſolut Obedience; and that to plead for a priviledge in the point of Obedience, &amp; to diſclam it in the point of ſubjection, is only the flattety of ſuch, as having renounced with Conſcience all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Obedience, would deveſt others of all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, that they may exerciſe their Tyranny without
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64759:56"/>
without controll. But He who hath called Rulers, <hi>Gods</hi>; Doth notwithſtanding Himſelf remain the Moſt High God over all the Earth; &amp; from his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, neither the Commands nor Violence of Kings of Clay ought in the leaſt to remove us. And as theſe inferior Princes do often forget their Subordination to the Moſt High, in their unjuſt commands; &amp; would uſurpe His Throne, by an uncontrollable Soverain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo the Lord, by the warrand of his Word, and approbation of his Providence, and alſo of the People, (when by them oppreſſed, but by Himſelf animated &amp; ſtrengthned) hath declared &amp; made void this their pretended exemption and impunity, and removed the carcaſes of ſuch Kings and broken their Scepter. Amongſt which precedents, the inſtance of theſe times, whereof we now ſpeak, is worthily recorded, and deſerveth better to be remembred.</p>
            <p>Seing therefore, that neither the Ordinance and Commiſſion of God, nor yet the Surrender of the People, though into ane abſolut ſlavery (which yet no preſumption leſs then their own moſt Expreſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent can poſſibly infer) can from any certain and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ground and warrant, be either produced or plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for veſting the Prince with that arbitrary and irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Power and Dominion, neceſſary and requiſit to oblidge the Subject to a ſtupid and brutish ſubmiſſion, to all poſſible injuries and outrages; and that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any rational man, to concede that Privil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of exemption and impunity to wickedneſs and fury, for murthering both the Souls &amp; Bodies of poor Subjects, which our very adverſaries deny to Weakneſs or Folly in caſe of Alienation of the Kingdome or any part thereof, or any ſuch groſs act of Mal-verſation,

&amp; laſtly ſeing the great inconvenience, of opening a door to Rebellion &amp; all diſorder, mainly urged by the Adverſaries, againſt the permitting of the People any judgment or reflection upon the Princes Actings, doth more rationally plead for Implicit &amp; blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which they themſelves diſprove, then mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat againſt neceſſary Defence and reſiſtance in caſe of perſecution for lawfull non-obedience; And that the great and true <hi>Salvo</hi> of all theſe inconveniences, and the main eſtablishment of the Throne, is only true judgement and Righteouſneſs, No ſober and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial perſon can condemn their poſition, who deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a Tyrannous Magiſtrat was the Miniſter of God to them for their Good, did plainly aſſert the lawfulneſs of Self-Defence, and holy Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the violation of the Ordinance of God.</p>

4. The Prophecies, Manner, &amp; Practiſe of the moſt part of the late bleſſed Reformations. And laſtly let the peculiar Right and Conſtution of this Kingdome by King and Parliament be conſidered and ſolidly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And then will wee alſo ſubſcribe to the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Reformers and crave pardon for this digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe grounds and principles did our Noble Anceſtours vigorouſly beſtir themſelves, and proceed in the Work of God. And as the Lord was ever with them while they were with Him, and did mind his work ſteadfaſtly in ſincerity and uprightneſs of heart; ſo notwithſtanding all the fals-hood and faintings which many diſcovered, yet the Lord himſelf did gloriouſly own it, and ceaſed not, until by the fair product of his own glory, in the clear manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his bleſſed Evangil, he had without the leaſt prejudice of the fundamental conſtitution and rights of Government, to the eternal confutation of all calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and reproaches, put on the Copeſtone with theſe joyous, and never to be forgotten acclamations of <hi>Grace, Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in the Year 1560. the Land is enlightned, the bleſſed Goſpel of our Lord again revealed and reſtored; in ſo much, that both by the firſt General Aſſembly of this Church then conveening, and the Parliament then holden, A large Confeſſion of the true Faith is framed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> approved and published.</p>
            <p>O! that men would remember, ſeriouſly conſider and fix in their hearts, the greatneſs and excellency of this Work of Grace and Glory, bringing Salvation, Peace and Goodwil towards men; And manifeſting the praiſe and Glory of God in the higheſt; that in the juſt eſtimation thereof, they might alſo duly and truly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64759:58"/>
ponder diſcern, approve or reject all things conducing, either to it's advantage or prejudice. But here is the root of all our ſinn and miſery, that though this Light, be only our Life; and the Salvation and Redemption thereby revealed, be no leſs then the project of God's eternall love, and the ſubject of His eternall delight; and was more dear and glorious to our Lord Jeſus, then the boſome of the Father, &amp; all the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet men, ſo greatly and highly therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, do at beſt but rejoyce therein for a ſeaſon, and ſoon relapſe, firſt into Indifferency and Formality, and then into Error, Superſtition and all Ignorance. This the Devil, the author of all wickneſs, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and improving to the uttermoſt, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Kingdom, doth quickly take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of, for ſetting on work and promoving of that Myſtery of iniquity. Which (ſpringing up in that bitter root of Pride, and working in the Spiritual power and ſubtilty thereof) as it began to work very early in the Chriſtian Church, even amongſt the Diſciples themſelves, in preſence of their and our Lord, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by their contention, <hi>who should be greateſt</hi>) And notwithſtanding all the Grace, Power, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, which appeared in the times that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, &amp; all the long &amp; violent perſecution, wherewith the Church of God was then exerciſed; yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it's motion, did ſtill advance, until attaining it's maturity in the revelation of the Man of Sin, it filled and overwhelmed the Chriſtian World, with theſe ſtrong deluſions of Superſtition, Idolatry, and all darkneſs that ſo long prevailed therein: So it is the main and only Engine whereby Sathan, as in all other Churches, ſo in this of Our's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath ſo actively beſtired himſelf, and attempted the overthrow of their later Reformations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64759:58"/>Theſe are the cauſes, why, notwithſtanding of that great and glorious Light which the Lord made to shine amongſt us, the true Government and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (though his own great Ordinance, inſtituted both for Fencing and ſecuring of Truth in Purity, and for promoving of the ſame in Power; and though by the Light of that ſame Truth, clearly diſcovered and Manifeſted) through long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and many difficulties, did ſcarce in theſe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es attain it's eſtablishment.</p>
            <p>Yet the Lord, who of his own free Mercy and Grace, did viſit us with the day-ſpring of his bleſſed Goſpel from on high; did alſo by his own Power and Preſence, in and with his faithful Servants, at length alſo compleat his work, and eſtablish his Kingdome over us and his Government amongſt us: And ſo the Kingdome became the Lord's; even the firſt fruits of the Kingdomes of the Earth, unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Progreſs and Period of this work, was from the Year 1560. unto the Year 1592. dureing which ſpace, theſe things are very obſervable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. So ſoon as this Church attained to freedome from perſecution and contrary violence, they Aſſembled in their firſt National Synod in the Year 1560. by vertue of that <hi>Intrinſick Power</hi> and Priviledg granted by our Lord unto his Church, and exerciſed by his Apoſtles and their followers; and that without any queſtion or control: Nor did they ſo much as petition for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the then Authority, though the ſame might have been more eaſily obtained, then the warrant at that time impetrated for conveening of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64759:59"/>2. As they firſt Aſſembled, and by vertue of the ſame warrant, did ſet on foot and continue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>ſeries</hi> of their Courts and meetings; (except in ſo far as by plain force and violence they were reſtrained) ſo they held the ſame in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt only, and in his ſole Authority, by Direction of his Word and Spirit, concluded all their Counſels, Votes and Acts. It's true, that they much and long wished for, and thereafter heartily accepted the countenance and concurrence of the Powers for the time; and that, not only for Decency, but alſo as the gracious performance of that promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. of the favour and aſſiſtance of Kings and Queens to the Church in the later dayes: But as they were perſuaded, that the Lord Jeſus (perfect in all his houſe) when inveſted at his exaltation with all Power in Heaven and in Earth, did make a full grant and Commiſſion of all Gifts and Offices requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit in his Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. (Wherein neither King nor Prince is mentioned) and that there was no Authority wanting to theſe firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees made at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> though emitted upon that ſimple warrant, <hi>Ast.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>It ſeemed good unto the Holy Ghoſt and unto us,</hi> (wherein neither King nor Prince was included,) ſo did they account it a groſs u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation, for the Kings on Earth, in place of their promiſed Patrociny (to which they are oblidged,) to claim and invade an Over-ruling Arbitriment in the matters of God and his Church; &amp; beleev that He who eſtablished the diſtinction and confirmed their Right, by ſeparating Caeſar's things from the things of God, doth alſo exact the ſame on their part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Brethren conveening in theſe Aſſemblies, did meet in perfect <hi>Parity and Equality</hi>; againſt which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64759:59"/>
the Extraordinary employments and Commiſſions delegated to ſome, upon the account of the particular exigence of theſe times, did grant no Priviledge or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence.</p>
            <p>From theſe three obſervations, without mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Book of Diſcipline, containing the true grounds and frame of Presbyterial Government, which was compiled in the Year 8560. and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the whole Church, and ſubſcribed to by a great many Lords and Counſellors, it is evident that <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Government was from the beginning of the Reformation conſtantly intended, and it's founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion really laid. We need not mention that the Pope's Authority and all Juriſdiction flowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, was by Law in the ſame Year 1560, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abrogated and diſcharged; nor that in theſe firſt Aſſemblies, greater Benefices were craved to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and Prelacy reputed to be only an <hi>Humane Device</hi>; nor is it neceſſary for us to clear, how that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary employment of <hi>Superintendency,</hi> uſed for a few Years in the beginning, was both only deſigned for an <hi>Interim,</hi> and in it ſelf wholly different from <hi>Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and was at length rejected as burthenſome. All theſe things are ſufficiently cleared by the late Large <hi>Apology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is obſervable, that as the Avarice and Power of ſome, who poſſeſſed and graſped after the Churches Revenues, did, by the procurement of a few packed Commiſſioners, in the Year 1671, introduce theſe Mock-Bishops (called <hi>Tulchan</hi>) for the better ſecuring of their own gain, which in the Aſſemblies immediatly ſucceeding, were firſt proteſted againſt, then quarrell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and laſtly reſtrained and ſubjected thereunto; So the Lord uſed the ſame as a warning, to awaken and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64759:60"/>
animat his Servants to a more vigorous proſecution of the eſtablishment of His Houſe in it's due Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In purſuance whereof, the Aſſemblies with the King's concurrence, from the Year 1575 until the Year 1581. did with much Prayer, Faſting and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs intend the work, until by perfecting of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of Diſcipline, and reducing of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops to a ſimple Dimiſſion, and condemning their Office as unwarrantable, they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpleated their work in the exact model of Presbyterial Government, in all it's Courts and Officers.</p>
            <p n="5">5. During this ſpace in March 1581. (as we now reckon) and after the Aſſembly had condemned the <hi>Office</hi> of Bishops as unwarrantable, the King, his Court and Council did ſwear and ſubſcribe to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Covenant; By which both the Pope's uſurped Authority over the Church in one Article, and his wicked <hi>Hierarchy</hi> in another, are abjured: And the ſwearers did join themſelves unto this true Reformed Church, in Doctrine, Faith, Religion and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; promiſing by the Great Name of the Lord our God, to continue in the Obedience of the Doctrine and Diſcipline thereof all the dayes of their lives. Which Diſcipline, as the foregoing Aſſertions do clearly diſcover, to have been from the beginning fundamentally <hi>Presbyterial</hi>; ſo the Model of <hi>Presbytery</hi> being now compleated, and any shaddow of power that the Mock-Bishops had lately uſurped, being now fully abrogated, it is ſufficiently clear, that both <hi>Prelacy</hi> is by this Covenant abjured, and <hi>Presbytery</hi> own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſworn to. And really if it be further conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Aſſemblies both 1581. and 1590, while moſt intent and forward in the erecting of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, did enjoyn and require the ſame to be ſubſcribed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64759:60"/>
by all ranks of People in the Land, and that theſe Acts were both ſeconded and enforced by Ordinances of King and Council, it may be juſtly doubted, whether the impudence of the ſucceeding Prelats in denying of the Obligation, or Perjury in breaking of it be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This is the Great Oath, into which, as the Lord God did bring us by the Power of his own Spirit and Truth, in oppoſition to that Bloody Bond, called the <hi>Holy League,</hi> wherein Antichriſt and his followers, had at that time conjured themſelves againſt the true Church of God; So the Kingdom thereby became the Lords, and we his peculiar people, as-well by the people's ſubjecting of themſelves and their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance, as by the King's ſubmitting Himſelf and his Scepter, in a due Subordination unto God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the maintenance and defence of his Church and Goſpell, the Liberties of the Land and Miniſtration of Juſtice. And this Oath and the Ordinances enjoyning it, notwithſtanding the many fearful violations thereof that have enſued, do yet ſtand to this day unrepealed and declared againſt, to the unanſwerable conviction and condemnation, even in their own Courts and Conſciences, of all it's wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As the <hi>Tulchan</hi> Bishops were the effect and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Avarice of theſe Lords that favoured them; So the ſame principle of Avarice and Wickedneſs did again reſiſt the Work of God, when almoſt brought to Perfection, by ſtirring up certain of the Nobles to re-induce Bishops, for the better inhaunſing of their Benefices, and the devouring of the Churches patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: And not only for their better eſtablishment, that what they want of Divine Right and Warrant, might be ſupplyed by the acceſſion of the Kings power
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64759:61"/>
and Command; but alſo that by their meanes, the growing wickedneſs of theſe times might abound without reſtraint or control, the Devil inciteth others of the more prophane, licentious and violent Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, ſuch as the Earle of <hi>Arran</hi> and his complices, to move and inſtigat the King, contrary both to the Word and Oath of God, to uſurp the Prerogative of Jeſus Chriſt, who is alone King in Zion, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade His Churches Priviledges, purchaſed for Her with His own Blood, by aſſuming to Himſelf in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>immediat Inſtance,</hi> the cognition of Her Doctrine and Cenſures: Which though the Church did conſtantly and valiantly oppoſe, both by Petitions and Proteſtations; yet this Wickedneſs did ſo impetouſly proceed, that all at once in a Parliament ſummarily called in the Year 1582. the Prerogative of Our Lord is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated upon the King, and his Juriſdiction and Empire exalted over all perſons and <hi>Cauſes,</hi> the Eſtate of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops &amp; their power and dignity confirmed, &amp; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the General Aſſemblies of the Church put in the King's hand. We mention not theſe things with any purpoſe to debate theſe queſtions, which have been moved on this Subject; Only we are confident, that how extenſive ſoever the King's power may be in the caſe of Reformation (which, Alas! for the moſt part cometh short of it's reach) yet where a Church is Regularly conſtituted, and ſo acting, and by Him ſworn to be maintained, no King or Prince ought ſo far to intrude Himſelf into Her Power and Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, unto which he is neither called nor gifted, as to aſſume to Himſelf a Soveraign &amp; immediat power of judging and diſcerning upon Doctrine, and her moſt ſpirituall Rights and Cenſures, and thereby in effect not only to conſtitut Himſelf a Proper and direct
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64759:61"/>
Church-Officer, without our Lords appointment; but in ſtead of Papacy ſo juſtly abrogated and ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abjured, to erect and revive the ſame in Himſelf (a Secular Perſon) far more abſurdly and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. We know that other formalities and notions are pretended, as theſe of Treaſon, Sedition, and Diſorder, to palliat and colour this Uſurpation; but ſeing nothing ſpoken or acted by warrant of the Word of God, can fall under the definition or pain of theſe crimes, and that all Miniſters and Eccleſiaſtick Courts are known, allowed and preſumed, both to ſpeak and act according to that only warrant, and Laſtly, ſeing both the warrant is to them committed, and the Church is priviledged and permitted to have it's own proper power and cognition thereanent, as it followeth by clear conſequence, that the things queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, muſt and ought to be <hi>firſt</hi> ſubjected to her tryal and cognition; ſo none do deny the Magiſtrat's juſt right and power, over both theſe things and perſons, they being once lawfully found to be deſtitut of the warrant pretended. But ſeing both Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth teſtify againſt this Uſurpation, as moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in it ſelf and injurious to our Lord Jeſus, and that all experiences have proven it to be moſt pernicious to His Church &amp; Kingdom, &amp; therefore many of his faithful Servants have worthily and valiantly reſiſted it, not only to bonds and banishment, but even to blood for the Teſtimony of their Lord &amp; Maſter; We return to the purpoſe of this obſervation, which is to vindicat the honour of the Lord's Work, and the memory of his faithful Servants, in the diſcovery of the old malice and ſubtilty of the great Enemy of the Church of God, working in the wicked Prelats &amp; their abettors; who to the effect they may enjoy their carnall deſignes, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64759:62"/>
proſecute their wicked luſts without controll, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour mainly by an abſolute ſurrender of all things, powers, perſons and intereſts, to flatter and exalt the King unto an illimited Soveraignty, and pretended Omnipotency, thereby both to oblidge and enable him the more to ſuch acts, deeds, and grants as are requiſite for the ſatiſfying of their vain Ambition, inſatiable Covetouſneſs and wicked luſts: Which Flattery and Uſurpation, being not more agreeable to the vain heart of man, then contrary to the Kingdom of our Lord, and the Power and Purity of His bleſſed Goſpel, what wonder if his faithful Servants (who can neither deny His Name, nor diſſobey His commands, by complying with the wicked practices, and the blaſphemous flattery of theſe vile Apoſtats) be not only hated of all men; but with their Lord and Maſter become the continual object of the reproaches, violence and cruelty of the wicked, as enemies and rebells to lawful Authority? Now that the World may perceav the wicked intent and deſign of this Prerogative, that it is none other then that of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (as to conciliat and endear the Powers to Prelats, who while they creat the King's Prerogative, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves to be the King's only Creatures; ſo to arm and animat the ſame Powers againſt our Lord and His followers.) Let it's Riſe and Effects both firſt and laſt be marked and obſerved, and the ſearch will declare, that wicked men luſting to Tyranny and licentiouſneſs, are checked and galled by the freedom and power of faithful Miniſters in the application of the Holy Word and Spiritual Cenſures. What reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? This freedom is found Treaſonable, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the King's ſervice and Intereſt, and the plain Zeall of God is therefore taxed as Sedition and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64759:62"/>
Treaſon; and under theſe formalities, the Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Church are infringed, and all the aſſerters thereof lashed with the ſame calumny: whereupon and to perfect the cure, the King muſt be declared IN ALL and OVER ALL; And by vertue of his fained Omnipotency, and for recovery of that Unity and Order, which only the coming of our Lord, His bleſſed Goſpel, and Powerful Miniſtry is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have diſturbed, the Ancient Policy or the Church muſt be reſtored; and the greateſt flatterers made the Archeſt Prelats, who by inhaunſing and by deſtroying the Power, may compeſce the (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) inſolency of the Miniſtry; and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual pretending of Diſſatiſfaction and Diſloyalty, may terrify men out of all Conſcience, until by the introducing of Will-worship and vain Superſtitions, they may extinguish all Light, and thereby reduce that Golden Age of Order into ſtupid Flattery, and of Unity into Implicit Obedience. And if theſe be not the kind careſſes, and moſt native iſſues of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> and <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and the very reſtoring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtablishing of the Kingdom of Antichriſt, he who cannot find it in this Period, will find all ſupplyed by the next.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Though we love not to reflect on Events, and know that no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before him, yet ſeing thereby the Lord's Judgments are made manifeſt, men ought both to obſerve and fear. The diſſaſtrous ends of all the promoters of Prelats in theſe dayes, (<hi>viz</hi>: of the Earle of <hi>Morton</hi> beheaded; <hi>Mr Iohn Douglaſs</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>St Andrews</hi> dying in the pulpit; the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Arran,</hi> after diſgrace, privately killed: <hi>Mr Patrick Adamſon</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>St Andrews,</hi> after recantation
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64759:63"/>
and diſgrace, dying in extream poverty) may juſtly cauſe their courſe the rather to be shunned and deteſted: But that which we love rather to obſerve, is, that as the promoters and advancers of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> were alwayes known to be men of no Principles, and for the moſt part of very flagitious practices; ſo the reſiſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and favourers of Presbytery, eſpecially the Lord's faithful Miniſters in theſe dayes, were not only very eminent in Knowledg, Piety and Holineſs, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all had that great Teſtimony and confirmation, which our Lord Himſelf maketh uſe of, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.18. that <hi>they ſought not their own glory, and therefore neither ſpoke nor did of themſelves, but ſought His Glory that ſent them, and therefore were true and no unrighteouſneſs was in them.</hi> As both their ſlighting of Court favours, by which they were much tempted, and their obſtinat refuſall of Bishopricks, (whereof King <hi>Iames</hi> himſelf bare them witneſs,) doth Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Lord, whoſe Work is perfect, and who when He beginneth will alſo make an end, hereafter in the Year 1586. shineth through the cloud, diſſipateth the darkneſs, and after the ſtorm bleſſeth us with a great calm; wherein, the Aſſemblies re-aſſuming their juſt power, and the matter by the King being brought to a treaty and Conference, the Bishops are firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, &amp; then Reduced. Thereafter the order of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries being ſet down &amp; perfected in the Year 1590. both the Nationall Covenant is renewed and ſubſcribed, by Order of the Secret Council at the Aſſemblies deſire; and all the power that remained either in Bishops or Commiſſioners, by the Aſſembly is devolved upon the new erected Presbyteries. And thus the Work of the Lord, in the <hi>Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>Iam.</hi> 6. bv the 114. <hi>Act.</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64759:63"/>
thereof, ratifying Presbyterial Government in all it's Aſſemblies, Courts and Officers, qualifying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricting the former <hi>Act.</hi> 1584. anent the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and abrogating all Acts contrary thereto or inconſiſtent therewith, and by other Acts there record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, receaveth it's laſt and full accomplishment with Power and Beauty, added to the former Grace and Glory.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That, as only the malice of Sathan and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of men, have in all Ages oppoſed the eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Presbytery; ſo the Lord, whoſe great Work and Ordinance it is, doth no leſs evidently commend it, by making, as on the one hand, it's ſincere and holy ſeverity powerfully to coerce and reſtrain all vice and profanity; ſo on the other hand, the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and orderly Subordination of it's Courts and Aſſemblies, moſt efficaciously to prevent and ſuppreſs all Schiſme and Hereſy: Which both the experience of theſe and all ſucceeding times do moſt clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
            <p>But though the Lord had shewed us all theſe great and manifold temptations and troubles, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated them all in ſuch an wonderful and bleſſed deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that we might for ever fear His great Name, love His precious Truth, and keep His holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and though in the short Sun-shine of that day of Salvation, He cauſed both King and People to taſte and ſee the Order, Beauty and Power of that Eſtablishment; Yet, O! how ſoon did we forget the Works of the Lord?

It is enough for us, (let the true Hiſtories of theſe proceedings be examined, and it will appear without the help of our obſevation,) that, as the beginnings of that Defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were no other then the Unfaithfulneſs of Man, and the inconſiſtence of the Wiſdom of God with the carnal wiſdom of this World, and that old oppoſition and rooted prejudice of the Kings and Powers of the Earth, who have for the far greateſt part ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and taken counſel againſt the Lord and againſt His Anointed; ſo for the unqueſtionable confirmation of all that hath been ſaid, either as to the wicked Riſe or woful Effects of Prelacy in this Church, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's part therein was viſibly to promote his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by re-acting the moſt palpable and groſs Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Iniquity that can poſſibly be deſcribed: In ſo far as this Apoſtacy ariſing from ſmall beginnings, by fair and ſmooth pretenſions, crafty inſinuations, Court-flatteries, falſe calumnies and ſuggeſtions, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and groſs perjuries, and violent diſſorders, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working of Sathan; After great and long oppoſition by Conferences, Warnings &amp; petitions, &amp; faithful and conſtant Teſtimonies and ſufferings of the Zealous Witneſſes of our Lord, both unto bonds, banishment, &amp; Sentences of Death, againſt the again

should be lawfully determined, and that other of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Defence and Aſſiſtance, in the proſecution of the ends of that Covenant, againſt all ſorts of perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And in <hi>November</hi> the ſame Year, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> determined anent the foreſaid novations and corruptions, diſproving and rejecting under theſe heads, the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church by Bishops, the erecting of Prelacy therein, and all the Corruptions flowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, whereby the Oath of the Covenant is clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and purifyed.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1639. the Prelats being routed, run to Court, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Aſſembly ſitting in <hi>August</hi> thereafter, the Kings Commiſſioner being preſent and aſſenting, doth ratify the concluſions of the laſt Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and the Commiſſioner and Secret Council ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Covenant, as it was then explained; and at the Petition of the Aſſembly, it is enacted to be again ſubſcribed for the Fifth time, by the Body of the whole Land. But no Faith, Honeſty, nor Honor binding the Prelats and a Court by them over-ruled; in the Year 1640. the King and Prelats vigorouſly arm again, and prepare for a new war: But this intended War is compoſed by a new Pacification, and in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64759:66"/>
mean time, the Parliament (formerly adjourned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Iune</hi> 1640) doth conveen at the time appointed, and by their <hi>fourth, fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth Acts</hi> fully eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish Presbyterial Government; ratify the Covenant, with the Addition and Explanation of the Aſſembly, and all Acts made thereanent; &amp; abrogat the Eſtate of Bishops, and all Acts whatſoever made in their favours.</p>
            <p>Thereafter, in the Treaty enſuing the Pacification, it is agreed that the Acts paſt in the laſt Parliament, with theſe to be made in the next Seſſion thereof, shall be published in the King's Name, and have the ſtrength of Laws in all time coming: Which Treaty being cloſed, and the laſt Seſſion of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Parliament ſitting in the Moneth of <hi>Iune</hi> 1641. the King in perſon being preſent among them, and the Oath of Parliament (for maintenance of Religion in purity as then eſtablished, and of the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Peoples Liberties according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and for endeavouring by all juſt and humble meanes, of Union and Peace betwixt the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes) appointed to be taken by that, &amp; all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliaments, being taken; by the ſecond Act thereof, ſuperſcribed by the King and ſubſcribed by the Preſident, the foreſaid Treaty is amply and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually confirmed, and the whole Articles thereof are ratifyed and recorded.</p>
            <p>Thus, by all the Security, that either Sacred Oaths; or Acts of Lawful &amp; Authorized Aſſemblies; Ordinanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of King and Council; doubled and re-iterated Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and Treaties; Acts of Parliament Enacted &amp; Re-enacted; the Kings Authority and Conſent being often and ſolemnly interpoſed, both by promiſe and hand-writ; And all that either Religion, Truth,

            <p>By all which Bleſſings, and the reſtoring of the Lord's own Ordinances amongſt us, as the Work of the Goſpel and the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus, in the Converſion of many thouſands, were greatly advanced, and the Glory of God, in the abounding of true Piety and flourishing of Righteouſneſs, did eminently shine amongſt us; (as the memory of theſe times in all ſuch as fear God and love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth ſweetly teſtify) ſo all theſe great things were tranſacted, to the perpetual shame and confuſion of all our calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Adverſaries, without any diminution of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's juſt Authority and Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>As the Power and Glory of the Lord was great in this Land; ſo the ſplendor and fame thereof reaching unto other Nations, it pleaſed the Lord thereby to provoke His People in <hi>England,</hi> at that time grievouſly groaning under the Tyrannous yoke of Prelacy, and juſtly alarmed by the imminent fears of prevailing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, to ſet about and intend the like bleſſed Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>It doth not concern us, to reflect on the Cauſes and beginnings of that War betwixt the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament there, nor what were the tranſactions betwixt the two Kingdoms in order to that Aid and Aſſiſtance given by <hi>Scotland,</hi> and how the ſame was mannaged: But this is certain, that, upon the Repreſentation of

the moſt juſt and important grounds, of the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Religion and Liberty, againſt the prevailing power of Popery, Prelacy and Tyranny in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi>; and their moſt inſtant and earneſt deſires for our help and Aſſiſtance; and rhe moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional &amp; clear motives of our own Security, (the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and loſs whereof had undoubtedly been the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Prelats Victory there) this Kingdom was induced in the Year 1643. to enter into that Sacred Bond of <hi>the Solemne League and Covenant,</hi> never to be forgotten, containing no other Articles then every one's <hi>Sincere and conſtant endeavours, in their ſeveral places &amp; callings, for the preſervation of the Reformed Religion in this Church, in Doctrine, VVorship, Diſcipline and Government; the Reformation of the ſame in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland, according to the VVord of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches; and the neareſt Conjunction and Vniformity of all the three in Truth, Faith, and Love; the extirpation of Popery, Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Error and Profanity; the preſervation of the rights and Liberties of the People, and of the Kings perſon and Authority in defence of the true Religion, and the Kingdom's Liberties; the Diſcovery and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Incendiaries; the retaining of the Peace and Vnion of the Kingdomes; the mutual aſsiſtance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of all entering into this League; and the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all duties we owe to God, in the amendment of our lives, and in walking exemplarly one before another</hi>: And all theſe in order to no other end, then <hi>the Glory of God, the advancement of the Kingdom of

Ieſus Chriſt; the Honor and Happineſs of the King and his Poſterity; and the true Liberty, Safety and Peace of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that Covenant, which in all the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies it hath occaſioned, did never receave a greater confirmation, then from the malice and oppoſition of it's adverſaries; who in the ſame Spirit &amp; with the ſame Spite, have alwayes perſecuted and reproached it, with the ſame Calumnies of Rebellion, Sedition and Blood, which from the beginning, the Devill hath ever been moſt active to raiſe and ſtir up againſt the Lord Jeſus, his Goſpel, Kingdom and Followers. But ſeing ſuch only as are bleſſed, do evite the offence of Truth; and all who truely ſeek Gods Glory or Love the Lord Jeſus, did and ſtill do heartily approve and embrace this Covenant: though it had brought the Sword not only into <hi>Britain,</hi> but with the Truth into all the Earth; though it were reproached as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend not only to our King, but with our Lord Jeſus to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and all the Kings of the Earth; though it had divided and diſturbed not only Realms and States, but with the Goſpel, families and neareſt relations; and had with Paul moved Sedition throughout the whole World, we ought not thereby to be either shaken or offended. We know alſo, that all the ſubtilty and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Hell have been ſet on work, and ſpared no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny or cavillation, by which either it's Words, Matter or Manner might be impugned: But theſe are ſo often and fully anſwered, and, without the aſſiſtance of any man's Patrociny, by the obvious plainneſs of it's Phraſe, the Holineſs &amp; Importance of it's Purpoſe, and the Juſtice and Neceſſity of it's way and Manner, ſo clearly confuted, that nothing can be added. Only
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64759:68"/>
ſeing the Conſtancy of Truth, ought not to cede to the Confidence of prevailing Powers, as we have aſſerted and do hold, the ſubject matter of this League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be in it ſelf Holy, Juſt and True; ſo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but diſprove the dangerous Method of ſome, who the better to enforce the obligation of the Oath of God, do ſuppoſe the Matter thereof, eſpecially as to that article againſt Prelacy, to be antecedently Indifferent, and not determined either by the Word of God or any other Moral Precept: Juſtly apprehending how eaſily in this light and backſliding time, ſuch ſuppoſitions may become poſitions; and that the obligation of the Oath of God, now ſo much violated and little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may be found too weak to ſecure mens ſtedfaſtneſs. As we are therefore perſuaded, and would have all to conſider and fix it in their hearts, that this wicked Prelacy and it's Hierarchy, are not only contrary to the Word of God, to the Practice of the Holy Apoſtles, to ſound Doctrine and the Power of Godlineſs; (under which expreſs conſideration we are alſo ſworn to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it's extirpation,) but by the ſad experience of all Ages in the Chriſtian Church, eſpecially in theſe our later times, had been found moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to all Truth and Righteouſneſs, and the main Engine and Device, whereby the Devil hath alwayes laboured, to advance his Kingdom of Darkneſs; and therefore hath been the great butt and aime, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow whereof, the great Work of God in this Land, hath been ſo Powerfully and Gloriouſly manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo do we moſt conſtantly hold, that as wel this Article againſt Prelacy, as all the reſt contained in this Holy Covenant, were and are antecedently oblidging both to King and People, without the ſupervention of either Oath or Promiſe; and that the rooting out of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64759:69"/>
Prelacy, &amp; the wicked Hierarchy therein ſo obviouſly deſcribed, is the main duty, in the endeavour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (as moſt advantageous unto all theſe great and holy Ends propoſed by the Covenant) all the Zeal of the faithful ought to be concentred.</p>
            <p>As for ſuch profane Jugglers, who neither conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Oath and Covenant as a ſpecial Ordinance and bleſſing of God, whereby we are more effectually ſtirred up and enabled, to the performance of all the duties of Religion and Righteouſneſs therein contained; nor knowing that this Covenant made with God, and accepted by Him, is alſo the Lords Covenant with us, for the ſecuring and eſtablishing unto us, all the great Bleſſings and Priviledges therein expreſſed, &amp; that, as we therein do avouch the Lord to be our God, ſo doth He avouch us to be His People, Do from the Righteouſneſs and Neceſſity of it's matter, vainly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the ſuperfluity of any acceſſory Obligation, and would thence infer, that the ſame may be the more eaſily diſpenſed with or renounced: We de only remit them to that Solemn Covenant <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made there betwixt the Lord and His People, and thereafter ſo often renewed, only for their greater Engagement to the moſt neceſſary duties of God's expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>We come in the next place, unto the Manner and Form of this League and Covenant; wherein, not purpoſing to reſume the many debates that have been raiſed anent it, we shall only take notice, that theſe old Acts and Laws <hi>viz. Act.</hi> 43. <hi>Parl.</hi> 6. of <hi>Mary</hi> 1555. <hi>and Act.</hi> 12. <hi>Parl.</hi> 10. <hi>Iam.</hi> 6.1585. made againſt Leagues and Bands contracted without the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, are now obtruded with the force and luſtre of a new Act. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. of the laſt <hi>Parliament,</hi> to condemn the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64759:69"/>
Covenant, as from the beginning Unlawfull and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious: But as theſe old Acts, at the time of the entering into this League and Covenant, did then ſtand explained by the 29. <hi>Act. Parl.</hi> 2. <hi>Charl.</hi> 1. ratifyed and authorized by the King himſelf, in a ſenſe moſt conſiſtent with the Covenant, and could no wayes render the ſame from the beginning unlawful, much leſs could the revival thereof in their greateſt rigour, or the ſuperveniency of any other Act thereanent, diſſolve the Sacred Obligation of this Oath once lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; ſo the reaſon of the former anſwer made ro this objection, and the Juſtice and Equity of that <hi>Act.</hi> 29. P. 2. <hi>C.</hi> 1. whereby the ſame was declared, remaineth in ful force, <hi>viz. that no League nor Bond made by the Subjects for maintenance of Religion, Liberty, and the Publick good of Church or State, was or can be underſtood, to be prohibited by theſe old Acts and Laws objected.</hi> Becauſe, as the makers of ſuch Bonds, cannot be reputed to be movers of Sedition, to the breach of the publick peace, (which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs reaſon and certification of theſe old Acts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected) ſo both the King and his Government, being appointed for the preſervation of theſe great ends and Intereſts, and He himſelf principally oblidged, both by the Command and Oath of God upon him, to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize all ſuch bonds. Covenants, and other means which may advance the ſame; It were a groſs Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox both in Reaſon and Religion, that the King's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of his duty and perverting of his Office, to the overthrow of theſe ends for which he is ordained, should therefore oblige the People to a ſinful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance and ſtupid connivance, to the high Dishonour of the Great God and King of Kings, and the utter
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64759:70"/>
ruine of the ſouls, bodies, and fortuns of themſelves and their Poſterity. It's true, it may be and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that this anſwer and reaſoning, doth proceed from an unjuſt jealouſy of Kings, and is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an intollerable preſumption in the Subject to cenſure and judge their actings: But ſeeing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into this Covenant, and into all others which we allow, was ſo far from proceeding upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt jealouſy, that on the contrary, it was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner extorted, by the force of the moſt palpable and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional neceſſity that can be imagined; and ſeeing the feeling and diſcerning thereof, is ſo far from that cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal preſumption alleadged, that to diſprove it, is in effect to deny both ſenſe and reaſon, unleſs our adverſaries can prove that notwithſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the King is by God the Lord, veſted with ſuch an uncontrollable Dominion and Soveraignty, that whatever Violence, Outrage, or Cruelty he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, the People are obliged by a patience, or rather ſtupidity greater then that of Beaſts, to endure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gain ſaying, it is impoſſible for them to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Tyranny that they contend for. But that the World may ſee, that ſuch objections are only the wicked flattery of ſelfish men, and how little they do therein either uſe or regard Reaſon, in the late Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned made againſt Leagues and Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is declared, that the explication contained in the <hi>Act</hi> 1640. <hi>viz. That ſuch Leagues and Conventions as are made by Subjects, for the preſervation of the King, Religion and the Laws, are not prohibited by theſe old Acts,</hi> is falſe and diſloyall, and contrary to the true and genuine meaning thereof: which Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not only a naked Aſſertion, and contrary to the expreſs reaſon and certification of theſe old Acts,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64759:70"/>
which is before ſett down; but ſo blind and irrational, that in caſe of an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> or the incapacity of the King to give His conſent to any Bond, Meeting or Convention, which in ſuch a caſe may be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it leaves no iſſue or expedient.</p>
            <p>It is not needful here to clear the neceſſity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which may induce Subjects to the making of Leagues and Conventions in certain caſes, without the conſent of the Prince; nor the exigence of theſe Times for the Covenant we plead for: Theſe things are cleared by undenyable Records, which, all the Wars, Blood and Confuſions that thereafter enſued, (flowing either from the perverſe and obſtinate oppoſition, violence, and Perſecution of the enemies of Truth, or being the effect of Gods Righteous Judgement upon ſuch whoſe hearts were falſe, and proved unſtedfaſt in His Covenant,) notwithſtanding all the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting of the Adverſaries, doth nothing diſprove. Neither do we here reſume the above mentioned prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of our firſt Reformers, for juſtifying the caſe in hand, and the explication of theſe old Acts here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded; who, by all their neceſſary Leagues, Bands and Conventions, never conceaved the ſame to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traveened: Only we cannot but regret, that, as the Act made in the laſt <hi>Parliament</hi> againſt Conventions and Bonds, was a fearful ſtep of the preſent great Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and directly levelled againſt the ſame Covenant, by which the Authors of the Acts themſelves were and are indiſſolubly obliged; ſo that old Act <hi>Parliament</hi> 10. Ja. 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. 1585. which is thereby ratifyed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, was alſo one of the woful Acts and effects of the wickedneſs that then prevailed in the Land, and doth relate to and is expreſly founded upon the 43. <hi>Act. Queen Mary, Parliament</hi> 6. 1555. which, under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

of diſcharging Bonds of Man-rent, was by the Queen Regent, then raging in Perſecution againſt the Profeſſors of the Truth, directly intended for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Goſpel and Congregation.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto only juſtifyed the lawfulneſs, or rather the neceſſity of the Covenant; as a <hi>League</hi> amongſt <hi>Subjects</hi> without the Princes conſent, and have not ſpoken thereto as a League with <hi>England,</hi> and the Subjects of an other Kingdom: Becauſe, as the firſt point is mainly denied by the Adverſary; ſo the ſame being proven, upon in the ſame grounds (firſt, of Juſt &amp; Neceſſary Defence of our Selves, Religion and Libertyes; <hi>Secondly,</hi> of the aſſiſtance that we owe and do expect in caſe of Perſecution for Truth, from all Chriſtians in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his new and ſpeciall command of Love, and the remembrance of that great and laſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein by this Law, all men shall be judged, without reſpect to the difference of Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and <hi>thirdly,</hi> upon the ground of the Glory of God, which is the great end of all things, and to which all inferiour duties of Submiſſion and Obedience ought to cede) the Juſtice and Neceſſity of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and League with <hi>England</hi> may be certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. O! that men, who weighing all things in the ballance of their own ſelfish Intereſts and deſignes, do make the vain &amp; airy enjoyment of Court-favour, and the evanishing poſſeſſion of ſuch advantages, as may be acquired thereby, preponderate and caſt the ſcales, in prejudice of theſe great and important concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Glory of God, and the advancement of the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus, Might yet be awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the terror of that dreadful and glorious Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laſt day, to an impartial conſideration
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64759:71"/>
of that duty, which we owe to all theſe that ſuffer and are perſecuted for Truth. Surely if not viſiting, not relieving and ſupporting (when it is in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,) of the afflicted members of Jeſus Chriſt, shall then be the condemnation of the Reprobat, (againſt which the exception of a contrary command of any King or Prince, or that the afflicted were by men for Truths ſake declared Rebells and Traitors, or were of an other Kingdome, shall furnish no defence) Can we in conſcience think, that the refuſal of Aſſiſtance to the perſecuted for Chriſt's ſake, when inſtantly thereto required, shall be, upon any of theſe pretended grounds, excuſed in that day?</p>
            <p>We do not here mention the ſupervenient conſent and Authority of the King, by which the alleaged defects, to the acknowledgement of all our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were clearly purged: becauſe (though the ſame will afterwards fall in, as a great acceſſion to the conviction of all Apoſtats, yet) we bleſs the Lord who hath bottomed our Faith and Conſciences upon more ſure and fixed foundations; and who gave His People more evident and gracious teſtimonies of His Favour, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Preſence, while they ſincerely walked conform to the grounds mentioned, before the King's aſſent was obtained, then ever ſince.</p>
            <p>The entering into and taking of this Covenant, was ſo much the more neceſſary and Praiſe-worthy in us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for ſeveral reaſons, 1. becauſe it contains no other then the ſame Duties and obligations, which were before by us ſo ſolemnly Covenanted to, in our Nationall Covenant: neither is the reſtriction of our Alleageance, ſuppoſed to be made therein, any other then the true and righteous qualification of all ſuch engagements, moſt conſonant unto and approven

by our firſt Large Confeſſion of Faith <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. Anent the Civil Magiſtrate; the Kings Coronation-Oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. and the Nationall Covenant, as it was taken and ſubſcribed both firſt and laſt: And though our Adverſaries have inſulted upon the later Confeſſion of Faith, as if both our former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practiſes were thereby diſproved; yet let the words be conſidered. Viz. <hi>Infidelity or difference in Religion doth not make void the Magiſtrat's Iuſt and Legal Authority, nor free the People from due obedience,</hi> And we are confident, that no ſober man will think the acknowledgement of juſt and legal Authority and due obedience, a rational ground, to infer that Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny over either Conſciences or Perſons, is thereby either allowed or priviledged; which is all that by us is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the ſame National Covenant did power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oblige us thereunto: not only upon the account of that obſtinate oppoſition, which the perfidious Prelats in <hi>England,</hi> both by raiſing Wars and breach of Pacification, had plainly teſtifyed; the revival whereof, in caſe of any probable Capacity, we had juſt reaſon to apprehend, and by a poſterior League, (at that time, a moſt neceſſary and probable remedy,) in purſuance of our former engagement, to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; but alſo in reſpect of that expreſs ground of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the bloody bond of <hi>Trent,</hi> and of the deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all the enemies of Gods Church, who thereby conjured themſelves againſt it, contained in the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant: which could not but be a very fair perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſtrong inductive, to engage in that ſacred Bond of the ſolemn League &amp; Covenant, againſt that ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed conjuratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which at that time appeared ſo active</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Oath of Parliament, firſt taken in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64759:72"/>
the Parliament 1641. the King being preſent, obliging us to endeavour <hi>the preſervation of the Peace and Vnion of the three Kingdoms,</hi> did indiſpenſibly oblige us to enter in this Covenant, as a moſt neceſſary expedient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſummarily reviewed, both the Matter and Manner of this Solemn and important League and Covenant, we cannot but wonder at the poor Sophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of ſuch, (eſpecially that more Temporizing then <hi>Seaſonable</hi> Caſuiſt,) who delude themſelves in ſo great matters unto ſuch an Indifferency, as to aſſert, that this Covenant doth as neceſſarily depend upon the King's conſent for it's eſtablishment, as the private vow of a Daughter in her Father's houſe, or of an Wife under her Husband's power, in things free and arbitrary, though not abſolutely in their own diſpoſal, did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Judicial Law of the Jewes, fall under the Father and Husband's power of ratifying or annulling: But the ſimple propoſal of theſe caſes, doth hold out ſuch a diſparity both as to the Perſons, (being only wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under power,) the Things in themſelves, being free, but at another's diſpoſal, and many other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances tedious to inſiſt on, and even as to Law it ſelf by which the caſe is determined, being meerly Judicial, that none who fear the Lord, or mind His Glory in any meaſure of Sobriety, will daigne it with an anſwer. And ſuch indeed are the reſt of the Cavils and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherewith the Adverſaries of Truth have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to impugn and aſperſe this Holy Covenant; and are ſo fully and often anſwered already, that to account them worthy the reſuming and refuting, were in ſome ſort after Vowes to make inquiry.</p>
            <p>There is one thing that our Adverſaries have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently objected, which we cannot ommit, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64759:73"/>
the Covenants, both National and Solemn League were urged and preſſed, both by Church Cenſures and Civill Sanctions, of loſs of goods, ſequeſtration and other arbitrary pains, which hath been heavily complained of, as a great violence done to Conſcience: But as it was then too evident,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this Priviledge of Conſcience, was for the moſt part only pretended by ſuch, as had litle or no feeling thereof; ſo the Practice of the preſent times, doth now fully diſcover, that what is now ſo inſolently retorted, was never before really ſcrupled at. But the lawfullneſs of the courſe and practice then uſed, and the iniquity of this retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will eaſily be cleared, if it be conſidered, 1. that the Nationall Covenant, being a ſtanding, &amp; binding Oath upon the whole Land, and in the Year 1638. only renewed with ſuch an agreeable explanation, as none could or did quarrel, but ſuch as thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to palliate and perſiſt in their proceeding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt violations, was according to the example of good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> (who brought back the People, and CAUSED <hi>them ſtand to the Covenant of their Fathers,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.32.) moſt juſtly commanded, and under the pains due to the breach therof, ordained to be re-taken. 2. That the ſolemn League and Covenant, containing no other obligements, then what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional doth import, and being a moſt conducible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, both for the ſecuring and proſecuting the ends thereof, and whereunto, the National Covenant upon this ground did clearly oblige, The preſſing of the ſame League, is warranted not only by the former ground; but from the very bond of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, became an indiſpenſible Duty: By which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as the former proceedings are clearly juſtifyed, ſo the preſent practice, (as being a direct and violent
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64759:73"/>
ranverſing of theſe things, which were once ſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and rationally eſtablished) is the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. But whatever be the diſparity of theſe caſes in the point of Reaſon, we are ſure that light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do not more differ, then the Lenity of theſe former times, from the Rigour and violence now practized; &amp; that where one then ſuffered for obſtinacy againſt the Covenant, hundreths do now ſuffer for their ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therein.</p>
            <p>As for theſe Wars and great commotions, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued upon this great Tranſaction of the Solemn League, we will not thereon inſiſt: Only we are confident, that nothwitſtanding all the Calumnious conſtructions of our Adverſaries, al ſuch as ſeek out and have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Works of the Lord, will applaud unto the Glory and Righteouſneſs thereof; who, as by the ſword of Apoſtats in the Years 1644, and 1645. He did punish in his Juſtice, the Hypocriſy and Self-ſeeking of ſuch in this Land, whoſe hearts were not upright in His Covenant, and thereafter in the Year 1648. did by a prevailing Sectarian Party, reſtrain and crush the groſs and Generall Apoſtaſy then intended, under an Hypocritical pretext of purſuing the ends of the Covenant, at that time ſo palpably perverted and abuſed; ſo, for the manifeſtation of his own Glory, and of His Mercy to them that fear him and did not forget his Covenant, He did intermix ſeveral gracious Intervals of His aboundant Compaſſion; and at length did give unto His Work and People, a full and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Victory over that malignant Spirit and Party, that had ſo long prevailed in the Land, and cauſed the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the wicked to ceaſe, and all iniquity to ſtop it's mouth.</p>
            <p>Thus in the Years 1649, and 1650. &amp; thereafter, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64759:74"/>
Lord was with us while we were with Him, and while we ſought Him, He was found of us; but as we did forſake Him, ſo did He alſo forſake us: by which poſition, all the mixture and varieties, both of our Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Gods Providences in theſe times, may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be reſolved.</p>
            <p>There was indeed at that time in the Land, not only a party Faithful unto God, and zealous for His Name; but alſo a great Zeal of God, from clear knowledge and ſad experience, generally and ſolemnly profeſſed before God and all men in our Publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement <hi>Anno</hi> 1649: In conſequence whereof, the League and Covenant was alſo by the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom renewed that ſame Year. And in answer thereunto, the Lord did mightily both ſave and defend us from all our Adverſaries: and as He ſoon ſubdued our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at <hi>Stirling,</hi> and turned His Hand againſt our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries in the <hi>North,</hi> and cauſed the haters of the Lord faign ſubmiſſion unto Him; ſo, for His own Glory, the eſtablishment of His People, and the utter confuſion of His Adverſaries, He did highly advance His bleſſed Work, by the acceſſion of all theſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, with the Defect whereof, it had been formerly calumniated.</p>
            <p>The Advantages we here mention are (beſides that Publick Acknowledgement then made, and in the deep ſenſe thereof, the League and Covenant ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again renewed and taken, whereby our Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not only doubled, but ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed) 1. Theſe many neceſſary and righteous Lawes enacted in the then Parliaments, both for the ratifying the later large Confeſſion of faith, and the larger and shorther Catechiſms, agreed unto by both Kingdoms, and for the reſtraining and coercing of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64759:74"/>
and Blaſphemy, the encouragement of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and for the promoving of Godlineſs. Amongſt which Acts, that abolishing <hi>Patronages,</hi> deſerveth a more ſpecial and commendable remembrance: Not only becauſe of the many woful Effects &amp; Abuſes of Patronage, as it then was (&amp; now is) exerciſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by frequently, Godly men and in ſome meaſure quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the Work of the Miniſtry were (&amp; are) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly reſtrained from labouring therein; Many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations needleſly continued deſolate, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed Miniſtry; Many Naughty men and utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, at the ſole arbitrement of Patrons, violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtruded upon the People, without and againſt their own conſent; Presbyteries conſtrained (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Rule of the Holy Scriptures) to ordaine men, whom the People neither choiſed, nor could cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receave; Foundations of prejudice &amp; ſtrife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Paſtor and People laid, whereby the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preach nor the other hear with profit; Symoniacal Pactions often baſely made betwixt Patrons &amp; the perſon preſented, to the diſgrace of the Holy Calling as-wel as to the ſin and shame of the Perſons; And the Miniſtry of too many, in diſpencing of Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments &amp; Cenſures, made to depend too much upon the Will and pleaſure of Man: But alſo becauſe, it hath no Precept in the Word of God, nor Example in the old Jewish, nor new primitive and pure Chriſtian Church, to warrant it; becauſe, Intentionally and Natively it ſpoileth the People of that Right and Priviledge, in Electing their own Paſtors, which Scripture and Reaſon alloweth; And becauſe, being the Patron's (pretended) Heritage, and therefore, by him vendible to whom he pleaſeth, the whole and ſole Power of Preſenting of Miniſters, Planting of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64759:75"/>
Churches, Preaching of the Goſpel, &amp; ſettling Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, may be turned over unto, &amp; put in the hands of men, not only Profa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e &amp; Strangers to both Church &amp; Common-wealth, but alſo pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed Enemies of the Truth, yea, even Papiſts or Pagans. And therefore, (being in itſelf a grievous and unwarrantable Burthen; deſtructive of the Church and Peoples Liberties; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the free courſe of the Goſpel; the Freedom, Power &amp; Plainneſs of the Miniſtry; and occaſional of much baſe Flattery &amp; Partiality, under which, from the very times of Superſtition which introduced it, the Church did heavily groan) it muſt needs be ſo much the greater Bleſſing to be delivered from it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Advantage which the Lord's work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, was by that great and long Tranſaction with the King in order to His return, and Admiſſion to the Government; which at length, after repeated Addreſſes, many Treaties, and the interpoſing of Forraign States and Princes, produced the King's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and Allowance of the Nationall and Solemn League and Covenant: Which both by his great Oath unto the Moſt High God, and his hand-writ and Subſcription, he moſt amply aſſured, promiſing in the ſame manner to advance &amp; proſecute their Ends, and to ſeek and procure the eſtablishment thereof, and of Presbyterial Government, and of the whole work of God in all his Dominions. We know our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, perſiſting in their old malice, diſown and exclaim upon this Tranſaction as moſt diſloyal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, for Subjects (whoſe part is only to ſurrender &amp; ſubmit,) to require and enter into Treaties with their Prince: But 1. as theſe reproaches are from the ſame wicked Spirit, falſe grounds, and baſe and carnall ends, which from the very times of popery, have reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64759:75"/>
and been objected againſt the Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Land; ſo do wee thereto oppoſe, (in full aſſurance before God and all the World,) theſe ſolid and evident reaſons and warrants, whereby not only theſe Treaties and Tranſactions with the late King, but all theſe old Contracts and Agreements betwixt the then Powers and People, (which in ſome ſort, are the very foundation of the Proteſtant Religion in this Realm) are juſtifyed and approven: wherein if there be any diſparity, the difference of a King upon His Throne actually Exercing, from a Prince only aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, muſt caſt the advantage on our ſide. 2. Seing there is no Voluntary Kingdom, which is not both erected, ſuſtained, and continued by a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Contract, and no Right thereto ſo good (though even that of <hi>Divid</hi> himſelf and His Poſterity, who held the Kingdom, both by inmediate grant, and interpoſed Oath of the Moſt High,) which is not ſetled and confirmed by this agreement, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.3. 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 11.17. can any rationall man diſprove or condemn <hi>Treaties</hi> ſo naturally antecedent and previous thereto. 3. The reaſon and neceſſity of this Treaty is ſo dependent upon the preceeding War with the laſt King, in which (as-well as in his Kingdomes) this King did ſucceed him, that, ſeing it can have no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, but ſuch as therein were enemies, we willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer hoth the caſes to the determinations of the ſame reaſons. And as for ſuch who aſſerting the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Juſtice of the long Parliaments War, do nevertheleſs diſprove our procedure in this Treaty, as their mis-information doth not prejudge the Truth; ſo neither are we anſwerable for their inconſequence.</p>
            <p>The third Advantage which the Lord gave His Work, was by what the King did after his arrival in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64759:76"/>
               <hi>Scotland,</hi> both before and at his Coronation, for the greater confirmation of the Covenant and Work of God, and the more ſtrong engaging of himſelf and this whole Land unto the Lord. Before his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he emitteth that Declaration at <hi>Dumfermling</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known by this deſignation, wherein <hi>Profeſsing, and appearing in the full perſuaſion and love of the Truth, he repenteth (as having to do with &amp; in the ſight of God) His Fathers oppoſition to the Covenant and VVork, of God, and his own reluctancies againſt the ſame, hoping for mercy through the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and obteſting the Prayers of the faithful to God, for his ſtedfastneſs: and then proteſteth his truth and ſincerity in entering into the Oath of God, reſolving to proſecute the ends of the Covenant to his utmost, and to have with it the ſame common friends and enemies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting all to lay down their enmity against the Cauſe of God, and not to prefer Man's Intereſt to God's, which will prove an Idole of Iealouſy to provoke the Lord, and he himſelf accounteth to be but ſelfiſh flattery,</hi> &amp; ſo-forth proceedeth in the moſt cordial, ſincere &amp; aſſuring terms, to teſtify his love and zealous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for God, his People and Covenant, and on the other hand his great diſlike and deteſtation of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, courſes and Intereſts contrary thereto. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, ſo full of heart-profeſſions, and high atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the Great God, that none ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the preſent times, can reflect thereon without horror and trembling from the Holy Jealouſy of the Lord, either for the then deep Diſſimulation, or the preſent unparalelled Apoſtacy. However ſeeing the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64759:76"/>
ſame is ſo aſſertive, that no words could adde to it's aſſurance, nor no argument leſs then the preſent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, render it to any neutral perſon ſuſpect of the leaſt diſſimulation; ſure we are, that the generality of the Kingdom, did thereby obtain all the warrant of the King's moſt full and clear aſſent to, and allowance of the Covenant, that either Law or Reaſon could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Thereafter at his Coronation, how the King did again confirm the Covenant, and both He and his People thereby again engage themſelves unto the Lord, the order thereof printed and published to the World doth fully declare. In which, theſe paſſages are very obſervable. 1. That the King is deſired in Name of the People, jointly to <hi>accept the Crown and maintain Religion</hi> ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL &amp; SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEMN LEAGUE &amp; COVENANT, to which he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his cordial aſſent, <hi>wiſhing no longer to live, then he might ſee Religion &amp; this Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flourish in all happineſs.</hi> 2. After a Sermon moſt pertinently, plainly and powerfully preached upon that 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 12, <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. (wherein amongſt other things, the binding power &amp; force of the Oath of God, and the hazards of the breach thereof are fully repreſented) the Action com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menceth with the King's moſt Solemn Renewing of the National and Solemn League and Covenant, which was in this manner. The King kneeling and lifting up his right hand before the three Eſtats of the Kingdom, the Commiſſioners of the General Aſſembly, and the whole People and Congregation, <hi>by his great Oath in preſence of the Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts, he aſſureth &amp; declareth his allowance of the</hi> NATIONAL COVENANT, &amp; SOLENN LEAGUE &amp; COVENANT, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64759:77"/>
faithfully to proſecute the Ends thereof, and to eſtablish the ſame with the Presbyterial Government and the whole VVork of God, in all his Dominions.</hi> 3. That, having thus taken the Covenants, the King is preſented to the People, and their willingneſs, to have him for their King, demanded; which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly declare. 4. That he did alſo ſwear and take the Coronation-Oath appointed and recorded <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. to which both the Covenants are moſt conſonant, <hi>Promiſing by the Eternal &amp; Almighty God, who liveth and reigneth for ever, to obſerve and keep the ſame.</hi> 5. That when he Sword was put in his hand, he is deſired to receave the ſame <hi>For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Faith of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; of the true Religion</hi> ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL &amp; SOLEMN LEAGUE &amp; COVENANT, <hi>&amp; for the Miniſtration of Iuſtice</hi>; which he accordingly accepteth. 6. After the Crown is ſet upon his head, the Peoples Obligatory Oath is proclaimed, <hi>whereby they all ſwear by the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal &amp; Almighty God who liveth &amp; reigneth for ever, to be true &amp; faithful to the King,</hi> ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL &amp; SOLEMN LEAGUE &amp; COVENANT. 7. Being inſtalled and ſet upon the Throne, he is exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Miniſter to remember, <hi>That his Throne is the Lord's Throne,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>And being a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted King ſet thereon, he ought under God to rule for God, and eſpecially to beware that he made not the Lord's Throne, a Throne of Iniquity, to frame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief by a Law, even ſuch miſchievous Laws as have been enacted by his Predeceſſors, deſtructive to Religion,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64759:77"/>
and grievous to the Lord's People.</hi> 8. The Nobles of the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being called one by one, and kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King on the Throne, and holding their hands betwixt his hands, did <hi>Swear by the Eternal and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God who liveth and reigneth for ever, to be true and faithful to the King,</hi> ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL AND SOLEMN LEAGUE AND CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENANT. 9. The action is cloſed by a moſt ſolid and weighty exhortation, both to King and People to keep the Covenant, and beware of the breach of it; which is enforced by theſe fearful threatenings and inſtances recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, againſt Covenant-breakers, particularly theſe, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. where <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did shake his lap. ſaying, <hi>So God shake out every man from his houſe, &amp; from his labour, that performeth not this promiſe, even thus be he shaken out and emptied, and all the Congregation ſaid, Amen. Ier.</hi> 34. <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. And 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.23, 24, <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. With this Pathetick application, <hi>That if they should break the Covenant, God would shake off the King's Crown, and turn him from the Throne; that he would shake the Nobles out of their poſſeſsions, and empty them of their Glory; and would deliver both to the hands of their enemies who ſeek their life; That breach of Covenant and Rebellion againſt God was an old and continued Sin in the King's houſe, which God had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeverely punished: if therefore the King should not acknowledge Ieſus Christ King of Zion, who is above him, but break this Covenant, God's controverſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King's Family would be carried on unto the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64759:78"/>
weakning if not the overthrow of it.</hi> And laſtly, both the King and Nobles are certifyed, that <hi>if the King and they who are engaged to ſupport his Crown, shall conſpire together against the Kingdom of Ieſus Christ, both the ſupporters and the ſupported will fall together.</hi> This is that great Action, wherein almoſt all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities are ſo twiſted with that ſacred Bond, that the World muſt acknowledge, that never King and People under the Sun, became ſo expreſly and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged both unto God, one to another, &amp; amongſt themſelves, as we were and are by theſe moſt Sacred Oaths of the Holy Covenants, moſt indiſſolubly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Advantage, was that plenary and laſt Complement of all Securities whatſoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ratification of all theſe preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treaties, Tranſactions, Engagements and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concluded and enacted by the King, then having attained the Age of 21 Years compleat, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament fully and freely conveened in the Moneth of <hi>Iune</hi> 1651. whereby the ſame did paſs into a perpetual Law: And this Covenant which from the beginning was and is the moſt firm and Indiſpenſible Oath of God, became at length the very Fundamental Law of the Kingdom, whereon all the Rights and Priviledges either of King or People, are principally bottomed and ſecured.</p>
            <p>This is the fair ſide of the Tranſactions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of thesſe times, and the effects of the Lord's favourable preſence, and the conſequence of that Zeal which we have mentioned. O! that we had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely minded and walked agreeably to all theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, ſurely our times should have endured for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64759:78"/>
ever: but ſeing both our own backſlidings, and the Lord's withdrawing from us do evidently teſtify againſt us, let us aſcribe Righteouſneſs unto our God, that in the remembrance of all theſe Judgements where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath punished us leſs then our inquities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, we may not only take unto our ſelves shame and Confuſion of face, becauſe we have ſinned againſt Him, and thereby ſtop the mouth of all theſe blaſphemies and boaſtings of the Adverſaries of the Lord, and His Holy Covenant, which our Backſlidings have ſo widely opened; but in the thoughts of His faithfulneſs be encouraged to hope in His Mercy, and for the return of our Departed Glory, although we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt Him.</p>
            <p>The Principal Step of our Defection, and the only Riſe and Cauſe of all our Sin and Calamity, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to have been no other, then that which is the condemnation of the World, that Light indeed came unto us, but we loved Darkneſs better then Light, becauſe our deeds were evil. For the Lord did cauſe His Goſpel to shine amongſt us, in as great Power and Purity as ever any Nation enjoyed, and by the Advantages of his own Holy Miniſtry and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; the acceſſion of our many fold Covenants and Engadgements, did beautify and ſecure the ſame unto us; And though that after a long continuance of all theſe bleſſings, the Lord by the Aſcendent Power of His own Spirit and Glorious Preſence, did bring the whole Land under theſe great convictions, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the concluſion of the League and Covenant, <hi>of our not valueing the ineſtimable Benefit of the Goſpel, nor endeauouring to receave Chriſt in our hearts, and walk worthy of Him in our lives, the only.</hi> Duty and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64759:79"/>
end of all our Covenants and Engagements, which is in effect God's greateſt Delight and Glory in the World, and all our Felicity; And unto theſe unfained reſolutions there annexed, of <hi>Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; And laſtly though the Lord from Heaven had both plagued us for, and purged us from theſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apoſtacies and Defections, whereby men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, not holding the Head and End of all things, even our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, were both in the Years 1645. and 1648. ſoon turned aſide from their ſtedfaſtneſs in the Covenant, and became Enemies unto God's own Work and Cauſe, and had therefore ſtirred us up to the Renewing of our Covenant with God in the Year 1648, with and after a moſt Solemn Acknowledgement both of the Cauſes and Evills of theſe Defections, and a moſt ſerious deteſtation of, and reſolution againſt both; Notwithſtanding, we ſay, of all theſe things, Yet the great Sin and Evil of not valueing, receaving, and walking worthy of our Lord Jeſus. and the not directing and improving the great Bleſſings of His Goſpel, Ordinances, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, Victories, and all other Benefits and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beſtowed on us for the promoving of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Lord, and the Eſtablishing of His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the Salvation of Sinners, did ſtill remain. Thence was it, that the generall and great Zeall which then appeared, was ſo ſuddenly contracted to a very few, and much remitted in all: And that mens corruptions, turning former Profeſſions into feigned pretenſions, and cauſing many, (in place of the great and only end propoſed) to minde Selfish Deſignes, and Worldly advantages, the Lord was provoked to give up ſome to the proſecution of theſe baſe deſires, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which they had ſo quickly backſliden; And to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64759:79"/>
abandon others to the deluſion of an over-credulous Charity: which two Evills did ſo far prevail in all the Tranſactions of theſe Times, that though the Over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence of the Moſt High, did bring forth thereof the Advantages which we have al-ready, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; yet were Men thereby acted to purſue Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, over the belly of moſt ſignal Warnings and moſt pregnant Diſswaſives to the contrary, and to conclude Agreements, and accept of Securities in the great Matters of God, and of His Work ſo long contended for, and far advanced, which no rational man not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring airy words and profeſſions, and Ink-ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to plain refuſal, viſible reluctancies, manifeſt reſilings, open counter-actings, and ſtrong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued prejudices, would be ſatisfyed with, in his own private matters of almoſt the meaneſt concernment. But though the Lord from heaven did at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> teſtify againſt both this evil and ſinful courſe, and the great Sin and wickedneſs that had procured it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by many of His faithful Servants did give expreſs Teſtimony &amp; Warning againſt the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it is ſtil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in: And notwithſtanding that by a new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, after all the aſſurance contained in the Declaration at <hi>Dumfermling</hi> that could be imagined, the Lord did make it evident at <hi>Clova,</hi> that all theſe condeſcenſions were only the conſtraints of Policy, the Backſliding and Deluſion of theſe times did proceed, until, that under a pretence of Neceſſity, preferring the Arm of Flesh to the Almighty Power and Favour of the Moſt High, and through the perſwaſion of a <hi>Mock-Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> only agreable unto that <hi>Mock-Treaty</hi> whereon it depended, we were induced again, to break the Lord's Commandement and our own Engagement, in joyning with the People of theſe Abominations; to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64759:80"/>
provoke the Lord to be angry, until He should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume us utterly without a remnant or eſcaping; and by partaking of their Sins, became apt and ready to partake of their judgements, which the Lord, by the hand of the TREACHEROUS, did ſuddenly inflict upon us for all our treachery: And thereby, according to His Righteouſneſs and Great Faithfulneſs, as he had brought upon us the bleſſing; ſo He alſo brought upon us the curſe of His Holy Covenant, and the fears of our own Acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>Theſe were our Forſakings &amp; Backſlidings, which provoked the Lord alſo to forſake us, and at length to give us over unto, and leave us in the hands of our enemies; and to lay on our necks that long and heavy yoke of forraign Uſurpation, under which, from the Year 1651. unto the Year 1660. we did ſo grevouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly groan. The remembrance of which things, doth neceſſarily oblidge us to the Declaration of theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as we deſire heartily to reſume theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of unfeigned Humiliation (for the undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Precious Goſpel and ſlighting of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) contained in our Holy Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the Land without exception are and were ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned; ſo (although in the Narration of the procedure of our ſinful and Wofull Defection, the particular paſſages of Self-ſeeking and Over-credulous Deluſion, may import a narrower reſtricton, Yet) the Lord is our witneſs, that the pure motive of His Glory, and the Honor and Truth of His Work and Covenant, without prejudice to the perſons of any, far leſs of ſuch, whom we are perſwaded the Lord both did, and yet doth honor, to be inſtrumental in His Work, and faithfull in His Covenant, (though neither in the former practice, or this preſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64759:80"/>
we do agree) have induced us to this reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which we earneſtly obteſt, may be looked upon by all, rather as the matter of our mourning then of our cenſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That whatever love and ſincere reſpect we retain for ſuch of the Faithful, who (through the Holy and Wiſe Permiſſion of the Soveraign Lord, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of particular temptations, or of that general and powerful ſnare of an Evil Time) were carried on to a Sinful Complyance with the Evil Courſes thereof: Yet we are perſwaded, that the remitting of that Zeal, ſincerity and ſtedfaſtneſs, whereunto, in our Solemn Acknowledgement, upon the moſt powerful motives, we had then lately ſo ſeriouſly engaged our ſelves; and the more Politick then Pious management of theſe Treaties and Tranſactions; (wherein the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Work of God, and proſecution of the Ends of the Covenant ſo highly pretended, could not ſincerely and zealouſly be intended, by any imaginary ſecurity or ſinful aſſiſtance thereby obtained) but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the relapſing unto that moſt ſinful Conjunction with the People of theſe Abominations, ſo ſolemnly and lately repented for, and reſolved againſt, (which, in ſtead of being ſalved, was, by the Conſtrained, Politick, Diſſembled, and Formall Repentance then uſed, to the mocking of the God of Truth, and ſcorn of all our Holy Engagements, on all hands moſtly aggravated and exaggerated) theſe evils, we ſay, were the very foundations of this preſent Apoſtacy, and the grounds of the Lords controverſy, which hath ſo long, and yet doth ſo greivouſly purſue this Poor Church and Nation. O! that all men would yet at length, after all the evils and warnings which God hath ſent amongſt us, ſeriouſly conſider their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64759:81"/>
wayes, take unto themſelves shame, and give unto God the Glory, before the decree bring forth our utter deſtruction and deſolation. Who knoweth but the Lord would repent Himſelf for His ſervants, when He ſeeth our power is gone, and return on high for His own Glory, and the Congregation of the poor that compaſs Him about, and render vengeance unto all his adverſaries?</p>
            <p n="3">3. That neither failing nor backſliding of many of the faithful, nor the wicked Hypocriſy and Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation practized on the other hand, in the carrying on, and concluding of theſe Treaties, whereby the King was brought under the bond of the Holy Covenant, doth leſſen or annul His Obligation thereto; far leſs the Security, which the People, eſpecially ſuch who know not theſe depths of Sathan, did obtain thereby, for their warrant and confirmation: Surely the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Aggravation of Perjury, cannot annul the Sacred Obligation of an Oath; nor an intended Falshood, looſe the bond of Truth; nor will vile Diſſimulation, and the moſt fearful mocking of God and the whole World, deliver from His Holy Juſtice and Jealouſy, who is a terrible and ſwift witneſs againſt, and avenger of all ſuch abominations. Did the wicked diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and rebellious heart of the Children of Iſrael, wherewith they entered in Covenant with the Lord, <hi>Deu.</hi> 29.10. <hi>to</hi> 28. liberate them from the ſin of Apoſtacy, and all theſe fearful plagues threatened againſt it? Did not that Diſſimulate promiſe and engagement of the remnant of the Jewes, made to <hi>Ieremiah chap.</hi> 42.20. rather haſten and aggravat the punishment of their diſobedience, <hi>v.</hi> 21, <hi>and</hi> 22? All who love Truth or fear an Oath, do no doubt abhor ſuch wickedneſs. But the main objection is, that all theſe condeſcenſions
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64759:81"/>
were extorted by Force and Fear, which doth excuſe the Diſſimulation, and annul the Oath. We shall not here inſiſt to clear and refute this cavillation, which others have ſo fully anſwered: For as to the poſition, <hi>that neither force nor fear, do cauſe to ceaſe the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of an Oath in a matter meerly Indifferent; much leſs, Holy, Righteous and true</hi> (as the matter of the Covenant is) all yeeld. But that neither Force, Fear, nor any other indirect way can be alleadged for the annulling of theſe engagements, both the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treaties, the juſt and neceſſary Reaſons, and all other cicumſtances do moſt evidently confirm; So that the whole World may juſtly wonder, that theſe men, who both in profeſſion and practice, do plainly evidence their profane Indifferency, and regardleſs violation of all Oaths, wherein Intereſt doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, should by the manifeſt Patronizing of all Perfidy (whereof no inſtance can be adduced in the breach of any treaty, wherein the ſtronger &amp; weaker did ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any matter of Right, which is not more juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) &amp; the shamefull diſgracing of the King himſelf, (whom neither Conſcience, Honor, Honeſty, nor the example of his Father could teach the conſtancy of the moſt mean and abject of his Subjects,) should plead &amp; pretend to rational pretext for the preſent Apoſtacy, and not rather content themſelves, to ſay with the King in one of his Declarations, emitted shortly after his return to <hi>England, that it is well known by what abuſive meanes His Majeſty was adduced to make and publish that Declaration at Dumfermling,</hi> without any more ſpecial condeſcendence, which is impoſſible. But oh! that the World did alſo know and conſider all the re-iterated Oaths and Subſcriptions, High and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64759:82"/>
Solemn Atteſtations, Free and unrequired Profeſſions, Fearfull Execrations, made before God, Angels and Men, both in Publick, upon the Throne, under the Crown, in plain Parliament, and alſo in Private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which many yet alive can ſufficiently atteſt; by which this poor Church and Nation was inſnared, and precipitated into all the Sin and Miſery, that ſince the Year 1650. unto this day, hath afflicted us. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord, who ſeeth and heareth, doth alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, to require it, and the violence done to Himſelf in many of his ſuffering members, who partly even in the conſcience of the very things, which they that are moſtly therein concerned, do mockat, dare not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute their Conſciences in an ambulatory Complyance, with the wicked Apoſtacy in theſe times.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We cannot but obſerve, that after the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and during the time of the English uſurpation, theſe only, for the moſt part, remained mindful of, and faithful to the King, who were faithful and ſtedfaſt in the Covenant; when as theſe, who formerly did, and at preſent do pretend ſo highly, for the King, in prejudice both of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, did in their ſlavish complyance, abandon all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagance and Honeſty, to complement the then Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for the promoving of their own ſelfish deſignes, which is the only bond of all their Engagements, and rule and aim of all their Actions. And though many of them do now pretend to have been ſufferers, yet it is well known, that if they had had the half of theſe temptations, which the Faithful upon the account of their alleageance did conſtantly reſiſt, the Kings In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt for their part, had been for ever forgotten, as it was by many of them openly renounced and abjured; And that the main reaſon of their then ſeeming and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64759:82"/>
Loyalty, was the improbability of credit with, and acceptance from the Uſurpers, becauſe of their known Naughtineſs.</p>
            <p>Having thus declared the Lords great Work and Glorious Preſence amongſt us, in all theſe Mercies and Judgements which he shewed upon us, and theſe ſtrange Viciſſitudes &amp; Alternations, ſometimes of His Grace &amp; Power, engageing us with heart &amp; hand unto Himſelf, ſometimes of our own hearts Wickedneſs and Unſtedfaſtneſs, again cauſing us to apoſtatize and backſlide from His Holy Command and Covenant, which, daring the ſpace of an hundred years from the Year 1560, have in the Holy and Wiſe Providence of God paſſed over us; that by all theſe great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which our eyes have ſeen, and the Signs and wonders which he hath wrought, we might know, that the Lord is our God, and Jeſus Chriſt our King; and that by all theſe things, He only went about to eſtablish us for a peculiar People unto Himſelf, in the Glorious Light of His Truth, and Beauty of His Holineſs, far exalted above many other Nations. We are now come to the Year 1660, wherein though the Lord was pleaſed according to His Glorious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity, by His own immediate hand, to break the yoke of our Oppreſſors, reſtore our Covenanted King, Lawes and Liberties, and to make all Factions, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Intereſts, not only to cede unto, but unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly to conſpire for this Bleſſed Reſtitution; yet how evidently hath it ſince appeared, that the Lord had not given unto us an heart to perceave, eyes to ſee, nor ears to hear, unto that very day.</p>
            <p>We need not here reſume the King's moſt Solemn and Indiſſoluble Engagements, which we have ſo lately mentioned, nor add that after <hi>Worceſter</hi> fight,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64759:83"/>
and from beyond Sea, he did confirm by private letters to perſons of unqueſtionable credit, that he was, and through the Grace of God would continue, the ſame man that he had declared Himſelf to be in <hi>Scotland</hi>; nor that it was the conſcience of that clauſe of the Covenant, relating to the maintenance of His Perſon and Authority, which during the times of Uſurpation, did retain the ſence and love of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſo fresh and deeply rooted in mens hearts; Nor that the publick owning, publishing and reprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof by the then Parliament in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1660. was the firſt Public Act that durſt or did appear in his favours; Nor laſtly need we remember that Letter written and directed by the King, after his return to the Presbytery of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and this whole Church, wherein he declares Himſelf <hi>reſolued, by the Grace of God to protect and preſerve the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Scotland as it is ſetled by Law without violation</hi>; Seing that though according to it's then State and poſture, ſuch a Solemn and Publick Aſſurance might have been reputed a perpetual Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet the whole ſtrain of the Letter, is ſuch as tendeth only to divide the whole Miniſtery, and to abuſe the greater part of them: And particularly, the altering and ſuppreſſing of that moſt fixed and certain ground of his Engagement, even the Word of God and the Holy Covenant, for that of <hi>Law,</hi> which is but frail and moveable, did even then diſcover to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that latent Diſſimulation and Inſtability, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by others were either weakly or willingly deluded. The thing we obſerve is, that both King and Peoples Obligations were not then greater, then the oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity appeared to be moſt happy, for the accomplishing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64759:83"/>
of the Lord's Work, the making of his Name Great &amp; One in all theſe Nations, &amp; the Nations happy &amp; high above all Nations in Name &amp; in Praiſe, &amp; the eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the King and his poſterity upon the Throne in Glory &amp; proſperity, &amp; that the owning of, &amp; adhering unto the Solemn League and Covenant, our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Religion and Righteouſneſs, had both in the perſwaſion of all ſober men, and even in the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greateſt part of our Adverſaries, infallibly produced, and effectuated all theſe bleſſings.</p>
            <p>But Oh! how ſuddenly and ſtrangely was this bleſſed appearance overclouded, the expectation of all the Godly diſappointed, the joy and peace of all corrupted and marred, and this Land reduced unto this preſent ſo woful deſolation and ſore diſtreſs, which though the groans, tears, and the Blood of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, the cry of Violence and Oppreſſion, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and Profanation of Gods Sanctuary, the reigning power of Darkneſs, the Pride, Rage and Blaſphemy of Perjury and all Profanity, which hath filled the Land, and the dreadful Wrath of the moſt Holy and Great God, which both burneth round about, and hangeth over it, do ſufficiently make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, yet for our greater upſtirring to conſider and lay to heart, that all theſe evils are come upon us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our God is not amongſt us, and what the heat of this great Anger meaneth, &amp; alſo for the clearing of the Innocency &amp; Teſtimony of the Lords ſufferers, we do shortly exhibite the violent courſe of this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant Defection.</p>
            <p>The King being returned and re-eſtablished in May 1660. the Antichriſtian Spirit of Prelacy, ever enemy to the Goſpel and Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64759:84"/>
and the Holy Covenant whereby the ſame are promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, taking occaſion from theſe many troubles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, which the oppoſition and falſe-heartedneſs of many in the ſame Covenant, did principally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to inflict upon thir Lands, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the proneneſs of mens Power to decline unto Tyranny, and their corruptions to all licentiouſneſs, did firſt moſt falſely and atrociouſly ſlander the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as the Bond of all Iniquity, Rebellion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which prejudice being enforced which many apparent advantages that then did attend it, did ſo ſuddenly and ſtrongly ſpread and root it ſelf in the hearts of our Nobles, Rulers, and the generality of the Land, that, without ſo much as ſeriouſly reflecting upon their former ſo Solemn Engagements, Sacred Oaths, Publick Profeſſions, Vigorous Actings and Appearances for the Cauſe and Covenant of the Lord, with any conſideration of Conſcience, Honeſty, or Honor, which ſo great and ſudden a mutation from their former wayes, though they had been as wicked, as in effect they are true and righteous, did certainly call for in ſober and earneſt Repentance, they with the concurrence of ſuch vile Sycophants and treacherous perſons in the Church and Miniſtry, as the worldly wealth and Power of Prelacy had wickedly debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſet themſelves in a moſt determined and reſolute Fury, whereinto all their former zeal for God is by the malice of Satan ſuddenly corrupted, by the plain force of Power, and colour of Authority, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they had now attained, to deface and overturn the whole Work of God, raze it's fundations, annul His Covenants, repeal all Acts made in their favors, incapacitate and perſecute all oppoſers, and laſtly to efface and diſſolve all ſenſe and bond of Conſcience,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64759:84"/>
by which this fearful courſe of Apoſtacy, might be in the leaſt, checked or controlled.</p>
            <p>We shall not here premiſe any thing, for clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Unlawfulneſs of the ſucceeding Acts and Deeds, whereby this Apoſtacy was carried on, and for the looſing and freeing of us from all obligation of Obedience thereto, or Complyance therewith: Any who can but ſuppoſe, that not only a whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but alſo all men are, and have often been found liars, and compare impartially the things preſent with the things that are paſt, muſt neceſſarily conclude, that all theſe Acts and Deeds of Defection were and are Groſs Perjury and Wickedneſs, and that ſo long as that maxim shal hold, <hi>that we ought rather to obey God then Man,</hi> they can never be binding either in Conſcience or Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Seing therefore that the only Rule of theſe Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actings and overturnings, was to deſtroy that which the Lord had ſo gloriouſly planted, and to looſe that whereunto we were and are indiſſolubly obliged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring our ſelves to what is already ſaid, for vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Work and our Holy Covenants, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to lay forth the Sinfulneſs and Wofulneſs of this Defection, as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. In <hi>August</hi> 1660. the Committee of Eſtates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Parliament 1651. being again ſet down,

the very firſt day of their meeting, do violently ſeiſe upon ſeveral faithful Miniſters, peaceably and quietly aſſembled together, and imployed in the drawing up of a monitory Letter to the King, in the moſt rational and dutiful manner, and for the moſt important and neceſſary Ends, of Gods Glory, and the Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that can be imagined, as the Letter it ſelf ſet down at large in the <hi>Apologetick Narration</hi> doth teſtify.

            <p>Although that theſe Acts have been and are, both in themſelves &amp; in their effects, juſt cauſe of great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and mourning to all the Faithful in the Land; yet when we remember that height of Wickedneſs and Profanity that then abounded, and the falſe, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; perjurious Sermons &amp; practiſes, by which the Parliament was thereunto inſtigated, but moſt of all that Act that then paſſed for an Anniverſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; wherein, as if we had been delivered to commit all this great Wickedneſs, the Spirit and Work of the Lord are heinouſly blaſphemed and calumniated, as the only Author and Cauſe of all the Blood, Bondage, Uſurpation, Rebellion, Rapine, Violence and other Evils, that either the malice and wickedneſs of men had cauſed, or God in his Righteous Judgement had therefore permitted or inflicted; and the Ranverſing of our Bleſſed Reformation, Holy Covenants, and the Righteous Laws whereby they were eſtablished, accounted the Reſtitution of Religion, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Liberties; And the 29 of <hi>May,</hi> as moſt Auſpicious, appointed for the yearly ſolemn comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration thereof.

And for the better ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof, and evident declaring to the World, how Eraſtian and Antichriſtian this Woful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, both in it's Riſe, Deſigns and Effects, as by this <hi>Act,</hi> the Reſtitution thereof is expreſly found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>King's Supremacy, as being an inherent Right in the Crown for the diſpoſal of the external Government of the Church,</hi> So it is alſo declared, that <hi>whatever the King shall determine with advice of the Bishops and ſuch of the Clergy as he shall nominate, in the externall Government of the Church, shall be valid and effectual,</hi> without any other <hi>Proviſo</hi> then that the ſame be <hi>conſiſtent with the Laws of the Realm.</hi> But the Abſolute Complement of all Wickedneſs and the Hight of Uſurpation, above all that ever the Papacy it ſelf aſpired unto, is that which followeth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the King and Parliament, for clearing all ſcruples
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64759:87"/>
which may occurre from former <hi>Acts</hi> and Practices, do reſcind all former <hi>Acts,</hi> by which, the ſole and only power of Juriſdiction within this Church, doth ſtand in the Church, and in the Meetings and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies thereof; and all Acts of Parliament and Council, which may be interpreted to have given any Church-power, Juriſdiction, or Government to the Office-bearers of the Church, their reſpective meetings, other then that which acknowledgeth a dependence upon, and ſubordination to the Soveraign Power of the King as ſupream, and is to be regulated and authorized in the exerciſe thereof by the Bishops, who are to put order to Eccleſiaſtick matters, and to be accountable to the King for their Adminiſtration; And the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid 114 <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>la.</hi> 6. whereby the Priviledges, Power and other eſſentiall Cenſures given by God to the ſpirituall Office-bearers in His Church, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randed by His Word are ratifyed, is even in ſo far and totally caſſed and reſcinded. And that the World may know how preſumptuous and abſurd this Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation is, which cannot be juſtly conceaved without an inſtance of it's effects, we here ſubjoyn that 4 <hi>Act.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64759:87"/>
of the <hi>King's preſence in perſon or by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioner, and of his Ratification and Approbation,</hi> without which no Act or Deed is to be of any force. Now let the World conſider, what he could have done more in the conſtitution and regulation of his own Court of <hi>Exchequer:</hi> And if he hath not done all, as to the conſtitution of this Court, (immediatly depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his ſole Authority) which He Himſelf hath done or poſſibly could do; by what warrand or rule, He who is King of Kings will require. We shal not here ſtand to examine theſe Acts according to former Laws, Oaths and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hereby moſt fearfully violated and contemned; This is a ſtrain of wickedneſs above all that former times could imagine. O! that God would ſpeak to the Authors, but not in his wrath, and as he hath ſet His only Son upon his holy Hill of <hi>Zicn</hi>; ſo he would cauſe them to fear His diſpleaſure, that they may yet be wiſe and inſtructed to kiſs the Son, left he be angry, and they perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a litle. Surely to define, that the ſole Power and Juriſdiction of this Church, doth not ſtand within the ſame, but in ſome thing without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide our Lord Jeſus; and that the ſame is fountain'd in, and derived from the King; and that all Church-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in all Church matters, are accountable to him, who is neither thereto Gifted nor Called, is to ſet the King upon our Lord Jeſus his Throne, and a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation from, and reflection upon him, who hes builded the Temple of the Lord &amp; bears the Glory, &amp; ſits and rules both as King &amp; Prieſt upon His Throne; <hi>Who,</hi> more worthy then <hi>Moſes, was faithful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as a Son over His own Houſe</hi>; and therefore did
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64759:88"/>
not leave His Church deſtitute, of any ſuch neceſſary and proper Officer or Aſſiſter, when neither King nor Prince was ſo much as members thereof; And laſtly, it's a plain Perverſion in ſtead of Performance of that Promiſe made to the Church, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>That Kings should be it's Nurſing Fathers,</hi> where in place of Dominion, there Submiſſion is expreſly injoyned, <hi>they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the Earth.</hi> We know that this empty Notion of <hi>External Policy,</hi> is vainly pretended to colour the matter: But ſeeing whatſoever can be meaned by external Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, even as to outward decency and Order, is either particularly determined by our Lord Himſelf and His bleſſed Apoſtles, or under the definition of General and Evident Rules left unto the Churches arbitriment, whereby the King (being no Church-Officer) upon a double account is clearly excluded; and ſeing that under the pretence of this External Policy, the greateſt &amp; moſt ſuperſtitious Novations in the pure Worship of God, and the greateſt Corruptions and Abuſes both by the appointment of new Officers in the Church of Chriſt without His own warrand, and the uſurping and perverting of the Power of Spiritual Cenſures in the Government of Gods Houſe, may be and have been introduced, we doubt not, but all rational men do ſee the deluſions of ſuch vain pretences. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſince the <hi>Act</hi> it ſelf doth proceed, to grant the King all the <hi>Power in &amp; over both Eccleſiaſtick Cauſes &amp; Perſons</hi> that can be imagined, it would be but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ingenuity in our Adverſaries, plainly to aſſert, that the King is the Great Apoſtle and Vicegerent of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in and over His Houſe: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they should not only appear herein deſtitute of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64759:88"/>
any better warrand, then this preſent <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; But moſt plainly to juſtify al the Uſurpation, that ever the Pope or Antichriſt, can be charged with.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Bishops being thus reſtored and admitted to ſit and give voice in Parliament, this Mixture and the Power of their Antichriſtian Spirit doth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exert it ſelf: And without regard to the nature of Parliamentary and all Civil Powers (which are no wayes converſant about things and perſwaſions only Internal, and meerly appertaining to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or to the Word of God, which is the ground and warrant, upon which all Power whatſoever being only Declarative, in matters of this kind, ought certainly and expreſly to proceed,) They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Dogmatick Act declaring theſe Poſitions, <hi>That it is lawful to Subjects for Reformation or neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Self-defence to enter into Leagues, or take up Arms againſt the King,</hi> and ſuch like, to be Rebellious and treaſonable; and particularly <hi>that the National Covenant as it was explained in the Year</hi> 1638, <hi>and the Solemn League and Covenant were, and are in</hi> THEMSELVES UNLAWFUL OATHS, <hi>and were taken by, and impoſed upon the Subjects of this Kingdom, againſt the Fundamental Law and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof.</hi> (Which neither they nor all the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hell, is able to condeſcend upon or inſtruct) And therefore, out of the plenitude of their power, (as much as ever any Pope pretended to) they looſe the Obligation of Conſcience, and free the Subjects of their Engagements: And further, to compleat this their Wickedneſs, they appoint a Declaration of this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64759:89"/>
High Impiety, to be ſigned by all in Publick Truſt, that none may be admitted to, or exerce the ſame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they receave in their right hand or in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads this their accurſed mark. <hi>O! Lord our God, thow art of purer eyes then to behold Evil, and canſt not look on Iniquity: VVherefore lookſt thou on them that deal treacherouſly, and holds thy tongue when the wicked devour the man that is more righteous then he? Yet ſurely O Lord thou haſt ordained them for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and O mighty God, thou haſt eſtabished them for correction.</hi> Can the World beleeve, that a whole Nation in it's moſt National Capacity, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King, Parliament and the body of the People, should after moſt clear and evident convictions, and ſignal Manifeſtations of the Glory and preſence of God, in the moſt important and holy Concernments of all Truth and Righteouſneſs, moſt ſolemnly (as it were) to day engage themſelves by Oath unto the Lord, and to morrow, without ſo much as ſeriouſly remembring Gods Holineſs and terrible Jealouſy, either againſt theſe that break His Holy Covenant, or wickedly profane His Name by taking it in vain, at once without any reaſon or probable motive rendered therefore, deſpiſe, contemn and trample the ſame Holy and Great Engagements under foot, and urge others to the like Wickedneſs and Impiety? If this tend unto, or shall prove effectuall for <hi>the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majeſty's Perſon, Authority &amp; Government,</hi> as this <hi>Act</hi> and ſtatute is entituled, then ſurely he may break the Covenant and proſper. But this is not all, for theſe men ſuppoſing by this Act, that the Work of God was utterly ſubverted and overthrown, they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64759:89"/>
provide alſo againſt the fears of it's revival, by declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>all ſuch Gatherings and Petitions that were uſed in the beginning of the late Troubles,</hi> though the ſame be no other then that common priviledge of all men, which Slavery it ſelf (much leſs Subjection) doth not take away, <hi>to be unlawful and ſeditious</hi>: And furder do ſtatute and enact <hi>that no perſon by VVriting, Printing, Praying, Preaching, or malicious and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſpeaking, expreſs or publish any words or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to ſtirre up the People to the diſlike of the Kings Prerogative and Supremacy, or of the Government of the Church by Bishops, or juſtify any of the deeds, Actings or things declared against by this preſent Act.</hi> By all which, not only the Security of Religion and the Liberty of the Subject is utterly ſubverted, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of the lawful, moſt neceſſary and only means of aſſerting thereof, in caſe the ſame should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded; but we are alſo denyed and prohibited the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, ſo much as to mourn and pour out our prayer unto God, either apart or one with another, for all this Horrid Apoſtacy, or our heavy perſecutions for non-complyance therewith; So that the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of all remedies, Petitioning and Prayer, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the meaneſt and laſt of all comforts, even the Tears and Complaints of the afflicted, (which God and Nature hath hitherto placed beyond the reach of all cruelty) are now ſeverely forbidden.</p>
            <p n="7">7. By the <hi>third Act</hi> of the ſame <hi>Seſsion of Parliament,</hi> under the pretence that Patronages, being the juſt &amp; proper right of theſe concerned, were unjuſtly abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Year 1649. notwithſtanding that the ſame
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64759:90"/>
were only, in ſo far as they were burthenſome to the Church of God, and obſtructive to the Work of the Goſpel, then abrogated; and in lieu thereof the civil Intereſt and benefit of Patrons more amply extended and ſecured; yet on purpoſe that they might caſt out and remove ſuch faithful Miniſters, as notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the wicked Acts and Practiſes then made for the overthrow of the Work of God and Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, might have by their ſtedfaſtneſs (at leaſt) put ſome demur to this impetuous Defection, they ſtatute and ordain, <hi>that all Miniſters who entered to the Cure of any Parish, in or ſince the Year</hi> 1649. <hi>have no right unto, nor shall poſſeſs any benefice or ſtipend for that ſame current Year</hi> 1662. <hi>or any Year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but decern their Kirks and Benefices</hi> Ipſo Jure <hi>vacant</hi>: And then under pretext of favour, they clearly diſcover the deſign and ſnare intended, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that <hi>every ſuch Miniſter who shall obtain the Patron's Preſentation and Bishop's Collation, betwixt and the twenty of September then nixt following, shall have right to his Church and Benefice, as if at his entry he had been lawfully preſented, otherwiſe the Act to ſtand in force against him.</hi> By which means this ſame Parliament in their firſt Seſſion having enacted, that no Patron should preſent, or Miniſter Preſented have right, except they should firſt take the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, the very body and ſtrength of the Miniſtry of this Church were reduced to this ſore <hi>Dilemma,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take that Oath of Supremacy, which both by expreſs Acts and clear Practiſes, was now declared and interpreted to be the very height of Papacy, and root of Prelacy, and by accepting of Collation, to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64759:90"/>
acknowledge theſe perfidious and uſurping Prelates, or to loſe and be caſt out of the Miniſtry, likeas, <hi>de facto</hi> 300. and upwards of the faithful Miniſters, were by vertue of this Act shortly thereafter outed and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented from the Exerciſe of their Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Prelates not having attained their full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by this laſt Act, do further proſecut their deſign of caſting out, and incapacitating all ſuch as either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained or might riſe up to oppoſe their wickedneſs, and therefore they procure, 1. an Act of Parliament without either Citation or Reaſon alleaged or rendered, againſt the faithful Miniſters of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (who, being eminent lights, were alſo from the advantage of the place apprehended as more eminent oppoſers,) diſcharging them of their, Miniſtry, and ordaining them to remove themſelves and families out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after the 8 of <hi>September</hi> then next to come. 2. By the fourth Act of the ſame ſecond Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the effect that not one faithful Miniſter might remain to witneſs againſt their Defection, they ſtatut and enact, <hi>that all Miniſters, for Teſtifying their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of, and complyance with the preſent Government by Prelates, keep and obſerve the Bishops Viſitations and Dioceſian Aſsemblies, and be aſsiſtant to them in all Acts of Church Diſcipline as they shall be required, under the pain for the firſt fault of Suſpenſion from Office and Benefice, and of Depoſition if they should not amend.</hi> We are not here to redargue ſuch lukewarm Newters, as, by the ſubtilty of a vain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction deceaving &amp; being deceaved, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of innocent ſubmiſſion, do actually Aſſiſt, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,

and Comply with that wicked Prelacy, which they are ſworn to Extirpat; and at beſt, can only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to keep the Covenant by that <hi>deteſtable Neutrality,</hi> which, they have therein abjured; Their growing Backſliding will quickly declare and free them of this imputation of Neutrality. Our regrate is for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who are thus by the Perjury and violence of ſuch who of all men ought moſt to patronize them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outed of the Miniſtry by Deprivation from Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or ſtipend, but declared by a Parliament, a Civil Court, depoſable from their Spiritual Office, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtently and abſurdly as if the ſame Secular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were authors thereof, had by the ſame Act ſtept into their pulpits. 3. By the ſame laſt Act, in imitation of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtat, who found not a more effectual and Devillish invention for ſuppreſſing &amp; deſtroying Chriſtianity then the shutting up of their Schools and Colledges for learning, they ordain for the poyſoning of all the ſprings and fountains thereof, that none teach or rule in an Univerſity or Colledge, except they both take the Oath of Supremacy, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, &amp; own the Government of Prelacy, &amp; that none be permitted to teach any School, or to be a Paedagogue to Children without the Prelates licence. 4. By the ſame Act, they not only prohibit any to Preach in publick or in families without the Prelats licence; but advancing &amp; purſuing their malice &amp; perſecution unto theſe very San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries of reſt &amp; refuge, which even in former times, (when the proud were called happy, &amp; ſuch as wrought wickedneſs were ſet up, yea they that tempted God. were delivered,) the Lord did provide and reſerve for his Own, wherein they that feared him, and thought upon his Name, ſpoke often one to another, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64759:91"/>
the Lord hearkened and heard it; they under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, leſt the People should thereby be alienat from their <hi>Lawful Pastors</hi> (as they call them) who in effect are Wolves and Thieves, diſcharge all Private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in houſes for Religious Exerciſes, which might tend to the prejudice of the publick Worship in Churches: Under which qualification, all Chriſtian Fellowship and Society, amongſt ſuch who cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome their juſt averſion from theſe Churches and publick Meetings, which theſe Apoſtat Prelats have prophaned and polluted, and whereunto they have wickedly intruded, are prohibited and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="9">9. By a Proclamation emitted this ſecond Seſſion of Parliament, they again enjoin the obſervance of that Anniverſary Holy Day, the 29 of <hi>May, even the Moneth and Day which they had deviſed of their own heart for a feast unto the People</hi>: And to the effect they might the more infallibly attain their purpoſe of Outing all faithfull Miniſters, they ſubjoin the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>Deprivation of Benefice,</hi> or Stipend, againſt all ſuch who should not, (becauſe in conſcience could not) obſerve it, like as <hi>de facto,</hi> ſeveralls, who could not in conſcience ſatisfy themſelves either as to the Authority or Reaſon of the appointment, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without Citation or hearing, Outed of their Benefices and Stipends for that Year; and the ſame either immediatly ingathered by the common Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, or gifted to ſome other.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In the ſame Seſſion of Parliament, pretending that the whole Land, (a few only excepted,) were notourly and heinouſly involved in the crimes of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Leſe-Majeſty, through no other cauſe nor oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,

then our moſt Neceſſary, Righteous, and Lawful entering into the Solemn League &amp; Covenant, and proſecuting the holy ends theirof, once ſo ſignally owned and countenanced by the Lord, and ſo fully Authorized by all the Law &amp; Security that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined (for, as for the English Uſurpation, few were guilty of Complyance therewith, who were not alſo moſt forward in this Apoſtacy, and the very vileſt and worſt of ſuch had been declared an honeſt man by an expreſs and particular Act of the ſame Parliament) they appoint a packed cloſe Committee, wherein the generality of the faithfull to the number of about 800, (not adding a hundred more who by private reſentment or upon ſome other prejudice were liſted in this roll) without citation or any cauſe ſignifyed, or any manner of tryal taken, were moſt arbitrarily Fined, and for the moſt part in ſuch pecuniary mulcts and ſumms as it pleaſed the malicious ſuggeſtions of the delators to impoſe, and in many particulars ſo abſurdly, the ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſame perſon was found twice fined under divers ſtiles in diverſe Shires, and others were left blanck either in the Name or Surname, who might be filled up either for one perſon or another, as the beſt conjecture should determine; and others were fined, who were dead long before, or were Infants, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors under age, and others who to this day could never be found.

We need not here inſiſt upon the particular ſteps, whereby the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs jealouſies of theſe wicked Prelats, did urge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and advance this Preſecution, by their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating of reiterate Acts and Proclamations, until they obtained that laſt Act and Proclamation, concluding and adjudging all theſe Miniſters unto ſuch a nice and impoſſible Confinement, which not only the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of humane frailty, and it's dependance upon many indiſpenſible conveniences, do render more rigid &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, then the moſt ſtrict impriſonment, and the moſt barbarous banishment; but alſo the moſt curious skill of the moſt exact Geographer can ſcarce make practicable: It is enough for us to note, that having, by a poſterior Proclamation, extended the ſame pains unto all Miniſters outed upon whatſoever ground of non conformity to this preſent courſe of Apoſtacy, (in which condition all the faithfull Miniſters in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a very few excepted, are included,) there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many Innocent and Faithful Miniſters, in any Chriſtian Church at once and for ſuch a cauſe reduced to ſuch hardships, fears, and uncertainties, and that by ſuch perſons, who not only are as deeply &amp; ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſworn and engaged as they are, in the ſame Cauſe and Covenant, for which they ſuffer, but by ſuch who once (ſome of them at leaſt) appeared to have had the zeal of God, ſo that if it had been poſſible they would have pluckt out their own eyes, and have given them to ſuch, whoſe Enemies they now are, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tell them the truth: Such is the fearful ſnare &amp; prevailing Power of Apoſtacy; but God ſeeth &amp; telleth their wanderings, and putteth all their tears into his bottle.

            <p>We shall not here debate the Lawfulneſs or Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Obedience here required, only for the vindication of many thouſands of the Faithful, who by their ſufferings have born Teſtimony againſt this Act; we add, 1. that waving the ordinary &amp; captious maner of propoſing the queſtion in the terms of <hi>Hearing or nor Hearing,</hi> which ſtrickly taken, are not the ſubject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we are aſſured that none ſeriouſly pondering the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Oath of God, <hi>ſincerely, really &amp; conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the dayes of our life to endeavour the extirpation of Prelats and their dependants,</hi> but they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the owning of, and ſubmitting to the Apoſtat Curats according to this Act as our Miniſters, is moſt diametrally oppoſit thereto: Can we Lawfully Own ſuch whom we are bound to abhorre? Or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſuch whom we are bound to extirpate? Surely this were to rebuild what we have deſtroyed. 2. That though ſome nimble Sophiſters, who fear not after vowes to make inquiry, can and have ſwallowed both Owning and Submitting as not repugnant to the duty of Extirpation, yet, ſeing the direct contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is by the terms themſelves very ſignificantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and that theſe terms were for this expreſs cauſe and deſign particularly elected and made choice of by the Parliament, for ranverſing of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Covenant, no ſober man will be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their deluſion to think, either that Owning and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64759:94"/>
Submitting ſignify no more then Simple Submitting, or that that Active Aſſenting and Complying Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion here mean'd, is no more then that Stil and Paſſive Submiſſion, unto which men by the force of inevitable neceſſity, and againſt their wills are oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. 3. That whoever pretending to enter into the Miniſtery, doth preſumptuouſly contemn and deſpiſe the ſacred Rule and Order of Entry appointed by the great Shepherd, cannot be reputed to enter by the <hi>Door,</hi> nor to be ſo much as Externally by him Sent or Called: But ſuch as do enter by groſs and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Perjury and wicked Violence and Intruſion, do without queſtion contemn the ſacred Rule and Order of Gods Word, ſo that to admit ſuch to be ſo much as Externally Called were to make the God of Order the Author of Confuſion, and him who is the Truth, the favourer of Perjury. We know that this notion of an <hi>External Call</hi> is conceited by many, to be no other thing, then the performance of ſuch Rites and Solemnities, as are preſcribed to the Admiſſion of a Miniſter, done by ſuch a Perſon or Perſons, on whom the like hath been performed; but ſeing that by many inſtances of groſs Diſorder and Violence, (which are obvious for any man to ſuppoſe,) many abſurdities might be hence inferred, and that to be Externally Called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording both to the meaning of Truth, and the import of the words is, <hi>to have ſuch a Viſible Evidence of the Call of Ieſus Chriſt, as in Reaſon and Charity doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all men to receave the perſon ſo called, as truely ſent</hi>; Certainly if any Perſon force his own Entry into the Miniſtry by open and profane Contempt of the Rule and Order given by our Lord Jeſus, he doth in like maner as palpably diſprove any Evidence of a Lawful
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64759:95"/>
Call, which he can pretend to, &amp; no man is obliged either to Beleeve him to be Called or to Receave him as Sent. Which things are ſo evident in themſelves, that whoever denyeth them, is obliged by the ſame conſequence to affirm, that if <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had in his horrid wickedneſs purchaſed the Apoſtleship by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the Chriſtian World had been bound to Receave him as an Apoſtle. 4. Though we are not to lanch out into theſe depths, how the Soveraignity of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath ſuffered Churches to fall away into Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy, and again recovered them, and if during theſe times of Apoſtacy a ſtanding Miniſtry ſtill continued, or how long it did; if not, what way it was revived and raiſed up, in which caſes true Faith in Jeſus Chriſt which is the ſubſtance of all, and a conſcientious walking according to the meaſure of the times, doth certainly purge and ſuſtain many things otherwiſe chargeable with Informality; Yet of this weare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that it hath alwayes been both the ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of all Apoſtatizing Churches, that they have not reſiſted the beginnings of Defection, and when the Authors theirof did prove incorrigible, though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Miniſters, that they did not ſeparate from them, and account them as Heathens and Publicans, which courſe, if duely and zealouſly obſerved, had undoubtedly put a great ſtop and hinderance to the riſe and wicked Uſurpation of Antichriſt, all whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and violence without the deluſion and complyance of ſuch who ought to have reſiſted them, had never proven ſo effectual. 5. That a man may be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and yet not a Miniſter unto all, ſo as to oblige them to receave him as ſent to them, which may be intuitively underſtood beyond the light and power of any demonſtration, if we but ſuppoſe the caſe of a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64759:95"/>
particular Congregation, living under, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their own lawful Paſtor, &amp; that amongſt ſuch, a few violent perſons ariſing, bring in another Miniſter by plain force, and caſt out their lawful Paſtor, and if it be ſincerely reſolved what the faithful in that Church are then obliged to do, ſurely none will think that they ought inſtantly to relinquish their true Paſtor, &amp; own &amp; ſubmit to this Intruder, but on the contrare all muſt grant that they ought to adhere to their lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter &amp; not only diſcountenance &amp; withdraw from the Uſurper, but by all lawful means endeavour his Ejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which caſe, if but tranſlated to the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this oppreſſed Church under uſurping Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, will with the ſame evidence reſolve the queſtion. 6. That whatever conſtruction or interpretation many to whom it is given to believe but not to ſuffer, may put upon their hearing of the Curates, as to the inferring or not inferring their owning of, and ſubmiſſion to their Miniſtry, yet this is certain, that as it is the moſt probable argument and preſumption of owning that can be alleadged, ſo is it that which this Act requires for to teſtify both a due acknowledgement of, and hearty complyance with the preſent Government by Prelates, and as an undoubted evidence of the peoples giving their cheerful Concurrence, Countenance and Aſſiſtance to the Curates. 7. That ſeing hearing of the Curates by the acknowledgement of all the more ingenuous is not a duty to which they are moved by conſcience, but rather uſed by them as a thing though lawful yet arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for the eviting a greater inconvenience, &amp; ſeing that this Act and every article theirof is undoubtedly groſs and wicked Perfidy againſt God and his holy Covenant, commanding the diſowning and relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing the Lords Miniſtry whom we are bound to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64759:96"/>
maintain, and the owning and encouraging by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch vile Intruders as we are bound to extirpate, thereby deſigning expreſly to involve all as much as is poſſible in the ſame Perfidy, and to looſe the former obligation of the Oath of God; whatever may be ſaid in the caſe abſtractly conſidered, yet we are perſwaded that being thus ſtated, not hearing becomes a caſe of Teſtimony, and an indiſpenſible duty. 8. That as it is the ſin and miſery of all declining times that the zeall of God is at the beſt rather wished for as a Bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then minded as a Duty; ſo we are confident that the true and right zeall of God should, and would not only inſpire all with an unanimous Averſion againſt the the profane intruding Curates, but animate us as one man to drive away theſe Wolves and Thieves, and to eradicate theſe plants which our heavenly Father never planted. 9. That though the Curates could inſtruct and juſtify their External Call, yet ſuch are their lies &amp; lightneſs by which they cauſe the people to erre, &amp; the viſible truth of their vile Perjury and Prophanity, which they preach and practiſe, that all ſerious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers may eaſily diſcover them to be inwardly raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wolves under the sheeps cloathing of an pretended external call, of whom in conſcience of our Lords command all ought and should beware. 10. That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the difference in theſe things even amongſt the faithful, yet all muſt aggree and acknowledge that the violent preſſing of ſuch to hear, who upon ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable grounds from a tender ſenſe of conſcience do only plead that Chriſtian, innocent, &amp; moſt ſafe priviledge of a peaceable forbearance, is not only contrare to that ample promiſe of <hi>Indulgence to tender conſciences</hi> made and declared by the King from <hi>Breda</hi> before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn 1660. but is in effect to violent all conſcience, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64759:96"/>
the hight of oppreſſion and rigor. 11. That as the grounds laid down may and do ſufficiently anſwer all objections, ſo therefrom may be shortly cleared, firſt, that common and ordinary Sophiſm, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and obſerving the Ordinances is an indiſpenſible Duty from which neither the wickedneſs nor frailty of the Miniſter doth looſe: But as it may be eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that this when acknowledged doth rather ſuppoſe then inferre the complexed lawfulneſs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Curates as Miniſters, and that their Miniſtry is the Lords Ordinance, which is plainly denyed; ſo we are alſo to conſider, that ſuch duties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances are only acceptable unto the Lord, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the matters of his Worship which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſound and wholly agreeable unto his will, truely done, in ſpirit, and altogether performed in truth, <hi>Nam bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>um est ex omni cauſa,</hi> hence it is that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity and wickedneſs even of the Lords lawful Prieſts, let be the Perjury and Profanity of wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, have not only cauſed the People to abhorre the offering of the Lord to the Prieſts heavy charge, but eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord himſelfe to abhorre his ſanctuary, &amp; to account incenſe an abomination, ſo that he cannot away with the calling of aſſemblies, it is iniquity even the ſolemn meeting; shall it then be accounted iniquity for to hate that which the Lord hates, and withdraw from that which he hath forſaken? Ought we not rather to diſtinguish a holy abhorring from a profane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, though both of them proceed from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats ſin, and in the ſenſe thereof rather wish for, and withdraw with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> unto a cottage in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that there we may mourn for all theſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſurely were there no more in this matter but that Holines becomes the houſe of God for ever, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64759:97"/>
men of clean hands and a pure lip ought to draw near and turn unto him, it were ſufficient to juſtify the Lords People, who in drawing near to God, cannot in conſcience either regard or make uſe of the mouths and hands of theſe Apoſtates which are continually filled with lyes and violence, as either ſent by the Lord to them-ward, or to be imployed by them to God-ward, 2. From theſe grounds may be cleared that grand objection from our Lords command to the People of the Jewes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. ſaying, <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes ſeat, therefore whatſoever they bid yow obſerve, that obſerve and do.</hi> Whence ſome inferre that even ſuch as without a title do uſurp the office of teachers ought notwithſtanding to be both heard and obſerved; but it is anſwered, 1. That it neither appeareth from the words nor yet from any other Record, that the Scribes and Phariſees did by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare, as by <hi>Moſes</hi> chair is only underſtood the Office of teaching, reſolving and judging according to <hi>Moſes</hi> law, to which although the Levites were appropriate, yet is there is no ſuch determination thereanent in the Word of God, as can by any manner of inference reject the Scribes &amp; Phariſees as intruders, ſo it is more preſuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (that, ſeeing our Lord in that long Legend of evils &amp; woes pronounced againſt them, doth not in the leaſt charge them with Intruſion, but rather acknowledge their Vocation by calling them the Builders) they had thereto lawfully attained. 2. As our Lords Words bear no command for the People to hear, but only to obſerve and do what they heard, rather ſuppoſing then allowing that, which though for the time he endeavoured to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to the beſt advantage, yet afterwards he intended not only to reform but utterly to abolish, &amp; therefore
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64759:97"/>
cannot in reaſon infer a command &amp; duty to hear the Curates; ſo neither our Lords tolerance in this caſe can ſo much as infer it's lawfulneſs, except the caſes were duely ſtated &amp; compared, which if any will rationally do, by firſt ſuppoſing that the Scribes and Phariſees had then lately by groſs Perjury and Violence thruſt out the Lords Teachers &amp; intruded themſelves into the Office, we are bold to affirm that our greateſt adverſaries dare not in this caſe aſſert, that our Lord would ſo much as in the like words here uſed have inſinuat a ſimple toleratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p n="13">13. Hitherto we have only obſerved the progreſs of theſe Acts that directly tend to the overthrow of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and the erecting of Prelacy, but as by the vileſt of Flatteries and moſt preſumptuous of Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Soveraignity is puffed up and exalted to that Supremacy, which is the neceſſary &amp; only foundation of Prelacy; So it is no wonder if both in the righteous Judgement of God, and through the influence of this wicked Prelacy, the ſtay of lawful Authority become a yoke of Tyranny, and that theſe Prelates, who make an abſolute ſurrender of Religion, Conſcience &amp; all Sacred Concernments, for the gratifying, and to the arbitriment of theſe Powers whoſe Creatures they have often Atheiſtically acknowledged themſelves to be, do with the ſame and greater profuſion ſubject both Laws, Liberties and the Fortunes of others, to the luſt of the ſame Powers, which they may ſo eaſily pervert unto their own eſtablishment and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And this indeed is and hath alwayes been that great aggravation of our later Prelacy, rendring the ſame worſe and more intolerable: then the Romish Hierarchy, which being wholly dependent upon the Pope, another and diſtinct head, and not upon the Civil Power, whoſe intereſts are oftentimes not only

            <p>We shall not here repeat theſe Acts whereby for the better and more eaſy eſtablishment of Prelacy then deſigned, this Parliament for it's firſt work under pretence of vindicating &amp; declaring the Kings Juſt Right and Prerogative, did in effect wholly corrupt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novate the well tempered and firm conſtitution of our Ancient Government, which both all our Ancient Hiſtories and Records, the only evidence whereby fundamental Laws are verifiable, do ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and the long continuance and endurance thereof, excellently commend. The firſt thing that thereafter occurs, is that Act and offer of fourty thouſand pounds Sterling to the King yearly during his life, whereby in place of that relaxation from theſe burdens which the iniquity of Uſurpers had only from time to time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, a laſting and perpetual Impoſition, by it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance fully exequating the exceſs of the former, is entaild upon us, and that for no other end then the complementing of a few Favourites of Prelacy, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64759:98"/>
the maintaining of a Military Force over us, for their &amp; the Prelates ſecurity, &amp; the perſecution &amp; ſlavery of the body of the people oppoſite thereto. The 2. thing is that rigid, irregular &amp; exorbitant Fining which we have already mentioned, clearly &amp; unqueſtionably carried on &amp; executed, by the ſame Authors &amp; for the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The 3. thing is that <hi>humble tender</hi> made to the King <hi>of our duty and loyalty,</hi> wherby <hi>in recognizance of the Kings prerogative, and in a further acknowledgement of our duty,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> by the 25. <hi>Act, Seſsion</hi> 3. do ſubject the Perſons, Fortunes and whole ſtrength of the Kingdom to the Kings pleaſure and arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that <hi>humble</hi> (indeed, but alſo blind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderat) <hi>offer of</hi> 20000 <hi>foot Men, and</hi> 2000 <hi>Horſmen ſufficiently armed with</hi> 40 <hi>dayes Proviſion, to be ready upon the Kings call to march to any part of his Dominions for oppoſing whatſoever Invaſion or Inſurrection or for any other ſervice:</hi> Which offer, though poſſibly many do account it but a voluntary and cheerful expreſſion of that readineſs, which our Anceſtors have often witneſſed for the defence of King and Country; yet in effect, if duely conſidered as concluded under the force of a Statute &amp; Act of Parliament, in place of that willingneſs and readineſs alleadged, whereunto our Anceſtors were from time to time determined, by theſe viſible and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent exigencies of the common concernment which did require it, it will be found no other thing, then an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite and ſlavish Emancipation of our lives and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, to the arbitrement of the Powers, coloured with the pretext of loyall devotion to lawful Authority. But whatever is herein exorbitant, is without queſtion the proper effect and product of the jealouſy of theſe Apoſtate Prelates, whom the inward diſquiet of an evill conſcience, cauſeth to apprehend terror round
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64759:99"/>
about. The 4. thing, wherein this wicked prelacy hath perverted the Ancient and well conſtitute Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Realm, is their procuring, erecting, and exercing the High Commiſſion Court, (without ſo much as the approbation of that Parliament wherein nothing would have been refuſed them, wherein not only Eccleſiaſtick and Civil Juriſdiction are abſurdly confounded, in impowering ſecular perſons to ſuſpend and depoſe, and pretended Church-men and Miniſters to fine, confine and incarcerate, but the <hi>Act.</hi> 131. <hi>Parl.</hi> 8. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. diſcharging all New Courts not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Parliament, directly thereby contraveened; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the Catholicon of the Kings omnipotent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative ſalve this breach, in reſpect the ſame Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, now in ſo great vigour, was by the 129 Act of this ſame 8 <hi>Parl Iae.</hi> 6. and almoſt immediatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Act alleadged, then alſo recently enacted.

The 5. thing which offers, is the accumulation and in effect the ſuppreſſion of the ordinary Offices of State (the very ſtay and props of regular Government, and the conduits and channells whereby it's refreshing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences are diffuſed) with, and by an extraordinar and ſuperlative power and Office in the ſingle perſon of the Kings Commiſſioner.

lawfully alienate his Crown: Which devices are all the inventions of theſe wicked Prelates, who knowing that if the King should either hear, ſee or act, but by ſuch ears, eyes, &amp; hands as they do aſſigne unto him, their affairs could not long proſper, do by ſuch exorbitancies endeavour the eſtablishment of their own Tyranny. The 6. thing that occurs is not only the keeping up of a Military Force to the intolerable burden and ſlavery of this free Nation, in ſo far as the ordinary and civil manner of Legal Execution, ſpecially for Fines and Eccleſiaſtical Delinquencies is now committed to, and managed by Military Force and Violence, and thereby the manner of exacting often times rendered more hard and inſupportable then the exaction it ſelf; but alſo that for ſatisfying the reſtleſs jealouſies and endleſs fears of the evil conſciences of theſe Apoſtate Prelates, more and greater forces under the vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Forraign fears, which both the then condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and poſture of theſe Wars, the dis-proportion of the Forces themſelves, and the diſpoſal of ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were leavyed did clearly redargue, have been lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed, and are kept on foot, for maintaining whereof the Publick Revenues are mis-applyed, the Fines, when by the Kings favour long delayed, at length ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted and expended, new Taxations impoſed, far exceeding the quantity of any formerly required, and at length the old Aſſeſsment the great grievance of the late Uſurpation of new ſuperadded, and the poor Country and body of the Land in it's greateſt poverty ſubjected unto, oppreſſed and harraſſed by more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious extortions then ever the Conquering ſword of an Forraign Enemy did heretofore, or can probably li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe: And all theſe things clearly intended and carryed on for no other end then the ſupport of this wicked
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64759:100"/>
Prelacy, and it's cruel Bondage and Spiritual Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. We need not mention for an aggravation of theſe violences, that theſe Forces were leavyed by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate procurement of the Perfidious Prelates, without the advice of the King's Council, (ever from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, what ever may be the preſent exaltation of Prerogative, reputed to be one with the King, and who both by Place and Intereſt are therein indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly concerned) ſeing it is not the leaſt of the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and calamities of theſe times, that the poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and it's greateſt Concernments are by them ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandoned. But this we muſt take notice of, that though our Adverſaries, by reaſon of the diſaſtrous Events that lately have happened, do now boaſt of a moſt ſpecial Providence and fore-ſight in all theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; yet it would be more juſt and rational on their part, to acknowledge that as oppreſſion doth even make a wiſe man mad, ſo to ſee a free Nation, by the Perfidy and Inſolent Domineering of a few up-ſtart Prelates, and the violence of their wicked and ſlavish Favourites, reduced to the condition of a moſt inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable and unnatural Conqueſt, both was, is, and ever will be a moſt juſt cauſe and provocation to all ingenuous Spirits and true Patriots, to undertake the aſſerting of their own Liberty, upon the greateſt hazard.</p>
            <p>Having thus truly and fully repreſented the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prerogative and Prelacy, over and above all things Divine and Humane, Sacred or Profane, we shall briefly adde the bitter and cruel fruits and effects of this ſinful and woful Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the Laws above mentioned, enacted for the overthrow of Presbytery and the Reſtauration of this accurſed Prelacy, ſpecially in ſo far as concerns the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64759:100"/>
Miniſtry, were and are ſuch as did inevitably infer, either a ſinfull complyance with that Perjury and Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy whereby they were framed, or the endurance of the pains and ſufferings thereto ſubjoyned; ſo almoſt the whole faithful Miniſters, are thereby firſt and laſt not only deprived of their benefices and livelyhood, ejected out of their reſpective Parishes, and by immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent &amp; viſible force incapacitated from the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, but ſome of them are Banished, others Confined, and the remnant reduced to ſuch ſtraits, fears and uncertainties as we have before repreſented. Then might we have ſeen the shepherds ſmitten, and their flocks ſcattered, our teachers removed into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the Lords Vineyard and Sanctuary laid moſt deſolate: ſo that in ſome whole Countreyes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces no preaching was to be heard; nor could the Lords day be otherwiſe known, then by the ſorrowfull remembrance of theſe bleſſed enjoyments whereof now we are deprived. Oh! though we had not the zeal &amp; courage of our Anceſtors, to have ſet our ſelves for the defence of the Goſpel, and the maintenance of the Lords Miniſters and Ordinances, of which we were ſo perfidiouſly and violently ſpoiled, yet that at leaſt we had remembered, by Prayer and Supplication to God, in the dayes of our afflictions and of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, all the pleaſant things that we had in the dayes of old.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As this Antichriſtian ſpirit did at the firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelfe, in that height and rage of Prophanity and all Exceſs, which ſuddenly overſpread the Land, and did very powerfully and evidently usher in the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prelats; ſo the ſame hath been ever ſince by them not only tolerated, but greatly countenanced and encouraged. We do not here mention their groſs and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64759:101"/>
wicked Toleration of Popery, whereby in thir few years it hath increaſed to a greater hight then ever it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at any time in this Land ſince the Reformation, &amp; that though it hath, &amp; doth appear in that daring confidence, as in its avowed idolatrous Maſſes and ſeminary Prieſts amongſt us, to contemn and deſpiſe theſe ancient and ſtanding Laws whereby ſuch things are often and ſeverely prohibited under the pain of death, yet to this day never one hath been publickly queſtioned and charged upon that account. The thing moſtly to be noticed is, that the only grievance and eyeſore of Prelates is Conſcience and any meaſure of Tenderneſs therein; Thence is it that the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and peaceable Forbearance in not bearing Curates and the like, have been perſecute with all rigor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Adulteries, Blaſphemies, Swearing and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are ſo far from being punished or reſtrained, that the Committers thereof are now only the perſons moſt in fashion and favour; yea it hath been known and can be inſtanced that perſons conveened, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, as diſaffected, have either upon the diſcovery or information of their Profanity and diſſoluteneſs, been inſtantly and freely diſmiſſed. Oh that men and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do ſo litle remember our Lords own rule to judge and diſcern falſe prophets by their fruits, whereby he hath expreſly ſaid that we shall know them, and that men are ſo far blinded and bewitched, as not to ſee the mighty working of Sathan in this Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, endeavouring under a meer shaddow and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Formality, to root out the Power and Life of Religion and Conſcience, and to reduce this poor Church unto that <hi>Laodicean</hi> luke-warmneſs more deſperate and incurable then coldneſs and death it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:64759:101"/>3. The faithful Miniſters being outed, and the hedge of Presbyterian Government removed, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity and wickedneſs doth yet more abound, ſo there came out of this ſmoak, Locuſts upon our Church, even a crue of Curates for Inſufficiency, Vanity, Lies, and Prophanity, the very Scorn of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation &amp; Scandal of Religion. We need not here adduce particular inſtances, there is none who in the leaſt obſerve their doctrine and maner of converſation but will eaſily acknowledge it: And the certainty of what we here affirm is ſo obvious unto all, that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular condeſcendence would either prove an infinite labour, or too much abridge the extent of ſo ſad a truth. Its true there are ſome who being convinced, and others who ſuppoſing the truth of what is here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, do either doubt or deny theſe; things to be the proper effects of Prelacy, but rather of the licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, and ſuch accidents which may be incident to the beſt conſtitutions: But if it be conſidered, 1. That that thing which inſeparably and infallibly attends ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may with more then ordinary probability be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to depend thereon by a certain influence: 2. That that which is no Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, but the viſible product of the Devils malice and mens pride and luſt, can never be effectual for the eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Truth, or promoting of Holineſs. 3. That ſuch who not only diſcover in themſelves the foreſaid evils, but by open and moſt notorious Perjury do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp and invade and hold the Offices they pretend to, muſt of neceſſity hate the light becauſe their deeds are evil; it will be very eaſily granted that Prelacy, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and their dependants, to whom all theſe things are clearly applicable, are not only the proper cauſes and authors of all the Prophanity and Wickedneſs under
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64759:102"/>
which this poor Land now perisheth; but moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally introductive unto all theſe Superſtitions and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, wherein the Devill by the ſame means did, and hath involved the Chriſtian World under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Papacy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Prelates and Curates being thus eſtablished, from the ground and warrant of the Acts mentioned, ſeveral Proclamations and Edicts, for the more effectual execution thereof and preſſing conformity thereunto, &amp; for the ſuppreſſing conſcientious adherence to, or (ſo much as is poſſible) the very remembrance of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Engagements and Covenants, and the holy Miniſtry and Government therein contained, are emitted and published. We have already mentioned that at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and theſe others to the ſame purpoſe which did enſue upon it. The firſt what we here note is, that the Prelates conceaving that their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions already practized and to be practized, might excite the compaſſion of ſome to a charitable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the afflicted; more to expreſs their cruel malice then really to hinder that, which at beſt is not worth the noticing, under the pretext of <hi>Diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then thereafter there is another Edict published againſt <hi>unwarrantable Preaching, Praying, or Hearing,</hi> whereby even ſuch Exerciſes, without which the Communion of Saints can hardly be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, are reſtrained &amp; diſcharged; in ſo much, that if a faithful outed Miniſter should repair to any private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or two or three moe then the Domeſticks of one Houſe be found together, though only imployed in the moſt Chriſtian &amp; edifying Exerciſes of Praying, Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing or Godly Conference, their meeting is declared an <hi>unlawfull Conventicle,</hi> and all ſuch as are acceſſory, punishable accordingly. By a fourth Proclamation, men are required <hi>to be aſsiſtent to, and concur with the Curates in the exerciſe of Diſcipline, as they shall be thereto called,</hi> though they be not told either by what warrant, or in what capacity they are to meddle in the Matters of God; for our Adverſaries do both diſown Elders, &amp; allow Deacons no rule. There is a fifth Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <hi>diſcharging all Conventions &amp; meetings whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver under the pretence of Religion, which are not allowed by Authority, certifying all perſons acceſſory, that they shall be looked upon and punished by pecuniary and corporall pains, as ſeditions perſons, at the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Council, and eſpecially that the Miniſters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing therein, and their reſetters or countenancers in any ſort, shall be liable unto the higheſt pains due to ſeditious Perſons.</hi> And laſtly, there is a ſixt, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding

We shal find men ſentenced not only to Banishment, but to Deportation and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, <hi>viz.</hi> to be carried to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where, being poor men and not able to redeem their Liberty, they muſt undoubtedly be ſold; a punishment, which not only the diſproportion of their delinquencies, but the whole tenor of our Laws, and the undoubted Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtianity, doth reprobate and condemn. Theſe things duely conſidered and compared, it will be more then evident, that our Oppreſſions and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances by reaſon of this Court alone, do far exceed all the preſſures and injuries of that <hi>Spanish Inquiſition,</hi> whereupon the <hi>United Provinces</hi> have juſtified and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their revolt from under the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to all Proteſtant States and Churches.</p>

               </gap>ious Fatuous perſon, who was there looſe: An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity ſo great, unuſual and inſolent, that although He had behaved himſelf not only rudely in his demeanor, (which is the worſt that his Adverſaries can charge him with) but had been moſt flagitious in his life; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that Spirit of Spite and Rebellion that rageth Apoſtats, could prompt Chriſtians to inflict upon one, who had ever carried ſo much as the Title of a Miniſter. But becauſe the open Iron-grate, whereby this <hi>Hole</hi> is shut, gave too great acceſs to the charity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of many perſons who came to viſit him, he is therefore upon the third day thereafter carried up to the <hi>Iron-houſe</hi> within the <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as they did thus ſentence a Miniſter for Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing, ſo the ſame Court having conveened before them an honeſt private man . . . <hi>Black,</hi> for being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at an alleaged Conventicle, but in effect, at the meeting of a few Chriſtians for praying and hearing the Lord's Word, without ſo much as any other offence pretended; becauſe, according to the example and warrant of the Primitive Chriſtians, he refuſed to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64759:107"/>
give His Oath, &amp; thereupon to delate the names of ſuch as he knew to have been preſent, and becauſe he was not liberall in giving <hi>St Andrewes</hi> his titles, the <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> ordaineth him to be ſcourged thorow the Town; although it was well known to the Court, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation could give very ſmall evidence, and they were convinced, that his refuſal did not flow from contempt of the King's Authority, but meerly and purely from ſcruple of Conſcience. Theſe are a few inſtances of many particulars of this kind which might be alleaged, whereof there is no corner in the whole Countrey, nor Parish almoſt in the Weſt, which cannot give evidence; and therefore we do remitt any more ample confirmation of theſe things, until we have noted a few moe particulars for clearing thereof.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As we have obſerved the Wickedneſs of theſe Eccleſiaſtick Laws, and the iniquity and irregularity of the Act of Fining, and the introducing of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Military Force; (a ſervitude unheard of and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable in any free Nation) ſo the evils and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereof can ſcarcely be numbered. For 1. Upon pretence of that Proclamation, commanding People to keep their Parish-Churches, and prohibiting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to any other, except in caſe of vacancy under the pain of 20 shillings Scots <hi>toties quoties,</hi> the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours being diſpoſed upon, to ſuch places which are known to be moſt averſe from this courſe of Apoſtacy, lying at catch for their own advantage, have often taken the opportunity, where there was but one Church in the bounds ſtill enjoying a faithfull Miniſter, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vacancies about, to go and beſet that Church in the time of Divine Worship to the profane diſturbance thereof: And thereafter either to cauſe call ſome old roll of the Parishioners, and exact the Fine of twenty
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64759:107"/>
shillings Scots of all others without exception, or reſpect even to the licence contained in the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf in caſe of vacancy, or to require an Oath of every perſon to know to what Parish they belong, and that at the Church door without permitting them to come forth, until they either give their Oath or pay the Fine, not only with ſuch curſing, ſwearing and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as would make Infidels amazed to ſee the Lords day ſo profaned, by Chriſtians profeſſing the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith; but with ſuch rigor, by taking by force the Bibles or garments from ſome poor perſons, who have not wherewith to pay, and inſolent beating and wounding of others to the effuſion of blood, as may juſtify the greateſt Barbarity. We need not inſtance particulars in a truth ſo univerſally known. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to another kind of this ſame violence, practiſed in other places where Curates are planted; who, to force and compel the people to that complyance with their Miniſtry, which in conſcience they are bound to abhor, cauſe form liſts or rolls of ſuch as keep not the Church, and calling them after ſermon, both Men and Women by Name and Surname, they amerciate the abſents in ſuch ſumms and Fines as they pleaſe, &amp; for the moſt part, far exceeding the pains contained in the Act of Parliament; whereupon the Souldiours are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly warranted to go and exact the ſame by quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering. Which Practice is not more unjuſt in it's illegal and ſummar procedor, then rigid and exorbitant; both as to the quantity and the maner of exacting it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their riding and quartering - money (which is therewith exacted) and the other inconveniences which inſeparably attend the rapine and violence of profane ſouldiours. 3. In many places, not contented thus to Fine and Exact, the ſouldiours, on the Lords day, go to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64759:108"/>
private houſes, and by plain force compel and drive to the Church all ſuch as they find, and oftentimes do inſolently beat and abuſe perſons who by reaſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity or ſickneſs are really unable: A practiſe ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and abſurd, that ſome of themſelves have ſaid, it was our Lord's way to drive buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, but not to drive them into it. 4. As to the exacting and levying of the Parliaments Fines, the ſame was done (by a reference of the <hi>Councill</hi> to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,</hi> and his orders thereon) in ſuch an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and exorbitant manner as cannot be paralelled. For 1. Parties of horſe being directed to ſeveral Shires, when a party arrived in any Shire, they direct their order to all the perſons therein Fined, intimating to them and every one of them to pay their reſpective Fines, with three shillings ſterling <hi>per diem</hi> for every horſe-man in the party, from the day and date of their Order until the Fine be payed, and the payment ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the commander of the Party: By which extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, many have been compelled to pay more for Quartering then the ſumme and quantity of their Fine; and during the time of theſe oppreſſions, many have computed that the Sherifdoms of <hi>Air</hi> &amp; <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>frew,</hi> were compelled to pay upon the accompt of Quarterings, over and above the Fines, betwixt two and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand merks Scots <hi>per diem.</hi> 2. There was no defence nor exemption allowed againſt theſe Quarterings; for whether the perſon fined did liberat himſelf by taking the <hi>Declaration,</hi> or that it was alleaged that he was Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or an Infant, or never Charged, or that his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor charged was ſince Deceaſed, or that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor was never Charged, yea Died before he was fined, or that the perſon quartered on was only Relict of the perſon fined (a poor Widow living upon a mean
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64759:108"/>
Joincture) or that the perſon quartered on had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the perſon fined, ſave that he lived in the houſe and place which once pertained to him, and which this perſon lawfully Purchaſed, even before the other was fined; Yet all was repelled, and no complaint of this rigor and violence could be heard or receaved; but on the contrary the complainer (eſpecially if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take the <hi>Declaration</hi>) was rejected with moſt inſolent reproaches and menaces. 3. That both in the up-lifting of the Fine and exacting of the Qwarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the extremity of rigor was uſed, by dragging ſome to priſon, who either were known altogether indigent and inſolvent, or did offer to renounce the Benefit of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Indemnity</hi> (the forfaulture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was the alternative and utmoſt certification for not payment of the Fine, contained in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>) or by Plundering, Beating, and Spoiling others without poſſibility of redreſs. We need not adduce Particular Inſtances for the verification of theſe things, ſeing they were not done in a corner: But the cry of this violence as it filled the whole Land; ſo no doubt it alſo reached unto the very Heavens, and is entered in to the ears of Him <hi>who hateth violence and loveth righteouſneſs, who ſaith unto Princes, remove vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſpoil, and execute judgement and juſtice, take away your exactions from my people.</hi> One thing mainly to be conſidered is, that as Prelacy is the great cauſe of all the Sin and Miſery that afflicteth us; ſo was it by the inſtigation of the ſame wicked Apoſtats, that theſe Fines ſo long delayed were thus at length rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly exacted: And that for no other purpoſe, then the leavying of moe Forces for their ſecurity and ſupport, and the better ſtrengthening of their Tyranny. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were it not of the Lord, who, becauſe of our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64759:109"/>
contempt of his glorious Goſpel, and bleſſed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, hath plagued us with ſtupidity, and ſmitten us with madneſs, blindneſs and aſtonishment of heart, to give unto us the reward of our own hands, and to cauſe us to eat the fruit of our doings, it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that rational men after the feeling of ſo ſore griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and the teaching of ſo many and ſad experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, should ſtill couch under the burthen and ſubmitt themſelves to the yoke of a few inſignificant Apoſtate Upſtarts, and not rather acquit themſelves like men, by pulling off theſe vizards of Religion, under which they mask their villanies, and plucking them out of that Sanctuary and great refuge of Loyalty, which they do not more pretend then profane by all their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Rebellion againſt God, and their cruell Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of His faithfull Servants and the Kings true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which they palliat under this pretext; to the effect that in the righteous and deſerved Punishment of theſe wicked men, both the ſin and Backſliding of the Land might be ſiſted, and the fierce anger of the Lord averted.</p>
            <p>This is the wickedneſs and violence of accurſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, which though it hath diffuſed it ſelf over the whole Land, and left no corner thereof untouched, yet as the <hi>Weſt</hi> hath been more grievouſly thereby op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and afflicted, ſo poor <hi>Galloway</hi> in a manner hath been the point in which all it's malice and Tyranny hath been concentred. We need not here ſearch after Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, or be curious for the verification thereof; the cries and groans of that afflicted Countrey have filled all mens ears, and the deſolations thereof are obvious to every ones eyes: Nor need we inſiſt to purge their innocency or clear the cauſes of their ſufferings, which were no other then their adherence to their faithfull
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64759:109"/>
Miniſters (though caſten out and rejected by men, yet continuing through the grace of God, to preach amongſt them) and their deteſtation of a crue of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Curates (ſcatterers and devourers, not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the flock) thruſt in amongſt them more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently then upon any other part of the Countrey. The thing we have here to obſerve is, that the manner of their perſecution was firſt and laſt by plain <hi>Hoſtile In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion.</hi> After which maner <hi>Sir Iames Turner</hi> with his Forces (having twice before been amongſt them) in <hi>March</hi> 1666, with greater power and fury then ever formerly, marcheth againſt them: where being arrived, what exactions, oppreſſions and inſolencies, he and his forces committed by arbitrary fining, plundering, quartering, impriſoning, beating, wounding, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men like beaſts, chaſing to moors and mountains, and by haraſſing and laying both Parishes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-ſides almoſt wholly deſolate; the ruine and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of ſeveral hundreds of families, and the impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verishing and great diſtreſs of many others do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtify: And yet after all theſe atrocious inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by the contrivance and authority of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Galloway,</hi> (who ſometimes appeared ſo zealous for the Covenant and Work of God, that, frequently in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to the People of his own Parish, while he was a private Miniſter, when they were ſett at Table and ready to Participate, he cauſed them to renew the Oath of the Covenant, ſubjoining thereto both that ſolemnity and theſe words uſed by <hi>Nehemia,</hi> Chap. 5.13. when in the like caſe <hi>he did shake his lap, and ſaid, ſo God ſhake out every man from his houſe and from his labor, that performeth not this promiſe, even thus be he ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64759:110"/>
out and emptied</hi>) by the preſcription, we ſay, of the ſame <hi>Bishop</hi> and his Synod, theſe poor oppreſſed people, after all theſe exactions, are urged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſubſcribe an acknowledgement that <hi>Sir Iames had uſed them civilly and diſcreetly</hi>; whereby they were forced not only to deny common ſenſe, and lay aſide their juſt reſentments, but by this their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription (which might be oppoſed to all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints) they were virtually excluded from all hope of redreſs. All which things are not only confirmed by the notoriety of the matter of fact, but are alſo by that grievous and mournfull Paper of their ſufferings, moſt amply cleared and inſtructed. To which though <hi>Sir Iames</hi> hath made an anſwer for his own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſeeing the ſame doth for the moſt part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in a ſimple denyall (which it was eaſy for him to make, having neither accuſer nor contradicter) and he at moſt giveth only an account of, &amp; vindicateth his orders, without ſo much as denying the exceſs, that might have enſued in that military way of execution, (expreſsly waving to anſwer the extortions of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which were commiſſionated for civill Fines) any further reply were ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>This poor people having continued and lyen under all theſe miſeries, for the ſpace of ſeven moneths and upward after <hi>Sir Iames</hi> his third Invaſion, and thereby witneſſed not only their very firm &amp; Chriſtian Patience towards God; but alſo given a greater teſtimony of their loyally and ſubmiſſion to the King's commands, then all the flattering and flaunting profeſſions of theſe their adverſaries (who rather then to ſuffer the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred part of theſe hardships, would curſe both God and their King) will amount to: And knowing by ſad
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64759:110"/>
experience, that both Separat Petitioning had been by <hi>Sir Iames</hi> inſolently rejected, &amp; that Joint Petitioning was by Act of Parliament condemned, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all hope this way being cut off, upon an very Accidental &amp; Indeliberat Occaſion, they were ſtirred up and gave the riſe to the actions and commotions following; which was thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir Iames</hi> ſtill breathing forth perſecutions, upon the 13 of <hi>November</hi> laſt, ordereth four ſouldiours, from <hi>Dumfreis</hi> to the Parish of <hi>Dalray</hi> in <hi>Galloway,</hi> to poind a poor old man's goods; and in caſe they should find none, to ſeiſe and apprehend his perſon, and bring him priſoner to <hi>Dumfries.</hi> The ſouldiours in proſecution of this order, apprehending the old innocent man, bind him hand and foot like a beaſt, and lay him bound upon the ground, ready to be carried along. When two or three of his neighbours, commoyed with ſo great an indignity, come and deſire the ſouldiours to looſe him, they, in ſtead of ſatisfying their deſire, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſault the Countrey-men with their ſwords drawn, and neceſſitat them to their own defence: Whereupon one of the ſouldiours being wounded, the other three throw down their Arms, and the poor man is relieved, The Countreymen, having thus accquited themſelves againſt theſe firſt aggreſſors, in proſecution of their own neceſſary defence, againſt the violence of 10 or 12 more ſouldiours, who were oppreſſing in the ſame Parish, (whom now they had greater cauſe to fear then be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore) upon the morrow thereafter, with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of 6 or 7 whom they joined to themſelves, they quietly ſeiſe upon and ſecure them, all of them render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Arms, except one who was killed in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. After this, the Countrey being a little hereby alarmed, but moſt of all determined by their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64759:111"/>
former ſad experience, that <hi>Sir James</hi> would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avenge himſelf of this affront, upon the whole Countrey without diſtinction of free and unfree, and that in fury and rage, as far exceeding his former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, as the cauſe was different, they gather to the number 54 Horſemen with ſome few Footmen, and inſtantly reſolving upon it, they march towards <hi>Dumfreis</hi>; where upon the 15 of <hi>November</hi> they take <hi>Sir James</hi> priſoner, and diſarm the Souldiours that were with him without harm or violence to any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the wounding of one man who made more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate reſiſtance. Being thus by the over-ruling hand of Divine Providence, and the force of irreſiſtible neceſſity, more then by any human contrivance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a buſineſs of this importance beyond all hope of retreat; and conſidering how many in the <hi>Weſt</hi> and els-where, did groan under the yoke of this wicked Prelacy, and did ſuffer by their Tyranny, whom the juſt apprehenſion of that rigour and cruelty, to which the report of what had hapned would enrage the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries againſt all without diſtinction, might perſuade yea neceſſitat to a conjunction, they from <hi>Dumfreis</hi> move towards the <hi>Weſt.</hi> In the mean time, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port being brought to the <hi>Council,</hi> the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding and over-ruling in it, Lieut. General <hi>Dalzel</hi> is immediatly ordered to march with all the Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Glaſgow</hi>; which accordingly was done, with more haſt, rage and fury, then if 10000 Infidels had with fire and ſword invaded the Land: And a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is emitted againſt the <hi>Rebels</hi> (as they called them) riſen in Arms in <hi>Galloway, Air,</hi> and other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> (when as at this time there were not 40 Men in the Sherifdom of <hi>Air,</hi> who had joyned with

them) declaring <hi>this Inſurrection to be manifeſt and horrid Rebellion, and therefore charging the perſons acceſſary, to lay down Arms within</hi> 24 <hi>hours after pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blication,</hi> without any aſſurance of Indemnity offered, and laſtly, <hi>commanding the whole Subjects to be aſsiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lieutenant General, and being requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him or others in Authority, to riſe in Arms, and aſsiſt with all their Power, under the Pain of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi> A Proclamation ſo full of fury and madneſs, not only rendering ſuch as were in Arms deſperate without hope, except in the cruel mercy of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prelates; But alſo engaging all without diſtinction, either Actively to concur to the deſtroying of theſe poor, innocent and afflicted People, or els to prepare themſelves for ſuffering the ſame pains and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it may juſtly be wondered at, that even the ſingle motive of this Proclamation, did not procure, to theſe <hi>Galloway</hi>-men, a greater concourſe.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64759:112"/>
               <hi>Weſt-land</hi> mens Grievances, theſe poor men not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding eight or nine hundreds, and extremly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and ſpent by ſore travail and watching, and moſtly by their faſting and great abſtinence, are (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Holy, Wiſe and determinate Counſel of God) a litle after ſun-ſet routed and diſſipated. The number of the ſlain on both ſides were reckoned, about 40 and upwards of the <hi>Weſtland men,</hi> and 4 or 5 of the Generals Forces. The number of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was greater, amounting in all to 130 and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: But, becauſe the threed of this ſtory hath precipitated our Narration to this fatal period, the obſervations following will ſupply what is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That theſe men who roſe in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> were not only (for the moſt part) perſons of known and very exemplar integrity, piety and zeal for God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all of them (ſeverally and jointly) ſo far from baſe and turbulent deſignes, that they cannot be ſupponed by any who know them, to have been Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of either Rule or Riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo did with the ſame ſtraightneſs and ſincerity, in all parts declare, that their only Motives were the rigor of extreme Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, which conſtrained them to the defence of Religion and Liberty, and the Conſcience of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible duty, vve all owe to God &amp; one to another, in the bond of the Holy Covenant; and in the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of a moſt harmleſs deportment, did fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves to theſe profeſſions: ſo that it may truly be affirmed, that a company of more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, upright and harmleſs men, did never in any age appear in ſuch a poſture. Which as it doth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appear, in their ſparing and civil uſage of <hi>Sir Iames Turner,</hi> and their great abſtinence and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64759:113"/>
moderation in all places, not only from Plunder and ſuch inſolencies, but even from the neceſſary means of Subſiſtence; ſo it is a truth ſo certain, that all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (ſave a few profane Curates, who ſpare no lies whereby they may vent their malice) muſt and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as in many places, there were many found who joined themſelves to the <hi>Lieut. General's</hi> Forces, to aſſiſt againſt and ſuppreſs that faithfull afflicted company; ſo the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (by order from the <hi>Secret Council</hi> to the <hi>Town-Council,</hi> and from the <hi>Town-Council</hi> to the ſeveral Captains, who did admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrate it to their reſpective Companies) did, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the ſame perſons, take the following Oath, viz. <hi>I ſhal be true and faithfull to the King, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Authority and maintain the ſame, againſt this Inſurrection and Rebellion, and any other that ſhall happen, with the hazard of my life and fortune</hi>; And the two <hi>Shires</hi> of Middle and Eaſt <hi>Lauthians</hi> did arm very readily againſt them: But whether this Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was in Rebellion againſt the King, or whether this Conjuration and theſe Practices, were not a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Conſpiracy and horrid Rebellion againſt the great God, a few reflections on what we have premiſed shall hereafter clear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That as only the force of Neceſſity, from the rigor of their perſecutions, and the cutting off of all liberty to Petition or hope of Redreſs, did compel the <hi>Weſt-land</hi> men to this courſe; ſo upon the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and moſt ſlender inſinuation of liberty to Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Grievances to theſe in Authority, they very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and readily embraced the opportunity, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64759:113"/>
to the <hi>Council,</hi> that the only evill under which the Land perisheth, is the Erecting of this wicked and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous <hi>Prelacy</hi> contrary to the Holy Covenant, and the cruel oppreſſion, both in Body &amp; Conſcience of all that deſire to continue Faithfull therein: but how they were abuſed in this offer and Tranſaction, we have before related.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That though the wicked Prelats (for the greater exaltation of their pride and triumph, both over God and his Cauſe) have boldly affirmed, that theſe men were by certain Faithfull Miniſters perſuaded and brought out, in the full aſſurance of moſt certain Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that their Cauſe was ſuch, that upon the Event they could venture their ſalvation; yet the contrary is moſt certainly known, &amp; that they came out, for the moſt part, moſt voluntarly and of their own accord; thinking it their duty (as one of them in his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony doth declare) to appear for and help the Lord againſt the mighty: And that, though they had and ſtill retain a moſt firm perſuaſion of the juſtice of the Lord's Cauſe and Covenant, and a very confident aſſurance that the Lord will ariſe and own it, to the utter confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of His adverſaries; Yet, knowing that Times and Seaſons are in the Lord's hand, and that the time hath already been, when ſuch <hi>who had indignation, and whoſe heart was againſt the holy Covenant did proſper, and by Arms pollute the Sanctuary of ſtrength, and place the Abomination that maketh deſolate, wherein, though the people that did know their God were ſtrong and did exploits, yet did they fall by the ſword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by ſpoil many dayes</hi>; Theſe men did neither limit the Holy One, nor bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64759:114"/>
their reſolution upon the aſſurance of future Events: Yea the fear and apprehenſion of theſe many viſible ſigns attending this Action, whereby the Lord's ſtanding controverſie and continuing diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Land, for fearfull breach of Covenant, and the many horrible ſins that have enſued (which then more then ever were diſcovered, both in the actuall oppoſition of many, and faint withdrawing of others, of whom better things were looked for) did juſtly make them conceave, that as the Lord, who hath ever glorified His own Name, would alſo now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it, both in their active and paſſive Teſtimony (a ſeal which His Work and Cauſe, hath not hitherto ſo viſibly had) And that they were rather thereto called, then to be the Lands <hi>Deliverers</hi>; for which, all that fear the Lord may think with trembling, greater judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are yet ordained.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That amongſt the many obſervable providences of God, whereby he brought this Action to it's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, their turning from <hi>Lanerk</hi> towards <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and leaving the <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſpecially theſe parts where many faithful men were preparing for a Conjunction, doth bear the very eminent characters of the Lord's Work and Purpoſe, which he hath ſince made manifeſt; and was the occaſion of the proſcribing of ſeveral both Miniſters and Gentlemen, as we shall hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That as the <hi>Louthian</hi>-men were very active in appearing againſt this faithfull company; ſo after the Conflict, they were very vigilant and inhumane to take and ſpoil all ſuch flyers as they rencountred: A ſin which no doubt, by reaſon of it's greater aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Lord will require with greater ſeverity,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64759:114"/>
then that of <hi>Edom, Obad.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who <hi>rejoyced over the children of Iudah in the day of their deſtruction; and laid hands on their ſubſtance in the day of their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, who ſtood in the croſs way to cut off ſuch as did eſcape, and delivered up theſe that did remain in the day of diſtreſs</hi>; and therefore he is threatened by the Lord, that <hi>for his violence againſt his brother, ſhame ſhould cover him, and he ſhould be cut off for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen the indignation of the Lord; in the moſt dreadful and aſtonishing of all judgements, even his ſuffering and cauſing the righteous to fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wicked, in delivering the ſoul of his turtle dove unto the multitude of the wicked; His Name unto reproach and blaſphemy, His Strength into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and His Glory into the enemies hands: A providence that may juſtly move our aſtonishment to a greater height then that of <hi>Ioſuah</hi> chap 7. v. 9. <hi>Oh Lord, what wilt thou do unto thy great Name?</hi> And how terrible are the charge and ſucceeding Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which theſe things do denounce? But the Lord who in wrath remembers mercy, maketh both judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mercy his peoples ſong; and it is to his enemies alone, that a cup without mixture is poured out; as the things which follow will declare.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arcbishop</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> having cauſed celebrat the report of this Victory, with almoſt as many Guns from the <hi>Caſtle</hi> as there were men ſlain in the fields, and as if the 40 had been 40000 Infidels, the priſoners are brought in, and ſecured. We cannot but here mention the ready and charitable relief, which many good people in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> did then extend to them;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64759:115"/>
certainly it is gone up for a Memorial before God, and shall have a return. But who can expreſs the malice of that Antichriſtian ſpirit, raging both in the <hi>Arch-Prelate</hi> and his dependents, which miſery it ſelf doth not ſatiate; and therefore they do ſo exclaim againſt this poor expreſſion of humanity, as prepoſterous and ſavouring of diſaffection, that even ſome of their own Complices did condemn them for it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Councill</hi> falling immediately to the examination of the Priſoners, they remitt firſt 10, thereafter 14 to the <hi>Iustices</hi> to be arraigned or rather condemned as Traitors, they having firſt determined and preſcribed the very maner of their execution: and about the ſame time the <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> going Weſt, with ſome others impowered for that effect, do likewiſe at <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow</hi> condemn other ſixteen. Theſe things we join together, becauſe both their Indictments, maner of Tryall, Doom and Execution were the ſame, except in ſo far as shall be noted. The Indictment and Charge of Treaſon exhibited againſt all, conſiſted of two heads and crimes, deduced from old and late Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and aggravated by many circumſtances, viz. <hi>riſing and gathering in Arms, and renewing the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant without and againſt the Kings Authority and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>: Every one's particular acceſſion was libelled from, and proven by his own confeſſion before the <hi>Council.</hi> This place might require a large digreſſion for anſwering the crimes objected, and clearing the innocency of the Lord's Witneſſes; but ſeing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Narration doth not only furnish all arguments thereto requiſite, but warranteth them by Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents beyond contradiction, it shall ſuffice now to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:64759:115"/>1. That God the Fountain of all Power, and Author of all Right, as, wherever he hath granted to any creature a Being, he hath alſo armed it with a love and power of <hi>Self-preſervation</hi> ſutable to it's capacity; ſo much more, where, unto a Being, He hath ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added a Right, as in all rationall creatures, which cannot be violated but both by Force and Injury, hath He granted both the Power and Right of <hi>Self-defence,</hi> which is really one and the ſame thing with it, and in effect nothing elſe but that divine Impreſs and rational Inſtinct, whereby the very courſe of Nature is uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſo inſeparable from the Being and Right of the creature, that it never ceaſeth, except where by the Soveraign Will and Law of God, the Right is firſt annulled and the Being may be deſtroyed. Which <hi>poſition,</hi> being the clear and true foundation of all Rule and Righteouſneſs, and even of the Being of all things, it may juſtly be wondered, that men should be found, who deny and would ſubvert it in it's firſt, principall and moſt immediate effects. But if accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereunto any will ſubſume and prove, that either by the Lord's ordaining of powers, or mens Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar and Submiſſion thereto, (made mainly for Self-preſervation,) the foreſaid Right and Power was or could be revoked or renounced, we shall moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quite the plea, and proſtitute our ſelves to all the violences that Tyranny can invent, ſince in that caſe there could be no Injury.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as all Societies, Governments and Lawes are appointed in a due Subordination to God and His ſuperior Will and Law, for His Glory and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good of the People, including the ſafety of every individual; ſo, if either this Subordination be noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly infringed, or theſe Ends intollerably pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64759:116"/>
the common tie of both Society, Government and Law, is in ſo far diſſolved. Hence is it that a King or Rulers commanding things directly contrary to the Law of God, may be and have been juſtly diſobeyed, and by fury or folly deſtroying or alienating the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may be and have been lawfully reſiſted. Theſe are concluſions which our greateſt Adverſaries cannot but admit, and are not deducible from any other premiſſes. Let us hear <hi>King Iames,</hi> whoſe loyalty none can doubt, in a ſpeech to the Parliament in the year 1609. he ſaith, <hi>a King degenerateth into a Tyrant when he leaveth to rule by Law, much more when he beginneth to invade his Subjects perſons, rights and liberties, to ſet up an arbitrary power, impoſe unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Taxes, raiſe forces, make war upon his Subjects, to pillage, plunder, waſt and ſpoil his Kingdomes.</hi> And leſt his inconſequence be ſuſpected, as if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, he would have a Tyrant incontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, it is upon the ſame grounds, that in his anſwer to <hi>Cardinal Perron,</hi> he juſtifyeth the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> their Defenſive Arms; Now how a diſcretive judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe caſes, both of unrighteous commands, and wicked violence, and ſpecially in the later, which is (by far) the more ſenſible, doth neceſſarily remain with the People, and in what maner the ſame is to be determined and cautioned, ſo as neither to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe diſobedience againſt Authority, nor create ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Common-wealth, is already fully clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That though all Soveraign Powers, (upon the ſuppoſition of theſe true and great ends, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of reaſon and charity, that the perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted do in like manner really intend them,) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64759:116"/>
indefinitly and therefore in appearance univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally without reſtriction; yet according to this known rule, that ſuch particulars, as if expreſſed, would not (far more if they cannot) be conſented to, are not underſtood to be compriſed under a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendence, ſuch exceptions and limitations as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly implyed and could not lawfully be expreſly renounced, do ſtand in full force. Whereupon alſo both the Righteouſneſs of God's judgements, and the Lawfullneſs of the Peoples Reſiſtance againſt mal-verſing Powers, are clearly and certainly founded.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That not only the light of Nature and undenya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reaſon together with the agreeable Practice of all Nations, ſpecially of our Anceſtors, do evidently clear theſe Principles propoſed, but alſo our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Statutes declaring the reveal'd Word and Will of God to be the Superior Rule and Law, and repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Acts repugnant thereto. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 3, 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. and explaining ſuch Acts as were generally made againſt unlawful Convocations and Leagues and Bonds among Subjects, to be underſtood with this due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and limitation <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 29. together with the King and Peoples Oaths of faithful Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and Alleadgeance: whereby the Coronation-Covenant and Contract, ſpecially that made with this King (the very bond of the Kingdom) is eſtablished and ſecured, do undoubtedly infer, beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that both our Government and Lawes are conſtituted and to be interpreted with <hi>ſubordination to the Law and Will of God,</hi> and in order to theſe great Ends of their eſtablishment.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That though prevailing Factions have in all times endeavoured, by their moſt exceſſive and boundleſs flatteries, to exalt and extend the Powers to an equal
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64759:117"/>
degree of abſoluteneſs in all Cauſes and over all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, meerly for their own baſe ends and private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; yet if any of theſe perſons would ſeriouſly conſider, and would ingenuouſly declare their opinion, in a particular application of the caſe to themſelves, what they would account lawfull for them to do either jointly or ſeparately, in caſe that they were injuriouſly and violently invaded to the deſtruction of their Lives or Fortunes, or the ſubverſion of their Families and deareſt and neareſt Concernments, their reſolution in this point would eaſily juſtify the practiſes of all ſuch, who, eſteeming the Glory of God and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of His Goſpel infinitely preferable to all other Intereſts whatſoever, do valiantly offer and expoſe themſelves for the vindication thereof, to the greateſt hazards.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That through the manifeſt and notorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the great Ends of Society and Government, the Bond thereof being diſſolved, the perſons, one or moe thus liberated therefrom, do relapſe into their primeve Liberty and Priviledge, and accordingly as the ſimilitude of their caſe and exigence of their cauſe doth require, may upon the very ſame principles again join and aſſociate for their better Defence &amp; Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they did at firſt enter into Societies.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That we being a Nation ſo ſolemnly and expreſly engaged by Covenant unto God, &amp; one with another, for the advancing and promoving of theſe holy and important Ends therein contained, there lyeth upon all and every one of us an indiſpenſible duty, by all poſſible means to promove the ſame, not only in our own conſcientious and exemplary walking, and ſerious admonition and exhortation towards others; but alſo in endeavouring (in caſe of Defection) a National
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64759:117"/>
Reformation, and valiant vindication of the Glory of God, and His Work and Cauſe, againſt all incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Apoſtates; as we would not not by conniving at their ſin be partakers of their Judgement, and as we would by deſtroying the <hi>accurſed</hi> from amongſt us, avert the imminent wrath of God from the whole Land and Nation. Which <hi>poſition</hi> as we clearly before aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, both from the Profeſſion and Practiſe of our firſt Reformers; ſo, that qualification in the Covenant, of <hi>our endeavours in our places and callings,</hi> is moſt agreeable thereto: ſeeing the ſame doth plainly import, that as every one is to confine himſelf to his own place and move in his own ſphere, while all in their reſpective capacities do harmoniouſly concurre in the ſame work and duty; ſo if any in higher place and imployment, do not only become remiſs and forgetful of the Oath of God; but, according to the extent and influence of their power, would ſeduce and corrupt their inferiors unto their Apoſtaſy, it is both their place to reſiſt ſuch wickedneſs and violence, and their calling to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour either the Reformation or Removal of theſe who prove ſo contrary to, and obſtructive of the ends whereunto they are ordained. Neither can this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence appear unwarranted or hard unto any who will impartially conſider, that though the ſame qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth in the like maner affect and define all duties whatſoever, which we owe either to God or our Countrey; yet it were moſt abſurd thence to infer, that if theſe more eminently intruſted should either turn directly Apoſtates and enemies to the Chriſtian Faith, or adverſaries and deſtroyers of the Common-wealth, the people of an inferior degree might not ſtep forward to occupy the places, and aſſert the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, which theſe wicked men had ſo traiterouſly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64759:118"/>
forfaulted and deſerted. All which muſt neceſſarily be granted, if it be but rightly conſidered, that as <hi>Order</hi> and the Obſervance thereof, is only a mean ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to, and intended for the Glory of God and the good of the people; ſo muſt all the Regulation and Determination thereof be only admitted, in ſo far as it is Conducible, and no wayes to render it Deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive or Repugnant to theſe great Ends of its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. From all which we clearly conclude that thir words in the Covenant <hi>of Places and Callings,</hi> are no more Reſtrictive in the caſes above mentioned, then a General's command to his ſouldiours entering in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel (being thus qualifyed) doth impede the neceſſity of Succeſſion (in caſe of the vacancy of any charge, either through death or deſertion) requiſit for the obtaining of the propoſed end of Victory; but that they are in effect (ſpecially the antecedent and ſubjoined words <hi>ſincerely, really and conſtantly, all the dayes of our life</hi> being conſidered) rather Exegetick and Ampliative.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That whatſoever Laws, Covenants and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſtanding and binding unto us, before this late fearful Apoſtacy and Defection, they are ſtill in the ſight of God, and in the Conſciences of all that fear His Name and mind his Glory, the rather more ſtrong and obligeing then in the leaſt infringed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved: It being impoſſible that ſuch Sacred Oaths (ſo ſolemnly ſworn unto the moſt High) and ſuch Righteous Laws by vertue thereof ſtatuted and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for the carrying on, and eſtablishment of the Work of God thereby intended, should be Ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Mutable at the pleaſure of men; ſpecially of ſuch, who, without regard of God, Conſcience, Honor or Honeſty, have, in the very pride and power
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64759:118"/>
of Wickedneſs, not only broken the Lords bands, caſten away His cords, and violently (under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of abuſed Authority) overturned his whole Work; but done deſpite againſt the ſame, both by ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Burning and Blaſpheming of the Lords holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And this <hi>Poſition Reſciſſory</hi> we oppoſe unto their great <hi>Act Reſciſsory,</hi> and to all Acts and practices of the like nature antecedent thereto, or dependent thereupon. Being fully perſwaded, that, though now they appear unequally ballanced, yet the Lord shall declare from heaven His Righteouſneſs, and laugh at His enemies Acts and Deviſes, and have them all in deriſion.</p>

            <p n="10">10. That the Glory of God and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Defence and Maintenance of the bleſſed Goſpel, and it's precious Miniſtry and Ordinances, are Duties &amp; Concernments infinitly more important, then the defence and preſervation of our Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the Common-wealth, againſt the moſt barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and horrid violences and injuries that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: Like-as, the violation and deſtruction of all theſe is ſo evidently deſigned, and wickedly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by this late and preſent Apoſtacy, that a clearer ground and cauſe of Self-defence and Reformation cannot poſſibly be ſuppoſed; ſo that to condeſcend to anſwer the peevish clamours of theſe Neutral and careleſs men, who ſay, <hi>what needeth all this noiſe for the extrinſick and arbitrary forms of Government and modes of VVorſhip, both with and without which, Religion and Righteouſneſſ have equally flourished and proſpered?</hi> where to shut our eyes from beholding the Glory and Grace of God, that in this Land hath ſo viſibly appeared in, and been advanced by this great Ordinance of PRESBYTERY, by Himſelf (for that end) appointed; and alſo from the obſerving of theſe deludges of Profanity, Wickedneſs, Superſtition and Violence, which the Devill, by his great engine of PRELACY, hath alwayes and in all Churches cauſed and procured.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That as ſuch was the State, Condition and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of this Church and Kingdom, at the time
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64759:119"/>
of the King's return, and before the re-erecting of this Prelacy, that all and every one of the Nation were moſt ſtrictly obliged <hi>ſincerely, really and conſtantly</hi> to have reſiſted and oppoſed this wicked Defection to the laſt drop of their blood; ſo the ſinfull complyance of many, and wofull fainting and withdrawing of others, might indeed incapacitat ſuch as remain faithful from the <hi>beſt,</hi> but neither could nor can dis-engage them from their <hi>utmoſt</hi> endeavours.</p>
            <p>From theſe grounds and what hath been formerly repreſented, the argument of the Indictment of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon above-mentioned viz. <hi>That all Convocations and Riſings in Arms, or Subjects entering in Leagues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or againſt the Kings Authority, are treaſonable: But ſuch was the late Riſing and renewing of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Therefore &amp;c.</hi> May be eaſily and clearly anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all ſuch Riſings and entering into Leagues, as are not warranded and commanded by the Superior Law and Authority of God (who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords) which by our own expreſs Acts and Statutes are acknowledged, and are not founded upon the Fundamental Right, and neceſſarily intended for the preſervation of Religion and Righteouſneſs, the great and principal End of all Laws and Governments, according whereunto our Laws have alſo by poſterior Statutes been expreſly interpreted, are indeed treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: But ſuch the late Riſing was not; but on the contrary was more clearly approven by theſe grounds, then any other the like Inſtance which can be adduced or inſtructed, from the parallel of any other Age or Nation; Therefore it was altogether Lawful, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Neceſſary. Which anſwer, though the Lords faithful Witneſſes did ſufficiently inſinuat and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64759:120"/>
yet both the Conſtitution of the Court, and perſons of the Judges before whom they were arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were ſuch, as the ſame was rather accounted an aggravation of their Crime and Treaſon.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing this was not done, without the ſpecious pretexts, not only of iniquous Laws, but alſo of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Scripture; We shall briefly conſider, firſt, that Queree often made to them, <hi>where they had read or how they could inſtruct, that, under the Pretence of Religion, it is lawful for Subjects to riſe in Rebellion againſt lawfull Authority?</hi> To which it is anſwered, that this Queree is a clear begging of the queſtion, by expreſly ſuppoſing that the late Riſing was only <hi>in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> for Religion, but <hi>really</hi> in Rebellion, which ought firſt to have been proved, and is in effect an arrant ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny and falshood. 2. That even the Queree it ſelf ſeems to imply and grant, that for Subjects to riſe in Arms really for the defence of Religion, againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of the Powers under the pretence of Lawful Authority, is both lawful and laudable: Which being the true caſe and cauſe of this late Riſing, and ſo clearly warranted both by the Word and Covenant of God, and the practiſe of all Reformed Churches; we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to refer theſe poor mens Innocency, unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and ſecret thoughts of their adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we shall conſider theſe texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which were pretended againſt the Innocents: and 1. it was much urged that <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of witch-craft</hi>; To which one of themſelves did roundly and clearly anſwer, that, the place having been ſpoken by the Prophet to a King, becauſe of his diſobedience and contempt of the command of God, and not to Subjects, would ſooner conclude his Accuſers then
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64759:120"/>
himſelf to be a Rebell. Secondly, it anſwered, that Riſing up againſt <hi>Authority</hi> it ſelf, the Ordinance of God, and diſobeying the Powers therewith veſted, ſtanding and acting in their <hi>right line of Subordination,</hi> is indeed Rebellion, and as the ſin of witchcraft; but to reſiſt and riſe up againſt perſons <hi>Abuſing</hi> ſacred Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and <hi>rebelling againſt God</hi> the Supream, is rather to adhere to God as our Liege Lord, and to vindicate both our ſelves and his abuſed Ordinance, from man's wickedneſs and Tyranny.</p>
            <p>The ſecond text objected was that, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.52. where even our Lord himſelf, when violently ſeiſed upon by wicked men, but who were then in Authority; did nevertheleſs reſtrain his diſciples from his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and reſcue, ſaying unto <hi>Peter, Put up again thy ſword into his place: for all they that take the ſword, ſhal periſh with the ſword</hi>; To which, as it was ſufficiently anſwered (without any reply) by one of theſe Impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, (whom they accounted diſtracted, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt appearance of impertinency) who thereto did oppone <hi>Luke</hi> 22.36. Where our Lord, ſpeaking at the ſame time and to the ſame purpoſe, ſaith, <hi>he that hath no ſword, let him ſell his garment, and buy one</hi>; Yet for further clearing, we ſay, 1. That from the place it ſelf in all the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> it is moſt evident, that that command was given, and theſe words ſpoken by our Lord, only for to teſtify his voluntar ſubmiſſion unto the Fathers will, by laying down of his life for fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Scripture, as is clear from the ſame 26. of <hi>Matth. v.</hi> 54. &amp; <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18.11. otherwiſe the context being conſidered (that not only in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.36. cited, He, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning his diſciples of hazards to come, adviſeth them to provide ſwords and weapons; and in the 26 of <hi>Matt.,</hi> aſſerts his power to have called 12 legions of Angels
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64759:121"/>
to his aſſiſtance, which clearly implyes the lawfulneſs thereof) this Scripture objected doth more confirm then impugn the Lawfulneſs of <hi>Defenſive Arms.</hi> 2. Is it poſſible that men should be ſo much demented by flattery, as to think that it was unlawful for Jeſus Chriſt the Mighty God and Lord over all, to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf by the aſſiſtance of his Diſciples, againſt the horrid Wickedneſs and Inſurrection of the vileſt of His creatures, had it not been, that it was neceſſary that the Scriptures concerning him should be accomplished. 3. Where our Lord ſaith in the place objected, <hi>all they that take the ſword, ſhal periſh with the ſword,</hi> as He thereby only condemneth Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and Offenſive war; ſo the Saying it ſelf, by its later part, doth tacitely imply the Lawfulneſs and Juſtice of both <hi>Defenſive</hi> and <hi>Vindictive Arms,</hi> the ſame being otherwiſe juſtly founded.</p>
            <p>Though theſe Texts were only objected, yet to help our Adverſaries, who are known not to be much converſant in the Scripture, and to obviate the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that may thence ariſe to others, we ſubjoyn a third text <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18.36. where our Lord ſaith, <hi>if my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Iews,</hi> whence ſome infer, that all Arms, even in Defence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are unlawfull and prohibited; But it is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the intent and ſcope of our Lord's anſwer, was to clear himſelf of that calumny objected againſt Him by the <hi>Iews,</hi> that he made Himſelf a King in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Caeſar</hi>; ſo the meaning of it is plain and obvious, to wit, that our Lord's Kingdom is not of the Nature and for the Ends, for which other Kingdoms of this world were inſtituted; but wholly ſpiritual for declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64759:121"/>
the Truth, and thereby gaining ſouls unto glory: Whence as our Lord would there infer that he came not to conquer to himſelf Diſciples by outward force, and thereby to gain followers by the ſpoiling of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and other Princes; ſo it is without all shaddow of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion thence to conclude, that a people having recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the bleſſing of the Goſpel and Kingdom of Ieſus Chriſt, should without Reſiſtance ſuffer themſelves (to the manifeſt dishonor of God and the hazard of the eternal damnation of themſelves and their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to be impiouſly and ſacriledgiouſly ſpoiled and deprived thereof, when they are in a capacity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ſame. The truth whereof, together with the hypocriſy of our Adverſaries, may ſoon be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the Queſtion be but ſtated in the terms of one For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign &amp; independent Prince's invading another, meerly upon the account of the Chriſtian Faith; and whatever ſolution or evaſion they shall herein make, will as exactly quadrat to the caſe in hand, it being almoſt ridiculous to conceave, that the greateſt aggravation of Invaſions of this Kind, to wit, that it is made by a Prince upon his own Subjects (whoſe Profeſſion he himſelf is principally bound to maintain) should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any ſpeciality and difference in the caſes. The laſt text is that of <hi>Math.</hi> 5.39. and remanent verſes to the end, where our Lord ſaith, <hi>reſiſt not evill, but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever shall ſmite thee</hi> &amp;c. with the other parallel places, ſpecially <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.10.. But it is anſwered, that as theſe places do injoyn either patience, when the clear call and diſpenſations of God do inevitably call unto ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without which patience were no patience but rather ſtupidity; or that bounty and debonairity which our Lord would have his diſciples to practiſe, in the remitting and diſpenſing with the utmoſt extenſions
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64759:122"/>
and points of Right, for the better reproving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of the animoſities and rigid contentions of men, for matters of ſmall or no moment, and the more effectuall commending the grace and peace of the Goſpel; So thence to infer that men should give way to all Violence and Sacriledge (to the ſubverting of Religion and Righteouſneſs) is, after the manner of Sathan, to cheat and abuſe men by the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth unto wickedneſs and error; and groſsly to exceed that ſignal rule mainly in theſe places intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, that we should <hi>be perfect even as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven is perfect,</hi> who, though he filleth the earth with his goodneſs, and extendeth his bounty unto all, cauſing the ſun to riſe upon the evill and on the good, yet doth he love righteouſneſs, and helpeth and delivereth the oppreſſed; and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the zeal of his own glory (wherein He himſelf doth often eminently appear) by the hand of His people, to take vengeance on His adverſaries. Let us therefore in the conſideration of what is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.10. <hi>he that leadeth into captivity, shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword,</hi> both poſſeſs our ſouls in patience under all the former ſufferings, and hope and rejoice in the faith of the ſucceeding delivery there ſubjoyned.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Defences which theſe Faithful men did ſummarily hint at, and being often interrupted, were ſcarcely permitted to propone: All which being reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as unworthy to be heard, what wonder, if what their <hi>Advocats</hi> did plead in their defence, upon the point of <hi>Quarter</hi> given, to ſome of them in the field, was alſo repelled? We are not to dip in matters of this kind; but certainly it much diſcovereth the ſpirit
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64759:122"/>
of malice and violence that now prevaileth, that neither the Nature and Import of <hi>Quarter,</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth nothing to Grace or Pardon (whereof theſe men were declared incapable) but <hi>is a paction of the Law of Nations, whereby the perſon worſted, by quitting of his arms,</hi> (the only and oftentimes the probable means either of his ſafety or vengeance) <hi>doth condition for, and redeem his immunity as to life</hi>; Nor yet the honor of the Granters, Perſons <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> by the King for the command of his Forces, with the common Priviledges and dignities belonging to ſuch Offices; Nor yet the Practice of all Nations about, even in the caſe of <hi>Inteſtine</hi> War; Nor the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional arguments of humanity and prudence, not to reduce men to utter deſpair in ſucceeding Inſurrections (from which no Kingdom is priviledged) Nor laſtly, the Paucity of theſe few innocents, not exceeding 5 or 6 who could have been thereby benefited (there being many other taken and not upon Quarter) could prevail againſt that Pedantick diſtinction <hi>inter bellum juſtum &amp; injuſtum.</hi> But this being alleadged to have been <hi>bellum injuſtum,</hi> (as indeed it was in the juſteſt ſenſe) therefore no faith nor Quarter muſt be herein obſerved, <hi>quia, ſc. adverſus Hostes tantum eſt Bellum, at in Perduelles, judicium,</hi> as if from this, one should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that though in <hi>War</hi> there may be faith and Quarter, yet in <hi>Iudgement</hi> there ought neither to be Truth nor Performance.</p>
            <p>All defences therefore being repelled, theſe perſons accuſed were all condemned to be hanged to death as Traitors, and their Heads and right Hands to be cut off, to be diſpoſed on by the <hi>Council,</hi> and their Goods and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64759:123"/>
Eſtates to be forfaulted to the Kings uſe. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly upon ſeveral dayes, this Sentence was executed upon thirty five of theſe faithful men, and by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>Council,</hi> the heads of many of them were affixed upon the Ports of ſeveral Burghs; and the right hands of the firſt ten (to the high contempt of God and His holy Covenant, and to the provocation of His jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy) on the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> of <hi>Lanerk,</hi> where the Covenant was by them ſolemnly renewed and ſworn. As for the other five, they were and are reprived; One of them, who in all his Tryall, to the conviction of all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt conſtant in the Covenant, and bold and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in his Teſtimony, upon the colour of a fit of diſtraction (by which he was once vexed) and through the interceſſion of many in his behalf; An other of them, for his vile and abject fainting to the very reproach of humanity, redeeming his life by becoming <hi>Hang-man</hi> to ſeven of his fellows, when two ordinary Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in the Burghs about had plainly refuſed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring they would have nothing to do with the blood of ſuch Righteous men, and one of them therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; The other three, partly becauſe of their fainting and condeſcendence to take the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and partly through the favour and interceſſion of friends.</p>
            <p>We shall not, nor cannot enter upon the particular declaration of that Grace, Conſtancy and Courage, by which the Lords faithful Witneſſes were ſuſtained, and did bear Teſtimony to the Word of his Truth, the holy Covenant, and the Cauſe and Work of God. Only this is certain, that the Lord did not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that vile abject perſon to the weakneſs of flesh and blood, whereby he was depreſſed below the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of men, then by His Grace and Glory, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64759:123"/>
to manifeſt the power thereof, He was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently preſent with ſuch as He honoured to be his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to cauſe them contemn and triumph over Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers, hell and death, and all their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; as may be evident from theſe things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Council,</hi> pitching upon thoſe men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out choiſe, for a Teſt of diſcrimination did require ſeveral of them, by taking the <hi>Declaration,</hi> to renounce the Covenant; which they conſtantly refuſed. And ſo were Martyred, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Mr Hew Mackaile,</hi> a young man of 25 years of age, and an Expectant in the Miniſtery, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned and accuſed through meer ſpite of the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>St. Andrewes,</hi> (againſt whoſe <hi>Iudas</hi>-like Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy he had preached four years ago) for no greater acceſſion, then that he had been ſome few dayes with theſe that roſe, with a ſword (having been moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſpectly taken, leaying them becauſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity and weakneſs the day before the Conflict) did not only moſt patiently endure cruel Torture whereby he was examined, for the diſcovery of the contrivance of that Riſing, which all men knew and ſaw to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberat; but, notwithſtanding the promiſe of favour plainly made to him upon condition of ingenuity (which he ſincerely uſed) being alſo condemned, did utterly reject all inſinuations made unto him upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the leaſt Retractation; and bitterly mourning for, and repenting of his apparent fainting and relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing, though; it really proceeded more from his infirmity, then fear or love of life, but rejoycing in his own folly, whereby the Lord did bring him to ſuch a manifeſtation of his Grace, and declaration of His

Glory, he, to the admiration of all, in his moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Chriſtian ſuffering, by his blood ſealed the Truth and glorified God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That others of them, though obſcure and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, upon the Scaffold hurried and interrupted in the declaring of their Teſtimony, by the Prelats Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the rudeneſs and inhumanity of theſe that executed them; yet did bear witneſs to the cauſe of God, and of that grace and aſſurance, whereby the Lord upheld them, to the admiration and aſtonishment of all the beholders.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That though at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> where eleven of them were executed, (all mean Countrey-men, and ſome of them of decrepit age, and others of them very young, not exceeding 18 years) their enemies cauſed beat drums about the Scaffold that they might not be heard (a barbarity never practiſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and rarely heard of, except in the Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Proteſtants in the <hi>Low-countreyes</hi>) yet were they ſo litle thereby amazed, that both by words of of Praiſe and thankſgiving to God, that had honoured ſuch <hi>plough-men</hi> (as they termed themſelves) to be His witneſſes, and the conſtancy of their countenance and whole carriage, they did bear ſuch teſtimony to the Holy Covenant, as both many were thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and their Enemies ashamed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That though ſome of them did appear weak and faint-hearted at firſt, yet ſo powerfully and abundantly was it given to them <hi>in that hour,</hi> that out of weakneſs they were made ſtrong; and declared that they had ſeen ſuch glimpſes of the Glory of God betwixt the priſon and the Scaffold, that all fear was clearly diſcuſſed; And particularly a young Countrey-boy, not much above ſixteen years of age, being condemned at <hi>Aix,</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:64759:124"/>
moſtly becauſe he did refuſe to take the <hi>Declaration,</hi> which they told him, was the renouncing of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which he had taken at <hi>Lanerk</hi>; &amp; though, both through fear and ignorance of the very grounds of Chriſtianity, he fell into great anxiety, neither daring to die, nor yet to redeem his life at the rate propoſed; Yet after the Prayers and Conference of ſome that had acceſs to him at <hi>Irwin</hi> two dayes before his death, on the morning that he ſuffered, he appeared ſo much changed, both from the depth of fear and perplexity unto great reſolution and joy, and ſo much enlightened with the knowledge of God in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the hope of Salvation through His Name, that all that ſaw him, do bear teſtimony to the Grace and wonderfull Work of God, &amp; of that joy of heart, that carried him to the Scaffold, leaping and praiſing God.</p>
            <p>From all which particulars, and from the ſeverall Teſtimonies and Speaches, which theſe left behind them in writing, we muſt conclude and rejoyce, that God out of the dark cloud of ſuch a ſad and aſtonishing providence which lately overſpread us, hath brought forth ſo bleſſed and bright a cloud of Witneſſes, ſtrengthened and filled with ſo much grace and glory, to bear Teſtimony unto His Name, Covenant and Cauſe and for the confirmation of all that love and wait for His Salvation.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto ommitted, to ſay any thing to that <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Conjuration</hi> taken by the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and the concurrence and aſſiſtance of many others, who did either Actually riſe in Arms for the ſuppreſſing of God's People and Cauſe, or ſince the Conflict did ſtop, apprehend, and ſpoil them in the croſs way, and have been aſſiſting and abetting to their deaths and perſecutions, either as <hi>Guarders</hi> of Priſons,

Courts or Scaffolds, or as <hi>Iudges, Clerks, Advocats, Aſſizers,</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> in the Dooms pronounced againſt them. If, after all the truth, equity and reaſon that have been repreſented, and the Power and Glory which God hath declared, men will not hear and fear, nor be converted, neither the tongues of men and Angels, nor of ſuch as should return from the dead, would be of any force or perſuaſion to prevail with them. Is it poſſible, that <hi>Edinburgh</hi> should think that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a new invented Oath of <hi>alleageance</hi> and <hi>fidelity</hi> to the King, and for the defence of his Authority againſt all Inſurrections and Rebellions, wherein the <hi>Prelates</hi> and the Up hold of their wickedneſs, and the Subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the Godly to their luſt and tyranny, were and are clearly intended and deſigned, shall warrand them in the great day of the Lord (who is terrible unto the Kings of the earth) for taking part with Rebels and Apoſtats againſt the God of heaven, and for oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppreſſing of ſuch, as, continuing ſtedfaſt in the common Cauſe and Covenant (for which <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was once very honourable and eminent) did only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to liberat themſelves from that intolerable Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage both of Bodies and Conſciences (more grievous then death) under which they groaned? doth <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> thus not only condemn the practice of Our Noble Anceſtors and Reformers, who accounted it neither Inſurrection nor Rebellion to ſet themſelves for the defence of the Goſpel againſt the then Powers, who did endeavour to oppreſs it; but by this Oath, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don both Religion and Liberty, in this ſo perillous and backſliding a Generation, to the luſt and tyranny of abuſed Authority, and whatſoever it shall pleaſe to impoſe, without control or contradiction? Do they thus remember the National Covenant and the Solemn
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64759:125"/>
League and Covenant once ſo powerfully ſworn and owned amongſt them, and the <hi>mutuall defence and aſsiſtance,</hi> wherein <hi>every one of us</hi> is thereby <hi>bound to another, to the uttermoſt of our Power, againſt all ſorts of perſons whatſoever, and not to ſuffer our ſelves, by whatſoever Combination, Terror or Perſwaſion; to be divided and withdrawn from that bleſſed Vnion</hi> therein contained? While on the contrary, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and conjure themſelves againſt ſuch whom they are not only bound to aſſiſt, but alſo to relieve of all the perſecutions and oppreſſions which they ſuffer and ſuſtain, only for their adherence to the ſame holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. Surely theſe things being duly conſidered, this Oath, in ſtead of qualifying the <hi>Declaration</hi> (in lieu whereof, being more general, plauſible and inſnaring it was contrived and impoſed) will be found a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal application of all the Wickedneſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is therein only ſpeculatively declared; and may in the righteous judgement of God, by reaſon not only of the equality, but even of the exceſs hereof to <hi>London's</hi> ſin, bring upon <hi>Edinburgh, London's</hi> plagues and judgements. We need not here inſiſt to teſtify againſt the reſt, who in any ſort concurred or aſſiſted in the oppoſition and perſecution above-mentioned, the meaneſt part of whoſe acceſſion, doth far exceed <hi>Paul's</hi> keeping the clothes of ſuch as ſtoned <hi>Stephen.</hi> If we conſider that the ſuffering and not oppoſing, to the utmoſt of our power, the shedding of innocent blood, doth involve all under that certain denouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by <hi>Ieremiah</hi> unto the Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi>; and all the People, <hi>Ier.</hi> 26, 15. ſaying, <hi>Know ye for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if ye put me to death, ye ſhal ſurely bring
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64759:126"/>
innocent blood upon your ſelves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitant thereof</hi>; the moſt innocent amongſt us, will find himſelf more concerned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his own, then cenſure others for their acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The ſerious thoughts whereof, may and ought juſtly to cauſe us tremble, left our <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>-like ſin in shedding of innocent blood, <hi>provoke the Lord to wrath</hi> in ſuch a meaſure <hi>as he will not pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when we do reflect upon the rage, cruelty and barbarity that have enſued, the things that we have mentioned, may juſtly appear to be but the Beginnings of evills. For firſt, immediatly after the Conflict, the <hi>Arch-prelat</hi> procureth a proclamation to be emitted <hi>Prohibiting the reſett and concealment of, or correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with any of theſe</hi> poor men that had eſcaped, or had been acceſſary unto the late Riſing, and ordaining all to purſue them as the worſt of Traitors <hi>under the pain of being accounted guilty of the ſame Rebellion.</hi> In which Proclamation, after the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently and abſurdly laboured, that ſeveral perſons, againſt whom, not ſo much as any delation or ground of ſuſpicion could be alleaged, should, contrary to all reaſon, be inſert, he at length prevailed that about 57 Gentlemen, Miniſters and others, alleaged more eminently guilty, should be therein by Name expreſſed. Certainly if it be conſidered, that neither Reaſon nor Prudence do adviſe to ſeek Security only in Revenge, but rather by an attemperation of Clemency, in caſes of this nature, to bring things to a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we muſt conclude, that ſuch courſes are only the product of blind prelatick-fury. 2. After the firſt executions at <hi>Edinbugh,</hi> the <hi>Commiſsioner</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64759:126"/>
General</hi> march unto the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and there having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed ſeveral perſons, as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, the <hi>Lieutenant General</hi> ſtaying behind, taketh up his Quarter at <hi>Kilmarnock</hi>; and there, and from thence doth practiſe and iſſue forth ſuch orders of cruelty, as the barbarity thereof may very probably render the Narration ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>For. 1. The Countrey is burthened with ſuch Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calities of Corn and Straw for Troop-horſes, (more then double the number of theſe that were amongſt them) that to redeem themſelves from the drudgery, they not only are content to quite the prices which the troopers ought to pay, but alſo to pay in to them ſuch ſumms of Money, as upon computation will equalize the valued rent of the Shire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Notwithſtanding of all the Exciſe, Fines and Taxations impoſed and leavyed for the maintenance of theſe Forces; yet upon pretence of want of moneys and Pay, the ſouldiours are shortly thereafter permitted to take free Quarter; and conſequently are licenſed to all the abuſes, that either rapine or cruelty may ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Dalzel,</hi> at and by his own hand, hath privately in his own chamber and Quarters, not only by words menaced ſuch, as after publick examination upon the account of Intelligence, had been acquitted; but alſo really (by fire and ſword, threatening to kill out-right, or roſt and burn alive, ſuch who being groundleſsly queſtioned, had upon the firſt examination declared all they knew) examined men by tortures.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such perſons as he happeneth to apprehend, whether upon the ſuſpicion of their having been with theſe that roſe in Arms, or having reſet ſuch after the Conflict, are there-upon ordinarly ſtript naked to their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64759:127"/>
shirts and breeches; and thruſt into Priſons, in cold, hunger. nakedneſs, and ſometimes in extreme ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; As in <hi>Kilmarnock</hi> into dark and obſcure little holes, which being deſtined for one man or two, and not capacious of more (though ſtanding upright) then ten or twelve, they are ſo pinched, that not one of them can poſſibly ſo much as relieve himſelf of the continual pain of ſtanding, by ſuffering his body to ſink unto the ground; and unto all the former miſeries have that of their own dung and excrements ſuperadded: ſo that the poor men would often chuſe death rather then life. Amongſt which cruelties and rigors, that practiſed upon a petty <hi>Heritor</hi> in or about the Parish of <hi>Vchilery,</hi> deſerveth to be remembered: Who, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended upon a groundleſs ſuſpition of reſet of Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (as they tearm them) was brought to <hi>Kilmarnock</hi>-Tolbooth; where, being an old man full of obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he was ſo ſuffocated with the ſmoak, there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a coal-fire, wanting a chimney-vent, that often-times a day the ſouldiours have in deriſion carried him out as dead, and after a litle recovery by reaſon of the free Aire, with cruell ſcorn ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly returned him unto his priſon. Which Barbarity they ſtill continued, until by extremity of ſuch uſage, he is reduced to ſuch weakneſs as there is litle hope of life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is one Act, ſo far beyond, and without all shew and pretence of Humanity and Juſtice, as ſcarce any preface or Teſtimony is ſufficient to perſwade the belief of it; which is thus. <hi>Dalzel</hi> having ordered a party to <hi>Newmills</hi> to ſeiſe and apprehend one <hi>Finlaw,</hi> living peacably in his own houſe, and they about the time of <hi>Dalzel's</hi> return from <hi>Air,</hi> returning and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng with them the priſoner, he inſtantly calleth him to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64759:127"/>
his chamber, and examineth him privately (without ſo much as any one witneſs preſent) whether or not he was with the <hi>Rebels</hi> at <hi>Lanerk</hi>; the man in answer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that he was there when they came to the place, but upon the account of his own private affairs. The <hi>General</hi> asketh in the nixt place, whom he knew to have been there amongſt them, and becauſe the man (by declaring his ignorance) appeared unwilling to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any, he inſtantly calleth the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the Guard, and giveth orders to carry the poor man to the Gallows and there to shoot him dead. The man being thus hurryed away, when he is brought to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, queſtioneth the <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> if the <hi>General</hi> was ſerious in what he had ordered: whereunto the <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> replyeth that he knew nothing to the contrary; the poor man declaring his innocency, obteſteth him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both upon the grounds of Humanity and Chriſtianity, that he would at leaſt obtain him a reprival for that night, that he might prepare for Death and Eternity, and with ſome importunity prevaileth to move him to return to <hi>Dalzel</hi> for a grant of the licence deſired: but the <hi>Lieut. General,</hi> in place of relenting, doth moſt ſeverely threaten the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> himſelf, telling him that he would teach him to obey his orders preciſely without pleading for mitigation; whereupon the <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi> returning to the place, immediately ordereth the poor man to be shot, who was inſtantly ſtript naked and left dead upon the ground. A fact ſo Barbarous and Cruell, and in effect ſo plain a <hi>Murder,</hi> being deſtitute of the leaſt shaddow of either Ordinary or Martial Law to colour it, that the horror thereof may juſtly render it incredible.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As this laſt Act is ſuch as barbarity it ſelf would condemn, ſo its well known that this man <hi>Dalzel</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:64759:128"/>
was therefore brought from <hi>Muſco,</hi> where it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he had learned to comply with that Arbitrary Tyranny, and to exerciſe that Barbarous Cruelty, which there more then in any part of the Chriſtan World, is wickedly practiſed, as the only proper Executioner, agreeably &amp; accurately to ſerve the rigor and violence of this, accurſed Prelacy. Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation he hath not at all fruſtrated: For both he and the <hi>Arch-Prelate</hi> of <hi>St Andrews,</hi> are ſo wickedly acted by the ſame ſpirit of ſpite, rage and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they have often grieved and openly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that ſuch whom they have ſuppoſed, and would have inſtantly and utterly deſtroyed as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals (according to the exceſs of their own luſt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, without reſpect to any meaſure or proportion of Juſtice) should either be proceeded againſt, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished acording to the tenor of Law; accounting and impudently declaring, that theſe <hi>Formalities</hi> (as they are pleaſed to tearm the very ſubſtantials of Law, and the great ſecurity of all mens lives and fortunes) were, and are in their opinions moſtly obſtructive to the King's ſervice. It were endleſs to enumerat all the evils, extortions, cruelties and exactions that this <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia</hi>-beaſt hath acted and doth practiſe upon that poor countrey of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> where retaining ſome of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both Horſe and Foot, the moſt ſlender ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, or the ſmalleſt ſurmiſes, though never ſo falſe, are accounted crimes and convictions; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly punished with ſuch rigorous impriſonment as we have already deſcribed; or by oppreſſive Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, not only on the perſon ſuſpected, but alſo on the whole bounds about: in which Quartering, the ſouldiours do behave themſelves with ſuch inſolency and rapine, that not only many hundreds of families
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64759:128"/>
are reduced to beggery, but in ſeveral Parishes, the countrey almoſt laid waſte and deſolate; So that now it is the common report and perſwaſion of all, that the <hi>West</hi> is appointed for ruine and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seing this is the caſe of almoſt that whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, without reſpect to guilt or innocency, how hard and lamentable is the condition of ſuch who were in the late Riſing, and have hithertil eſcaped? it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible fully to repreſent all their ſore diſtreſs and great perplexity which they ſuſtain, wandering and hiding themſelves in woods, mountains and caves of the earth, afflicted with all the pain and miſery, that the extremity of cold, nakedneſs and hunger, with the continual uncertainty of their Lives, can lay upon them, and hunted more then Partridges, by the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and cruell malice of their adverſaries. We know that ſome of our profane Apoſtate Preachers (who not only think the fiery tryall a ſtrange thing, and are offended at the croſs of <hi>Christ,</hi> but preferring this worlds eaſe to their everlaſting reſt, do neither hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the warning, nor believe the promiſed and often experienced conſolation of ſuffering) have wickedly judged theſe poor men and their cauſe by the event, and affirmed that curſe <hi>ſa.</hi> 8.21. to be on them accomplished: but as both the ſin of Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the ſting of this threatning, imbittered frett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the curſing of God, the very worm of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here recorded, do clearly diſcover and confute this calumny; ſo are theſe Apoſtate calumniators plainly and directly therein concerned, who, having ſuch evident tokens of perdition, as are their vile Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy and cruell perſecution and reproach, may and ought to tremble in the pre-apprehenſions thereof,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64759:129"/>
which, without ſerious repentance, they cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, when the righteous God who upholdeth his own with ſtrength and joy in tribulation, shall hereafter give unto all of them, though now troubled, reſt with all ſaints.</p>
            <p>But not only time, but heart and tongue would fail any Chriſtian, to relate all the violences, plunderings, extortions and inſolencies, that from the beginning of this Apoſtacy until this day have been and are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Military Force among us, firſt upon <hi>Galloway,</hi> then upon both <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Nithiſdale,</hi> and now upon the whole <hi>Weſt:</hi> which as they have been Extended in bounds, ſo are they continually Intended in cruelty. Only this we shall ſay, if ſtobbing, wounding, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtripping and impriſoning mens perſons, violent breaking of their houſes both by day and night, and beating and wounding of wives and children, ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deflowring of women, forcing wives and other perſons by fired matches and other tortures to diſcover their husbands and nearſt relations, although it be not within the compaſs of their knowledge, and driving and ſpoiling all their goods that can be carried away, without reſpect to guilt or innocency, in as cruell a manner as ever <hi>Scotland</hi> ſaw exerced amongſt them by a forrain enemy (as can be inſtanced from every corner of that Countrey) May repreſent our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſlavery &amp; bondage; certainly the ſame is ſo much the more miſerable and inſupportable, in that all this wickedneſs is moſt unnaturally perpetrated, both by our own Countrey-men and Sworn brethren, and ſo much the rather to be laid to heart by al, that, as al theſe things are only acted and allowed by the wicked malice and blind fury of this prevailing Prelatick party, and for ſatisfying their inſatiable hatred and revenge againſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64759:129"/>
all their oppoſers, ſo is the whole Kingdom thereby diſabled, and moſt obviouſly in theſe moſt dangerous times, expoſed to the Invaſion, of any Forrainer; As may be very evident from theſe conſiderations. 1. The <hi>Weſt,</hi> the ſtrength and better part of the Kingdom, is already diſabled, not only by the above-mentioned oppreſſions, but by generall diſarming, and taking of ſerviceable horſes, and likely very shortly to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally waſted and ruined. 2. The <hi>North</hi> and <hi>High-Lands</hi> have been of late ſo much neglected and connived at, through the prevailing wickedneſs of the times, that they are wholly in diſorder, and all places about infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by moſt inſolent rapines and murthers: but ſince the Actors are void both of Religion &amp; Conſcience, they cannot now be guilty of either Rebellion or Sedition, and ſince they are rather favourers of then enemies to <hi>Prelates,</hi> it is no matter how great enemies they be to Righteouſneſs. 3. The whole Kingdom is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by exactions and impoſitions, ſo vexed by generall oppreſſion and diſorder, from which the wickedneſs of Prelatick Rulers, ſuffer no place to be exempted; &amp; ſo diſguſted with the violence and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity they ſee done to their brethren (their own flesh) for ſuch ſlight and unworthy cauſes and occaſions, as the worſt of men not intereſted, do juſtly apprehend Prelacy and Conformity to be; that all are either diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, disheartened, or diſobleiged from the ſervice of King and Countrey. 4. There remaineth no ſtrength nor force amongſt us, but theſe two regiments of foot and nine troops of horſes, which even with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the five more intended, will not in all exceed 2000 foot and 1000 horſe, and yet are they all and more then the Countrey can wel bear, and theſe ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched by licentiouſneſs, cruelty and rapine, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64759:130"/>
neither can their hearts endure, nor their hands be ſtrong againſt an enemy. Theſe are the fruits of our departing from the Lord, and again erecting and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this accurſed Prelacy. O! that God would cauſe us to know how evill and bitter they are; but the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats</hi> who fear not God, regard not the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, let the Covenant &amp; Conſcience be rooted out, then come on us what will: theſe are the only enemies of their uſurpations &amp; wicked luſts, and therefore muſt be accounted ſo both to King and Countrey; againſt theſe are our forces leavyed and maintained, and unto this deſign their numbers muſt be modelled and our exactions proportioned: The arraying of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and eſtablishing of the <hi>Militia</hi> conform to our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws and Liberties may poſſibly arm the Prelats enemies; ſurely that courſe would not ſo violently preſs Conformity, and execute their cruelty, nor ſo largely gratify a few Nobles, who by the command of the troops muſt be made sharers of the ſpoil and booty, and ſo engaged for theſe vile Prelates againſt the poor Countrey. O blinded Nobles! are not the wealth and peace of the Countrey your riches and ſtability? O abject <hi>Scotland</hi>! how art thou abondoned?</p>
            <p>This being the deſign, rage and jealouſy of the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Prelats, in order thereunto there muſt be five troops more added to theſe already leavyed, and the Countrey yet more oppreſſed for the ſecuring and eſtablishing of their wickedneſs. 2, They are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring by all means to have the <hi>Declaration</hi> againſt the Covenant generally preſſed, that either by violent ſtraining they may deſtroy all conſcience thereof, or may more fully diſcover, and more effectually reach all the faithful in the Land, whom by the teſt of a refuſal they purpoſe to ſtage and ſeverely punish as enemies to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64759:130"/>
Authority. We shall not offer here to adde any thing againſt this <hi>Declaration.</hi> If all that the Lord hath done in this Land now by the ſpace of near an 100 years, all that his ſervants have formerly declared and teſtifyed, and now of late have witneſſed and ſealed with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r blood, and all the tenor and purpoſe of this diſcourſe avail not to juſtify our holy Covenants, and condemn this horrid Apoſtacy and wicked <hi>Declaration,</hi> nothing certainly will be able to perſwade, and the mighty power of God can only convert. Only we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear that the ſame ſpirit of deceat, which, under the colour of due obedience to lawful Authority, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared wretched <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to a combination and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the Lord and his Anointed, may renew the ſame practiſe upon the whole Land, for the more eaſy involving of ſuch in this Apoſtacy, whom poſſibly the groſs and palpable wickedneſs of the <hi>Declaration</hi> might deterre: And to ſuch we give this warning, that as all Powers are ſubordinat to the moſt High, and appointed and limited by His holy will and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for his own glory and the Peoples good; and as our Alleagiance was, and ſtandeth perpetually and expreſly thus qualifyed, <hi>viz. in defence of Religion and Liberty,</hi> according to our firſt and ſecond Covenants; and laſtly, ſeing all Alleagiance and obedience to any created Power whatſoever, (though in the conſtruction of charity apparently indefinite, yet) of it's own nature is indiſpenſibly thus reſtricted; To renew the ſame, or take any the like Oath of Alleagiance purely and ſimply, purpoſely omitting the former and due Reſtriction, eſpecially where the Powers are in moſt manifeſt and notorious Rebellion againſt the Lord, and oppoſition to his Cauſe and Covenant, is in effect equivalent to to an expreſs rejecting and diſ-owning of the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64759:131"/>
and of the Soveraign Prerogative of the Great God and King over all, which is thereby reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; &amp; as much as in plain terms to affirm, <hi>that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever abuſed Authority shall command or do, either as to the overturning of the VVork of God, ſubverting of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, deſtroying of Rights &amp; Liberties, or perſecuting of all the Faithful to the utmoſt extremity, we shall not only ſtupidly endure it, but actively concur with &amp; aſsist in all this Tyranny.</hi> And if this be not more, yea double wickdneſs above all that the <hi>Declaration</hi> doth import, let all men conſider. O! all ye who deſire to behold the good that God will do for His People, beware of this High Rebellion againſt Him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As all reſtraints of either Conſcience or Law are now wickedly taken off, and only a convenient oppurtunity waited for, to re-introduce that dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe of Formality, the <hi>Service-book,</hi> and the whole bulk of theſe corrupt Ceremonies and pernicious Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, that have been formerly, and alwayes found ſo deſtructive to the light &amp; power of the Goſpell, &amp; are ſo vain and ridiculous in themſelves, that nothing but the very, ſpirit of darkneſs and judiciall deluſion from the Lord, can induce men to ſuch fopperies; ſo may we certainly expect the re-impoſing of this heavy yoke, and all the Sin, Superſtition, Perſecution and Wrath which neceſſarily do attend it, except we abide ſtedfaſt in the Lord's Cauſe and Covenant, inſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating and patiently waiting for His Salvation, and glorious appearance again in this Land.</p>
            <p>Thus we have repreſented in part both the Sin, Sufferings and Diſtreſſes that ly upon the whole Land; which though they be moſt heavy and greivous in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64759:131"/>
themſelves, yet are they in their Tendency &amp; Preſage more to be regarded. Can any man ſeriouſly look upon the hatred and ſcorn of that Light and Truth? wherein once we gloried, the ſpite againſt the Holy Covenant and all Conſcience, the Blaphemy and ſin againſt God, and the violence and perſecution againſt all ſuch as fear His Name, whereby the enemy rageth and their tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult continually increaſeth, and not be aſtonished? Is there any who believeth that God is, and that His Words are Truths and all His Wayes judgements, His Threatnings ſure and certain, His jealouſy as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire, His wrath ſo dreadful and His indignation ſo terrible, that only the ſame Omnipotency which inflicteth the ſtrokes, can ſuſtain poor paſſive wretches from evanishing at it's ſmalleſt rebukes, and yet shall ſuſtain them eternally, and not tremble becauſe of the provocation of all theſe Abominations? O! that ſuch whom the Love of Chriſt hath not conſtrained, nor the tears and weeping of a departing Saviour moved, might be yet perſwaded by the Terror of the Lord, &amp; that the dread of God might make their hearts ſoft. Surely abounding ſin is the greateſt Woe, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſgreſſion the greateſt cauſe of mourning; but above all ſins and tranſgreſſions, Chriſt deſpiſed in His Goſpell and Ordinances, and perſecuted in His mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is the moſt mournful and fearful: Which as it ſcattered and deſtroyed the Lord's peculiar People and Nation, dear to Him above all Nations, and hath overturned and ruined the faireſt part of the Chriſtian World, either in Barbarity or groſs Darkneſs; ſo is it the great condemnation of the whole World. This is the work and wickedneſs of accurſed Prelacy, moſt Perjurious in it's Riſe and ever Antichriſtian in it's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and Effects, as all who have hearts to underſtand
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64759:132"/>
what we have here declared, and eyes to ſee the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate and condition of matters, muſt and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. This is thy Sin, O <hi>Scotland,</hi> and, if mercy prevent it not, shall be thy ruine. This is the Voice, Teſtimony and Warning of all the ſufferings of the Lord's people; who though continually afflicted and perſecuted in their bodies, &amp; though their ſouls be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly filled with the contempt of the proud; yet have not nor dare not deny the Lord, His Work, nor His holy Covenant: whom though the Lord hath cauſed to turn back from the enemy, and given for a ſpoil to them that hate them, yea given them as sheep for meat, and made them a reproach, a ſcorn and a deriſion; yet have they nor forgotten the Lord nor dealt falſly in His Covenant. O! that men would! conſider this Grace of God, whereby as he conforteth and ſuſtaineth his ſervants in all their afflictions; ſo he warneth backſliders to return, and all to flee from the wrath that is to come, and to ſave themſelves from this wicked generation: Which Grace, as it allayeth to, the Faithful the ſmart, ſo ought it to remove from all the ſcandal of our Lord's croſs, and is indeed that ſtrength and preſence of the Captain of our ſalvation (who was made perfect by ſuffering) with all His ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, giving for the preſent joy and peace, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards aſſured victory.</p>
            <p>Now, ſeing it is the Lord who hath ſo viſibly brought upon us theſe ſore Trialls, that ſuch as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved may be made manifeſt, and ſo graciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth them from the temptation thereof, yea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by refineth, purifyeth and maketh many white, that they may be more abundant Partakers both of His Holineſs and of His Glory, and alſo eminently bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneſs to the Truth, Grace and Power of His

great Work, His holy Covenant, and precious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Miniſtry amongſt us, clearing them by His own Teſtimony of all theſe calumnies, wherewith either through the invention of ſome men's malice, or the occaſion of other mens weakneſs and ſin, they were formerly aſperſed, we shall shut up this diſcourſe with this one word of exhortation.</p>
            <p>Great hath been the Sin of this Land in not believing and obeying the glorious Goſpell, in not receaving the Lord Jeſus in our hearts, and witneſſing His Light and Grace and Glory in our lives and converſations, but in reſting on the outward forms and appearances of the true Doctrine, Worship, Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without labouring after the power of Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and beauty of holineſs (the only grace and bleſſing of all theſe enjoyments) and in perverting and mannaging the poſſeſſion and profeſſion of all theſe things unto ſelfish ends and worldly advantages, O foolish people and unwiſe, have we thus requited the Lord for all theſe mercies of His Goſpell, pure Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Holy Covenants, to corrupt and deprave them from that great end of the Glory of His grace and mercy in our ſalvation, unto the baſe deſigns of ſerving and ſatifying our own luſts to His dishonour? And therefore is it that the Lord, having often in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy corrected and warned us, hath now at length given us over unto this horrid Apoſtacy and Defection; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as the latent malice and hypocriſy of many, and the great fainting and want of zeal in all, have been manifeſtly diſcovered; ſo the Lord is feeding the wicked with their own deluſions, and putting the zeal and conſtancy of all to the Teſt, and in effect ripening this whole Land, either for a glorious deliverance from that perverſe ſpirit and generation of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64759:133"/>
hath been long mingled in the midſt of us, and even from the dayes of our firſt Reformation, hath retained and continued the old enmity againſt the Lord Jeſus and His bleſſed Goſpell and Kingdom; or elſe for a totall and final overthrow in utter darkneſs and deſolation. And therefore O <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe the Lord loved thy Fathers, and delighteth not in thy deſtruction, hath He, after all our fearful backſliding and ſinful fainting and departing which teſtify againſt us, neither left Himſelf nor us without a witneſs; but raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us His own faithful Servants and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with whom we are all equally and indiſſolubly engaged in the ſame righteous Cauſe and Covenant, &amp; by the mighty power of His grace, from the pure zeal of His Glory, enabled them firſt to venture and then to lay down their lives for the Teſtimony of His Work and Covenant, that we may yet at length conſider and underſtand, that theſe were no more the labour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of carnal deſigns, then that corruption and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of flesh &amp; blood could triumph both over it ſelf &amp; death &amp; hell the chief of terrors. O! that men would therefore lay to heart their bonds &amp; Engagements unto the Lord, repent of their backſlidings, and ceaſe from their oppoſition to His Cauſe &amp; Covenant; at leaſt that ſuch whom the Lord hath not abandoned unto that depth of Apoſtacy, whereunto others have made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, would yet be wiſe &amp; inſtructed, repent of their fainting &amp; Neutrality in the cauſe of God, &amp; their conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or complyance with the declared enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp; beware of that wicked <hi>Declaration</hi> againſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or any other Oath and Subſcription likely to be the ſnare and temptation of theſe times, which either under the pretext of Peace and Order, or of due Obedience unto lawful Authority may be wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invented and impoſed, really for the ſuppreſſing of

Truth, and advancing of this Rebellion againſt the moſt High God, and the eſtablishing of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Prelatick-<hi>Tyranny.</hi> We have already fully detected the mask and deſign of ſuch impoſtures; He who hath given Authority and Power unto Kings and Princes, and rendered the ſame Sacred by His holy Sanction and Command, as he hath often punished their Ingratitude and Uſurpation againſt His own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity; ſo will He not hold that people guiltleſs, who, being both His Creatures and ſworn Subjects, either connive at, or comply with ſuch Rebellious Princes in their wickedneſs. Shall both the Law of God, and the very Propenſion of the heart and blood to the love and obedience of Parents, cede to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Kings and Rulers, for the good and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Common-wealth, and shall not far more all Alleagiance &amp; obedience to the ſame Kings &amp; Rulers, cede and give place to our Obedience to the Moſt High our only Soveraign Lord, and the conſcience of His holy Oath and Commandments, for advancement of his glory, the great and only end of all things? Fix it therefore in your hearts, firſt to love and fear the Lord our God, and then to honour and obey the King; and let the ſincere and inward love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the dear eſteem of his precious Goſpel, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our moſt ſacred and ſolemn Oaths and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and of that beauty, power and glory of His pure Ordinances, Miniſtry and Government which we once enjoyed, alwayes dwell in your hearts, and ever determine and eſtablish you to reſiſt and diſown all wicked Uſurpations againſt the Lord and His Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all Invaſions againſt His Crown and Prerogative, all Corruptions and Humane Inventions in His pure Worship and Ordinances, all perverſion of the true

            <p>Thus we have ſeen and declared the great Work of God in this Land, from the firſt times of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto this day; we have alſo teen our manifold provocations, whereby we have often Turned, Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Provoked the moſt High; and all theſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Temptations and Diſcoveries, wherewith, by the ſpace of now more then an Hundred years, he hath corrected and exerciſed us; and we are at length arrived unto, and have conſidered the preſent ſtate and poſture of our affairs: Wherein though 1. the extremity of Apoſtacy, exceeding all that any age can parallel, and aggreageable by all the circumſtances of moſt clear and glorious Manifeſtations, moſt ſolemn and ſacred En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, moſt ſudden and cauſeleſs backſliding, and moſt national daring and violent defection that any Church can be charged with. 2. The extremity of Perſecution and Violence, which, conſidering either the Actors; (once ring-leaders, now Apoſtats from the ſame Holy Covenant which they perſecut) or the Manner, by Hoſtile and Military Force, without ſo much as regarding their own Lawes which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for warrant; or the cruelty and exceſs, whereby mens lives are imbittered, making them prefer Death to the ſlaveries and inſolencies which they, ſuſtain, Are
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64759:135"/>
not to be inſtanced in any Chriſtian Church. 3. The extremity of Sin and profanity, and of the enemies boaſting and blaſphemy, whoſe mouths are ſet againſt the Heavens, and all the ſpite of their tongues and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of their hearts, againſt the holy Covenant and tenderneſs of conſcience, over which and all their followers, they wickedly inſult and rejoyce. And 4. the extremity of mens fainting and deſerting ſo Good a Cauſe; Which in their hearts they ſecretly own and approve, but dare not avow, yea are ready to deny for fear of the Adverſaries, Though, we ſay, theſe extremities (undenyably apparent in our preſent condition) do ſadly denounce unto this Land, the worſt and moſt woful of all extremities, even utter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking and deſolation, and that the End is come; yet notwithſtanding all theſe hopeleſs and deſperat appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, it is the Lord who cauſeth light to shine out of darkneſs, and ſaith in the evening it shall be light, who ſaith unto dry bones, <hi>live,</hi> and calleth his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of their graves, who even calleth things that are not as though they were, in whom all the ſeekers of His face ought to rejoyce, and joy in the God of their ſalvation. Therefore, although that over and above all theſe menacing evils, the power and pride of the Enemy should yet more prevail, even many degrees above all the appearances of Human Hope or Help, &amp; all Neighbouring Nations should not only give them the leiſure and conveniency, but with all their might conſpire and concurre with our enemies, to intend their perſecution &amp; ſtrengthen their Apoſtacy; yet are the Lord's Faithful, not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that River, the ſtreams whereof make glad the City of God, though ſurrounded with the ſiege of of Nations, Batteries of mountains, and inſurrections

For the Lord ſhall judge his people and repent himſelf for his ſervants, when he ſeeth that our power is gone, and there is none ſhut up or left: And the Lord ſhall ſay, ſee now that I, even I am He, and there is no God with me: I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand; for I lift up my hand to heaven, and ſay, I live for ever. if I whet my glittering ſword, and mine hand take hold on

judgement, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood (and my ſword ſhall devour fleſh) and that with the blood of the ſlain and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. Rejoyce, O ye Nations, with his people, for He will avenge the blood of His Servants, and will render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to His adverſaries, and will be mercifull unto His Land and to His People.</hi> This is the Song which God hath taught us, and therewith we ſhut up and ſeal the FAITH AND PATIENCE OF THE SAINTS.</p>

As for theſe Calumnies that have gone abroad of me, I bleſſe God, I know them to be no more: And as I go to make a reckoning to My God, I am free as to any of theſe, concerning the King's Perſon or Government. I was Real and Cordial in my deſires to bring the King home, and in my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for Him when he was at home, and I had no correſpondence with the Adverſaries Army, nor any of them, in the time when his Majeſty was in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; Nor had I any acceſſion to his late Majeſties

               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:64759:140"/>Now, Gentlemen, concerning the Nation, I think there are three ſorts of People that take up much of the World and of this Nation. There is 1. the openly Prophane: And truely I may ſay, though I have been a priſoner, I have not had mine ears shut; I hear aſſuredly, that Drinking, Swearing, Whoring were never more Common, never more Countenanced then now they are. Truly if Magiſtrats were here, I would ſay to them, if they lay forth their power for glorifying of God, by reſtraining this, they should fare the better; if they continue in not reſtraining, they shall fare the worſe. I ſay no more, but either let People shun Prophanity and Magiſtrats reſtrain it, or aſſuredly the wrath of God shall follow on it. 2. Others are not openly Prophane (everyone will not allow that) but yet they are <hi>Gallio's</hi> in the matter: If matters go well as to their Private Intereſt, they care not whether the Church of God ſink or ſwim. But whatever they think, God hath laid Engagements upon <hi>Scotland:</hi> We are tyed by Covenants to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Reformation: Theſe that were then Unborn are yet engaged; and in our Baptiſme we are engaged to it. And it paſſeth the power of all the Magiſtrats under heaven to abſolve them from the Oath or God: They deceave themſelves, and it may be would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave others that think otherwiſe. But I would cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at this, People will be ready to think this a kind of inſtigation to Rebellion in me; But they are very far wrong that think <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> are not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. Whoever they be that ſeparate them, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not to be blamed, but They. It's true, it's the duty of every Chriſtian to be Loyall; yet I think the Orders of things are to be obſerved as well as their Natures; the Order of Religion as well as the Nature
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64759:140"/>
of it. Religion muſt not be the Cock-boat, it muſt be the Ship. God muſt have what is His, as well as <hi>Caeſar</hi> what is His: And Theſe are the beſt Subjects that are the beſt Chriſtians. And that I am looked on as a Friend to Reformation, is my Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another ſort that are truly Godly: And to them I muſt ſay what I fear, &amp; every one hath reaſon to fear (it's good to fear evil) It's true the Lord may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; but if He do not (and truly I cannot forſee any probability of it) Times are like either to be very <hi>Sinning</hi> or very <hi>Suffering</hi> Times: And let Chriſtians make their choice: There is a ſad <hi>Dilemma</hi> in the buſineſs SIN or SUFFER; and ſurely, he that would choiſe the Better part will choiſe to Suffer. Others that will choiſe to Sin, shall not eſcape Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; They shall Suffer, but it may be, not as I do (<hi>turning about and, pointing to the Maiden</hi>) but worſe: Mine is but Temporal, theirs shall be Eternal; when I shall be Singing, they shall be Howling. Beware therefore of Sin whatever yow are aware of, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch times.</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot ſay of my own Condition, but that the Lord in his Providence hath mind of Mercy to me even in this World: For if I had been more favourably dealt with, I fear I might have been overcome with Temptations, as many others are, and many more I fear will be; And ſo should have gone out of the World, with a more polluted Conſcience, then through the mercy of God now I have. And hence my Condition is ſuch now, as when I am gone, will be ſeen not to have been ſuch as many imagined. It's fit God take me away, before I fall into theſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that I ſee others are falling into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64759:141"/>
others I fear will fall: I wish the Lord may Prevent it. Yet bleſſed be His Name, that I am keeped both from preſent evils &amp; evils to come. <hi>Here he turned about a litle &amp; ſpoke ſome words to Mr Hutchiſon, when turning again to the People, he ſpoke as followeth.</hi> Some may expect I will regrete my own condition: but truly I neither grudge nor repine; nor deſire any revenge. And I declare I do not repent my laſt going up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; for I had alwayes rather have Suffered any thing, then ly under Reproaches as I did. I deſire not that the Lord should judge any man; nor do I judge any but my Self: I wish, as the Lord hath pardoned me, ſo He may pardon them for this and other things; and what they have done to me, may never meet them in their accounts. I have no more to ſay, but to beg the Lord, that when I go away, he would Bleſs every one that ſtayeth behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His last Words, immediatly before he laid his Head on the Block after his doublet was off, were theſe.</hi> I deſire you, Gentlemen, all that hear me this day to take notice (and I wish that all who ſee me might hear me) that now when I am entering into Eternity, and am to appear before my Judge; &amp; as I deſire Salvation and do expect eternall Salvation and happineſs from Him, from my Birth to my Scaffold, I am free from any acceſſion by my Knowledge, concerning Counſel or any other way to his late Ma. death; And I pray the Lord preſerve his preſent Maj. and to pour his beſt bleſſings on his Perſon and Government; and the Lord give him good and faithful councellors. <hi>Turn-about to his Friends, he ſaid,</hi> Many Chriſtians may ſtumble at this, and my Friends may be diſcontented; But when things are rightly conſidered, my freinds

have no Diſcredit of Me, nor Chriſtians no Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block, but rather an Encouragement.</p>

which a day or two before his Death he wrot, and left with ſome of his Friends ſealed and atteſted under his own hand.</head>
               <p>MEn and Brethren, I fear many of yow become hither to gaze, rather then to be edified by the carriage and laſt words of a dying man: But if any have an hear to hear, as I hope ſome of this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence have, I deſire your audience to a few words. I am come hither to lay down this earthly Tabernacle and mortal flesh of mine; and I bleſs God, through His Grace I do it willingly and not by conſtraint. I ſay, I ſuffer willingly: If I had been ſo minded, I might have made a diverſion, and not been a Priſoner; But being conſcious to my Self of nothing worthy of Death or of Bonds, I would not ſtain my Innocency with the ſuſpicion of guiltineſs by my withdrawing: neither have I wanted opportunities and advantages to eſcape ſince I was Priſoner, not by the fault of my keepers (God knoweth) but otherwiſe; But neither for this had I Light or Liberty; left I should reflect upon the Lord's Name, and offend the Generation of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64759:142"/>
the Righteous: And if ſome men have not been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, or dealt deceatfully in telling me ſo, I might have avoided not only the ſeverity of the Sentence, but alſo had much favor and countenance, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the courſes of the time: But I durſt not redeem my Life with the loſs of my Integrity; God knoweth I durſt not; and that ſince I was Priſoner, He hath ſo holden me by the hand, that he never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me to bring it in debate in my inward thoughts, much leſs to propone or hearken to any overture of that kind. I did judge it better to Suffer then to Sin; And therefore I am come hither to lay down my life this day. And I bleſs God, I die not as a <hi>Fool</hi>; Not that I have any thing wherein to glory in my ſelf: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that I am a Sinner, yea one of the greateſt and vileſt that hes owned a profeſſion of Religion, and one of the moſt unworthy that hes Preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; my corruptions have been ſtrong and many, and have made me a ſinner in all things, yea even in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing my duty: And therefore Righteouſneſs have I none of mine own, all is vile; But I do beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners whereof I am Chief: Through Faith in his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Blood have I obtained Mercy; and through Him and Him alone, have I the hope of a bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and Victory over Sin, and Sathan, and Hell, and Death, and that I shall attain unto the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Juſt; and be made Partaker of Eternal Life. I know in whom I have beleeved, and that He is able to keep than which I have committed unto Him againſt that day. I have Preached Salvation through His Name, and as I have preached ſo do I Beleeve, and do commend the Riches of His Free-grace
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64759:142"/>
and Faith in His Name unto yow all, as the only way whereby ye can be ſaved.</p>
               <p>And as I bleſs the Lord that I die not as a fool; ſo alſo that I die not for <hi>Evil-doing.</hi> Not a few of yow may happily judge, that I ſuffer as a Thief, or as a Murtherer, or as an evil Doer, or as an Buſſy body in other mens matters. It was the lot of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf, and hath been of many of His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Servants and People to ſuffer by the World as evil Doers: &amp; as my ſoul ſcareth not at it, but deſireth to rejoice in being brought into Conformity with my Bleſſed Head, and ſo bleſſed a Company in this thing; ſo do I deſire and Pray that I may be to none of yow to day, upon this account a ſtone of ſtumbling and a rock of offence: Bleſſed is he that shall not be offended at Jeſus Chriſt and his poor ſervants and members, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their being condemned as evil doers by the World. God is my record, that in theſe things, for which Sentence of Death hath paſſed againſt me, I have a good Conſcience: I bleſs God, they are not matters of Complyance with Sectaries, or Deſignes or Practices againſt His Majeſt. Perſon or Government, or the Perſon or Government of His Royal Father: My heart (I bleſs God) is conſcious unto no Diſloalty; Nay, Loyal I have been, and I commend it unto you to be Loyal and obedient in the Lord. True Piety is the foundation of True Loyalty: A wicked man may be a flatterer and a Time-ſerver, but he will never be a Loyal Subject. But to return to my purpoſe, the matters for which I am condemned, are matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to my Calling and Function as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, ſuch as the Diſcovery and Reproving of Sin; The preſſing the holding faſt of the Oath of God in the Covenant, and preſerving and carrying on the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64759:143"/>
Work of Religion and Reformation according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; And Denying to acknowledge the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat as the <hi>Proper Competent Iudge in cauſes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi>: That in all theſe things which (God ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering by His gracious Providence) are the grounds of my Inditement and Death, I have a good Conſcience, as having walked therein according to the Light and Rule of God's Word, and as did become a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>I do alſo bleſs the Lord, that I do not die as <hi>one not deſired.</hi> I know that by not a few I neither have been nor am deſired. It hath been my lot to have been a man of Contention and Sorrow: But it is my comfort, that for my own things I have not contended, but for the things of Jeſus Chriſt, for what relateth to His Intereſt and Work, and the well being of His People. In order to the preſerving and promoting of theſe, I did Proteſt againſt, and ſtood in Oppoſition unto theſe late Aſſemblies at <hi>St Andrewes, Dundee</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; and the Publick Reſolutions for bringing the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Party into the Judicatories and Armies of this Kingdom, conceaving the ſame contrary to the Word of God, and to our Solemn Covenants and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and to be an inlet to Defection, and to the Ruine and deſtruction of the Work of God. And it is now manifeſt to many conſciences, that I have not been therein miſtaken; nor was not fighting againſt a man of ſtraw. I was alſo deſirous and did uſe ſome poor Endeavours to have the Church of God purged of Inſufficient and Scandalous and Corrupt Miniſters and Elders; for theſe things I have been miſtaken by ſome, and hated by others: But I bleſs the Lord, as I had the teſtimony of my own Conſcience; ſo I was and am therein approven, in the conſciences of many
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64759:143"/>
of the Lord's precious Servants and People; and how little ſoever I may die Deſired by ſome, yet by theſe I know I do die Deſired, and their approbation, and prayers, and affection is of more value with me, then the Contradiction, or Reproach, or Hatred of many others; the love of the one I cannot Recompence, and the miſtake, or hatred, or reproach of the other; I do with all my heart Forgive; and wherein I have offended any of them, do beg their mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I do from my ſoul wish that my death may be profitable unto both, that the one may be confirmed and eſtablished in the ſtraight wayes of the Lord, and that the other (if the Lord ſo will) may be convinced, &amp; ceaſe from theſe things that are not good, &amp; do not Edify but Deſtroy.</p>
               <p>One thing I would warn yow all of, that God is wroth, yea very wroth with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and threatneth to depart and remove His candleſtick: The cauſes of his wrath are many, and would to God it were not One great cauſe, that Cauſes of Wrath are deſpiſed and rejected of men. Conſider the caſe that is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ier.</hi> 36. and the conſequence of it, and tremble and fear. I cannot but alſo ſay, that there is a great addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and increaſe of wrath. 1. By that deludge of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity that overfloweth all the Land, and hath reins looſed unto it every where, in ſo far that many have loſt not only all uſe and exerciſe of Religion, but even of Morality, and that common Civility that is to be found amongſt the Heathen. 2. By that horrible Treachery and Perjury that is in the matter of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and Cauſe of God, and Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Be aſtonished, O ye Heavens at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord; for my People have committed two evils, they have
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64759:144"/>
forſaken me the fountain of living waters, &amp; hewed them out ciſterns, broken ciſterns that can hold no water: Shall be break the Covenant, and proſper? Shal the throne of iniquity have fellowship with God, which frameth miſchief by a Law?</hi> I fear the Lord be about to bring a <hi>Sword</hi> on theſe Lands, which shall avenge the quarrell of His Covenant. 3. Horrible Ingratitude: The Lord after 10 years oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp; bondage hath broken the yoke of Strangers from off our necks; but what do we render unto Him for this goodneſs? Moſt of the fruit of our delivery is to work wickedneſs, and to ſtrengthen our Selves to do evill. 4. A moſt dreadful Idolatry, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to the Creature: We have changed the glory of the Incorruptible God, into the image of a corruptible Man, in whom many have placed almoſt all their Salvation and deſire, and have turned that which might have been a Bleſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us (being kept in a due line of Subordination under God) into an Idol of Jealouſy, by preferring it before him. God is alſo wroth with a generation of Carnal, Corrupt, Time-ſerving Miniſters: I know and bear teſtimony that in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is a True and Faithful Miniſtry: Bleſſed be God, we have yet many who ſtudy their duty, and deſire to be found faithful to their Lord and Maſter; And I pray you to Honor, and Reverence, and Eſteem much of theſe for their Works ſake: And I pray them to be encouraged in their Lord and Maſter, who is with them to make them as iron-pillars, and brazen walls, and as a ſtrong defenced city in the faithful fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of their duty: But oh! that there were not too many who mind Earthly things, and are enemies to the croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, who push with the ſide and shoulder, who ſtrengthen the hands of evill
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64759:144"/>
doers, who make themſelves tranſgreſſors, by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudying to build again what they did formerly <hi>warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi> deſtroy, I mean PRELACY, and the CERE<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>MONIES, and the SERVICE-BOOK, a Myſtery of iniquity that works amongſt us, whoſe ſteps lead unto the houſe of the great Whore, BABYLON, the Mother of fornications: Or whoſoever elſe he be that buildeth this <hi>Jericho</hi> again, let him take heed of the curſe of <hi>Hiel</hi> the <hi>Bethelite,</hi> and of that flying roll thereatened <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. And let all Miniſters take heed that they Watch, and be Stedfaſt in the Faith, and quit themſelves like men, and be ſtrong; and give faithful and ſeaſonable Warning concerning Sin and Duty. Many of the Lords People do ſadly complain of the fainting and ſilence of many Watchmen; And it concerneth them to conſider what God calleth for at their hands in ſuch a day: Silence now in a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when he is ſo much called to ſpeak, and give his Teſtimony upon the Peril of his life, is doubtleſs a great Sin. The Lord open the mouths of His Servants to ſpeak his word with all boldneſs, that Covenant-breaking may be diſcovered and reproved, and that the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt may not be ſupplanted, nor the ſouls of His People deſtroyed without a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have but a few words moe to adde: All that are Profane amongſt you, I exhort them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for the day of the Lord's vengeance haſteneth and is near: But there is yet a door of mercy open for you, if ye will not deſpiſe the day of ſalvation. All that are Maligners, and Reproachers, and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Godlineſs, and of ſuch as live godly, take heed what ye do, it will be hard for you to kick againſt the Pricks; You make your ſelves the Butt of the Lord's fury, and his flaming indignation, if ye do not
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64759:145"/>
ceaſe from and repent of all your ungodly deeds. All that are Neutral, and Indifferent, and Lukewarm Profeſſors, be zealous and repent; leſt the Lord ſpew you out of His mouth. You that lament after the Lord, and mourn for all the abominations that are done in this City, and in the Land, and take pleaſure in the ſtones and duſt of <hi>Zi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He will yet appear to your joy, God hath not caſt away his People nor work in <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> I hope it shall once more Revive by the Power of His Spirit, and take root downward and bear fruit upward. There is yet a Holy Seed and precious Remnant, whom God will preſerve and bring forth: but how Long or Dark, our Night may be, I do not know; the Lord shorten it for the ſake of his Choſen. In the mean while, be ye patient &amp; ſtedfaſt, immoveable, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord, &amp; in love one to another: Beware of Snares which are ſtrawed thick: Cleave to the Covenant &amp; Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Do not decline the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt; chooſe rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, then to enjoy the pleaſurs of ſin for a ſeaſon; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Reproach of Chriſt greater riches then all the Treaſure of the World. Let my Death grieve none of you, it will be more profitable and advantageous both for me, and for you, and for the Church of God, and for Chriſts intereſt and honor, then my life could have been. I forgive all men the guilt of it, and I deſire you to do ſo alſo: Pray for them that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you, and bleſs them that curſe you, bleſs I ſay, and curſe not. I die in the Faith of the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, &amp; Proteſtant Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, particularly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

I am a member and Miniſter. I bear my witneſs and Teſtimony to the Doctrine, Worship, Diſcipline and Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by Kirk-Seſſions, Presbyteries, Synods and Generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Popery and Prelacy, and all the trumpery of Service and Ceremonies that wait upon them, I do abhor. I do bear my witneſs unto the National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanant of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Solemn League and Covenant betwixt the three Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland, England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> Theſe Sacred, Solemn, Publick Oaths of God, I believe can be looſed nor diſpenſed with, by no Perſon, or Party, or Power upon earth: but are ſtill binding upon theſe Kingdoms, and will be for ever hereafter; and are ratifyed and ſealed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of many thouſand ſouls, ſince our entering thereinto. I bear my witneſs to the Proteſtation againſt the controverted Aſſemblies and the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; to the Teſtimonies given againſt the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; againſt the courſe of Backſliding and Defection that is now on foot in the Land, and all the branches and parts thereof, under whatſoever name or notion, or acted by whatſoever party or perſon. And in the laſt place, I bear my witneſs to the croſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and that I never had cauſe nor have cauſe this day, to repent becauſe of any thing I have ſuffered, or can now ſuffer for His Name: I take God to record upon my ſoul, I would not exchange this ſcaffold, with the Palace or Mitre of the greateſt prelate in Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Bleſſed be God, who hath shewed mercy to ſuch a wretch, and hath revealed His Son in me, and made me a Miniſter of the Everlaſting Goſpel, and that He hath daigned in the midſt of much contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Sathan and the World, to ſeal my Miniſtry upon the hearts of not a few of His People, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64759:146"/>
in the ſtation wherein I was laſt, I mean the Congregation, and Presbytery of <hi>Sterlin.</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the poor empty Man, that did there intrude upon my labors, and hath made a prey of many poor ſouls, and expoſed others to reproach, and oppreſſion, and a famine of the Word of the Lord. God forgive the miſleaders of that part of the poor people, who tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to reject their own Paſtor, and to admit of Intruders; and the Father of mercies, pity that poor Miſled people: And the Lord viſit the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Presbytery of <hi>Sterlin</hi> once more with faithful Paſtors; and grant that the Work and People of God may be revived thorow all <hi>Britain,</hi> and over all the World. Jeſus Chriſt is my Light, and my Life, my Righteouſneſs, my Strength and my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He is all my Salvation, and all my Deſire. Him, O Him I do with all the ſtrength of my ſoul commend unto you. Bleſſed are they that are not offended in Him: Bleſſed are they that Truſt in Him. Bleſs Him, O my ſoul, from henceforth even for ever. Rejoyce, rejoice all ye that love Him; be patient and rejoice in tribulation: Bleſſed are you, and bleſſed shall you be for ever and ever. Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Righteouſneſs and Eternal Salvation is yours: All are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods. Remember me O Lord with the favour thow beareſt to thy People; O viſit me with thy Salvation, that I may ſee the good of thy choſen, that I may rejoice in the gladneſs of thy Nation, that I may glory with thy Inheritance. <hi>Now let thy ſervant depart in peace ſince mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi>

               <p>THat which I intended and prepared to have ſpoken at this time &amp; in this condition, immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my death (if it should be ſo ordered that it should be my lot) is not at preſent in my power, having been taken from me: But I hope the Lord shall preſerve it to bear my Teſtimony more fully and clearly, then now I can in this condition, having my Memory much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, through much ſore and long Sickneſs, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and exceſſive drawing of my Blood. Though I bleſs the Lord my God, that notwithſtanding of the forementioned diſtempers, I am in ſome capacity to leave this short and weak Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>I deſire in the <hi>first</hi> place to confeſs my Sins, ſo far as is proper to this Place and Caſe, and to acknowledge Gods Mercies; and to expreſs my Repentance of the one, and my Faith of the other, through the merits of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our gracious Redeemer and Mediator: I confeſs that my Natural Temper (or rather diſtemper) hath been Haſty and Paſſionat; and that in my Manner of going about and proſecuting of the beſt pieces of work and ſervice to the Lord and to my Generation, I have been ſubject to my exceſſes of Heat, and thereby to ſome Precipitations; which hath no doubt offended ſtanders by and lookers on, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64759:147"/>
hath expoſed both Me and the Work to their miſtakes, whereby the beauty of that Work hath been obſcured: Neither have I in following of the Lord's work, His Good Work, been without my own Self-ſeeking; which hath ſeverall wayes vented is ſelf to the offence of both God and Man, and to the grief thereafter of my own Conſcience, and which hath often made me groan, and cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O miſerable man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> And to ly low in the duſt mourning and lamenting over the ſame, deprecating God's wrath, and begging His tender Mercies to Pardon, and His powerful Grace to cure all theſe evils. I muſt withal confeſs, that it doth not a litle trouble me, and ly heavy upon my ſpirit, and will bring me down with ſorrow to the grave (though I was not alone in this Offence, but had the body of the Nation going before me, and the Example of perſons of all Ranks to inſnare me) That I ſuffered my ſelf through the power of temptations, and the too much fear anent the ſtraits that my nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Family might be brought into, to be carried unto ſo great a length of Complyance in <hi>England</hi> with the late Uſurpers, which did much grieve the hearts of the Godly, and made theſe that ſought God ashamed and confounded for my ſake, and did give no ſmall occaſion to the Adverſary to reproach and blaſpheme, and did withall not a litle obſcure and darken the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſeverall former Actings about His bleſſed and glorious Work of Reformation, happily begun and far advanced in theſe Lands, wherein He was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to Employ, and by Employing to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me to be an Inſtrument (though the leaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthieſt of many) whereof I am not ashamed this day, but account it my Glory, how ever that Work
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64759:147"/>
be now cried down, oppoſed, laid in the duſt and trod upon: And my turning aſide to comply with theſe men, was the more aggravated in my perſon, that I had ſo frequently and ſeriouſly made profeſſion of my Averſneſs from and Abhorrence of that way, and had shown much Diſſatisfaction with theſe that had not gone ſo great a length; for which as I ſeek God's mercy in Chriſt Jeſus, ſo I deſire that all the Lord's People, from my example may be more ſtirred up to watch and pray, that they enter not into temptation.</p>

               <p>THis is a great and important work, both for us who are now to render up our ſpirits to Him that gave them; And for yow who are not a litle concerned in the Cauſe, and in our blood by juſtifying or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning our ſentence: And therefore, as we ſpeak
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64759:150"/>
to yow as Dying men, who dare not diſſemble with God or man, nor flatter our ſelves; So ye should not be idle, curious, or unconcerned Spectators.</p>
               <p>We are condemned by men, and eſteemed by many as Rebels againſt the King (whoſe Authority we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) But this is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that we ſuffer not as Evill doers, but for Righteouſneſs, for the Word of God, and Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt; And particularly for our renewing the Covenant, and in purſuance thereof, for Preſerving and Defending of our ſelves by Armes, againſt the Uſurpation and inſupportable Tyranny of the Prelats; And againſt the moſt unchriſtian and inhumane Oppreſſion and Perſecution, that ever was enjoyned and practiſed by juſt Rulers, upon Free, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and Peaceable Subjects.</p>
               <p>The Covenant and Cauſe being ſo juſt in themſelves, and the duties of Self-preſervation and mutual Defence in maintenance thereof, being to Judicious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed men ſo clear, we need to ſay the leſs for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of our Practice: Only, the Lawes eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prelacy, and the Acts, Orders and Proclamations made for Complyance therewith, being executed againſt us by Military Force and Violence; And we with others, for our ſimple Forbearance, being Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Confined, Impriſoned, Exiled, Scourged, Stigmatized, Beaten, Bound as beaſts, and Driven unto the mountains for our lives; And thereby hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Families being beggared, ſeveral Parishes and ſome whole Country-ſides exceedingly impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished; And all this, either Arbitrarily and without any Law, or reſpect had to guilt or innocency; Or Unjuſtly contrary to all Conſcience, Juſtice and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though under the Pretence of iniquous Laws;

And this being one of the greateſt Principles of Nature, warranted by the Law or God, Scriptural Inſtances, and the conſent and Practices of all Reformed Churches and Chriſtian States abroad, and of our own famous Predeceſſors at home, It cannot in reaſon or Juſtice, be reputed a Crime, nor condemned as Rebellion by any humane Authority.</p>
               <p>Though we be not the firſt that have ſuffered for the Cauſe or God within the Land, yet we are among the firſt that have been Legally condemned and put to Death Expreſly for taking the Covenant: And we are ſo far from being ashamed thereof, that we account it our honour to be reckoned worthy to ſuffer for ſuch a Cauſe; And cannot but bleſs the Lord, that we have ſuch a cloud of Witneſſes, in this and other Reformed Churches, going before us in the ſame duty for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and in Suffering therefore.</p>

               <p>As this Land was happy above all Nations, for the purity and plenty of the Goſpel, and for a Form of Church Government more conform to the Patern in the Scriptures, then in others of the Reformed Churches; So we acknowledge His great goodneſs to us in ſpeciall, that gave us our lines in ſuch pleaſant places: For we have ſuch full perſwaſion of the Truth of the Reformed Religion in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> And have felt ſo much of the Power and Sweetneſs thereof, that we do here declare our firm belief and perſwaſion of, and adherence to the ſame, in Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, Worship, Diſcipline and Government, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Nationall Covenant, the Solemn League and Covenant, the Confeſsion of Faith, Catechiſms, Directory of worship, and Propoſitions for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; Accounting it our honor and happineſs to have been born in it, to have lived in Communion with it, and now to die (through Grace) Members, Witneſſes and Aſſerters thereof.</p>

               <p>We shall ſay no more, but as we were not afraid to take our lives in our hands, ſo we are not afraid to lay them down in this Cauſe; And as we are not ashamed of Chriſt becauſe of His croſs, ſo we would not have you offended in Chriſt nor diſcouraged becauſe of us: For we bear you record, that we would not exchange lots with our Adverſaries; nor redeem our Lives, Liberties and Fortunes, at the price of Perjury and breach of Covenant.</p>

               <p>DEar Friends and Spectators, I am brought by the good providence of God to this publick place of execution (which is no dishonour) for points of Treaſon, as is alleadged; but God knoweth (who

And whoever they be that any way have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall or incenſed againſt me to procure this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt me, God forgive them, &amp; I forgive them. I am not now purpoſed to diſput the matter of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in company with theſe worthy Chriſtians who are now defeat and broken, their blood shed, and they deſpitfully mocked by many: I acknowledge and declare that I was with them. As to the cauſe of my being with them, whither in Rebellion or not God knoweth, and all <hi>Israel</hi> shall know. And for me, I ſay the Cauſe is the Lords, who made the Heaven and the Earth, though now it be hated. And I deſire to bear witneſs (with the reſt of the worthy witneſſes, who are gone before and are now ſtaged) to that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Work of Reformation in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to Goſpel-Ordinances in their Purity, as they have been taught and adminiſtrated theſe 30 Years laſt by paſt, And I adhere to the Presbyterial way of Doctrin, Worship, Diſcipline, and Government, by General Aſſemblies, Synods, Presbyteries, and Seſſions, according to the Patern of the holy Scriptures (Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the head Corner-ſtone) the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, Cathechiſmes Shorter and Larger, Directory for Worship, National Covenant, Solemne League &amp; Covenant, &amp; every Paper tending to the good of the true Religion. And this I think fit to Teſtify &amp; Declare under my hand (not knowing if I shall have any Liberty to ſpeak,) &amp; intend, God willing, to Seal with my Blood shortly. I confeſs that unexpectedly I am come to this place, (though ſome times I have had ſome ſmall thoughts of it) And I do account my ſelf highly honoured to be reckoned amongſt the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

The Bleſſings of the Eternall God be multiplied upon yow and your ſeed, and upon all the ſuffering Friends of Chriſt this day; upon my dear and loving Wife, who hath been a faithful ſympathizer with me, and upon my dear Children.

               <p>I am condemned (I shall not ſay how unjuſtly) as a Rebell againſt Man, but the Lord God of Gods He knoweth, &amp; all <hi>Iſrael</hi> shall know that it is not for Rebellion againſt God, but for endeavouring to recover the bleſſed work of Reformation, and particularly for endeavouring to extirpate Prelacy, which hath been the cauſe of ſo much ſin and ſuffering within this Land, and for renewing of the Covenant, from the obligation whereof (ſeing I made my Vow and Promiſe to the Lord) neither I my ſelf, nor any humane Authority can abſolve me. And if any account this Rebellion, I do plainly confeſs, that after the way which they call Hereſy, I worship the God of my fathers.</p>
               <p>Although the inſupportable oppreſſion, under which I and many others did groan, were enough to juſtify our Preſerving and Defending of our ſelves by Armes, yet know that the Cauſe was not Ours but the Lord's; for we ſuffered all our grievous Oppreſſions not for evill-doing, but becauſe we could not in conſcience acknowledge, comply with and obey Prelacy, and ſubmit unto the Miniſtery of Ignorant,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64759:159"/>
Light and Profane men, who were irregularly and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently thurſt upon us; Neither did we only or mainly deſigne our civil Liberties, but the Liberty of the Goſpel, the Extirpation of Prelacy, the Reſtauration of our faithful Paſtors, the Suppreſſion of Profanity, Promoving of Piety, the ſaving of ourſelves from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt violence, untill we had preſented our Grievances and Deſires; And in a word, the Recovering of the once glorious, but now ruined Work of Reformation, in Doctrine, Worship, Diſcipline and Government, according to the Nationall Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant, to which I declare my adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and through grace shall ſeal the ſame with my blood.</p>

And cannot but regret that others of the Lord's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they heard of us, did not come forth with ſpeed to help the Lord againſt the Mighty; much more let all mourn, that not only many have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Enemies, but alſo conjured themſelves againſt the Lord, &amp; the ſame Covenant which they ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſware; And as for the Petition it ſelf, I knew not that expreſſion was in it.</p>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64759:160"/>
to mourn for the ſame, and pray that the Lord for Chriſt's ſake may freely forgive me, as I have forgiven them that have wronged me, and hope through the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to obtain the ſame; And I do exhort all and every one of my friends to more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Prayer and ſtedfaſtneſs, alwayes abounding in the Work of the Lord; And above all things, to deteſt &amp; shun that wicked Declaration againſt the Covenant, the apparant temptation of the time, and the very mark of Antichriſtian Prelacy.</p>
               <p>All that I have is but little, but if I had many Worlds, I would lay them all down, as now I do my life for Chriſt and His Cauſe, nothing doubting but the Lord will abundantly provide for my Wife and my ſix Children, whom I commit to the Lord's care, and recommend to the Kindneſs and Prayers of the faithful; And do lay an expreſs charge on my Wife that she shew all my Children, that I have bound them all to the Covenant, for which now I lay down my life, and that She lay it upon them as my laſt command, that they adhere to every Article thereof.</p>
               <p>The Work and People of God are brought very low: It may be, becauſe they were not ripe for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; And for the greater triall, and filling up of the cup of the Adverſaries; Or, becauſe there was litle, or leſs prayer then should have been amongſt theſe who appeared at this time, that the Lord hath made this late breach. But, dear Friends, be not therefore tempted to call in queſtion the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; or to think the worſe of Chriſt and His Cauſe, becauſe of ſufferings; Nor be discouraged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe few who took their lives in their hands, fell before the Adverſary; For as ſufferings are often ſweetned by the Spirit of God and Glory that reſteth

upon the ſufferers, and afterward bring forth the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs unto them that are exerciſed thereby; So the Lord will ariſe in due time, and have mercy upon <hi>Zion,</hi> and plead the cauſe which is his own: And this Teſtimony, as I am this day to ſeal with my blood, ſo I ſubſcribe with my hand.</p>

               <p>BEing by a great ſurpriſal of Providence, thus ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the World, in a matter of ſo univerſall concernment to all that fear God and deſire to be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in his Covenant, I could not forbear to leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me this ſtanding Teſtimony, concerning the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and Uſes thereof, for the Glory of God, for the Vindication of my Profeſſion from the aſperſions caſt thereon by Men, and the Edification of theſe by my death, to whom I had devoted my Life in the work of the Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>I have eſteemed the Government of this Church by <hi>Presbytery,</hi> to be among the chief of the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, which by his blood he hes purchaſed, and aſcended up on high to beſtovv as a gift upon it; as being the very Goſpell-Miniſtery in it's Simplicity and Purity from the Inventions of Men, and ſo the Mean
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64759:162"/>
by which other Ordinances are adminiſtred, and the moſt fundamental Truths made effectual in the hearts of his People, and therefore that it ought with that ſame carefulneſs to be contended for. Experience both of the having and wanting of it, hath given it this Epiſtle of Commendation, ſo as it may be both known and read of all men: Which is alſo true of the ſolemne Engagements of the Nation thereto, by the Nationall Covenant, and Solemn League and Covenant, which I have eſteemed in their Riſe &amp; Renewing, pregnant performances of that promiſe, <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 44.5. where it is evident, that where Church Reformations come to any maturity, they arrive at this degree of <hi>ſaying I am the Lords &amp; ſubſcribing with the hand unto the Lord.</hi> So was it in the dayes of the Reforming Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and after the Reſtauration from the Captivity in the dayes of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah:</hi> This ſame promiſe did the Lord Jeſus make <hi>Yea &amp; Amen</hi> to us, when he redeemed us from ſpirituall <hi>Babilon,</hi> which is ſo much the greater evidence, that theſe were the very Motions of Gods Spirit in our firſt Reformers, that they were expreſſly deſigned againſt the greateſt motions of the Spirit of Darkneſs in Antichriſt and his ſuppoſts, and againſt the greateſt confirmations that ever theſe Abominations attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and that bloody Bond called, the <hi>Holy League.</hi> And therefore whatever indignity is done unto theſe Covenants, I do eſteeme to be no leſs then doing deſpite unto the ſpirit of Grace in his moſt eminent Exerting of himſelf; but eſpecially <hi>Declaring</hi> againſt the ſame as flowing from a Spirit of Sedition and Rebellion, to be a Sin of the ſame nature with theirs, who aſcribed Chriſt his caſting out of Devils to <hi>Beelzebub</hi>; and that with this aggravation, that theſe <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> came never

Upon the ſame reaſons at <hi>Lanrik,</hi> with the reſt I declared my adherence to the Covenant, by my lifting up of my hand, after the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles thereof were read.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but with greef of heart acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg my fainting in a day of trial, that being ingaged with them upon ſuch accounts, I many times in fear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to withdraw, and at length did, which as it was the occaſion of my falling into the hands of the Enemy, ſo I think among other things it was the cauſe why God delivered me into their hands. Upon the ſame fear, in all my Examinations I have denied my ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them, and endeavoured to Vindicate my ſelf by aſſerting the real deſignes I had to part from
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64759:163"/>
them, and have utterly caſt away the glory of a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which my very being in their company as a favourer of the ends of the Covenant, and as one will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to contribute my beſt endeavours for the promov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, but eſpecially my declaring for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, did bear unto the Truth and Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt againſt this untoward Generation: This I confeſſe to be no leſs then a denying of Jeſus Chriſt, and a being ashamed of his Words before men; but I hope the Lord who remembreth that we are but frail duſt, shall not lay it to my charg, but according to his faithfulneſs and Grace will forgive me, who by this Publick Confeſſion, take to my ſelf shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of face, and fly to the propitiation offered to all ſinners in Jeſus Chriſt. And theſe things as they have procured this death unto me, as an act of Gods Juſtice; ſo they mind me of other evils in mine own heart, that have been the ſource of this my unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs to take on Chriſt's Croſs: My heart hath not ſtudied to maintaine that Spirituality in walking with God and Edifying Exemplarineſs with others, that became one that had receaved the firſt fruits of the Spirit and aimed at the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, living in times of ſo much calamity for the Church of God, and particular afflictions as to my ſelf. If I had ſpent my dayes in groaning after my houſe from Heaven, would I have shifted ſo fair an occaſion of being cloathed with it? Alas that I have loved my Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt ſo litle! Alas that I have done ſo litle ſervice to him, that I have ſo litle labour to follow Me to my Everlaſting reſt. This I ſpeak to theſe eſpecially, with whom I have familiarly converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Pilgrimage, that ſeing the Lord will not grant me Life to teſtify my real Reformation of theſe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64759:163"/>
things, my aknowledgement at Death may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them, to ſtudy not only Godlineſs but the Power of it.</p>
               <p>As I acknowledg that I have not been free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous in theſe particulars formentioned, ſo in other things, wherein I interponed that Holy name of God, as to the not being upon the Contrivance of this riſeing in Armes, nor privy to any reſolution thereanent, nor conſcious of any Intelligence at home or abroad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, I was moſt ingenuous: And they have wronged me much, who ſaid that I denied upon Oath, that which they were able to make out againſt me, or knew to be truth; But non alleage Perjury againſt me, but ſuch as are ſo manifeſtly guilty of it before the World, that their tougnes in ſuch alleagances are no ſlander.</p>
               <p>Although I be Judged and condemned as a Rebell amongſt Men, Yet I hope even in order to this Action to be accepted as Loyal before God. Nay there can be no greater act of Loyalty to the King, as the times now go, then for every man to do his utmoſt for the Exſtirpation of that abominable plant of Prelacy, which is the bane of the Throne and of the Countrey: which if it be not done, the Throne shall never be eſtablished in Righteouſneſs, until theſe wicked be removed from before it. Sure I ame theſe who are now comdemned as Rebels againſt Him by them, are ſuch as have ſpent much time in prayer for Him, and do more ſincerely wish his ſtanding, and have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured it more by this late action ſo much condemned, then the Prelates by condemning them to death.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Diſaſter</hi> hath heightened greatly the Afflictions of our Chuch, and ought to teach all of you to drink the Wine of Aſtonishment: Ye have not known tribulation till now: Now we Judg them happy that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64759:164"/>
are fallen aſleep and removed far away, and know that God hath been taking away his Servants from the Evils that were to come. Know that God's deſigne is to make many hearts contrite, that have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly too whole, and have not lamented ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the removeall of his Ordinances and Miniſtery, and the reproach rubed upon the Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beware that your ſorrow be not a momentany motion of commoun Compaſſion, that evanisheth when it may be there is ſome intermiſſion in this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courſe of sheding innocent blood: Labour to have a conſtant impreſſion that may ſacrifice the heart, nay ye vvould live much in apprehenſion of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgment. Certainly the Withdrawing of many from us, and not contributing their help to the great work, they were ingaged to, as well as we, the generall Riſeing againſt us in many places of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but above all this open sheding of the blood of the Saints, which involveth the land in the guiltineſs of all the righteous blood shed from the foundation of the World, have made <hi>Scotland</hi> fit fuell for the fire of Gods Wrath. I can ſay nothing concerning times to come, but this, All things shall work together for good to them that Love God, and ſo this preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation; And they shall have moſt comfort in this promiſe, who are moſt willing that ſuch afflictions as we are brought to, be the way that God choiſeth to work their good.</p>
               <p>Commit wholly the management of all maters to God, and make it your intire ſtudy night and day to keep your very garments clean: It is hard in times of ſo generall Corruptions not to be defiled one way or other; be free of the Sin as you would be of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which will certainly be ſuch as will make all
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64759:164"/>
the Churches Know, that God is the ſearcher of the hearts and trier of the reins, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.23. and ſo will not be mocked by theſe pretences whereby, men colour their going along in an evill courſe, from the real Love that they have to a preſent world. If naked <hi>Preſence</hi> amongſt them who are eſteemed Rebels by men, be ſufficient to engage them in the Crime and Punishment (for that is all the ground of my Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) shall not God be much more Zealous of his own glory, againſt all who ſo much as ſeem to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with this courſe of backſliding.</p>
               <p>As a good Mean and encouragement, to all the duties of our time, labour to be rooted and grounded in the Love of Jeſus Chriſt; This will be tender of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that may have the leaſt reflexion upon him, His Words or Works, and will prompt the ſoul to Zealous appearing for Him at the greateſt hazard, and to as much willingneſs to die for Him, as to Live that they may Glorify Him. And for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of yow all in this matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do declare, that ever ſince the day of my coming into priſon, God hath keeped my ſoul free from all Amazement or fear of death; that ſince my inditement and ſentence, God hath ſo manifeſted Himſelf at ſeveral times, that he hath lifted up my ſoul above Prelats, Principalities, &amp; PowerS, Death &amp; Hell, to rejoice &amp; be glad in His Salvation; and from my ſoul to account him Worthy, for whom in this his Cauſe I should undergo the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt shame or Paine; And to aſſured hopes of Eternal Communion with Him in Heaven: And that nothing hath more brangled my peace, then shifting, an open and free teſtimony before my Examinators, to the work that I was ingaged in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:64759:165"/>I do freely pardon all that have acceſſion to my blood, and wish that it be not laid to the charg of this ſinful Land, but that God would grant Repentance to our Rulers, that they may obtaine the ſame recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with Him, whereof I myſelf do partake. Truely I beleeve many of them if not inſtigated by the cruel Prelats (at whoſe door our blood doth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally lie) would have uſed more mitigation: But that reluctancy of mind to shed blood, will be ſo far from Vindicating of them, that upon the contrary, it will be a witneſs againſt them in the Day of the Lord.</p>
               <p>I heartily ſubmit my ſelf to Death, as that which God hath appointed to all men becauſe of Sin, and to this particular way of it, as deſerved by my particular Sins. I praiſe God for this Fatherly chaſtiſement, whereby he hath made me in part and will make me perfectly partaker of his Holineſs. I glorify Him that called me forth to ſuffer for His Name and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the ſolemne engagements of the Land to Him, and that he hath taken this way to take me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the evill to come. The Lord bleſs all His Poor Afflicted groaning People that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
               <p>Hereafter I will not talk with flesh and blood, nor think on the Worlds conſolations: Farewel all my Friends whoſe company hath been refreshful to me in my Pilgrimage; I have done with the Light of the Sun and Moon, Welcome Eternal Life, Everlaſting Love, Everlaſting Praiſe, Everlaſting Glory. Praiſe to Him that ſits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever. Though I have not been ſo with Thee as I ought to have been in the Houſe of my Pilgrimage, yet thow haſt made with me an Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64759:165"/>
Ordered in all things and Sure. And this is all my Salvation, and all my deſire. Bleſs the Lord O my Soul! that hath pardoned all my Iniquities in the Blood of His Son, and healed all my Deſeaſes. Bleſs Him O all ye his Angels that excel in ſtrength, ye Miniſters that do his pleaſure. Bleſs the Lord O my Soul! Halelujah.</p>

               <p>I Am condemned to die I shall ſay little concerning men who have judged and condemned me, they are to anſwer to God for it; But I bleſs the Lord, who
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64759:166"/>
hath counted me worthy to die for ſo good and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a cauſe. And that I be not miſtaken after I am gone hence, I have thought fit to teſtify that in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſincerity of heart, I came into the ſervice, not conſtrained but from conſcience of my being engaged by Covenant to God, and with a full purpoſe to perform my vows made in that Covenant unto the Lord, in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt; And that I might endeavour to reſtore again the precious Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to their former purity &amp; power, and to recover the fair Church in this Land (which our bleſſed Lord hath purchaſed to Himſelf, and bought at ſo dear a rate) to her former Beauty, which is now defaced: And particularly to bring down that Antichriſtian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, and that perjured crue of Prelats, who have ſo perfidiouſly wronged the Intereſts of our bleſſed Lord and Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt. This is the only Cauſe for which I undertook this ſervice, and joyned with others my dear and Covenanted brethren; And that I had no intention to wrong the King's perſon or Authority, but to ſeek his real good, according to my duty in the Word of God, and alſo as I ſware in the ſame Covenant wherein I did ſwear againſt Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And notwithſtanding I be condemned of men as a <hi>Rebel,</hi> yet I am juſtifyed of God, my God and Father, in and through my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who giveth me ſweet peace of conſcience and joy of heart; I grant it is not enough to juſtify me before Him, that I had a juſt Cauſe, unleſs likewiſe I had therewith the acceptation of my perſon through Faith in the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſtandeth in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in heaven, which I dare declare this day as a dying man, that I have obtained; for I am confident that through His righteouſneſs made over unto me, He
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64759:166"/>
hath made me free, in which I shall ſtand for ever; and that within a few hours I shall ſee Him in peace, as I am ſeen of Him; and behold and wonder, and wonder and behold for evermore that moſt glorious excellency of His. And this yeeldeth to me great conſolation in all my extremities, were they never ſo great; This I ſay is my peace and conſolation this day, even Chriſt my Righteouſneſs, who hath both accepted my Perſon and Cauſe: Therefore I count it a ſmall thing to be judged and condemned of men, for my Teſtimony is on high, and my record in heaven.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>my Friends,</hi> I am condemned to die for adhering to my Covenant made with God, for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion and Converſation, to which all ranks of the Land are as well bound as I, though many (alas! too many) shaking off all fear of God have deſpiſed the Oath, not only by breaking the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but by profeſſing and declaring avowedly the bond thereof null, and not binding either to their own or other mens conſciences: And this miſchief is framed by a Law, which doth greatly highten the Sin; O! tell it not in <hi>Oath,</hi> and publish it not in <hi>Askelon.</hi> Oh! that this should be heard of amongſt Papiſts and Pagans, that profeſſed Reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants should ſtand in ſo litle aw of a ſolemn Oath, and Name of the great and living God.</p>
               <p>But I exhort and obteſt you all, that ſo much the more as others have made void His Covenant, you would eſteem it the more precious, and cloſely follow the Reformation vowed, in every Article thereof, upon all occaſions given you of the Lord; And that you abhor, deteſt and refuſe any engagement whatſoever, that may wrong your Oath in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant directly or indirectly, as ye would eſcape the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64759:167"/>
wrath of God that is coming on ſuch breaking of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but rather choiſe the greateſt extremity of affliction, then the leaſt ſin of this ſort; as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, who refuſed to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but chuſed rather to ſuffer reproach for Chriſt; And be not afraid of ſuffering for Chriſt, as though it were an evill thing, neither ſcar ye at His croſs, for the Lord Himſelf ſaith, <hi>My yoke is eaſy and My burthen light</hi>; Yea it is lighter to us then to many that ſtand by: Believe; Faith maketh all burthens light to the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sufferer.</p>
               <p>And now I beſeech you believers in Chriſt, abide in Him and bring forth fruit unto Holineſs, and ſtudy tenderneſs in all manner of converſation, and holineſs without which no man shall ſee the Lord; And let not this profane and mocking Generation have any thing to reproach you with, but that whereof you would not be ashamed, that when you ſuffer ye may not ſuffer as evill doers, that whereas they ſpeak evill of you, they may be ashamed that falſly accuſe your good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Chriſt. It is not knowledge nor a bare Profeſſion that glorifieth God, but Tenderneſs, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Righteouſneſs, that do commend Religion and His Cauſe to all men, and shall convince your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of their Wickedneſs in wronging you, and make them the more inexcuſable in that day when they shall be judged: Yea, what know ye, but ye may win others by your tender and good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?</p>
               <p>I recommend to you, that ye would be much and fervent in the uſe of that precious duty of Prayer, wherein moſt near Communion with God upon earth is to be found: Be much in prayer, with and for others- Forſake not the aſſembling of your ſelves
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64759:167"/>
together as the manner of ſome is (I wish they may ſee the evill of it who neglect it) but exhort one another, and ſo much the more, as ye ſee the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching: Earneſtneſs and diligence will haſten the Lord's coming with relief unto you, and to the Lords born-down Work; and your ſlackneſs in this, may make the wheels of His chariot to move the more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the effectuall fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much with God; It will do more then Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of men and weapons of War for your defence and deliverance.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you alſo, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint yourſelves with the Word of God in the Holy Scripture, that ye may have acquaintance with Jeſus Chriſt who is clearly ſet forth therein; that ye may know Him in His excellency and come to love and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Him whom ye know; that ye may be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with His revealed will therein, and may know what is truth, and cleave faſt thereto, from a ſure perſuaſion that it hath the warrant of His Word; and may be guarded againſt every error of the wicked, and that ye may fully know what is good and what is evill; And that ye may ſuffer with confidence, when ye are brought forth thereto as I am.</p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> be ye perfect, be of good comfort, be of one minde, live in peace- and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</p>

               <p>REverence the good Providence of the Lord our God, who can do nothing wrong; For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever He doth is well-done, and my Soul faith, <hi>Amen.</hi> I had not a will of my own (my Heart) ſince that day wherein Yow and I parted, My Lord and my God captivated it, &amp; brought it to a ſubmiſſion unto His will: I bleſs Him for evermore for it, that I was never left to my own will: Praiſe, O praiſe Him all ye living! And O thou my ſoul praiſe the Lord for it. I bleſs the Lord for evermore that ever He viſited my Fathers Family, that ever He condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to come unto my Fathers Family, and to give a viſit to the like of me: He viſited me there, and ſet his Love upon me, and hath choſen me for this very end, to be a witneſs for his covenanted Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this my Soul is glad, and my Glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth for this Honour wherewith He hath honoured me; And that, though I be condemned to die by men on earth, yet am I juſtifyed of God through the blood of my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who ſtandeth in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Heaven, and hath made me free through his imputed Righteouſneſs made over unto me, in which I ſtand for ever; And within a few hours I shall ſee Him in peace, as I am ſeen of Him, and behold and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64759:168"/>
wonder, and wonder &amp; behold for evermore, even that moſt glorious excellency which is in Him. All that which is ſpoken of Him is but litle: O my Heart, my dear Love, come and ſee I beſeech yow! I thought I had known ſomething of my deareſt Lord before, that I had ſome love from and to Him before, But never was it ſo with me, as it hath been with me ſince I came within the doors of this Priſon; many a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious viſit hath his gracious Majeſty given unto me. He is without all compariſon; O love, love Him! 0 come to Him, O taſte and ſee, and that shall reſolve the queſtion beſt. The thing I ſuffer for is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted Reformation. I bleſs God, and all that is within me doth bleſs and magnify His Holy Name for this, tnat <hi>Scotland</hi> did ever enter into a Covenant with the Lord, into a ſworn Covenant, with the hand lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the Lord: And I have now ſworn and renued this Covenant again for my ſelf &amp; you, and my four Children in all the parts and points thereof; And I pray, God help you to abide in the Covenant for ever.</p>
               <p>And now I give you and my four Children unto the Lord, and commit you ro Him as your Covenanted God and Husband, &amp; my Childrens Covenanted Father. I ſay no more, but either ſtudy to be indeed a ſincere Chriſtian, &amp; a ſeeker of His face in ſincerity, or elſe you will be nothing at all. I recommend you and your young-ones to Him, who is God All-ſufficient, and aboundeth in Mercy and Love to them that Love Him and keep his Covenant. The bleſſing of the Covenant be upon you, ſo fare you well. So ſaith</p>

               <p>I Am come here to die, and I thank God, it is not for evill doing that I now ſuffer: although I be charged with Rebellion againſt the Kings Authority, yet 1 declare before God and you all, that in all this matter I never intended to wrong his Majeſtie's juſt Power and greatneſs, but for conſcience ſake did reſpect Authority as the Ordinance of God appointed for the punishment of evill doers, and that I wish his Ma: all welfare both in this life, and the world to come, and that it may be his happineſs to conſider his Obligations to God and Perform the ſame, that ſo it may be well with him and his Poſterity to many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and I pray God make him a friend to His Cauſe and the truly Godly who own the ſame, though falſly called Phanaticks or turbulent perſons.</p>
               <p>I declare I have ſuch perſuaſion of the Intereſt of Religion Reformed, and ſworn unto in the Covenant that I dare venture not only to lay down my own life, but if every hair of my head were a man, they should all be put to venture for this cauſe: I would not have the world to ſtumble at the Cauſe, becauſe of my death after this manner; for I rejoyce greatly in it, and I deſire every good Chriſtian as they tender their own ſouls that they would grip faſt, lay hold on, and cleave to Jeſus Chriſt and His way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:64759:169"/>My coming out at this time (I ſay) was not againſt his Majeſty, but for the Covenant which is now troden under foot; my intention was for the Cauſe of Chriſt; I take God to witneſs, it was nothing elſe I came out for, and for that I am free to lay down my life.</p>
               <p>I bleſs God I am much encouraged in this, and not at all afraid to die for ſo good and clear a Cauſe; and I hope He will bring me thorow all my difficulties in this dark shadow of death: I hope I have the peace of a good conſcience, and have had ſome glimpſes from Jeſus Chriſt of His countenance and reconciled Face, ſince I came into this priſon, for which I deſire to bleſs His Name with all my ſoul, heart and ſpirit. And I rejoyce that He hes made uſe of me to ſuffer for His Cauſe; And I think it too litle, not only to lay down my body, but (if it were poſſible) even my very ſoul at the ſtake for that Cauſe and for Jeſus Chriſt my good and kind Maſter, who hath loved me and given Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for me. I give the Lord thanks that I had ſome of His Preſence ſince I came into this condition: and again I ſay, I am much encouraged and not afraid to die, and bleſs Him that I die not as a murtherer, or evill door, or Rebel to Authority, but for ſuch a cauſe as this.</p>
               <p>O that it were the happineſs of my Nation of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> once to ſubiect themſelves unto the ſweet yoke of Chriſts Reformed Government, under which this Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath enjoyed ſo much of the Power and life of the Goſpel, by a faithful Miniſtry according to the Covenant ſworn by them both.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>my dear Friends in Chriſt, and fellow-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters,</hi> though I be a ſtranger in this Land, being an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-man,</hi> but trifted by providence in the proſecution
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64759:170"/>
of my calling, to have my reſidence for a time here in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which I look upon, as a ſingulare evidence of God's ſpecial love to me, though I be a ſtranger, I ſay, to many of you, yet I muſt be bold as a dying friend, to beſeech you by the mercy of God, and by your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before Jeſus Chriſt, when we shall have to do with none but Him as our Judge, that ye be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſtedfaſt in the Cauſe of God, and Covenant which ye have ſworn with hands lifted up to the moſt high God, which no Power on earth can looſe you from, and that ye keep you from ſnares unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and not ſuffer your ſelves to fall into a deteſtable Neutrality and Indifferency in that Cauſe of God; And eſpecially that ye keep your ſelves free of any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements by word or write, that may wrong your Oath of the Covenant. I commit my Wife and Children to His care, who careth for them that put their truſt in Him before the Sons of men, not doubting but they shall be eyed with goodwil and favor by the Godly, after I am gone. And now I render up my Spirit to Him who gave it me, and for whoſe ſake I now lay down my life. To this God, my Covenanted God, be glory, bleſſing and praiſe for now and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>I am come here this Day to this Place to die this Death, for crimes for which (I thank God) my Conſcience doth not condemn me. My crime, as is alleaged, is for Diſloyalty againſt the King's Majeſty; Yet I thank God, that my appearing lately with the Lord's People was from my ſenſe of my obligation in the Covenant, and the ſenſe of the wrongs done in the Land, and the crying oppreſſions committed therein. This was the end of my appearing for the Lord againſt His enemies, to bear witneſs againſt the ſame: The which obligation of the Oath of God, I judge that none on earth can looſe the Conſcience from. I bleſs the Lord again and again, I die for this Oath and Covenant; And I thank God alſo, that I have by the great mercy of the Almighty God in Chriſt Jeſus, obtained mercy and forgiveneſs for all my tranſgreſſions both againſt the firſt and ſecond Table of the Law: And that through that Ocean of grace which is in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I believe that I am juſtified and ſanctified, and believe now to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Him, by that bleſſed blood of His, which hath purchaſed this Salvation to me, through faith in the ſame, made application of, according to the good Covenant of grace. He hath performed this, out of his vvonderfull and incomparable free-grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64759:171"/>
this is my joy and exceeding great rejoycing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and all my ſalvation, for vvhich I am Grace's debtor throughout all Eternity. I die vvith this my Teſtimony, my adherence to the National Covenant, to the Solemn League and Covenant, to the Work of Reformation a great length carried on, and now over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown moſt ſinfully by ungodly Men, vvho have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished their Apoſtacy by Law, which no juſt Power on earth could ever do. Alſo I adhere to the Presbyterial Government, the Confeſſion of Faith, Cathechiſms Larger and Shorter, And to the Solemn Acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> And Publick Teſtimonies thereof againſt the ſins of the time. This day I rejoyce that He hath counted me vvorthy to lay dovvn my life for Him, as one that beareth vvitneſs againſt the breach of all the Sacred Oaths and Ties that were eſtablished in this Land, yea by the juſt Laws both of God and Man, which never could have been repealed lawfully, as this wicked Generation hath done.</p>
               <p>Dear Friends, I hope ye will ſtand faſt in this Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and in the Solemn Oaths and Ties ye are under, and all the body of the Land alſo will be ſtedfaſt in the ſame, upon the greateſt hazard ye can meet with; And that ye will ſtudy perfect holineſs and nearneſs with God, which will help to keep you ſtraight in this day of Perſecution and sharp Triall that is now raging in this Land: I bleſs the Lord, I die not a fool, though ſome men have thought ſo of me by their ſpeeches to me, ſince my impriſonment: neither durſt I ever be the man to buy my liberty at ſuch a dear rate as Perjury, and to shake off theſe bleſſed bonds I did vvillingly come under; And I thank God, I never yet to this moment rued or repented it; And ſure I am
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64759:171"/>
it is better for me to ſuffer the vvorſt of deaths, then to preſerve my life by breaking the Oaths of God. I alſo give my Teſtimony againſt Prelacy and that vvick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hierarchy novv eſtablished in this Land, as that vvhich the Church of Chriſt could never bear until this day, it being ſuch a grand Enemy to the purity of the Goſpel, and povver of Godlineſs, yea a yoke vvhich the Church of God groaneth under. I have no more to ſay, but commends all you the lovers of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to God Himſelf, and to the good vvord of His grace, vvhich is able to build you up untill the day of His appearance, and to give you all an inheritance with them that are ſanctified through faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And ſubſcribes my ſelf an expectant and apparent heir of the grace of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>I Am here condemned to die upon alleaged Rebellion againſt the King and his Authority, which God knoweth, I never intended. For in my judgement, a man's endeavouring to extirpate perjured Prelates and abjured Prelacy, according as he is bound by Oath in a ſworn Covenant, may very well ſtand with a man's Loyalty to King and Countrey; for I am ſure, the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64759:172"/>
King and his Subjects may be happy, yea more happy in the extirpation of <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Prelacy,</hi> then in their ſtanding; Yea the Throne shall never be eſtablished in peace, until that wicked plant be plucked up by the roots, which hath ſo much waſted and made deſolate the Lord's Vineyard: For my part, I pray that the Lord may bleſs our King with bleſſings from Heaven, and make him a friend to the Intereſts of Chriſt, as the beſt way for the ſtanding of his Throne to many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; And I pray for all that are in Authority under his Majeſty, that the Lord may not lay to their charge the innocent blood of His Saints, which they have shed. But the ground of my ſentence is truly, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Covenant with my God, and labouring to defend the ſame, according to my Oath: And this I profeſs is and was my duty, and by the grace of God will not quite it; And in token hereof, I am here before you all to lay down my life in defence of the ſame, and require you all to be witneſſes to this my Teſtimony; I do declare, I am not ashamed, but count it my glory. I do likewiſe declare this before you all in the ſight of God, the Judge of all hearts, that ſince the day I did firſt ſwear and ſubſcribe this Covenant for Reformation, it hath been ſweet unto me, for I am perſuaded in my Conſcience of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſs thereof. I did ſwear the Covenant four times, and the laſt time at <hi>Lanerk,</hi> which was the ſweeteſt time to me of them all; For with my whole ſoul I renewed it, and gave up both my ſoul and body to Him, to be at His diſpoſal, which, I truſt in God, I shall never rue. Hearty praiſe and thanks be to the bleſſed God, that ever it pleaſed Him to give unto this poor Church that mercy to enter in Covenant with Himſelf, that He might be unto us a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64759:172"/>
God, the richeſt mercy that can be beſtowed on men. I have lived a Presbyterian in my judgement, according as I have ſworn, and judge it to be the only way that God hath appointed in His word, for the Government of His Church on earth; for under that Government the power and practice of Religion hath greatly flourished, and many a ſoul hes been converted to the Lord, and found ſweet fellowship with Him in His Ordinances, by the Miniſtry of His honeſt and and lawfully called Servants. And bleſſed be the day that ever I heard a faithfull ſent Miniſter preach the Goſpell. I do declare before heaven and earth that my whole deſigne in this Riſing in Armes, was only againſt abjured <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Prelaetes,</hi> the great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors of God's Intereſts, and cruell perſecuters of His People, both in their conſciences and bodies; and I judge their Government and why not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the Word of God in the Holy Scriptures. I might cite many Scriptures to this purpoſe, but I shall only name two <hi>Luke</hi> 22.26. <hi>but ye ſhall not be ſo; but he that is greateſt among you, let him be as the yonger; and be that is chief, as he that doth ſerve.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>neither as being Lords over God's heritage, &amp;c.</hi> Yea it may be ſeen from ſad experience, that under their Government, the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath decayed, and avowed profanity and Popery it ſelf hath increaſed, both to the dishonor of the holy Lord, and the great grief of the hearts of the Godly. I am ſo perſuaded of tne truth of the Covenant, and of the error of their way, and that Jeſus Chriſt is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King and Lord over His own Houſe, and beſides Him there is none elſe, for He will not give His glory to another, I am ſo perſuaded of theſe things, that I
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64759:173"/>
dare ſeal the truth thereof with my blood, and am come hither for the ſame end, without any fear or amazement; yea if every hair of mine head were a man, I would have ventured all according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which I made with my God; And although I be a poor polluted ſinner, and my houſe not ſo with God, as it became; yet hath He made with me an everlaſting Covenant, well ordered in all things and ſure, and this is all my Salvation and all my deſire; And I hope the Lord will ſoon tread down all His enemies with shame, and the enemies of His Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant alſo. Therefore, let all that love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and His Truth and Covenant, take comfort and courage, notwithſtanding of all that which is come to paſs, And let them not be ashamed to adhere thereunto, whatſoever ſufferings they meet with there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for He will make up that loſs in Himſelf, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the wrongs done to Himſelf &amp; them in His own due time: I aſſure you, Chriſt is a good Maſter to ſerve: if ye knew Him rightly &amp; His croſs, it is ſweet &amp; eaſy to the believer; for He maketh death to be life, and bringeth light out of darkneſs. I deſire to follow the bleſſed Captain of my ſalvation through well and wo. I beſeech you, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> whom now I am to part with, that ye ſtand to the defence of all the truths of God and of His Word; &amp; that ye receive the Lord Chriſt, as He hath offered Himſelf therein, ye who have not cloſed with Him; And that he who hath cloſed with Him, abide in Him by a lively faith and love, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth fruits, that you may put credit on your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and keep off every thing that may shame your glorious and bleſſed Maſter before this evill and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous generation. And I give you all warning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

will anſwer to Him, who shall judge the quick and dead, that ye ſtand faſt in all the duties ye are ſworn unto in the National and in the Solemn League and Covenant, both towards God, your King and one another: And that ye beware of ſnares in taking of any Oaths or Declarations contrary in the leaſt, to the Oath of God in theſe Covenants. I leave my wife and little children upon Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, who are now to be made a widow and fatherleſs for His ſake, truſting, He will care for them; And I recommend them to the counſell and kindneſs of His people under Him. I can forgive the wrong done to me in taking away my life for this Cauſe, and wish God to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to theſe that have condemned me, or have had any hand in my death: But bleſſed be God, that brought and hath kept me on His ſide of this Cauſe, and honoured me to be a publick witneſs for Him and His bleſſed Truth; and Cauſe; for which I shall praiſe Him in the World to come, whether I now go: yea I will praiſe Him on the borders of Death &amp; Eternity.

               <p>His text was <hi>Song.</hi> 1.7.

Yet during all this ſpace, to the certain knowledge and ſweet remembrance of all that converſed with him, he was moſt ſeriouſly exerciſed in the Study of Piety and true Knowledge, wherein as he greatly advanced above all his equalls, ſo at length he became moſt eminent and exemplary.</p>
               <p>While he is thus living and employed at his Fathers houſe, the late Troubles ariſing: in the <hi>Weſt</hi> fall out; and the newes thereof having alarmed him with the reſt of that Countrey, upon the 18. of <hi>Nov.</hi> laſt, being the Sabbath; for ſuch motives and upon ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as he himſelf doth fully afterward declare, he joined himſelf to thoſe who roſe in theſe parts for the aſſiſting of that poor afflicted Party, as in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, by their Covenant, they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indiſpenſably obliged.</p>

Only this is certain, that being of a thin body, and tender conſtitution, he was ſo diſabled and weakened with the toil and fatigue of continual marching and tempeſtuous weather (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at <hi>Air,</hi> where he lay a conſiderable time, as if he had been dead, by reaſon of fainting) that he could no longer endure it. Whereupon, on <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Novemb.</hi> 27. he was neceſſitated to part from them in the morning, near to the New Bridge upon <hi>Cramond</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:64759:175"/>
water: And in his way towards <hi>Libberton</hi> Parish, about twelve of the clock paſſing through <hi>Bread's Craigs,</hi> he was taken, without reſiſtance, having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſmall ordinary ſword, by ſuch of the Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as were then ſent out to view the fields; in which paſſage it is very obſervable, that his eſcape formerly mentioned was not more miraculous, then his preſent taking was fatal: for it is without queſtion, had he but retained and obſerved the leaſt of that adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and caution, wherein at other times he was known to be both ready &amp; very happy, he might, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either hazard or trouble, have eſcaped this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; but God who gave him the full experience of his turning all things unto the good of them that love Him, did thus by his ſimplicity and folly, prepare the way for His own Glory and His ſervants joy and Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>Being brought to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and firſt to the Towns Council-houſe, in their ſearch for letters he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſtript; and there being none found, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted priſoner to the Tolbuith.</p>
               <p>Upon the Wedenſday, being the 28 of <hi>November</hi> by order from the Secret Council, he was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> Lord <hi>Sinclar, Sir Robert. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray of Preiſt-field</hi> and others, in order to his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and being interrogate concerning his joyning &amp; being with the <hi>Weſi-land</hi> forces, he conceaving himſelf not obliged by any Law or Reaſon, to be his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, to the deſtruction of his life, did plainly deny the queſtion; but being deſired to ſigne with his hand, what he had ſaid and they cauſed write, though at firſt he appeared willing, yet partly being adviſed by the Lord <hi>Sinclar,</hi> to beware that he ſubſcribed nothing, whereof the contrary would be found true, left it
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64759:175"/>
might therefore fare the worſe with him, and partly ſcrupling at the terms of <hi>Rebells</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> wherein the queſtion and his Anſwer were conceaved, and partly bethinking that a ſimple denyall may import more then the pleading of <hi>Not-guilty,</hi> he refuſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his name, which being reported to the Council gave great offence, and brought him under the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a deep diſſembler.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Thursday Novemb.</hi> 29. being again called before his Examinators, upon the conſiderations mentioned, &amp; for allaying the Councils prejudice, &amp; preventing the inconvenience he might there-through ſuſtain, he gives in a Declaration under his own hand, teſtifying, that he had been with the <hi>Weſtland</hi> Forces, with whom he occaſionally mett, and that he reſolved to have withdrawn from them upon the firſt opportunity which he was alſo about to do when he was taken, without either offering to flee or reſiſt, which he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Council the rather to believe, becauſe he had told ſo much to <hi>William Lawry</hi> of <hi>Blackwood,</hi> a perſon imployed from the <hi>Lieut. Generall Dalzell</hi> to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Forces. But notwithſtanding that <hi>William Lawry</hi> did teſtify this to be a truth, yet the Council retaining former impreſſions, and apprehending that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and confronting of ſome other Priſoners of the <hi>Weſtland</hi> Forces (who plainly declared their acceſſion to that Riſing) and their deponing concerning him, did only move <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hew</hi> to this acknowledgement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be certainly known, that he had formed and ſubſcribed the ſame the night before, they fortify and perſiſt in their jealouſy, and ſuſpecting him to have been a contriver of the Inſurrection, and privy to all Deſignes and Intelligence relating to it, they dealt with him with great importunity to be ingenuous, and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64759:176"/>
to declare who were the Ring-leaders of the late Riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what correſpondence either at home or abroad was kept anent it: And this was done eſpecially upon the <hi>Monday Dec.</hi> 3. at which time alſo the <hi>Boots</hi> (a terrible inſtrument of Torture, which the humanity of our later times hath ſo much abhorred, that not only the fashion of them was forgot, but all Torture for their cauſe, diſuſed; yet new ones ſuch as they are) were laid before him, upon the Town Council-Houſe table, and he certifyed, that if he would not confeſs, he should be tortured by them to morrow. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> Dec. 4. he was again called before the Council, where, after the Examination &amp; Torture of <hi>Iohn Nilſon</hi> of <hi>Corſack,</hi> he was again examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Rotheſs</hi> the Kings Commiſſioner, the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Montreſs,</hi> and ſeveral of the Privy Councill, (in the Town Council-Houſe) the Bishop of <hi>St An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> for the honor of his profeſſion forſooth, and ſome others of the Counſellers upon more real and Chriſtian motives, having at firſt withdrawn themſelves: And being urged to confeſs, he declared, with a ſolemn Atteſtation, that he knew no more, then he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy confeſſed, whereupon they ordered the <hi>Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to put his leg into the Boot and to proceed to the Torture. But as he had before confeſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ingenuouſly all he knew, ſo this Torture (though in it ſelf very violent and painful, by the extraordinary compreſſion both of flesh, ſinews and bones, by the force of timber wedges and hammer, &amp; uſed upon him in a double meaſure, even to ten or eleven ſtrokes, with conſiderable intervals; as there remained no truth concealed which it could extort) did not in the leaſt move him to expreſs any impatience or bitterneſs, but having ſuſtained it moſt conſtantly and Chriſtianly,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64759:176"/>
before he got the laſt three ſtrokes, he proteſted ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſight of God, that he could ſay no more, though all the joints of his body were in as great torture as that poor leg, and deſires to know what could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them to believe one of his Profeſſion, who had ſo ſolemnly declared as in the ſight of God, that he knew no more then he had told, <hi>viz.</hi> that to the beſt of his knowledge, the Riſing in the <hi>Weſt</hi> was meerly occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, upon a diſcontent betwixt the people in the <hi>Stewarty</hi> of <hi>Galloway</hi> &amp; <hi>Sir Iames Turner,</hi> to which every one did run, as their hearts moved them when they heard of it.</p>
               <p>This Torture was the cauſe why he was not indicted with the firſt ten, who being arraigned and ſentenced on <hi>Wedenſday Dec.</hi> 5. were hanged on the <hi>Fryday</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, at the Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Many thought that conſidering his ſmall acceſſion unto that Riſing, which neither was nor could be proven to be more, then what he himſelf had freely confeſſed, and that he had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch hard meaſure by Torture, &amp; that not in order to the diſcovery of his own Crime, but the declaring of the Contrivers and his Complices, that the ſame should have procured him favor, but the matter was otherwiſe determined. Neither was the Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, ſo quite forgotten, though ill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, and often repeated in Councill in theſe words <hi>Achab upon the Throne,</hi> and no more, and therefore</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Monday</hi> the 10 of <hi>Dec.</hi> he and other ſeven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved their Indictments of Treaſon, &amp; were acording<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſummoned to appear before the <hi>Iuſtices</hi> on <hi>Wedenſday</hi> Dec. 12. But his Torture &amp; cloſe Impriſonment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after (for ſo it was ordered) having caſt him in a Fever; whereby he was utterly diſenabled to make his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> Dec. 11. he gave in to the Lords of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64759:177"/>
Council his Supplication of the Tenor following <hi>viz. that whereas I have receaved an Indictment of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which was yeſterday delivered to me, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make anſwer thereto to morrow, and ſeing in this matter of the highest importance, not only all the time allowed is very short, but I am and have been ever ſince my Torture in a great diſtemper and Fever, beſides the great pain and utter inability of my leg, which hath conſtantly kept me bed-fast, and doth render me incapable not only of minding my own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but wholly unable either to walk or ſtand, far leſs to go and compeir before the Lord Iuſtice, as I doubt not but Phyſicians will teſtify, if your Lo: will order them to viſit me, which I humbly beg; And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my acceſsion to the Crimes libelled is ſo very ſlender, being only ſimple Preſence, and that not only occaſional, as I did declare before Your Lo: but alſo in ſome ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and purged, by my purpoſed and actuall off-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſerting; and laſtly, ſeing I was put to ſore Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in order to a furder diſcovery, with a promiſe of favor, in caſe of my Ingenuity, which I then ſingly uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in the ſight of God, to the utmoſt of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: May it therefore pleaſe Your Lordships, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to conſider the Premiſes, ſpecially my utter inability to make my appearance, and to ſurceaſe any legall procedor againſt me, in this ſo weak and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream condition, and to diſcharge me of the foreſaid Citation and Appearance. And your Lo: anſwer.</hi>

               <p>This Petition and the following are therefore ſett

down <hi>verbatim,</hi> that both the utmoſt of his condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendence may appear, and the fainting that he ſo much regrates in his laſt Speach, be the better underſtood.

               <p>Hereupon the Council did order two Phyſicians, and two Chirurgeons (<hi>viz. Sir Robert Cuningham, Doctor Hay, Iames <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And firſt, the general Indictment is read, founded both on old and late Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made againſt Riſing and Aſſembling in Arms, and entering into Leagues and Covenants, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Solemn League and Covenant, without or againſt the Kings Authority, declaring the ſame to be Rebellion and Treaſon; and thereafter amply ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon all the Acts, Deeds and Paſſages of the late Inſurrection with many aggravations; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon their taking and renewing the Solemn
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64759:178"/>
League and Covenant at <hi>Lanerk</hi>; And therefore charging them with, and concluding, that they ought to be punished for the ſame as Traitors. After which <hi>Mr Hew</hi> his ſpecial Indictment is read, bearing, that he had riſen and joyned with the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and was with them at <hi>Air, Vchilery</hi> and <hi>Lanerk,</hi> and ſeveral other places on horsback, and had kept and was at ſeveral of their Rendevouz's with a Sword. Whereunto <hi>Mr Hew</hi> being permitted to anſwer, began his diſcourſe very conſtantly and compoſedly, declaring, that he looked upon himſelf, both from the concluſion of his Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what had happened to others, as a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by men, and determined in himſelf to die, whereupon he thought himſelf obliged to uſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ingenuity, and then affirmed, that he was not ashamed to avow that he was one of that afflicted and perſecuted party and perſwaſion called <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> Thereafter he proceeded to ſpeak of the Ties and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements that were upon the Land to God, in order thereto, and having commended the Inſtitution. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Bleſſing of Presbyterial Government, he ſaid that the laſt words of the National Covenant had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes great weight upon his ſpirit. Whereupon the King's <hi>Advocate,</hi> interrupting him, deſired him to forbear that diſcourſe, telling him that he was not there called in queſtion for his perſwaſion, but for the crime of Rebellion, in riſing in Arms againſt his Ma: Authority, to which he deſired him to anſwer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he anſwered, that the thing which moved him to declare himſelf as he had, and would have done, was that weighty and important ſaying of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Whoſoever shall confeſs me before men, him shall the Son of Man alſo confeſs before the Angels of God; but he that denieth me and my words before men, shall he denyed before the An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64759:179"/>
of God.</hi> As for the Rebellion he was charged with, he ſaid; his Acceſſion was only ſimple <hi>preſence</hi> with a Sword, and that occaſional, as his confeſſion before the Council did bear. The <hi>Advocate</hi> anſwers, that not only preſence, ſuch as he was charged with, was treaſonable, but all intercommuning or keeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>Rebells,</hi> though for the ſpace only of half an hour; and however, he ſaid, he was guilty of a far deeper acceſſion, and of many other things beſides theſe contained in his own confeſſion; whereupon the <hi>Advocate</hi> cauſed read his Confeſſion, and alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of ſeverall others that were examined, in ſo far as they concerned him. <hi>M. Hew</hi> anſwered, that all the depoſitions read, contained no more then was in his own Confeſſion, nor could they make out any more againſt him; and ſo in effect it was.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Advocate</hi> after the ſuſtaining of the Indictment, having made uſe of; and cauſed read the confeſſions of <hi>M. Hew</hi> and the other perſons accuſed before the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> in place of Probation, referred the matter to their Cognition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſſize</hi> being encloſed gave their Verdict <hi>una voce,</hi> and by the mouth of <hi>Sir William Murray</hi> of <hi>Newtown</hi> their Chancellor, report him to be guilty of being with the <hi>Rebells</hi> at ſeverall times and places, and at their Rendevouz with a Sword, according to his ſubſcribed confeſſion. However it was thereafter underſtood, that four or five of the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> did with reluctancy pronounce this Verdict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinking death too great a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for ſo ſlender a Guilt, and that the major part of the <hi>Aſſize</hi> had cleanſed him, if the fear of an <hi>Aſſize</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> had not prevailed with them.</p>
               <p>The Verdict being reported, Doom was pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, decerning and adjudging him and the reſt to be
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64759:179"/>
taken on Saturnday Decemb. 22. to the Mercate Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and there to be hanged on a Gibbet till they be dead, and that their Goods and Lands be eſcheated and forfeited for his Highneſs's uſe. At the hearing of which ſentence, he cheerfully ſaid, <hi>The Lord giveth life, and the Lord taketh, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> And as he was carried back through the Guards to the Tolbooth, when the People made la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention, he anſwered, <hi>Though men cut us off, God will receave us, truſt in God, truſt in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being come to his Chamber, he immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to God by prayer, with great enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heart for himſelf and his fellow-priſoners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with him. Being afterwards asked, how his leg was, which was tortured; he anſwered merrily, "the fear of my Neck now maketh me forget my Leg. Thereafter he ſaid. to another freind,
<q>O how good Newes, to be within four dayes journey to enjoy the ſight of Jeſus Chriſt, and proteſted he vvas not ſo cumbered hovv to die, as he had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to preach a Sermon.</q>
                  <q>To ſome vvomen lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him, he ſaid, that his condition, though he vvas young, and in the budding of his hopes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the Miniſtry, yet vvas not to be mourned for; for, ſaid he, one drop of my blood, through the Grace of God, may make moe hearts contrite, then many years ſermons might have done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This afternoon he ſupplicat the Council for liberty to his Father to come &amp; viſit him, vvhich being granted, his Father the next night came to him. Their firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was very ſad; &amp; notwithſtanding, that according both to the teſtimony of his Parents, and knovvledge of all his relations, he vvas a moſt obedient Son; yet theſe inevitable infirmities vvhich are incident to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64759:180"/>
the beſt of men, and cannot but furnish ſad convictions, when conſidered in the power and pure light of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Law of God, did greatly trouble him in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the fifth commandment. The paſſage was thus. After prayer his Father ſaid unto him, <hi>Hugo, I called thee a goodly clive-tree of fair fruits, and now a ſtorm hath deſtroyed the tree and his fruits and branches.</hi> He anſvvered, <hi>that his Fathers too good thoughts of him had afflicted him.</hi> His Father ſaid, he was perſwaded, God was viſiting not his own ſin, but his parents ſin upon him, ſo that he might ſay, Our Fathers have ſinned, and we have born their iniquity. He ſaid alſo, <hi>I have ſinned, thow poor sheep what haſt thow done. M. Hew</hi> anſvvered with many groans, that through coming short of keeping the fifth commandment, he had come short of the promiſe, that his days should be prolonged in the Land of the living, and that Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with him, was for overvaluing his children, eſpecially himſelf.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 20 of <hi>December</hi> more from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Friends, then of his own inclination, he gave in to the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> a Petition, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whereas upon Tueſday laſt I was indicted and condemned, for the treaſonable deeds contained in the general and ſpecial Indictment exhibited againſt me; in the which ſpecial Indictment, containing my whole acceſsion to the ſaid Crimes, there is only libelled pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in ſeveral places, with an ordinary ſword, likeas my own confeſsion, which is the naked truth, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, how the ſame was occaſional; And ſeeing that it was alſo in ſome ſort purged &amp; retracted by my with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing

and deſerting with the firſt conveniency, whereby not only my caſe appears to be different from that of others, but alſo as favourable as poſsibly can be, nixt to innocency it ſelf; likeas the ſame appeared no leſs to many of theſe Gentlemen who were upon my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize. And ſeeing the Torture I ſuſtained, and the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity I then uſed, as in the ſight of God, to the utmoſt of my knowledge, deſerve that favour that was at that time inſinuated; And that it is expected that his Majeſty</hi> (whoſe mercy I beg) <hi>according to his great clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the most uſual practice in the like caſes, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his mercy, for the reſcue of many, who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with me involved. May it therefore pleaſe your Lordships graciouſly to conſider the premiſſes,</hi> and to pardon my great rashnes and precipitancy, <hi>and therefore to indulge ſuch a reprival at your Lo. shall think convenient, until his Majeſty's gracious pleaſure anent the premiſſes shall be fully known; At leaſt till the Commiſsioner his Grace, do return; And your Lo. anſwer.</hi> The words marked in this Petition by a different character, were the amendments of his Friends affection, which they were adviſed to put in, by ſome members of the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> to whom the copy of it had been preſented immediately before the downſitting of the <hi>Councill</hi>; and thereupon the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being tranſcribed, was in ſo great haſte preſented unto him, to ſubſcribe it, that he got it not read. However the Petition was both diſrelished and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by the <hi>Council</hi>; The truth is, ſome of his Friends exceeding zealous of his ſafety, had moved to ſeveral
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64759:181"/>
members of the <hi>Council,</hi> that the <hi>Declaration</hi> might be tendered to him, and ſome time permitted him to adviſe thereanent; which motion, it's like, was attended with ſome inſinuations, that probably he might be induced to ſubſcribe it; but as the motion was ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual without a warrand under his own hand, ſo even the Authors thereof do bear him witneſs of his poſitive, fixed and often declared reſolution, not to ſubſcribe it at the higheſt rate: Likeas, upon ſome ſurmiſes to the contrary, he thought it neceſſary for his own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to leave it under his hand, that the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned reſolution was from his own proper knowledge and motive, without the aſſiſtance of the leaſt diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive from any other perſon.</p>
               <p>During his abode in Priſon, the Lord was very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly preſent with him, both to ſuſtain him againſt the fear of death, and to diſpel all theſe over-cloudings of terror, unto which the frailty of flesh and blood hath ſometime expoſed the beſt of men; and alſo in aſſiſting him in prayer and praiſes, to the admiration of all his hearers, eſpecially on the Thurſday's night Dec. 20. whereon being ſet at ſupper with his fellow-priſoners and his Father, and one or two beſides, he requeſted his fellow-priſoners, ſaying merrily, <hi>eat to the full, and cherish your bodies, that we may all be a fat Chriſtmaſs Pie to the Prelates.</hi> After ſupper in thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving he burſt forth in bleſſing God, that had made him ſuch a fool as to come to that priſon; and after many gracious words, continued ſaying, <hi>many croſſes have come in our way and wrought but weakly upon us, but here is a croſs that hath done more good then all the many that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell us before.</hi> Then lamenting the condition of the Church of God, with much earneſtneſs, he uſed that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64759:181"/>
exclamation in the laſt of <hi>Daniel, What Lord shall be the end of theſe wonders</hi>!</p>
               <p>The laſt night of his life, being <hi>Fryday Decemb.</hi> 21. he proponed and anſwered himſelf, ſeveral queſtions, to the ſtrengthening of his fellow-priſoners, and great refreshing of all his hearers. As 1. he inquired; <hi>How ſhould he, going from the Tolbooth through a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of gazing People and guards of Souldiers, to a Scaffold and Gibbet, overcome the impreſsion of al theſe?</hi> To which he anſwered; <hi>By conceaving a deeper impreſsion of a multitude of Angels who are alſo on-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; According to that, we are a gazing-ſtock to the VVorld, Angels and Men: For the Angels rejoycing at our good confeſsion are preſent to convey and carry our ſouls as the ſoul of Lazarus, unto Abraham's boſom; Not to receave them, for that is Ieſus Christ's work alone, who will welcome them to Heaven Himſelf, with the ſongs of Angels and bleſſed Spirits; But the Angels are ministring Spirits, always ready to ſerve and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then all dying believers.</hi> 2. <hi>As Stephen ſaw the Heavens opened, and Ieſus ſtanding on the right hand of God, VVho then ſaid, Lord Ieſus, receave my Spirit, ſo</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>do I believe, that Ieſus Christ is alſo ready to receave the ſouls of his dying ſufferers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He enquired, <hi>VVhat is the way for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave of Heaven who are haſting unto it,</hi> ſeing the Word ſaith, Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him?
<q>Whereunto he anſwered, that the Scripture helps us two wayes
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64759:182"/>
to conceave of heaven. The firſt is by way of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, as in that Rev. 21. where heaven is held forth, by the repreſentation of a glorious City, there deſcribed; but in the ſame place it is alſo termed the Bride; but O how unlike are theſe two, a Bride and a City! which doth clearly evidence the inſufficiency and vaſt diſproportion of all ſuch ſimilitudes;</q>
and therefore he addeth,
<q>the Scripture furnisheth yet a more excellent way to conceave of heaven; and that is 1. by conceiving the love of Chriſt to us, even what is the breadth and length and depth and hight and the immenſeneſs of that love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge, which is alſo the higheſt and ſweeteſt motive of praiſe; unto him, that loved us, and washed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God and His Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen.</q>
                  <q>2. By holding forth the love of the Saints to Jeſus Chriſt, and teaching of us to love him in ſincerity, which is the very joy and exultation of heaven, Rev. 5.12.</q>
Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receave power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honor, and glory, and bleſſing.
<q>And no other thing then the ſoul breathing forth love to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, can rightly apprehend the joyes of heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt words which he ſpoke at ſupper, were in the commendation of <hi>Love</hi> above <hi>knowledge,</hi> ſaying,
<q>O but notions of Knowledge without Love, are of ſmall worth, evanishing in nothing, and very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</q>
After ſupper, his father having given thanks, he read the 16 Pſalm, and his firſt words thereafter were,
<q>If there were any thing in the World ſadly and unwillingly to be left, it were the reading of the Scriptures.</q>
                  <q>I ſaid I shall not ſee the Lord, even the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64759:182"/>
Lord, in the land of the living, but this needs not make us ſad; for where we go, the Lamb is the book of Scripture, and the light of that City, and there is life, even the river of the water of life, and living ſprings.</q>
To this he added many excellent obſervations, and making mention of the 23 v. of the 31 Pſal.
<q>O love the Lord, all ye his ſaints, he added, that where love was, it was ſo operative, that it made flesh, ſpirit; and where it was not, there ſpirit was made flesh: thereafter he ſung a part of the ſame Pſalm.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Supper being ended, he cals ſmilingly for a pen, ſaying, <hi>it was to write his Teſtament,</hi> wherein he only ordered ſome few books, which he had, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivered to ſeveral perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He went to bed a litle after eleven of the clock, and having ſlept wel till 5 in the morning, he aroſe and called to his Camerade <hi>Iohn Wodrow,</hi> ſaying pleaſantly, <hi>up Iohn</hi>; for you are too long in bed; you and I look not like men going this day to be hanged, ſeeing we lye ſo long.</q>
Thereafter he ſaid to him in the words of <hi>Iſaiah ch.</hi> 42. <hi>v.</hi> 24.
<q>Who gave <hi>Iacob</hi> for a ſpoil, and <hi>Israel</hi> to the robbers? did not the Lord? he againſt whom we have ſinned, for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto His Law, &amp;c. and I think, Iohn, (ſaid he) I have not known it, nor do I lay it to heart, as it is't ſaid in the end of the 25 verſe. But, John (ſaid he) for all this be not affraid, but read the 43. ch. v. 1.2. <q>for all will go well with us.</q>
                  </q>
                  <q>Iohn ſaid to him, you and I will be chambered shortly in heaven, beſide <hi>Mr Robertſon.</hi>
                  </q>
He anſwered,
<q>I fear, Iohn, you bar me out, becauſe you was more free before the Council then I was; but I shall be as free as any of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64759:183"/>
you upon the Scaffold. Before break-faſt. he ſaid, he had got a clear ray of the Majeſty of the Lord after his awaking, but it was a litle again over-cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
                  <q>Thereafter he prayed, and atteſted the Lord, that he had devoted himſelf to the ſervice of God in the Miniſtry of the Lord Jeſus, and the edification of ſouls, very early; adding albeit I have not been ſo with my God, yet thow haſt made vvith me an Everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure; this is all my deſire, joy and ſalvation, albeit thovv make me not a houſe to grovv. Novv Lord, vve come to thy throne, a place vve have not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cquainted vvith; earthly King's thrones have dvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats againſt poor men, but thy Throne hath Jeſus, an Advocate for us. Our ſupplication this day, is not to be free of death, nor of pain in death, but that vve may vvitneſs before many vvitneſſes, a good confeſſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>His Father coming to him that morning to bid him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arewel, his laſt words to him were, after prayer and a litle diſcourſe, that his ſuffering vvould do more hurt to the Prelates, and be more edifying to God's people then if he vvere to continue in the Miniſtry, for tvventy years.</q>
                  <q>And then he deſired his Father to leave him, elſe he would but trouble him, &amp; I deſire it of you, ſaid he, As the beſt and laſt ſervice you can do me, to go to your chamber, and pray earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to to the Lord to be vvith me on that Scaffold: for how to carry there is my care, even that I may be ſtrengthened to endure to the end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>About tvvo of the clock in the Afternoon, he vvas carried to the Scaffold vvith other five that ſuffered vvith him; vvhere he appeared to the conviction of all that formerly knevv him, vvith a fairer, better and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64759:183"/>
more ſtayed countenance then ever they had before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Being come to the foot of the Ladder, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his ſpeech North-vvard to the multitude. And, premiſing, <hi>That as his Years in the VVorld had been but fevv, ſo his VVords at that time should not be many.</hi> He ſpoke to the People, the ſpeech and Teſtimony vvhich he had before vvritten and ſubſcribed.</p>
               <p>Having done ſpeaking to the People, who heard him with great attention, he ſung a part of the 31 Pſal. and then prayed with ſuch povver and fervency, as forced many to vveep bitterly. Having ended he gives his cloak and hat from him; And vvhen he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf and took hold of the Ladder to go up, he ſaid vvith an audible voice, <hi>I care no more to go up this Ladder and over it, then if I were going home to my Fathers Houſe</hi>; And as he went up, hearing a great noiſe amongſt the People, he called dovvn to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv-ſufferers, ſaying, <hi>Friends and Fellow-ſufferers, be not affraid, every ſtep of this Ladder is a degree nearer Heaven.</hi> Then having ſeated himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſaid, <hi>I do partly believe, that, the Nobles, Counſellors, and Rulers of the Land, would have uſed ſome mitigation of this puniſhment, had they not been instigated by the Prelates, ſo our blood lyes principally at the Prelats door. But this is my comfort now, that I know my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the Earth, and though after my skin, worms destroy this Body, yet in my flesh ſhall I ſee God, vvhom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine Eyes ſhall behold</hi> (pointing to his eyes) <hi>and not another,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64759:184"/>
though my reins be conſumed in me. And novv I do vvillingly lay dovvn my life for the Truth and Cauſe of God, the Covenants and VVork of Reformation, vvhich vvere once counted the Glory of this Nation. And it is for endeavouring to defend this, and to extirpate that bitter root of Prelacy, that I embrace this rope</hi> (the Executioner putting the rope about his ncek.) Then hearing the People weep, he ſaid, <hi>Your vvork is not to vveep, but to pray that vve may be honourably born through; and bleſsed be the Lord, that ſupports me. Novv as I have been beholden to the prayers and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many ſince my impriſonment and ſentence; So I hope you vvill not be vvanting to me novv, in this last ſtep of my journey, that I may vvitneſs a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion: And that you may knovv the ground of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in this VVork, and vvhat my hope is, I vvill read to you the laſt Chapter of the Bible</hi>; And having read it, he ſaid, <hi>Here you ſee the Glory that is to be revealed upon me, a pure river of vvater of life, and ſo forth</hi> (read the place) <hi>vvhere the Throne of God is, and the Lamb is in it, vvhere his Servants ſerve Him and ſee His face, and His Name is in their foreheads, and the Lord God giveth them light, and they ſhall reign for ever and ever; and here you ſee my acceſs to my Glory and revvard.</hi> Let him that is a thirſt come, and vvhoſoever vvill let him take of the vvater of life freely. <hi>And here you ſee alſo my vvelcome,</hi> the Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come. Then he ſaid, <hi>I have one vvord more to ſay to my Friends,</hi> (looking
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64759:184"/>
dovvn to the Scaffold) <hi>vvhere are you? You need neither lament me nor be aſhamed of me in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for I may make uſe of that expreſsion of Chriſts, I go to your Father and my Father, to your God and my God, to your King and my King, to the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Martyrs, and to the City of the Living God, the heavenly Ieruſalem, to an innumerable company of Angels, to the General Aſſembly and Church of the First-born, and to God the Iudge of all, and to the Spirits of just men made perfect, and to Ieſus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the new Covenant; And ſo I bid you all fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvell: For God vvill be more comfortable to you then I could be; And he vvill alſo novv be more refreshing to me, then you can be: farevvel, farevvel in the Lord.</hi> Then the Napkin being put on his face, he prayed a ſpace vvithin himſelf, after vvhich he put up the cloath from his face, vvith his ovvn hand, and ſaid, he had one vvord more to ſay, and that vvas to shevv them the comfort he had in his Death, ſaying, <hi>I hope you perceaved no alteration or diſcouragement in my countenance and carriage, and as it may be your vvonder, ſo I profeſs it is a vvonder to my ſelf, and I vvill tell yovv the reaſon of it: Beſides the justneſs of my Cauſe, this is my comfort, vvhich vvas ſaid of</hi> Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <hi>vvhen he dyed, that the Angels did carry his ſoul into</hi> Abraham's <hi>Boſom; ſo, that as there is a great ſolemnity here, of a confluence of People, a Scaffold, a Gallovvs, and People looking out at vvindovvs; ſo is there greater &amp; more ſolemn preparation in Heaven,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:64759:185"/>
of Angels to carry my ſoul to Christ's boſom. Again, this is my comfort, that it is to come in Christ's hands, and He vvill preſent it blameleſs and faultleſs to the Father, and then ſhall I be ever vvith the Lord. And novv I leave of to ſpeak any more to creatures, and turn my ſpeech to thee. O Lord! and novv I begin my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vvith God, vvhich ſhall never be broken off. Farewel Father and Mother, Friends and Relations; Farevvel the VVorld and all Delights, Farevvell meat and drink, Farevvel Sun, Moon and Stars; VVel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come God and Father, VVelcome ſvveet Lord Ieſus, the Mediator of the nevv Covenant, VVelcome bleſſed Spirit of Grace and God of all conſolation, VVelcome Glory, VVelcome Eternal Life, VVelcome Death.</hi> Then he deſired the Executioner not to turn him over, untill he should put over his ovvn shoulders himſelf, vvhich, after praying a little vvithin himſelf, he did, ſaying, <hi>O Lord! into thy hands I commit my Spirit: for thou hast redeemed my Soul, Lord God of truth.</hi> Thus in the 26 Year of his age, he died, as he lived, in the Lord.</p>

               <p>And although theſe Summs (being Scots-money) may ſeem ſmall to ſtrangers, yet conſidering that they are not leavyed proportionally from all the People, but ſome ſelect perſons within theſe bounds, and that there
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64759:186"/>
are 19 or 20 Parishes of which there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at all; and that the great expenſe of free quarter by the ſouldiers, in moſt of the Parishes abovenamed (which would amount to a great ſumm) is not included, and that ſeverall perſons have not as yet payed, but are to pay their Fines and Ceſs; and that ſeverall of the poor people, through fear, at divers times have given bribes in money &amp; other things to Officers &amp; Souldiers, for keeping them free of Ceſs &amp; Quartering (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whereof they were little or nothing the better) and that the Parliament before, arbitrarily and for no alleadged crime, had exacted by their Act of Fining, from 132 Perſons within the ſaid bounds, the ſumm of 77120 Pounds Scots Money; And that the Ceſs (beſids free Quartering) levyed by the Souldiers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Commiſsioner's</hi> Order, for alleaged Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in Payment of the ſaid Fines, extended to near as much as the Principal, Conſidering (I ſay) all theſe things, the Summs are very conſiderable, and much greater then could have been expected in ſo little bounds, and in a Countrey ſo poor and mountainous, and leſs fertill then many others in the Land.</p>
               <p>But the exacting of money was not all, but in effect a ſmall part of their oppreſſion: for the carriage of the ſouldiers in free quartering was very cruel, barbarous and inhumane, as will appear by theſe general aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and particular inſtances.</p>
               <p>Ordinarily in Quartering, they did not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſufficiency, but ſet themſelves to conſume and waſte needleſsly; ſometimes throwing whole sheep to their dogs, and ſcattering corn, hay and ſtraw, they and their boyes uſually ſaying, <hi>we came to deſtroy, and we shall deſtroy yow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ordinarily when they had conſumed the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64759:187"/>
they quartered upon the poor Tennants, and when they had conſumed the Tennants, did fall upon the Land-lords, although they had conformed; as they did upon a Gentleman in <hi>Kirkmahoe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Frequently theſe who conformed from the beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and others who conformed of late, did no leſs ſuffer then theſe who conformed not at all; and ſome in ſeverall Parishes, who had given all the obedience which was demanded, ſuffered more then theſe who gave none at all; yea conforming husbands have been Punished by Fine, Ceſs and quartering for their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conforming wives.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be conſidered, that, beſids all that the Countrey had thus ſuffered, the ſouldiers were again ſent forth through the Countrey, and new Fines, Ceſs &amp; Quarter were impoſed upon the ſame perſons and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies who had been fined before; yea, upon ſome it was doubled and tripled, ſo that ſome Yeomens were fined in 500 merks Scots beſids their former fines. All which is the more conſiderable, that, although the Papiſts in that Countrey were very numerous, few of them were troubled, and theſe inconſiderable Perſons, who were only fined in inconſiderable ſumms for the fashion.</p>
               <p>And particularly in the Parish of <hi>Balmaclelland,</hi> a poor widow with ſeveral fatherleſs children, after she had payed at ſeverall times 320 merks, and ſuffered the Ceſs of 3 ſouldiers 17 dayes, coming to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of that Party to complain of ſome wrongs done unto her, in ſtead of acceſs, she is mercileſsly boaſted down ſtairs.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Parish an old deaf man, after he had payed 52 rex-dallers, and then given bond for 350 pounds Scots, was ſo toſſed, what by being brought
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64759:187"/>
before the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> and what by rude uſage at home, that he contracted ſickneſs and dyed; and thereafter his poor widow, having payed 120 pounds, was quartered upon many dayes, until she was forced to leave her houſe, and through cold and double grief contracted a deadly ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Parish a poor man, having been quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon and Payed 120 pounds Scots, was himſelf caſt into priſon, while 8 ſouldiers quartered upon him at home. In the ſame Parish, a Gentleman, who did ordinarly come to Church, was quartered upon by ſix ſouldier, notwithſtanding that himſelf, his Lady and moſt part of his family were ſick.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Parish a poor man being quartered upon 38 dayes, and having payed 48 pounds, and given bond for 150 pounds, though as is informed, he hath not ſo much as a free Cow, when he came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, he was beaten by the Officer, and returning, was again beaten by the Souldiers. In the ſame Parish, a poor bed-rid man with his ſick wife were neceſſitated to beg, until he gathered three pounds to give for his Fine or Ceſs.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Parish a very poor bed-rid creple man was forced to pay 50 merks.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Parish a very old honeſt man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reckoned paſt 80 years, and unable to work in his trad being a Coupar, and ſcarce having the worth of a groat of free goods, but the Countreyes charity, was forced to pay 20 pounds.</p>
               <p>In the Parish of <hi>Corſemichall,</hi> the ſouldiers being quartered in a houſe, having leſt ſome broth of mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, did violently thruſt away the hungry children from ſupping thereof, till firſt they ſet their dogs to leap it, and then did bid the children take what the dogs had left.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:64759:188"/>In the Parish of <hi>Parton,</hi> the ſouldiers, horſe and foot, after they had quartered 15 weeks in a Gentleman's houſe, till they had eaten up the Proviſion wherewith he should have maintained his family, having five or ſix ſmall children, they forced his wife and ſervants to the doors, after they had been their ſlaves and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants all that time, and then Poſſeſſed themſelves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute maſters of his whole houſes, plenishings, cattell and what elſe was his within their reach; and when ſome good neighbours had receaved the little ones for shelter, with great difficulty could they obtain one milk Cow of twelve belonging to their Father, for ſupply of the children. Nota. This Gentleman ſeems to be utterly broken, and hes been ſeverall times impriſoned and miſerably toſſed up and down.</p>
               <p>In the Parish of <hi>Borg,</hi> in a Gentlemans houſe, the ſouldiers did quarter for 15 weeks, till they conſumed the whole proviſion of the Family, which was well furnished with meal and malt and other neceſſaries; they alſo deſtroyed the whole plenishing (except one table which they left in caſe they came again) even to the pulling down of the Partition-wall of the main dwelling houſe, and pulling down of an Office-houſe without the gate: All this deſtruction they committed by giving and ſelling one part within the Countrey, and ſending another part to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and breaking and burning the reſt of it, of purpoſe that it might be uſeleſs for the owner, who was forced to flee before, &amp; betake himſelf to wandering with his brother and their families. And after they had committed all this vaſtation, they alſo fell upon their Tennants, and forced them to bring in malt, sheep, fowls, and other things (for their maintenance) that they pleaſed to call for, and ſo ruined them alſo; And two of his
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64759:188"/>
Tennants they forced to ſcatter their families, having threatened to burn their houſes, beſids all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they had done to their Maſter and them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>In the Parish of <hi>Irongray,</hi> a poor Tennant having bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained with the Souldiers, to redeem his goods for 36 pounds, when he came to <hi>Dumfris,</hi> they would hardly take 50 pounds, ſo that he was forced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the <hi>over-plus.</hi> and being returned home to shear his corns, and expecting no more trouble from them, they came back upon him, and took away his beaſts and all, even to the leading away of his hay. The like was practiſed upon another in the ſame Parish.</p>
               <p>And further, ſome Maintenance impoſed in the year 1648, being alleaged unpayed by ſeverall Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others within the Sheriffdom of <hi>Nithiſdale,</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of horning were raiſed by the Collectors; which let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and executions thereof were ſuſpended, becauſe the ſame was already payed, and yet notwithſtanding, Troopers were ſent to Ceſs and Quarter upon the ſaid perſons, till they should make payment, although the ſuſpenſion was not diſcuſſed; and ſeveral of them, to be releeved of the heavy burthen of the Ceſs &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, were conſtrained to make payment thereof, and that by and attour the Ceſs for the ſame, which was far above the ſaid maintenance, in ſo much that a Gentleman who at firſt might have payed for 30 pounds, the Party that went to Ceſs upon him would not aggree to remove for leſs then 200 merks, Yea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an order was procured from the <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> for removing the Ceſs for the ſaid Maintenance, a party of 8 or 9 horſmen, with their boyes and horſes, were ſent once and again to quarter upon ſome Gentlemen,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64759:189"/>
until they were forced to make a new addreſs to the <hi>Commiſsioner</hi> for removal thereof.</p>
               <p>By all which, that Countrey was ſo exhauſted of money, that neither poor nor rich could get it to ſatisfy theſe men's demands, and the poor people were forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſell their beaſts in the Merkets below their worth; in ſo much that they were forced to ſell a Cow for two Nobles or two Crowns, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the mean time ſtanding by to receave the ſame, although the poor men had deſtitute families at home: Yea many families whoſe ſumms are not here reckoned, in probability are totally ruined, and many others ſcattered, and particularly in <hi>Lochrutton</hi> there are above 16 families broken, in <hi>Irongray</hi> the moſt part of the families are broken, beſide ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that are already put from houſe-keeping, the ſouldiers having taken away, both there and elſewhere, that which the People should have lived upon; yea ſeveral Gentlemen, formerly in good condition, were put from houſe-keeping, and forced to wander, and be beholden to others for a nights lodging, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers having violently poſſeſſed themſelves of their barns, cattel and other goods.</p>
               <p>Neither is this all, the wickedneſs, prophanity and blaſphemies of the ſouldiers, are rather to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and ſuppreſt then thought or ſpoken of, if the notoriety thereof were not univerſall in theſe bounds.</p>
               <p>In the Parish of <hi>Carſphairn,</hi> in an Inn at the Bridge of <hi>Deugh,</hi> on the Sabbath-day, ſome of them being quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered there, they moſt profanely and atheiſtically mocked at all preaching of the Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>let us go preach,</hi> and then read their text out of the <hi>Cherry and the Slae</hi> (an old Scotch Amorous Poem) counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64759:189"/>
a form of divine worship, and as it is informed did ſing an other part of the ſame Poem in ſtead of the Pſalms, and uſed all other mocking modes, as if they had been ſerious at Gods worship.</p>
               <p>In the Parish of <hi>Irongray,</hi> an honeſt man retiring himſelf to the fields for ſecret prayer (not having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty at home) was followed by the Souldiers, who drew ſwords upon him threatning to kill him, if they heard him praying any more, ſaying, Sir, <hi>we have heard yow many times howling, if we hear yow again, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another time in that ſame Parish, the Maſter of the houſe was exhorting them to leave off their ſwearing and profanity, showing them the danger and hazard they were in of the condemnation of Hell, ſome of the ſouldiours mocking at hell moſt blaſphemouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. <hi>By my ſoul ere I go to hell, it shall cost God</hi> 24 <hi>hours pains ere he get me there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Town of <hi>Kircudbright,</hi> when one <hi>Captain Fin</hi> an horſeman died, one of his Camerads coming to ſee him, and finding him dead, came near and rudely gripping the dead man, uſed this horrid expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, what, divell art thow dead, man? and did not tell me before, that I might have ſent a letter to hell with thee (to ſuch a camerade of his as he named, who had died lately before) to take up my winter quarters.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Town alſo, as is informed, ſome of them conveening at the Croſs, &amp; drinking there healths, one of them perſonating...

            <p>BY theſe things, which have been done in <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Nithiſdale,</hi> as the Reader may compute, what vaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and horrid abominations muſt be in the whole Land, many places whereof are no leſs diſaffected to Prelacy, when there are ſo many and groſs, in ſo little bounds and ſo short time; ſo he may preceave, what provocation that poor oppreſſed people had to endeavour their own preſervation, and to take hold of any opportunity for vindicating their religious and civil Intereſts: and what reaſon others, either in the ſame condition with them, or upon the common ground of Non-conformity, being threatened and juſtly fearing to be shortly reduced thereunto, had, according to their obligation in the Covenant, for mutual defence and aſſiſtance in the common cauſe of Religion and Liberty, to joyn with them for their help. Neither should I have adventured to inſert theſe inſtances, if (beſids the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent care that was uſed in collecting of them, making them credible; the notoriety thereof, whereby they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned in that part of the Countrey; and many ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like things (whereunto all that is mentioned, is but like a preface) committed ſince Novemb. 1666, eſpecially in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64759:190"/>
the Weſtern parts, rendering them probable) they were not the native product of this Prelatical courſe, betwixt which and them there is ſuch connexion, as is betwixt the natural cauſe and the effect, and if the committers thereof had not had command, example and encouragement for many of them from the Prelats, whom they reſemble as much as face anſwereth to face in water. It is true the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats should no more bear all the blame, then Sathan (who reſtraineth none but tempteth to all) should be charged with all the Sin of man, and they were and are firſt and chief in the tranſgreſſion, who were their Authors and are their upholders and abettors, and in retaliation of their flattery of the Powers, and connivance at profanneſs in all, and in ſubſerviency to their intereſt and deſigne, have perpetrated and permitted ſo much wickedneſs and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; Yea the Peoples walking willingly after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, will never Excuſe thoſe, who by Law, Force &amp; Example make Iſrael to Sin: yet it is above contradiction, that Prelacy is the chief though not the only Intereſt, in ſubſerviency to which all theſe things are done; and the Prelats themſelves are a conjunct if not the Principal cauſe thereof. Theſe men having put off their former vizards, no man needeth further to unmask them. Let theſe who employed and maintained <hi>Sharp</hi> to agent their cauſe, and others who promoted him to the Prelacy, declare their own Experience, of his continued <hi>ſeries</hi> of ungrate deceaving and undermining of them and their Intereſts, under Truſt and profeſſions to the contrary, as all men know that he hath Impiouſly and Perfidiouſly betrayed the Church and Cauſe of God: if they will not, Let his own many letters written unto them, be produced, as in reaſon and for Vindication they should, and they will evince him to be the Archeſt Traitor that ever <hi>Scotland</hi> bred: And how can it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be? will he who is falſe to God, be true to any man? If that man eſcape ſome ſtupenduous and diſgracefull remark

by the hand of God or Man, I will not ſay, that Others need neither fear the One nor regard the other, but ſure I am, that many more Experienced in the obſervation of divine Providence; and forſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing then I am, are much miſtaken. Let the City of <hi>Glasglow,</hi> and perſons of all Qualities, eſpecially in that countrey-ſide, ingenuouſly ſay, whether that fiery Zelot for the height of English Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and Ceremonies, and otherwiſe inſignificant man, <hi>Maſter Burnet</hi> prelate there, doth nor, in Juſt recompence of too many their enſlaving their own light and conſcience, in flattery of him, and complying with that courſe, moſt inſolently domineer over them as his ſlaves, with as much Prid, Ambition, and Contempt, as the moſt abſolute Prince doth over his vaſſals. Let theſe of the Synod of <hi>Glasgow</hi> remember, with what deep diſſimulation <hi>Mr Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> prelat of <hi>Galloway,</hi> did by Expreſs ſuffrage declare, before the laſt Synod there, againſt the ſame Prelacy, which at that ſame inſtant of time, he was clandeſtinly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding with the Rulers to eſtablish. This man of all others, hath been the chief Cauſe of all the Oppreſſion and perſecution in that countrey, and thereby the Occaſion of the late riſeing in Armes, &amp; blood that hath followed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. One inſtance of <hi>Mr Honeyman</hi> prelate of <hi>Orkney</hi> I cannot ommit, that in the year 1661, when <hi>Mr Sharp</hi> had diſcovered himſelf, walking in his own garden, he ſaid to a famous perſon who can bear witneſs thereof, (Juſt as <hi>Balaam</hi> ſpake truth whether he would or not) That <hi>Mr Sharp was as falſe as Iudas,</hi> and I would gladly know, to whom this <hi>Caſuist,</hi> who ſince hath embraced a Bishoprick, will Compare himſelf for fals-hood, except to him who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into <hi>Iudas</hi> with the ſop. I need tell no man who knoweth the Perſons, of the brutish Senſuality of <hi>Mr Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace P.</hi> of the <hi>Iſles,</hi> who ſtudieth more the filling of his belly then he was ever fit for feeding of a flock; nor of the hatred of Godlineſs and good men in <hi>Mr Guthrey P.</hi> of <hi>Dunkel</hi>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:64759:191"/>
who while he was Miniſter at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> was an old perſecuter of both; nor the ſcandalous drinking of <hi>Mr Sraughan P.</hi> of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen,</hi> let thoſe who viſite him in his own houſe, declare how liberally he uſeth to entertain them with Wine there, upon their own Expence. It is true indeed, that <hi>Mr Lighton</hi> prelate of <hi>Dumblan,</hi> under a Jeſuitial-like vizard of Pretended Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, humility, &amp; crucifixion to the world, hath ſtudied to ſeem to Creep upon the ground, but alwayes up the hill, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promotion &amp; places of more eaſe, honor &amp; Wealth; &amp; as there is none of them all hath with a Kiſs ſo betrayed the Cauſe, and ſmiten Religion under the fifth rib, and hath been ſuch an offence to the godly, ſo there is none who by his way, practice and Expreſſions, giveth greater ſuſpicion of a popish affection, inclination and deſign. If theſe men had not put off their own vaile, no pencil of the moſt skilled artiſt could have drawn them to the life, but now by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves, they have ſaved others a labour, or at leaſt made it more eaſy. And therefore I shall rake no more into this unpleaſant dung-hil of the vileſt vice, which they and their Brethren in Iniquity (whom not nameing here doth not Except from their part of the charg of Ambition, Prid, Senſuality, Idleneſs, Covetouſneſs, Oppreſſion, Perſecution, Diſſimulation, Perjury, Treacheiy, and Hatred of Godlineſs and Good men,) have heaped together in their own Perſons, and tranſſuſed to others over all the Land. O the Immenſe long ſuffering and unſearchable Wiſedome of God! who, hearing the cry of theſe things, ſtirreth not the Zeal of all to Execute his juſt Judgment upon theſe men; but it may be, that he is ripening and reſerving them, for a more God-like ſtrok, then any would be acknowledged to be, wherein man were Inſtrumental. Neither are their Mercenaries, whom they hire as Poſtillions to ride upon the fore-horſe of all their Wickedneſs, leſs skilled, but more foreward that way then their drivers. It were as far above the faith of any, who have not heard and ſeen, to beleeve,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:64759:192"/>
and might render any pen ſuſpected of the want of truth or tenderneſs, to write the Hundreth part, as it it eaſy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance incredibly much, but endleſs to relate all that is true of the Ignorance, Lightneſs &amp; Profaneſs of theſe men. When I have told, that ſeveral lying in known and acknowledged fornication, without removall of the ſcandal, have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Miniſtry by the <hi>Prelats</hi> who knew it, and violently obtruded by them &amp; the Patrons upon the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people; That ſome of them after Admiſſion, have been deprehended lying with women by the way ſide; that Others have been found guilty of Actuall fornication, and of unanſwerable preſumptions of Adultery with other mens wives; and that drounkenneſs is both open and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent amongſt many of them, I may well awake the wonder, the blush and horrour of the reader, but I have only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to shew a part (&amp; indeed avery ſmall part) of theſe mens wayes. A Prophet he may be by way of prognoſtication, but let the world Judg what manner of Preacher he muſt be, who, offending that the people did not come to hear him, did, before the Congregation, Imprecate thus againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>God nor I be hanged hut I shall make you all come.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſed to pay the price of a horſe before he pleaſed, (which he uſed to boaſt privately would be at Doomſday) becauſe the ſeller, at the making of the bargan, in Civility ſaid, <hi>Pay me when ye pleaſe</hi>; and thereupon, to the ſcorn and deriſion of all, ſubſtained an action of Law ſome dayes before a Civill Court. Who will commerce with ſuch horſe-koopers? but much leſs who can acknowledg ſuch men for Miniſters? Theſe men, being themſelves general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without ſubſtance and forme of Religion, are ſuch mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſecuters of both in Others, that as I could never hear of one ſoul turned from Sathan to God by their labours (whereof indeed there are many profane ſeals) ſo they are become vile in the eyes of all, that are truly godly or but morally civil; In ſo much that this is the only advantage,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64759:192"/>
(and indeed it is an advantage, for if they were more ſmooth and ſober, they might be more inſnaring) that they do not wear a rough garment to deceave; and though I cannot ſay, that their out-ſide is as unclean as their inner-ſide, yet it is ſuch as ſaith in every mans heart, that <hi>the fear of God is not before their eyes.</hi> Theſe are the pleaſant birds, that are hatched and cherished under the warm wings of Prelacy, of whom though no man can ſpeak the half of the truth to a ſtranger, without expoſing himſelf to the Cenſure of partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Paſſion or being a Reproacher; yet the Univerſall and incontroverted Notoriety of theſe things, in all places where they reſide or converſe, will abſolve the relater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men who know them. It is true, we do not charg every individuall with every particular, yet becauſe they are generally true of Many, and being notourly knows and ſometimes repreſented are not remeeded, they are charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon the Courſe, which being Sinfull in ſelf, the Authors and Abettors thereof are participant of the guilt, and lyable to the punishment. And indeed the Lord hath already begun his controverſy with ſome of them, not only by pouring shame and Contempt upon them (particularly upon Traiterous <hi>Sharp</hi>) and drying up the Right eye &amp; blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gifts which ſeverall ſeemed to have (whether by their own negligence, which every man obſerveth, or Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat judgment, or both, I do not determine,) but alſo by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible curſing of their ſubſtance, diverſe of them being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated through poverty to ſell their tithes at half worth, long before they are payable, and others of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, leaving more debt behind, then they are able to diſcharge. Neither have theſe men thus profaned the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only, &amp; by the ſins of the Sons of Ely made all men to abhor the offering of the Lord; but from them are iſſued forth, ſuch overflowing ſtreames of wickedneſs over all the Land, that, beſids all that is mentioned, there are other inconceavable &amp; inexpreſſible Atheiſtical abominations ſaid to be committed
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64759:193"/>
by men, which, as it is a Wonder the Devil himſelf should dare to act, ſo for fear of the great and dreadful God, and of offending the ears of others, my heart trembleth to think, &amp; my hand faileth to writ. O Lord forgive, that ever ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeaking, but much more Acting, should have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned my Thinking thereof.</p>
            <p>And yet as if all that is related were too little, for ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to themſelves, for further inſlaving of the Countrey, &amp; venting of inſatiable revenge (curſed be their anger for it is fierce, and their wrath for it is cruell) they have procured two Proclamations, dated at <hi>Edinburgh March.</hi> 25. 1667. making mention <hi>of great evidence of many diſaffected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Weſtern Shares, who are ready to break out in open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, &amp; involve the Kingdom in blood; &amp; of just reaſon of ſuſpition that theſe Rebells will riſe in Armes against the King and his Authority, and not only make uſe of the Armes, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Ammunition concealed or tranſported from Enemies, but ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

theſe Shires muſt keep a horſe exceeding the value above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how impoſſible is it to labour much of the ground? How are covetous wretches, in hope of gaining horſe without Payment, and the half of the Fines for concealed Armes, animated to give in invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Informations againſt the owners? and many poor well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people tempted, to redeem their beaſts at the rate of Perjury and breach of Covenant? What an abſurd thing is it, to punish men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes innocent, only for not accepting or deſerting publick truſt; whereunto they neither have acceſs, nor can continue in without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and expreſs Perjury? How irrational and unjuſt is it, to command (under a penalty) Parishioners to do that which may be impoſſible, yea without the compaſs of their knowledge, ſuch as oppoſing, but much more apprehending and preſenting ſurprizers? wherewith, I pray you, shall theſe who muſt deliver up all their Armes (reſerving not ſo much as a ſword) defend themſelves or any other man, againſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſurprizall? We read in our Hiſtory of a Law, whereby for repreſſing of Theft, men were not to shut their doors in the night, and ſatisfaction was enſured to the owner for any thing that should be ſtoln from him; whereupon a Countrey-man alleaging his goods to be ſtoln, obtained payment; but being found thereafter that himſelf had hid them, he was hanged for a reward to himſelf and example to others: Now what if ſome of theſe covetous and malicious Men should (for who can rationally promiſe and ſecure, but that they who have done worſe, may alſo) thus abſtract or cauſe abſtract their own goods? what if the Lord should immediatly ſmit them for offering ſtrange fire? or thieves and robers should fall upon them? or evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in humane shape<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should haunt or hurt them, muſt Innocent people upon their invidious &amp; falſe alleagance be therefore punished?
