         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Worthy, Faithful, Dearly Beloved, and Honoured Friend
of ours, I cannot paſſe without ſome acknowledgment to his
Memory, whoſe Name lives like a Box of precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Houſe of God. Who in and through the rich Mercies of
the Lord, offered up himſelf a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable, in
the day of Power from the Lord, and that willingly and chearfully,
like a Lamb, whoſe great love and burning deſires were after the
Flock, the Sheep and Lambs of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Who, that they might be fed and taught, ſpared not himſelf in life
and death, by water and blood, to miniſter unto them; yea, how did
the care of all the Churches fall on him? the whole Flock, the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and wandring Sheep on the Mountains and Hills, ſolitary in the
Fields, diſperſed in the Woods, driven into the Wilderneſs.</p>
                     <p>How did his heart in this Epiſtle long and look after them, and call
them together, under the wing of that one Shepherd? What a bleſſed
Example of Patience, Faith and Courage hath he left them?</p>
                     <p>And though many Brethren knew not him, yet he knew them, and
owned them. If he was rejected by many, till now by his Death many
of thoſe Vails are rent, And they <hi>mourn over him</hi> whom they <hi>pierced</hi>
before: Now they ſee he was a Son and Heir of the Kingdom, of
whom this Nation was no longer worthy.</p>

from the beginning, the Word of Life which he had ſeen and looked on,
his hands handled, his heart poſſeſſed of that Eternal Love, Truth

growths in God's Houſe, to ſhew forth and to diſcover the cunning
Works of all ſorts, the curious workings in Gold, and Silver, and in
Braſſe; As appears in his <hi>Natural, Legal,</hi> and <hi>Evangelical</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                     <p>Very skilful alſo are his Carvings and Cuttings of Stones, to ſet

<hi>Zion,</hi> their Qualities and rare Vertues, each moſt coſtly; and to ſet
them every one in their Order, in their Ranks, Rows and Places, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for each Tribe and People, (the right Stone for each Tribe) how
to fix them in the Breaſtplate of Judgment, each in his ſocket of Gold,
with their true and right Engravings, like a Signet; how to call and
write upon each its true Name and Work according to its Nature,
(each Work of the Spirit after its kind) For the Gifts, the Operations,
the Adminiſtrations of the Spirit are various and manifold, to ſet
forth the manifold Wiſdom of God.</p>
                     <p>As in the Natural Creation there are bodies Celeſtial and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial:

Nay, in the Terreſtial there are varieties. When all the Creatures
were made, they were all brought to <hi>Adam;</hi> he gave them Names
according as they were, to every Creature his own Name; to the
Fiſhes in the Sea, to the Creeping-things and Beaſts in the Earth,
and to the Fowls in the open Firmament of Heaven, each in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places and Elements. The Earth brought forth her variety of
Herbs, Plants, Fruits and Trees, every one after his kind; all which
are but the ſhadows of the Kingdom above, the things of higher and
better natures.</p>
                     <p>As in the Paradiſe and Garden of the Lord, there were varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Fruits and Trees both for delight and ſhade, with the River to
refreſh them; yea, the very River divided it ſelf into four heads, to
water every quarter, unbowelling it ſelf to them in equal ſhares, to feed
and make them fruitful.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:51760:5"/>
Such is the Univerſal Love, the Spring and Fountain of Life, in
whom all live, move and have their being, to gather together all things
in one, whether viſible or inviſible, as into their head; That as all
Mankind are made of one Blood ſo all Souls of one Spirit, who
breathed at firſt the Breath of Life into them, that he that was the
firſt may be the laſt, the beginning and the ending, He that was,
and is, and is to come: What diſtance and difference ſoever there
may ſeem to be here, yet all the ſame, to day, yeſterday, and for ever,
the ſame God, the ſame Father of all, the ſame Jeſus and Saviour,
the ſame Spirit and Comforter; yet the Appearances, Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Workings and Revelations, manifold and various: And all, to
ſhew forth the Glory, yea, the Riches of the Glory of Him, that hath
called us, and worketh all theſe in us and for us.</p>
                     <p>Yea, were not the works of the Tabernacle ſo? and yet each beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
in its place, each work and workmanſhip; ſome works of Wood,
ſome of Stone, others of Braſs, ſome of Silver and over-laid with
Gold, the choicest of beaten Gold; and the more holy and inward, the
purer, the inmoſt the pureſt of all; each room and place as it came
neareſt to the living Oracle (the Mercy-Seat) the narrower, the
finer, the holier: and the more and the farther any thing or place
was diſtant from thence, the larger and courſer; the more outward,
the leſs holy.</p>
                     <p>So were the Offerings of the Lord, all pleaſant, that came willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
the skins, the Badgers skins, the red dyed Rams skins (for the
Covering of the Tabernacle on the out-ſide) good enough, yet very
courſe: the Boards of Shittem wood, the Curtains, the Pillars of
Wood, of Braſſe, of Wood over-laid with Gold, each according to
its place and ſervice in the Tabernacle, more or leſſe excellent, as
more or leſſe inward or ſpiritual: So was the Linnen, the Purple,
the Blue, the Scarlet, and curious Works; the moſt curious and pure
for the Vail next the Mercy-Seat.</p>
                     <p>So was it in the Compoſition of the Perfume and anointing Oyl, after
the curious and choice Art of the Apothecary (that no Compoſition or
Mixture muſt be made like it) of the choiceſt Spices.</p>
                     <p>So for the Lamps of the Canaleſticks to give light, and for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
of Incenſe evening and morning (Oh! great is the Mystery of
Godlineſs in all theſe things) no Lights, but what was made of this
pure holy Oyl, muſt burn before the Lord; if the Prieſts or Levites
did burn any other, they muſt be cut off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:51760:6"/>
And ſo for the Incenſe of ſweet Spices; the Lord, that Spirit, is
very curious, and can ſoon ſpy and ſmell out the Mixtures of Fleſh, or
any falſe Compoſitions, and abhor them.</p>
                     <p>So in the Prieſts Garments for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his <hi>Sons</hi> to miniſter in;
the nearer the Miniſtration was to the Lord, the Purer and Holier,
and the Garments the more curious. The imbroydered fine Linnen
Coat, holy and pure; the Robe of the Ephod, of blue; the curious
Ephod with the two pretious Onix Stones, and the engraving therein,
ſet on the ſhoulder plates; the curious Girdle of the Ephod, with the
wreathes of Gold, and the holy Breſt-plate of Judgement, with the
twelve pretious Stones coupled to the Ephod, and of the ſame curious
workmanſhip; with the curious Girdle, the Miter, the Plate of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the Crown for his head. For the other Prieſts, not ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
nor ſuch works, in regard their Inſtitutions was leſs glorious.</p>
                     <p>In all theſe things, how excellent, how skilful, and what a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſearching Spirit of diſcerning and Judgement, had this wiſe-hearted
Soul (in the Mysteries) unfolding the Riddles and hard
Sayings, ſtill opening them in Spirit, faithful in all God's Houſe, and
keeping nothing of the Counſel of the Lord back, nor hiding his Light
under a Buſhel, but ſetting it up in the Candleſtick, ſo, that it gave light
to many of the Lord's Houſe.</p>
                     <p>I was one of the number of thoſe, that conſtantly attending on his
Diſcourſes, as oft as I was in Town, knew him more in his Family
Exerciſes and Diſcourſes for many years than moſt; from whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
more help and light in the knowledge of God, than from all the
men in the World beſides, and found his Miniſtry moſt ſearching
and trying: What others took for Gold, he proved it to be but Braſs;
and ſome Doctrines that others preferred for Spiritual, he tryed, and
found them Carnal.</p>
                     <p>He had ſuch a Breſt-plate of Judgement and Diſcerning, that he did
conſtantly bear the remembrance of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> on his
heart before the Lord, and diſtinguiſhed every Tribe after his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yea, he had this ſingular and peculiar gift of Judgement, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the two Natures, the two Seeds, the two Covenants, to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Many a Soul he hath put upon the ſearch, that thought he had
attained and ran well, whom he found to be but in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or at leaſt
but departing thence.</p>
                     <p>Shall we ſay he was a Scholler? Nay, but a <hi>Rabbi,</hi> a Doctor in the
knowledge of Chriſt, in whom a greater Fulneſs of the riches of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:51760:6"/>
and Knowledge were treaſured up than in moſt; like that Diſciple
that lay in Chriſt's boſom: He obtained ſo long a ſhare of his life and
growth, having the true ſight and meaſure of every man's ſtate and
growth, yet himſelf ſate on a Rock higher than all, and was ſuch a
bleſſing in his Witneſs (and Teſtimony to the Lord, in his threefold
ſtate, of Life, Death, and Reſurrection, and ſo of our conformity and
likeneſs to Him therein) that no Book extant, but the Striptures, did
ever clear ſo much Truth as his <hi>Retired Man's Meditations;</hi> and this
bleſſed <hi>Epiſtle</hi> now of his, is as a Key that further opens that to the
Sons of men, and they are to be underſtood better in ſpirit, and in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
than in words.</p>
                     <p>How did he, ſeeing Truth lay ſcattered, maimed, and mangled in
parts and parcels, gather it all up? yea, and all the Profeſſions and
Profeſſors of it, and made one whole Garment of Truth amongst
them all, and that without any ſeam or rent; reconciling and healing
all the Wounds and Diviſions that have been amongſt good People, from
the crown of the Head to the ſoale of the Foot, in the Spirit of Love,
Righteouſneſs, and true Judgement; aſſigning every Profeſſion and
Principle, his true and proper place and ſtate in the Body, whether
Natural or Spiritual.</p>

                  <p>If <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17. when he paſſed by, and beheld the <hi>Athenians</hi>
Devotions, with an Altar, having this Inſcription <hi>[To the unknown

when all humane means fail.</hi> This you are therefore to know, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51760:8"/>
though the Saints who have adventured to oppoſe the Beaſt, and the
kingdom of Antichriſt (all along, contending in a good Cauſe) have
been ſtill cruſhed, and ſubdued, as is foretold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7. yet the <hi>time</hi>
is <hi>coming,</hi> yea, is even <hi>at the very door, for God to take the buſineſs into
his own hands,</hi> and to <hi>put forth the power of his wrath by heavenly
Inſtruments,</hi> foraſmuch as <hi>the earthly ones (as you have ſeen) have
proved ineffectual.</hi> And this ought to be a teaching to us, to depend
upon God, for the avenging of his people, even, when all humane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to perform it, is vaniſhed; and not haſtily to run out, in the uſe
of any indirect means, though tempted and allured thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But, to return to the things which we propound to ſet before you,
in this Epiſtle; They are reducible unto theſe particulars, following:</p>
                  <p>1. Firſt, The ſight and knowledge of Chriſt, as he is the Inviſible
and Holy One, from whom, as from the Head, all natural as well as
ſpiritual good, doth flow.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, Chriſt's Headſhip, exerciſed by him, (ever ſince his
Aſcenſion) as he is the Son of man, glorified; and this in the two
diſtinct branches and adminiſtrations of it. The one, that, wherein he
is the Lord and reſtorer of pure, incorrupt Nature, upon the Principles
of the firſt Covenant, renewed, and confirmed in his blood. The
other, that, in which he is the giver of the Holy Ghoſt, or, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of the Spirit, and new Name, (as Ointment poured forth) which,
where it is received upon the Principles of the new Covenant, never
fails, but abides with ſuch, for ever.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, The true Annointed Ones, or Witneſſes of Chriſt,
according to both his before-mentioned Adminiſtrations and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing,
which is given, by the one and by the other.</p>
                  <p>4. Fourthly, Thoſe that in Principles, are oppoſite unto theſe two
Annointings and the effects of them, declaring their enmity, in and by
the continued war they maintain againſt them, in the poſture of open
enemies, or diſſembled friends, both making up, but one and the ſame
Kingdom of Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>5. Fifthly, What Word and part of his Counſels contained in the
Promiſes and Propheſies, (not yet accompliſhed) is the Lord now
fulfilling, in the preſent diſpenſations of our day?</p>
                  <p>1. To the firſt, 'Tis the Teſtimony which came out of Chriſt's
own mouth, concerning Himſelf and his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 22. That
<hi>no man knows</hi> who the <hi>Son</hi> is, <hi>but</hi> the <hi>Father;</hi> nor who the <hi>Father</hi> is,
<hi>but</hi> the <hi>Son, and he to whom</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> will <hi>reveal Him:</hi> which plainly
declares, that the <hi>beings</hi> both <hi>of</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi> are <hi>great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51760:9"/>
and hidden Myſteries.</hi> The one as well as the other, is <hi>myſtical and
inviſible,</hi> and muſt be <hi>taught</hi> and <hi>revealed,</hi> before it can be <hi>truly</hi> and
<hi>fully known</hi> and <hi>underſtood</hi> what they are. Agreeable to this, is that,
Joh. 1. 18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> that is, <hi>immediately,</hi>
but <hi>by the means of the only begotten Son, which is in the boſom of the
Father; he hath declared him.</hi> The Son, therefore, who is the
<hi>only begotten,</hi> is ſaid to be the Image of the inviſible God; The firſt
name and ſimilitude whereby God is poſſible and capable to be known
to others beſide himſelf. For by and from Him, as the Head, the
knowledge and fruit of the whole Deity is derived and communicated,
in ſuch fit Images and lively Repreſentations, as He hath fore-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
within himſelf, to be known by, unto his whole Creation, from
the beginning to the end thereof. Hence it is, that we find Chriſt
the Mediator, by the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 10. ſpeaking of himſelf after
this manner, <hi>Ye are my Witneſſes, ſaith the Lord, and my Servant,
whom I have choſen.</hi> The Lord, <hi>the Mediator,</hi> hath and owns for
his Witneſſes, the Womans Seed, in the head, and in the members;
the promiſed Seed, in his Servant, the <hi>Branch,</hi> the chief and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
one; and in his Brethren, the ſame Seed; and who are made to
bear his Fathers Name (by <hi>Adoption)</hi> as well as himſelf, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it for ever; that <hi>one Seed,</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>which,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is
Chriſt, the myſtical body,</hi> that are <hi>Heirs according to promiſe. Ye are
my Witneſſes,</hi> ſayes this only begotten, who is from everlaſting, <hi>that
ye may know</hi> and believe me, and underſtand <hi>that I am he.</hi> Or, I am
the Son, that only doth or can reveal who the Father is, or who I am
in mine own Perſon; for, before me was no God formed, or nothing
formed or to be ſeen of God, neither ſhall there be after me; becauſe
I am his compleat Name and Manifeſtation. <hi>In me it hath pleaſed
the Father all Fulneſs ſhould dwell,</hi> and this alſo <hi>bodily, in</hi> the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of the <hi>fulneſs of time.</hi> By <hi>Chriſt</hi> then (as we learn from hence)
we are to underſtand that Perſon, in whom God firſt formeth himſelf,
and placeth his Name, by his immediate engraving and workmanſhip,
upon the tables of ſome <hi>Creature-beginning,</hi> ſome other nature begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by him, in difference and diſtinction from his own; and which, as it
is his <hi>firſt work,</hi> ſo is it his <hi>moſt compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect work;</hi> that which
comprehends all particulars and individuals in both creations, from
firſt to laſt; ſo that, as nothing is before it, to precede, ſo, nothing is
omitted, to make new, or to come after it, that is not eminently trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
up and ſeated in his Perſon already, who is <hi>the firſt-born of every
creature,</hi> he that was <hi>before all things, and by whom all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51760:9"/>
made the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega;</hi> he that <hi>was,</hi> he that <hi>is,</hi> and he
that <hi>is to come,</hi> the <hi>Almighty.</hi> In this ſtate of ſpiritual being and
hidden glory, Chriſt is truly and properly the <hi>Inviſible one,</hi> which
<hi>Moſes</hi> had the ſight of by Faith; fore-ſeeing alſo his incarnation, as
he was to be the great Prophet, raiſed up to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who
when he cometh, ſhould teach them all things, and declare the mind
of God fully, receiving himſelf the lively Oracles immediately from
God's own mouth.</p>
                  <p>From hence alſo it is, by reaſon that there is ſuch an Inviſible one,
who is with God from everlaſting, as his mouth, and in the Office of
Mediator, that in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, the firſt and ſecond Commands are
ſo poſitive and ſtrict, <hi>that we</hi> ſhould <hi>have no other Gods before the
Lord,</hi> viz. the <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> that brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and made himſelf known unto them by his Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi>
which imports the execution of his Purpoſe and Promiſe, and ſo, the
Being he gives to what his Word hath declared. This Name will be
beſt interpreted by the opening of another place of Scripture, which
ſpeaks of Chriſt in this his inviſible and myſterious being, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8 and
9 chap. wherein the building and workmanſhip that Wiſdom forms
for her own houſe, (the Sanctuary wherein God records his Name)
is moſt lively and excellently deſcribed, as that which comprehends all
the fulneſs and perfection of all times and things, <hi>paſt, preſent,</hi> and <hi>to
come;</hi> He <hi>that was, he that is,</hi> and <hi>he that is to come, the Almighty;</hi>
Who, as, in one and the ſame Perſon of the Mediator, he is the God
that builds all things, ſo he is alſo the Building or Houſe it ſelf, which
is his own immediate workmanſhip, and, as in one total ſum, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
all manner of perfection in it. For it is not the Property of the
firſt in the Trinity, to execute, but to purpoſe and contrive what ſhall
be executed, and by whom; and then, the Execution, though it be
by the ſame Divine Eſſence, yet, it is by reaſon of a ſecond and third
property, which is natural to it; according to which, God, that is
<hi>One,</hi> is alſo <hi>Three; One</hi> in Nature and Spirit, <hi>Three</hi> in Properties
and Operation; a Spirit after ſuch an incomprehenſible manner as is
known fully to himſelf alone, having three diſtinct inſpiring Properties,
whence he gives being to his own Name, or to him that he purpoſeth
within himſelf, ſhall bear his Name, and give the ſight and knowledge
of his eſſential Glory and Likeneſs, unto the underſtanding of others,
as his own mouth, that is ſet up, to utter and deliver the <hi>lively Oracle</hi>
of his Eternal mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Perſon,</hi> whom God from Eternity hath deſigned to this high
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51760:10"/>
and great Office, <hi>is he,</hi> whom we mean, when we expreſs him under
the Title of <hi>the Mediator;</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Will,</hi> that God hath the image of, within himſelf, from all
Eternity. As it is <hi>in him, it is himſelf;</hi> one that is <hi>with him,</hi> as
<hi>brought up by him,</hi> that is <hi>daily his delight;</hi> and whoſe <hi>delight</hi> alſo
is in the habitable parts of God's Earth, and with the ſons of men;
The Wiſdom and Power of <hi>God's Eſſence,</hi> in the form of the higheſt
Underſtanding and beſt Will, purpoſing to manifeſt it ſelf, and build it
ſelf a houſe in ſome other nature, wherein to well, and therewith to
converſe, whether upon terms of <hi>pure Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>free Grace;</hi> and ſo, to
make himſelf either a <hi>ſojourner for a ſeaſon,</hi> or <hi>an home and in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
as his place of <hi>Reſt for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by the <hi>ſetting up of this building</hi> in the Perſon of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
as the Root and Foundation of all intercourſe between God moſt
high, and the work of his hands in both Creations, let us ſee the fruit
and great benefit which comes to men, as he himſelf deſcribeth it,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 1, 3. For, <hi>by this means</hi> the <hi>Beaſts are killed,</hi> the <hi>Lamb is
ſacrificed,</hi> the <hi>Wine is mingled,</hi> or, the pure <hi>fruit of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is ſo <hi>tempered</hi> and prepared, in its manifeſtation and day-break
upon the Creatures underſtanding, <hi>by the firſt mixture of theſe two
natures in the Perſon of the Mediator,</hi> that it <hi>becomes fit drink</hi> and
<hi>ſutable meat for all ſuch, as are to feed at this Table of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence it is evident, that God is to be looked upon by us, as
under one Conſideration, in his own, proper, ſimple, abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Eſſence, wherein he is known, and perfectly enjoyed
by none but himſelf, in the moſt bleſſed Trinity; and under another
Conſideration, according to what he hath eternally purpoſed, and
actually made himſelf to be, in the Perſon of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> wherein
only he can be ſeen by the Creatures making it unlawful to own any
other image, form, or likeneſs of him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 3, 7. or <hi>to bow down
to it, or worſhip it;</hi> forbidding unto Angels or Men, all the <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God,</hi> which they are apt to feign of him from the device of
their own hearts, as the <hi>Object of their Worſhip,</hi> upon this very ground,
becauſe he hath one by him that he hath made the <hi>Angel of his face
and preſence,</hi> whom he hath employed to bring them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and who was ſeen by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, and ſhewed Himſelf to the
Church or whole Congregation of the People in the Wilderneſs, when
they tempted him, in ſetting up and worſhipping a <hi>molten Calf,</hi> of
their own invention, new and <hi>ſtrange gods.</hi> This to do before his
face, and to own (beſides him, that was the face and mouth of God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51760:10"/>
amongſt them) would be a <hi>great provoking,</hi> which he told them
ſhould <hi>not go unpuniſhed:</hi> This cauſed God to ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt have
no other Gods beſides,</hi> or before <hi>me;</hi> that is, not only <hi>not in my ſight,</hi>
but <hi>not in preference to him,</hi> that I have given to you, as <hi>my face</hi> and
<hi>mouth.</hi> Provoke him not, for <hi>my Name is in him;</hi> intimating with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that herein they were the more inexcuſable, becauſe they had him
with them and amongſt them. In him the light of God's Glory was
ſhining forth as in God's own face and very ſimilitude, ſpeaking his
Mind by his own mouth; and he was to be incarnate, that the ſame
Word might be near us, <hi>even in our mouth and in our heart, to hear
it, and do it.</hi> This is the Prophet, like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> which God
ſaid he would raiſe up unto them, out of, and from the midſt of their
Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Let us then acknowledge this great Myſtery of the Father and the
Son, <hi>diſtinguiſhing what God is by Nature and Eſſence, from what he
gives himſelf to be, in the Perſon of the Mediator,</hi> the only begotten,
<hi>that lieth in his boſome; who yet is alſo his Meſſiah,</hi> whom he ſends
and makes his Subſtitute, by way of his in-dwelling Deity and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
for the performing of all his pleaſure in both Worlds.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Trinity</hi> is the <hi>head, and immediate cauſe of the being and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
which is ſet up in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> whom they <hi>not
only inspire with each of their Names and Similitudes,</hi> but <hi>make him
a Veſſel of meet uſe, to convey the holy Oyl, in</hi> the way of a twofold
Miniſtry, <hi>and Pipe to both Creations;</hi> He therefore became incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that he might make uſe of no other ſpokſman, immediately to
interpret and declare the Mind of God unto his People, than the
<hi>Son of man glorified,</hi> of which we have the <hi>lively Type, (Exod.</hi> 4. 15,
16.) in the Office of <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhewing that <hi>Aaron</hi> was made
the <hi>mouth</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>mouth</hi> to <hi>God; Aarons</hi> Office
of ſpokſman, figuring out that of <hi>Chriſt's Manhead,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> his,
that of <hi>Chriſt's Mediatorſhip in ſpirits before his Incarnation;</hi> upon
which occaſion God promiſeth there, in the Type, that which he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fills
in Spirit and Truth, in Chriſt's Perſon. For, as <hi>Moſes had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to ſpeak to</hi> Aaron, <hi>as God's ſpoksman to him; ſo hath the Spirit
of the Mediator to</hi> Jeſus <hi>the Son of man.</hi> And as it was <hi>Aaron's</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to be <hi>ſpoksman to the People;</hi> ſo is it the Office of Chriſt's Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
to be <hi>the ſpoksman of Him</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> typed out, that <hi>great
Prophet,</hi> the <hi>Angel of God's Face and Preſence;</hi> and <hi>to be to him
the Interpreter and Declarer of God's Mind,</hi> and ſignifier of God's
Commands <hi>to all in both Worlds.</hi> Chriſt (as he is the Son of man)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51760:11"/>
is to himſelf (as he is the Word of God) inſtead of a <hi>mouth</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;</hi>
And Chriſt, as he is the <hi>only Begotten,</hi> or <hi>Word of the Father,
is inſtead of God,</hi> moſt high unto his own Manhead; anſwerable to
the Promiſe, made verſ. 15. and <hi>thou ſhalt ſpeak unto him,</hi> and <hi>put
words into his mouth,</hi> (meaning <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Aaron) and I will be with
thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you,</hi> (that is, both of
you) <hi>what ye ſhall do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee (and may ſee it with Admiration, as the Queen of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
did in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple, which was the Type) <hi>the Glorious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
into the Houſe of God,</hi> and the <hi>gradual acceſs</hi> which by <hi>one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
we have <hi>through Chriſt</hi> unto the <hi>Father.</hi> I would have you
know, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>that the head of every
man is Chriſt, the head of the woman is the man, and the head of
Chriſt is God.</hi> Chriſt that is the head of every man, is the head of
his own manhead; and therefore was Chriſt <hi>God's Angel, Meſſiah,</hi>
or <hi>ſent-one,</hi> before he was <hi>Man;</hi> and had for his Head, the <hi>one God
and Father of all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How God is the Head of Chriſt, we have ſhewed. The bleſſed
<hi>Trinity,</hi> is the Father to that only begotten One, who is the <hi>hidden
Wiſdom, ordained before the World was,</hi> to our glory; The <hi>Angel,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Meſſenger and Mediator of God's Covenant,</hi> of whom he
commands us to beware <hi>(Exo.</hi> 23. 21.) and to obey his voice; <hi>Provoke
him not,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>for he will not pardon their Tranſgreſſions; for my
Name is in him.</hi> What can be more plain? The moſt high God hath his
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> his <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>ſent-one,</hi> inveſted with his Majeſty and Power
of Command, whoſe Voice muſt be obeyed as the Voice of God, it
being his Office, to be <hi>inſtead of God</hi> to his Church. What he binds
is bound, what he remits is remitted, for the Name of God is in him;
He is in likeneſs and truth, ſo near to God, that he is <hi>God's equal,</hi> the
<hi>true Michael,</hi> that is ſecond with God in the Throne: and yet, he
that is found in the Form of God, <hi>and accounts it no robbery to be
equal with God;</hi> doth not diſdain to have alſo his Equals, <hi>the man,</hi>
that is, <hi>his fellow,</hi> the <hi>man of his right-haud,</hi> whom he hath made
ſtrong for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>With the moſt knowing <hi>Jews,</hi> the acknowledgment of Chriſt in
this his heavenly and ſpiritual being before his incarnation, was moſt
uſual and avowed. The Angel that redeemed <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 48. they
call the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> owned for <hi>God,</hi> and for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that was
tempted in the Wilderneſs; whoſe Voice, ſay they, is to be obeyed,
as the Voice of the living God; and his Office is, to be the Leader
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51760:11"/>
and Guide of the <hi>true Iſrael;</hi> the great Prince, that is the Preſence
and Majeſty of God, and the Lord and Ruler over all the Earth as
well as Heaven, all that is therein being governed by his hand. Unto
Him the pure and ſimple Eſſence of God is the Father; and he is ſet
up from everlaſting, the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Root,</hi> whence that <hi>chief Branch</hi>
ſprings, that is <hi>Jeſus the Lord and Chriſt,</hi> in the capacity of <hi>Son</hi> to this
<hi>Father, who muſt reign till all things be ſubdued under him,</hi> that is,
<hi>all inferiour Rule, Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> whatſoever, that <hi>officiate,</hi> or
ought to do ſo, <hi>in his right;</hi> But when that is done and finiſhed, then
ſhall this <hi>Son</hi> alſo <hi>himſelf, be ſubject unto Him,</hi> that is, his Father,
that raiſed him from the dead, and put all things under him, <hi>that God
may be all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This occaſioned Chriſt whilſt he was on Earth, to ſay, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 28.
<hi>Father, glorifie thy Name;</hi> ſpeaking therein to God the Mediator;
to Him, whoſe Office is, <hi>to be to him the Mouth of God;</hi> from whom,
he receives the lively Oracles to deliver to his Church; as it is written,
<hi>I will declare thy Name to my Brethren; in the midſt of the Church
will I ſing Praiſes unto thee.</hi> And again, <hi>I will put my truſt in him,
even in him who wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead,
and ſet him at his own right-hand of the Majesty on high,</hi> or in the
heavenly.</p>
                  <p>This made Chriſt ſay, <hi>When I am lifted up, I will draw all men
unto me;</hi> that is, mediately, and in order afterwards, to reſign them
up unto his Father, and give up all his intereſt of Rule in them, unto
him; unto whom, as he is his Equal, (for, ſaith he, <hi>I and the Father
are one)</hi> So alſo he is <hi>his Servant,</hi> and hath his <hi>Office of Miniſtry
under him.</hi> For, the end of Chriſt's Miniſtry is, <hi>to unvail the Glory of
his Father,</hi> and to <hi>ſhine with him as ſecond in the Throne,</hi> which he
prefers much before the drawing of all men to himſelf, to depend and
reſt on him only, and not on the Father, in and through him, as well
thoſe do that reſt in the knowledge of Chriſt according to the fleſh,
and behold not that vail rent, upon his ſpiritual Croſs, in order to <hi>live
to him, that died for them, and roſe again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By what we have already ſhewed, we have, or may have, the
ſight of him who is the Holy and Inviſible One, from whom, as from
the Head, all Natural as well as Spiritual good doth flow.</p>
                  <p>2. The next thing propounded, is, to ſet forth the <hi>two diſtinct
Branches</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtrations of this Headſhip,</hi> exerciſed by Chriſt,
as he is the Son of Man glorified, miniſtring the Inſpiration, Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Image of God, which is given according to the Principles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51760:12"/>
and Law both of the <hi>firſt</hi> and of the <hi>ſecond Covenant.</hi> The influence
and effect hereof upon all rational beings, whether Angels or Men, in
their mutable eſtate or immutable, doth proceed from Chriſt, as he is
the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> that <hi>quickening Spirit,</hi> who is <hi>Lord from Heaven;</hi>
And hereof he hath his living and undeniable Witneſs in the Hearts
and Conſciences of his Subjects and Followers, from the beginning
of the World to the end thereof.</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>Headſhip</hi> which Chriſt exerciſeth by the <hi>first</hi> of theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtries,
is that of <hi>Supream Natural Lord and Sovereign over all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi>
by the <hi>breath of whoſe mouth they were made,</hi> Pſal. 33. Rev.
4. 11. and <hi>redeemed by his Blood,</hi> Rev. 5. 9. So that his right of Rule
to them and over them, is indiſputable, and their obligation for duty
and ſervice to him, indiſpenſable and perpetual. The Angels that fell,
are charged <hi>(Jude</hi> 6.) <hi>with defection from, and rebellion against this
their Prince and Sovereign Lord,</hi> leaving and deſerting him who was
their appointed Habitation, and Object of Worſhip and Duty by
the very Law of their Creation. And, unto the ſame Diſobedience
and Revolt from Chriſt, was the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> tempted, who was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
at firſt to none but God. While God the Mediator ruled, and
man obeyed, all went right: For God being moſt perfectly wiſe and
juſt, could not erre in commanding; but man, though innocent, yet
being free and mutable, was capable to be tempted from his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as it fell out. <hi>Satan,</hi> that by his diſobedience had overthrown
himſelf, knew thereby the way how to overthrow man. He perceived
God could not be corrupted nor tempted to unwiſe or unrighteous
Government; And, if neither King nor Subject could have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
the Kingdom muſt needs have ſtood. But, he quickly found,
man was <hi>frail,</hi> though <hi>holy,</hi> and had not yet attained to his incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
eſtate, though upright, and was therefore capable to be
wrought upon, and corrupted in his mind, from the ſimplicity that is
in Chriſt. Man would be as God, have no guide but his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
hating that juſt reſtraint, which was needful as a bridle,
to be put upon him, to keep him from falling, and which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
to offer to him, as the means to remain innocent, and paſs out of
his mutable into an immutable holy ſtate, without ſin. But this would
not go down, nor be born; The reſignation of his Will, and abſolute
reſolution of it into the Will of his Sovereign, by believing, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
it for his good, would not be hearkened unto. He could not,
or would not, or would not think he was ſuch a fool, as ſtood in need
of being ſo abſolutely at the will and diſpoſe of another, when as yet
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51760:12"/>
he was his own man, free to continue under the guide of his own
ſelf-rule, a thing very beautiful and good, as he thought, to be put
into practice. This was the Choice God had given unto man, in this
his righteous mutable ſtate, either to truſt to his own guidance for the
ordering of his ſteps, according to the Rule ſet before him, and the
conditional Terms of the Law of Nature, and firſt Agreement or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made with him at his Creation; or elſe, to diſtruſt his own
Wiſdom, as inſufficient to be his guide, and his own power of Will,
that was mutable and uncertain in its beſt ſtate, and thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and reſign himſelf, through Faith, unto the guidance and power
of his <hi>Natural Head, Lord</hi> and <hi>Sovereign,</hi> to do, as by the ſight of
Faith, he ſhould find him do, and cleave cloſe to him, whatſoever he
ſhould go before him in.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe, the <hi>firſt man determined himſelf in,</hi> and in that
Act, choſe for his whole ſeed as well as for himſelf, who, if God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
might have been then concluded by it, without any new offer of
Grace made unto them, or their ever being brought to ſo fair a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
again. But ſo far was God the Mediator from applying himſelf
ſpeedily to any ſevere courſe of proceeding againſt the <hi>first Adam</hi> and
his Poſterity, that ſinned with him in his loyns, as that he takes this
occaſion to renew his <hi>first Offer,</hi> upon the experience Man now had
of truſting to his own wiſdom and ſtrength. God freely of his own
accord, makes a Promiſe to man, of a Redeemer that ſhould come
in his own Nature, and be made fleſh, to recover him out of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
corrupted ſtate, and bring him and his Poſterity once more, into
<hi>a ſtate of Reconciliation with God,</hi> that what the Law could not do,
in that it was weak through the fleſh, might be done <hi>by God's ſending
his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, who by the ſacrificing of himſelf,
condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be
fulfilled in all ſuch, as walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
And here, behold the Righteouſneſs of God, which is, and declares it
ſelf by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all, that believe,
making no difference; but <hi>as all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the
Glory of God, in the Act of our first Parents diſobedience;</hi> So <hi>all
ſhould be restored and brought into a capacity of being juſtified freely
by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Christ,</hi> and
<hi>made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> againſt all that can be objected
by the Malice of Satan, or from the Juſtice of God's Law, that hath
been broken, and muſt be ſatisfied, either by the perſon offending,
or ſome other, proper to make <hi>Atonement by his Obedience,</hi> in the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51760:13"/>
whereof</hi> we may be accounted <hi>righteous,</hi> as by the Act of
<hi>diſobedience</hi> in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> we were made <hi>ſinners.</hi> This is done
by the <hi>Redemption</hi> which is wrought for <hi>all men,</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs of
ſins through the Blood of Christ,</hi> either <hi>conditionally</hi> or <hi>abſolutely,</hi> Col.
1. 20, 23. Hereupon, God expreſly and ſincerely declares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he <hi>deſires
not the death of a ſinner,</hi> having ſent his only begotten Son into the
World, that <hi>all ſhould live through him,</hi> and <hi>none periſh or die</hi> in their
ſins, <hi>for want of a poſſible and ſufficient Remedy;</hi> even him, whom
God hath fore-ordained and ſet forth, <hi>to be a Propitiation through
Faith in his Blood, for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt.</hi> And this is
ſo far from making void the Law or firſt Covenant between God and
man, that it doth eſtabliſh it, and much clear up the Juſtice of God,
in exacting the Debt of Obedience and Allegiance due to him from
Man, according to the Law, when ſo much Clemency and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
hath preceded, and an <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> freely and of Grace hath
been paſſed, the benefit whereof is conditionally extended unto all.
Hence it is, that the Office of giving and putting in execution the Law
of God, as it is a Miniſtry that works wrath, is committed by the
Father unto Chriſt, as he is the Son of Man; Firſt, <hi>to diſpence Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Mercy, great patience</hi> and <hi>long-ſuffering;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>without Mercy,</hi> as that <hi>fiery Indignation,</hi> which is reſerved for
<hi>wilful</hi> and <hi>hardned ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Chriſt doth plainly intimate, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 10. where he ſaith,
<hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſpeak a word againſt the Son of Man, it ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
him; but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghoſt, it
ſhall not be forgiven.</hi> For what elſe can be the meaning of theſe words,
but that Chriſt would have his Diſciples know, that <hi>Judgment</hi> was
firſt committed to him, as he is the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> made the chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
and Diſpenſer of God's Juſtice, whether <hi>diſtributive</hi> or <hi>reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
the exact Rule whereof is given and contained in the Law of
Nature, or Covenant of Works? The Tranſgreſſions againſt this Law
are capable of remiſſion and forgiveneſs through his Blood, the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
whereof <hi>ſpeaks better things than that of Abel,</hi> and prevails
for gifts <hi>even to the Rebellious,</hi> ſo that they receive not God's grace,
nor take his Name in vain: if they do, he will not hold them guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
nor continue any longer to extend to them the benefit of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
Secondly, Therefore Judgment was committed to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Mercy, in reference to ſuch ſins, by which the doers of them
<hi>blasphemed</hi> and <hi>reſiſted the Miniſtry</hi> he was intruſted with, of giving
the Holy Ghoſt, or inſpiring the hearts of the Regenerate with the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51760:13"/>
                     <hi>new Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and that <hi>ſaving knowledge of God,</hi> which is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
according to the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> and of the <hi>new and everlaſting
Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Royal Office and Dignity, which <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the Son of
Man, is exalted unto, by the perſonal union which he hath with the
Word, being <hi>made a meet Miniſter,</hi> in all reſpects, <hi>through his Death
and Reſurrection, to diſpence God's ſovereign Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>to execute
Judgment and Equity, according to the Law of Nature, renewed and
confirmed in his own Blood.</hi> Herein he is <hi>King of Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of
Lords,</hi> the great and Univerſal Monarch, that is appointed <hi>Law-giver</hi>
and <hi>chief Judge</hi> in Heaven and Earth, to and over all Natural Beings,
whether <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>men,</hi> and is the rewarder of every man according
to his works, with the ſame meaſure that any man metes unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he meaſures out unto him again; and ſtrictly doth inſiſt upon,
and require that which is juſt and due to be paid unto God or man,
by the Law and Principles of the firſt Covenant. He therefore hath
the Gifts and Abilities, incident to that Communion with God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him to diſpence, being the Head of God's <hi>diſtributive,</hi> as
well as his <hi>revenging Juſtice,</hi> and will make it appear, that <hi>he deſires
not to reap where he hath not ſown,</hi> nor to gather where he hath not
firſt ſtrewed, and diſperſed abroad in his bounty and liberality, none
being a more chearful giver and lender of his Goods than He, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for nothing again where there is no ability to pay, not happening
through our own default.</p>
                  <p>This is the Miniſtry which worketh <hi>Wrath,</hi> that is to ſay, contracts
a debt of Puniſhment, and of the Curſe, to every one that joyns iſſue
with God upon the terms of this Covenant, and continues not <hi>in all
things written in it, to do them.</hi> And although by this <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and
that <hi>from Chriſt himſelf</hi> as he is the <hi>Son of man,</hi> there be <hi>a life</hi> and
<hi>communication of God's Image given,</hi> which, in it ſelf conſidered, is
<hi>pure, holy, righteous, ſpiritual,</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> yet, it is but upon ſuch
terms, that it may be again withdrawn and revoked by the Giver,
if he pleaſe; or may be corrupted or forfeited by the Receiver, and ſo
end in death and wrath. The proof of this was ſeen at firſt, in the
Fall of our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> and is ſince, in <hi>all the Children of Perdition,</hi>
who, after all their great and high enlightnings and clenſing from all
their old ſins, fall into a relapſe that is <hi>irrecoverable,</hi> ſo as to become
<hi>trees twice dead,</hi> finally to be pluckt up by the roots and burned.</p>
                  <p>It is <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the exerciſe of this <hi>his firſt Miniſtry,</hi> that we intend,
when we ſay, that he is the <hi>Lord of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Fountain of all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51760:14"/>
upholding a powerful and laſting Witneſs of himſelf <hi>in the
very Natural Conſcience,</hi> where he begets and ſets up that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which declares God <hi>Juſt,</hi> and the <hi>Juſtifier of him that either
is perfectly righteous in his own perſon, with the righteouſneſs that his
Law requires;</hi> or, that (in default thereof) is <hi>righteous in another,</hi>
that God hath given to be <hi>made a Sacrifice for them, that they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> ſuch, as he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to accept on their behalf, and to reward, not of <hi>Debt,</hi> but of
<hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In one of theſe two wayes it is for all men to ſeek to be juſtified, to
anſwer the end of the Law, and to receive the reward of it: But as
to thoſe, that neither in the one nor the other of theſe wayes, deſire to
approve themſelves, and be found righteous, they are juſtly convinced
of all, and ſhall be judged of all, as meet objects for God's reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juſtice, to be ſhewed upon them as the Judgement that is final,
after which, no place is left for Mercy. So then, in and by this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
that begins in Juſtice <hi>diſtributive,</hi> which is founded in God's
bounty and liberality, by which he giveth to all their <hi>being, life</hi> and
<hi>motion,</hi> and filleth the deſire of every living thing; and which end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in <hi>avenging</hi> and <hi>puniſhing Juſtice, upon mercy</hi> and <hi>bounty abuſed,</hi>
(as the known natural Principles of all Law, and righteous Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Government) God manifeſts himſelf the Fountain thereof, in the
Perſon of Chriſt the Mediator. And in this kind of knowledge of
God, and obedience to his Law, all mankind are and muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
whether they will or no; and are to ſhew themſelves, either
his obedient Subjects, whom he countenanceth, protecteth, and
rewardeth, in their well-doing; or his rebellious and diſloyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
over whom he will glorifie himſelf in his avenging Juſtice and
diſpenſation of Judgment at laſt, without Mercy.</p>
                  <p>A remarkable example of this we may ſee in the Caſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 31. 44. <hi>Laban</hi> a Righteous man (at leaſt pretending to
it, in his appeal to the God of Juſtice) converſing with God, in and
under the Law of Nature, and what of God is to be known under
that Miniſtry, ſaith to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Come now, after all our difference and
unkindneſs, thou ſhalt ſee I will deal righteouſly with thee, and put
thee to the proof who ſhall be found more righteous, thou in thy
way of ſerving God, or I in mine. Let us ſtrike a Covenant, I and
thou, and let it be for a Witneſs between me and thee; Let Him
whom I know and ſerve by the Light and Law of Nature, and whom
thou ſerveſt by a higher Law and Light, that of Faith, (which doth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51760:14"/>
not deſtroy, but eſtabliſh the Righteouſneſs of the Law) let him, whoſe
eye only ſeeth, and before whom we cannot be hid, (either from his
knowledge or his vengeance) watch and mark our carriages, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of our Covenant and Agreement; and accordingly be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
for, or againſt us, upon the breach thereof. Unto this <hi>Jacob</hi> chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
agreed upon his Principles, and <hi>Laban</hi> upon his. In which, it is
evident, that the ſame God and Chriſt may be converſed and walked
with, upon differing Principles; and that righteous Agreements may
be upheld and maintained by thoſe that own and call Chriſt to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as he is the <hi>Sovereign Miniſter of God's Juſtice,</hi> whether their
knowledge of him be according to the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> in
both which Chriſt comes forth, as to his Communications and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
Preſence in the hearts of the ſons of men; which is the point
that we are now upon, and have cleared in the firſt branch of it.</p>
                  <p>The Second (being that which conſiſts in a <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of God,</hi> that is <hi>beyond and above Nature,</hi> that which man in
his natural make, at beſt, reacheth not, or hath a mind or will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
is more difficult to be expreſſed, and when expreſſed, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.
For after this manner God is not ſeen or communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any, but in a ſecret and hidden way, which he makes not common,
but reſerves for peculiar kindneſs to thoſe that find grace in his ſight,
upon their coming, as <hi>Eſther</hi> did, into the inner Court, to have this
golden Scepter held out to them, by promiſe, or elſe they die. God's
firſt Voice and Manifeſtation of himſelf unto the Creature, ſpeaks and
declares him (as we have ſhewed) to be juſt, in a way of Law and
righteous Government, which he exerciſeth over his Creatures. He
is their Soveriegn, they are his Subjects, in order to receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Love, or of Wrath: That which this Second Voice mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and ſpeaks, is that Love, and the knowledge of God in it, which
he ſpreads abroad in the hearts of his good and loyal Subjects, after
the proof made of the Loyalty and ſtedfaſtneſs of their Love to him;
<hi>Not that they love him firſt, but of his own Will they are begotten, by
the Word of Truth, into this Love of his, which comprehends them,</hi>
long <hi>before they apprehend it, and God in it.</hi> But <hi>he that ſhall come,
will come, and will not tarry;</hi> if by Faith we are taught to wait for
him, <hi>Whom, having not ſeen, yet, we love,</hi> or, have ſecret cleaving
to, and earneſt longing after: <hi>In whom,</hi> even <hi>whilſt we ſee not,</hi> but
find our ſelves altogether in the dark, and at a loſs, <hi>as to what may be
ſeen</hi> and known of him <hi>by natural Light and Reaſon; yet, believing,
and having thereby</hi> given us the <hi>evidence of things, unſeen by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51760:15"/>
eye, they become ſo real,</hi> and are made <hi>ſo certain to us,</hi> as we
<hi>rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> We could do no
more, were we at the end of our Faith, and did ſee, as we are ſeen,
as we ſhall at the compleat Salvation of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>From him then, that is thus the Love and Joy of the believing Soul,
that is to ſay, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Miniſter of the Spirit, and giver of the holy
Ghoſt, and that new Name which none know but they that have it,
is this Second kind of Knowledge of God, and Communication of
Life from him, that we deſire to open and lay before you.</p>
                  <p>You have already heard that Chriſt is the only begotten of God, as
he is the Building and Sanctuary, which he that is the builder of all
things, ſets up in himſelf, for his own uſe, as his Temple and ſpeaking-place,
where to give and whence to deliver his lively Oracles and
Inſpirations, of both ſorts, with which he fills all things. In this
Heavenly Habitation, God records his Name, and hath the place of
his Throne and of his Footſtool, with which he will dwell and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
among his People for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again, By this workmanſhip and heavenly building,</hi> Chriſt <hi>the</hi>
Mediator <hi>hath a</hi> Creature-being <hi>given unto him</hi> in ſpirit, before the
World was, <hi>and is he who was before all things, and</hi> by whom all
things conſiſt; <hi>is the</hi> Angel of God's Face and Preſence, <hi>that is</hi> by
God <hi>and</hi> with him: <hi>Firſt,</hi> As his chief Meſſenger and Servant, his
Meſſiah; <hi>and then,</hi> as his Spouſe and Equal, that lies in his boſom, knows
all his ſecrets, <hi>and is retained</hi> in the moſt intimate bond of ſpiritual
marriage-union, that is poſſible for Creature-nature to be taken into
with God, even by perſonal union, as the body is with the ſoul. <hi>And
thus Chriſt is found, even as a Creature in the form of God, and is
called</hi> Michael, <hi>God's Fellow and Equal, after ſuch a manner, as the
body is to the ſoul, both making but one perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he lies in the Father's boſom, and is the Spouſe to
the bleſſed Trinity, is a higher manifeſtation of God, than he hath
ſent out from God, as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that bears God's Name only by
figure and repreſentation, as his ſingle Image, which yet ſpeaks truly
what God is, and as fully as the Creatures firſt veſſel of Receipt and
Meaſure, knows how to bear and receive; but doth not ſpeak out
all God's fulneſs, nor ſhew the Original it ſelf, whereof it is the figure
and character, which in its ſingle ſtanding and appearing out of God,
as a thing diſtinct from God, and not at the ſame time known to have
any abode in him, after that intimate manner of union and conjunction,
before-mentioned, the finite and ſhort-ſighted underſtanding of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51760:15"/>
Creature is ready to imagine that manifeſtation and ſight of God's
Glory to be all that is to be known and inherited of God; And to
deſire, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 20.) in the Perſon of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as
the Type, that <hi>God would not add to ſpeak more,</hi> or ſhew forth his
naked and unvail'd glory to them; but they would content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to hear God ſpeak under the Vail, which <hi>Moſes</hi> had put upon
his face, and not look out after any higher attainment. When God
had ſpoken once, and ſhewed the Creature as much of himſelf as it
could take in by its firſt make and conſtitution of being upon natural
Principles, he proceeds to declare his purpoſe to ſpeak again, and <hi>form
a hearing ear</hi> and <hi>ſeeing eye, proportion'd to his ſecond voice,</hi> adding
this kind of hearing and ſight to the ſam<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

and have the place of <hi>guide to them,</hi> and <hi>Lord over them,</hi>
that the Scripture in this ſenſe may be made good, that <hi>the elder
ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> The Root of this <hi>Second ſight of God,</hi> is
wrought out in Chriſt, as he is the <hi>only begotten</hi> that lies in <hi>God's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,</hi>
and from thence is made the Miniſter and Giver of what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
firſt receives and enjoys. So that now, ſuppoſing the <hi>Spirit of the
Mediator,</hi> (that is the <hi>only begotten</hi> and <hi>firſt-born of every creature)</hi>
to be the <hi>Root of all natural Principles and Perfection,</hi> as he is the
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the <hi>hearer</hi> and <hi>obeyer of God's firſt Voice</hi> (of which we
have already ſpoken) we are now to know, that God proceeds to
make the ſame <hi>only Begotten,</hi> to have being and abode in him, as his
peculiar poſſeſſion and choiceſt object of his Love, in the relation of
his Spouſe and Conſort. He is formed and prepared hereunto, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
him that is made able to <hi>hear, receive</hi> and <hi>obey God's Second
Voice,</hi> his higheſt, moſt excellent, and fulleſt manner of <hi>manifeſtation
of himſelf to Creature-underſtanding, with power</hi> in the diſpenſation
of the fulneſs of time, <hi>to become Man,</hi> made <hi>of a Woman, under the
Law,</hi> and afterwards <hi>raiſed up from the dead,</hi> and made to <hi>ſit down
on the right hand of the Majeſty on high;</hi> working out the ſame work
in <hi>Jeſus</hi> his Servant, the chief and principal Branch, which is firſt
wrought out in himſelf, as in the root and head of all natural and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
perfection. It is then a kind of <hi>working over the Creature
again,</hi> out of its firſt frame and conſtitution of being, into a frame and
conſtitution <hi>much more excellent and capacious,</hi> a ſtate <hi>incorruptible,</hi>
never needing, nor being ſubjected to change of any kind, afterward,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51760:16"/>
which the firſt building upon natural principles, doth, and did need.
This <hi>working over,</hi> or <hi>re-building the Creature</hi> again, called in
Scripture <hi>Regeneration,</hi> is not ſimply <hi>reſtoration</hi> or <hi>confirmation,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
immutableneſs to the firſt Principles, and no more; but it is
quite a <hi>new Creation,</hi> that takes down of the firſt building, as much
as the Builder pleaſeth, and leaves no more of it ſtanding, than what
is conſiſtent with, and grows up into perfect harmony, uſe, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs
to and with the new addition and enlargement that is
made, not deſtroying the firſt Image of God in man. This <hi>rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
work</hi> then produceth not a total anihilation of the <hi>natural being,</hi>
but brings upon the life and manner of operation that flows from <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
principles,</hi> ſuch a ceſſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ath it ſelf,</hi> rendring it impoſſible for the
Creature to live or move any longer unto ſin and evil; and quickning
it, and raiſing it out of this dead ſtate, into the greateſt freedom to, and
ſtedfaſt perſeverance in all kinds of good that is imaginable, as that
which becomes moſt natural and delightful, the contrary thereunto
moſt grievous and diſquietful to it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Second Life,</hi> which accompanies Salvation, and brings Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
to light, is a kind of life from the dead, that the natural
beings of Angels and Men are begotten into, by being made meet
Temples and Subjects for the Holy Ghoſt, in a ſtate of life eternal, by
a union with God that can never be diſſolved. Angels therefore as
well as Men, are called <hi>Children of the Reſurrection,</hi> Luke 20. 35, 36.
as they are brought into a ſtate never to change more.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, even amongſt theſe <hi>Children of the Reſurrection,</hi> that
the <hi>immortal life,</hi> wherewith they are quickned by Chriſt, as he is
the giver of the Holy Ghoſt is of two ſorts, as to the degree and
meaſure of the glory thereof. Firſt, Such, <hi>wherein Men and Angels
are equal:</hi> And the Second, <hi>Such, wherein ſome Men are made in
ſuch manner Chriſt's Equals, the Lamb's or Bridegroom's Wife</hi> that
lies in <hi>his boſom, that they are the Angels ſuperiours,</hi> and are made
<hi>joynt-heirs with Chriſt, of that Name,</hi> which he hath obtained, <hi>better
than that which is the Angels food,</hi> that <hi>Word of God's mouth</hi> that
<hi>they live upon.</hi> So that now, when we ſpeak of Chriſt, as the <hi>Author
of life Eternal, in this ſecond ſort of Miniſtry,</hi> wherein the natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the creature are, as it were, wrought over again and rebuilt,
we would be underſtood, that <hi>there is a birth of this Immortality,
which amounts to the giving of the Holy Ghoſt, in the ſingle portion
of it,</hi> and alſo <hi>in the double portion of it,</hi> as we ſhall diſtinctly open
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51760:16"/>
in its place; both being diſtinct from that <hi>pure, holy, righteous life of
Nature</hi> that was at firſt given by <hi>Creation,</hi> or afterwards renewed
by a <hi>Reſtoration</hi> and kind of <hi>new Creation of qualities,</hi> but falls ſhort
of <hi>true and ſaving Regeneration,</hi> properly and rightly explicated and
made known; by which the <hi>natural frame and make of the natural
ſoul and ſpirit of man,</hi> is in a manner wholly altered and changed,
and much for the better, becauſe it is raiſed out of its <hi>frail, mutable,
wavering,</hi> as well as <hi>ſinful, natural ſtate,</hi> into a <hi>ſtrong, ſtable, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
poſture of mind,</hi> in <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>true Holineſs,</hi> as a <hi>Rock</hi>
and <hi>Stone,</hi> that <hi>the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against.</hi> This fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gift and Grace of God, though it be the end of Man's Creation,
and that which God, as the reward to thoſe that are obedient under
the firſt Miniſtry, doth promiſe and hold forth, in a way of Promiſe,
yet is conditional, and ſo, that which in Juſtice God need not confer
upon any that perform not the Condition, but by their ſin do forfeit it.
And therefore it ſo happens, that all who inherit this Bleſſing, are
made receivers of it, by Promiſe, and by a ſecond and new Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with God, which he enters into with them, in regenerating them,
and makes them new Creatures, thenceforward to ſerve him and live
to him, in newneſs of Spirit and Life.</p>
                  <p>3. We now come to ſhew, according to the <hi>Third</hi> Particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
who thoſe be that are Chriſt's <hi>Anointed Ones</hi> and <hi>Witneſses,</hi>
under both his fore-mentioned Adminiſtrations, and the Anointing it
ſelf, which is given, by the one and by the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, as we have ſhewed, the <hi>Original and primitive Pattern of
all Perfections;</hi> the Works, that were finiſhed from the beginning,
known to God from all Eternity, and actually wrought and ſet up
from Everlaſting, in the Mediator, through that Eternal Wiſdom,
which was by God, as one brought up with him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. and whom
he poſſeſſed in the beginning of his way, before his Works of old, ere
ever the Earth was. And what is true in Chriſt, who is <hi>not only the
Root, but the chief and principal Branch,</hi> hath its Witneſs, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the Work which he begets, and ſhines forth in, amongſt his
Members, knit to him, by an abiding or indiſſoluable union; all that
are Branches in this <hi>true Vine,</hi> whoſe Fruit is ſuch as is <hi>cheering,</hi>
both to the <hi>heart of God</hi> and of <hi>Man;</hi> that is to ſay, of Man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in his higher or lower attainments, and growths, up into the
knowledge and love of God, as he is Man, and no more, partaking
of the Spirit of God by meaſure; And, ſecondly, of Man, made the
only Begotten of God, that lyes in the boſom of the Father, and is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51760:17"/>
anointed with the <hi>Oyl of gladneſs above his fellows,</hi> which Chriſt's
exalted Manhead is, and that after ſuch ſort, as not to have and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the dignity of it to himſelf, ſingle and alone, but <hi>as</hi> the <hi>Head and
Husband to that General Aſſembly of the Firſt-born,</hi> whoſe Names
are <hi>written in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>have right to the double portion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The right opening of this, is the great Key to all our practical and
experimental Knowledge of God, which is found amongſt the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Seed of God, that are either of the one or other birth, Children
of the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> in every Nation, Tongue, Language
or Form, truly ſearing God and working Righteouſneſs, and therein
accepted of God, either through Faith, or with that common accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
declared, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi>
whilſt in the mean time they may be great ſtrangers unto, if not much
prejudiced againſt one another, for not walking together in one and
the ſame way of Profeſſion and external Communion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Give me leave then, to diſtinguiſh this Seed of God into</hi> Four ſorts:
Two, <hi>that are</hi> Witneſſes unto Chriſt's firſt Miniſtry, <hi>as he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and Reſtorer of the</hi> Law and Principles of pure Nature, <hi>and is
the</hi> diſpenſer of God's Image, <hi>and</hi> the manifeſtation of his Will, upon
the terms of the firſt Covenant; <hi>And other</hi> two, <hi>that are</hi> Witneſſes
unto the truth of Christ's ſecond Miniſtry, <hi>as he is the</hi> new Creator,
that regenerates and makes over again his firſt work anew, <hi>is the</hi>
Author of Life from the dead, <hi>and</hi> bringer of Immortality to light;
<hi>which is not done by the firſt Covenant, nor can be; but, by this</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
knowledge <hi>and</hi> Image of God, <hi>begotten and wrought, by, and
according to the tenor of</hi> the new and everlaſting Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of Witneſſes we ſhall ſpeak unto; and rightly to have
the knowledge of them, we muſt yet further conſider Man in his firſt
make, and in the primitive conſtitution of being that was given to him
in his ſtate of Innocency before ſin entred: So as to enquire, upon
what terms Man then ſtood with God, and in what reſpect he was
pronounced <hi>good</hi> in God's eyes, and might be ſaid to be accepted
of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man</hi> then had the <hi>perfect knowledge of God</hi> and <hi>of Chriſt, as his
Creator and Law-giver</hi> (for God created all things by Jeſus Chriſt;
by the Word of God's mouth, in the Mediator, did all things live,
move, and had their being) ſo that what might be known of God,
even of his <hi>Eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> by the things that were
made, that is, by the means of any created beings, viſible or inviſible,
it was <hi>manifeſted in man,</hi> and was <hi>ſhewed to man, by that mixt, com
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51760:17"/>
pound being,</hi> which was given him, of an <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>ſenſual</hi> or
<hi>animal Soul,</hi> which furniſhed him with inward and outward ſenſes,
proportioned for ſuch a <hi>knowledge,</hi> and which were retained <hi>in due
ſubjection</hi> and <hi>ſubordination</hi> the one unto the other. From ſuch a
proſpect and ſurvey of things, as Man at firſt was fitted to receive both
from within and without him, the <hi>inviſible things of the Godhead</hi> were
clearly ſeen by him, rendring him without all excuſe, being thereby
inſtructed in the duty of his <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>ſubjection</hi> to the <hi>Law of
God</hi> under which he was made, to the glorifying him as God; which
as God expected and required from man, ſo he owned a liking and
acceptance of from man, with whom he treated, and agreed upon the
terms of his <hi>perſonal obedience,</hi> and <hi>entire obſervance</hi> of all his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi>
and <hi>continuance therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Three things</hi> man in this ſtate, might, and did experimentally find
in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The light and manifeſtation of God's Mind and Will, as a
Law within him, <hi>called in Scripture,</hi> The Candle of the Lord, the
Oyl with which God furniſhed the Lamp of man's ſpirit, which he was
to take care, that through his default he did not let it go out, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh;
but quicken and renew it, as it ſhould need, by ſuch means
God inſtituted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond thing which man experienced, was,</hi> the life of a rational
and intellectual Soul; <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> a ſuperior part in the ſame Soul,
affording the uſe of inward ſenſes, that by keeping open and awake, he
had, as it were, an intercourſe with the ſpiritual and inviſible beings
of Angels, and ſaw the intrinſick natures of the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thirdly,</hi> He found alſo, a brutiſh nature, of which he was
compouuded and made, which furniſhed him with the uſe and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of outward ſenſes, by which he might go abroad, and walk up and
down in converſe with earthly things and inhabitants: The fountain
of theſe outward ſenſes, his inferior part, to be in his ſoul or ſpirit. With
theſe he came to perform, and put in execution, that which the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
and directive part of him, judged right and fit to be done.</p>
                  <p>This was the inward and outward order of actings, that Man at firſt
was created in, with a freedom to make uſe of this Light within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
(which God, as a Talent, had committed to him to imploy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will) and rely upon his guidance and the ſufficiency
of it, to attain the end God ſet before him, in the way of his <hi>perfect
obedience,</hi> and keeping out the entrance of ſin, or elſe upon the ſenſe
of the <hi>inſtability</hi> he might diſcern in theſe Principles of <hi>Freedom,</hi> that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51760:18"/>
leave him alone and to himſelf, and the <hi>Inſufficiency</hi> to continue by the
power of the <hi>Grace</hi> received in well-doing, againſt all reſiſting and
deceiving temptations, to chuſe rather to make reſignation up of this
his Freedom, wherein he was at his own guidance and diſpoſe, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for a better and more <hi>perfect Freedom,</hi> that is to ſay, in order
to be intirely at the will of another, and the leading influence thereof in
all things, even of ſuch another, whoſe ſervice is <hi>perfect Freedom,</hi> and
who ſhould be as Surety for the performance of the duty to God's
Law, and ſecure us from the penalty of the Curſe therein threatned
againſt the Tranſgreſſion thereof, which was pointed out to <hi>Adam</hi> in
the Tree of Life, as <hi>John</hi> interprets by the Promiſe, mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi>
2. 7. <hi>To him that overcometh</hi> (which is done through Faith) <hi>will
I give to eat of the Tree of Life</hi> or Immortality, which is fed on by
Faith; through the power of which, the entire reſignation of our will,
into the leading and rule of the Spirit and Will of Chriſt is onely
wrought, and of which we ſhall treat particularly in its proper place,
though this ſmall touch of it is needful here: But the choice which
Man made, was, to lean to his own underſtanding for his guide, and
to truſt to the uſe of his Freedom, which gave him to be at his own
diſpoſe, as ſufficient to encounter with and reſiſt all Temptations, and
upon the firſt encounter failed and miſcarried, and let in Sin, Death
and Wrath upon himſelf and all his Poſterity, as the ſad Conſequence
of that Fact of his.</p>
                  <p>To be then upon theſe terms, as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his <hi>fall,</hi> perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
righteous, and finding <hi>acceptance</hi> with <hi>God</hi> whilſt we ſtand in ſuch
<hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> is an Effect which <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>firſt
Miniſtry</hi> doth produce in the <hi>hearts of men,</hi> making them in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the <hi>firſt ſort</hi> of the <hi>four Witneſses</hi> we have before-mentioned,
and which, though we have been conſidering of them in the Perſon
of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> before the <hi>Fall;</hi> yet by the ſame Rule and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
the <hi>Witneſs</hi> is ſtill the ſame, whether it be communicated ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
at mans <hi>Creation,</hi> or elſe by <hi>renewal</hi> or <hi>reſtauration</hi> again after
the <hi>fall</hi> by the <hi>ſame hand</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry</hi> which firſt gave it, which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> may do if he pleaſe; and that he hath done is moſt obvious and
undeniable from the experience we have had of late years, within
theſe Nations, in a ſort of <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes of Chriſt,</hi> that do
exactly go upon this bottom of <hi>Perſonal Righteouſneſs,</hi> wrought by
the Principles of <hi>pure Nature, renewed and reſtored within them,</hi>
which they aſſert may be held <hi>in perfection whilſt we are here in the
body,</hi> and by which we may, as by the <hi>Light within us,</hi> perfectly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51760:18"/>
ſubdue our brutiſh nature, and keep under the body, though all this be
accompanied with <hi>mutability,</hi> and the <hi>acceptance</hi> which they find with
God is according to their works, whilſt they do well, <hi>otherwiſe ſin is
at the door,</hi> and the puniſhment according to the ſame. This ſort
of Profeſſors of the Name of Chriſt, riſe ſo high in their Teſtimony
concerning him, as to call him, <hi>The glorious Sun of the ſoul; the
Searcher through of all darkneſs; the Wonderful Power; the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
Wiſdom, and Immutable Holineſs; a thing that is inviſible
to every fleſhly thing; the one individual Spirit of Brightneſs, that
created all ſouls;</hi> and are ſo dazeled with the Beams of this Glory,
(all which he truly is) that they overlook him too much according to
his Humanity, and ſee him not as he is the Son of man, in whom Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
is wrought for us, and the Atonement for ſin made by the
price of his Blood, the benefit whereof they have, whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
it or not: Theſe are they, that <hi>by the Candle of the Lord that is
lighted within them</hi> (the work whereof is written in their inward
parts) though they be not ſo much <hi>hearers of the Law by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the outward Word,</hi> yet do they ſhew themſelves <hi>doors of the
Law</hi> by <hi>the power of the Light</hi> that is <hi>within them; doing,</hi> as it were,
<hi>by Nature the things contained in the Law, and ſo not having the
Law,</hi> outwardly conſidered, <hi>are a Law to themſelves, ſhewing the
work of it written in their hearts;</hi> and <hi>by keeping the Righteouſneſs
of the Law, do judge them, who by the Letter tranſgreſſe the Law,
and do feel Peace and Comfort in their works.</hi> In this manner did the
<hi>Centurian fear God</hi> and <hi>work Righteouſneſs,</hi> Act. 10. before he heard
thoſe words from <hi>Peter,</hi> that inſtructed him in the knowledge of
Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, and the Peace that comes to the
Soul by his Blood, unto the Remiſſion of ſins, by whom all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
are juſtified from all things, which they could not be juſtified
from by the Law of Nature or Works. Theſe ought not to be denied
place in this rank of Chriſt's Witneſſes, whereof we have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſince they own and declare themſelves to be <hi>fearers of God</hi> and
<hi>workers of Righteouſneſs,</hi> upon theſe firſt principles of it which <hi>pure
Nature</hi> teaches and plants, where ever it is renewed and reſtored from
the hand of Chriſt's liberality and bounty, to put the Receivers of it
to the tryal, how far they will ſhew their faithfulneſs in the meaſure
committed to them, and in what readineſs they are to put theſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
out in the way of exchange to get more, and not to reſt untill
they obtain that ſtate which is immutable. It therefore greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
ſuch to look to their ſtanding, which is very ſlippery and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51760:19"/>
and take heed leſt they fall; and to think ſoberly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as they ought to think; and not affirm, as they are apt to do,
<hi>that their Witneſs contains in it all that Chriſt is:</hi> leſt otherwiſe,
when they come to be weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, they
be found at laſt to <hi>deny</hi> more of Chriſt than they <hi>confeſs</hi> of him: Nor
are they to exalt this part of the Miniſtry of Chriſt, which is but the
beginning againſt that fuller ſight and knowledge of him that is ſtill
to be revealed; but this one thing they ſhould do, <hi>Forget that which
is behind, and preſs forward to the mark of the prize of the high
calling which is in Christ:</hi> And although it be a commendable thing
in them, even upon their Principles, to ſpread the knowledge of Chriſt
in all the dark corners of the world, where the Scriptures and written
Word of Truth are not heard or received, the effect of which labours,
with God's bleſſing, may be the heightning and refining man's nature,
and purging it from filthy luſts and prophaneſs, teaching them to fly
from the Wrath and Vengeance which awaits evil-doers; Yet this is
to be done in ſubſerviency unto, not in oppoſition againſt the right
knowledge and powerful Preaching of the Scriptures, thoſe Divine
Oracles which God hath preſerved for the great benefit and uſe of his
Church in all times ſince the firſt writing of them. By theſe are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
the righteous Principles and Actings according to the Law of
pure Nature, wherein Man was at firſt created, and may ſo often as
Chriſt pleaſes, be again received in by that Light with which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens
every man that comes into the world, whereof Chriſt (as we
have ſhewed) is the Author and Diſpenſer; and under this firſt Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
all theſe are to be comprehended, who approve themſelves <hi>doers
of the Law, men that fear God and work Righteouſneſs in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in ſuch manner as God accepts, though as yet they have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the knowledge of Chriſt by the outward Miniſtry and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the written Word.</p>
                  <p>But as theſe are ſuch who pretend, to be <hi>doers of the Law by a
Light within</hi> them, without dependance upon the Miniſtry of the
written Word, by a Teaching of the Word, as it is ſpoken inwardly
to the mind by Angels, who are entruſted with it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1. So there
is a ſecond ſort of Witneſſes unto the ſame Principles in ſubſtance, that
is to ſay, to the life of the Image of God in pure Nature, wherein man
was at firſt created, as it comes again to be renewed and reſtored with
power in the ſoul, by the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
that is by his Blood through the Miniſtry of the written
Word, and the operation of the Spirit of Chriſt in the uſe of thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51760:19"/>
Ordinances and Inſtitutions of Worſhip, which he hath appointed and
revealed in the Scriptures, according to the ſeveral meaſures of their
growth up into this knowledge of Chriſt, and faithfull walking with
him therein, under the variety of Profeſſion and Forms of viſible Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
that are extant, in that which is acknowledged or witneſſed to be
the viſible Chriſtian Church; which, by the preaching of the Goſpel,
upon the Aſcention of Chriſt, and the Miniſtry of his Spirit poured
forth in the primitive ſtate of it, came to be raiſed up by God's viſiting
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to take out of them a People of his Name, that he might
ſubſtitute unto himſelf as another <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>holy People</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of
viſible Profeſſors of his Name, in the room and place of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and the old Law and Form of Worſhip that had been in practice
among them, <hi>Rom</hi> 11. which made <hi>James,</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 16, 17.
apply the words of the Prophets, unto this new Chriſtian Gentile
Church, which ſayes, <hi>After this I will return, and will build up
the Tabernacle of David, which is fallen down, and will build again
the ruines thereof; and I will ſet it up, that the reſidue of men might
ſeek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my Name is
called, ſaith the Lord, who doth all theſe things.</hi> Now amongſt the
viſible Members of the Chriſtian Church (as evidently appears, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.)
there were a Generation, that under the Name of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and
<hi>hearers of the Gospel and Miniſtry of the Spirit, according to the New
Teſtament,</hi> choſe ſtill to retain the Principles of the Law and firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
as the ballance of all their Faith, Obedience and Worſhip,
deſiring to be under the Law and Dominion of it, and to cleave to the
upholding and doing thoſe things, which, according to the Judgment
of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> made them <hi>debtors to the whole Law,</hi> and ſtruck
them clear off from the true Principles of Grace, that are by the Law
of Faith, and of the new and everlaſting Covenant; and of this, they
gave but too clear a proof, in that they gloried in ſomething that was
on this ſide the Spiritual mind, which is ſet upon things that are
above, and which ought to be died unto by the Doctrine of the Croſs,
unto which they ſhew themſelves the declared and zealous oppoſers.</p>
                  <p>Not, but that in words and profeſſion theſe pretended as much to
own the Principles of Free-Grace, and of the New-Teſtament as
any, and have their approach to it, at leaſt, when they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſome more and ſome leſs; but, when they are brought to the
Tryal, they quickly ſhew that they are not able to endure the bridling
and reſtraint which the New-Teſtament puts upon them, by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Croſs of Chriſt, to the crucifying that wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51760:20"/>
and affect to glory, from which they are excluded by the Law of
Faith and the New-Creature, as we ſhall ſhew in its place; So that
in Truth, that which theſe <hi>ſecond ſort of Witneſſes</hi> have in their eye, is
not the being and life of the New Creature, but the reſtoration of the
<hi>old Adam</hi> in his primitive, righteous and holy ſtate, into which they
grow up and are found for the life of their holineſs; and upon that
bottom, as a qualification to entitle them to all the Promiſes, and their
abode and continuance in Fellowſhip and Communion with Chriſt,
and Intereſt in his Death, for the Remiſſion of ſins; They do experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſuch acceptance from Chriſt, and are in themſelves ſo certain of
their good Eſtates to their Eternal Salvation, that they will not endure
to hear, wherein they are in a miſtake, nor that it is poſſible for them
to be better.</p>
                  <p>Theſe do indeed excel the <hi>firſt Witneſſes</hi> in the doctrinal part of the
knowledge of Chriſt, confeſſing him in that great part of his Prieſtly
Office (which the others ſee not) as he bare our Tranſgreſſions, and
made Atonement for the ſin of mankind, by the Sacrifice of himſelf;
in the benefit of which Sacrifice they find their outward <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi>
more than in their <hi>righteous works:</hi> nay, when as to the <hi>light</hi> and
<hi>evidence</hi> of their <hi>Sanctification,</hi> they are at a loſs and in the dark;
they have an adherence to the <hi>blood of Chriſt,</hi> as the propitiation for
their ſins, and his interceſſion on their behalfs to the Father, for the
obtaining new ſtrength againſt Corruption, and the renewal of their
former peace and comfort; which experience the <hi>firſt ſort of Witneſſes</hi>
are ſtrangers to, or ſee no need of, but account themſelves Juſtified as
well as Sanctified by the inward purity and perfection which they have
attained with power over the <hi>brutiſh</hi> and <hi>ſenſual Nature,</hi> that
they are more careful and able to <hi>keep under,</hi> than this <hi>ſecond ſort</hi>
are.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, The <hi>Oyl</hi> which is given from <hi>Chriſt</hi> under this <hi>firſt
Miniſtry</hi> in either of theſe reſpects before-mentioned, is that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing</hi>
that through the frailty and weakneſs of the <hi>Veſſel</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it, is not abiding, but at the beſt is but as a ſojourner, that
finds not in theſe hearts the <hi>new man,</hi> that is the place of its reſt,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. and though it be uſed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to trim the <hi>Lamp of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of man</hi> with, when renewed and reſtored to the <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>
that is required by the Law of God, in any degree and meaſure
of ſincerity or chaſtity of the pure <hi>Lamb</hi>-like and virgin Spirit, yet
being only in the <hi>Lamp,</hi> where it ſpends and conſumes and muſt be
duly renewed, and by a frame of heart meet to receive it, and cheeriſh
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51760:20"/>
it; or elſe being grieved and quenched, it ſuddenly departs: Hence
it is, that amongſt theſe <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> under this <hi>Anointing,</hi> which is
from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the operation, good, righteous, holy, and ſpiritual,
and the <hi>change</hi> made by it, true and real; there are ſuch a number of
viſible Profeſſors that prove Hypocrites, Apoſtates, and fall away
from the Grace and enlightening they have felt and experienced, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
both themſelves and others, being not able to hold it out in
the day of Tryal, nor to perſevere and endure to the end; without,
on the other hand, ſtumbling on the <hi>ſtumbling ſtone,</hi> and becoming
prejudiced againſt any higher and further growths up into Chriſt: or,
on the other hand, through fear of loſs by Perſecution, are terrified
from well-doing (with amazement) or, are bought off from it with
the reward of <hi>unrighteouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>Balaam</hi> was; and as <hi>Demas</hi> who
embraced this preſent World.</p>
                  <p>And the Reaſon of this, as to the <hi>one</hi> as well as the <hi>other ſort</hi> of
theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> is, becauſe that is wanting to them which ſhould <hi>fix
them,</hi> and make them <hi>unchangeable</hi> in well-doing, and cauſe them to
be <hi>Pillars in the Houſe of God</hi> that never <hi>go out</hi> more. That they are
partakers of <hi>righteous Principles,</hi> and are qualified with <hi>Power</hi> to
work <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and this from preſent <hi>annointing</hi> and <hi>impreſſion</hi>
of the <hi>true and right Spirit,</hi> is not, nor ought not to be denied them:
They may be <hi>Virgins,</hi> and have <hi>Lamps well trimed with Oyl freſh and
full,</hi> and yet not <hi>able</hi> to <hi>keep this Oyl from ſpending and going out,</hi> nor
prevent their own being to <hi>ſeek</hi> for <hi>want of it,</hi> when they ſhould
have the <hi>greateſt uſe</hi> of it. And indeed, the <hi>firſt ſort</hi> do confeſs as
much, and own their <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to be <hi>mutable,</hi> and they no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to have certainty in it, than they can ſtand in the <hi>Obedience;</hi> and
that their ſtanding or falling, may be or may not be, as they give their
free aſſent or diſſent to the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> that preſents it ſelf to them.
But with many, under the <hi>ſecond ſort of Witneſſes,</hi> it is not ſo; for
they faſten upon the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that is wrought in his
Perſon, as that which is unchangeable in it ſelf,</hi> which it is, if they do
but rightly apply it, and hold it upon the Texnure of the abſolute and
better <hi>Promiſes</hi> which are by the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> whereof they make
no doubt but they do. And as to their <hi>Sanctification,</hi> they have the
<hi>Law</hi> for their <hi>Rule,</hi> which in it ſelf is Moral and Perpetual, and ſo
they believe all real and true <hi>Conformity</hi> to it, wrought in their <hi>hearts,</hi>
muſt alſo be, although their <hi>hearts</hi> be not yet made that <hi>good ſoyl,</hi>
that <hi>where it hath received the Word, and retained it for a ſeaſon,
are not prepared to keep it for ever, and to bring forth fruit with that</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51760:21"/>
patience, as will loſe all other things, rather than ever be prevailed
with, to let it go.</p>
                  <p>From both theſe <hi>ſorts</hi> of <hi>Witneſſes, Chriſt</hi> is Preached, and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>
made known and Propagated in the World, and a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kept up againſt open Looſeneſs and Prophanneſs, Atheiſm and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
and by theſe Spiritual Traders and Merchants in the Traffick
of Chriſt's Goods and Talents of the Common Gifts and Graces of his
Spirit, there is by ſome, a right &amp; good uſe and approvement made, ſo
as they are at laſt perſwaded to put them to the Exchangers for their
Lord's Advantage, and their own benefit; being willing to purchaſe
the <hi>one Pearl</hi> of great price, which is obtained through <hi>ſaving Faith</hi>
and <hi>Regeneration;</hi> for many of theſe <hi>ſmall Pearls</hi> that in the Day
of Proof and Tryal, will not endure: And thoſe that do <hi>eat and
drink unworthily of this Table of the Lord,</hi> notwithſtanding the many
wonderful things they do in his Name, <hi>he will profeſs he knows them not,</hi>
but let them ſee, they <hi>have eat and drunk their own damnation,</hi> and
<hi>left themſelves wholly without all excuſe:</hi> And therefore, both theſe
degrees and growths up into Chriſt Jeſus, as branches in the <hi>Vine,</hi>
that after real union, muſt either by better husbandry applied to them,
come to receive a faſtening in and with the Root, that cannot be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
nor diſſolved, or elſe prove <hi>withered branches,</hi> at laſt that upon
tryal are only fit for the fire; Their great care and buſineſs ſhould
be to make their Calling and Election ſure, and from evidence which
cannot fail nor deceive, experience that the Root bears them, and not
they the Root.</p>
                  <p>And thus we come to the Conſideration of the other <hi>two ſorts</hi> of
<hi>Witneſſes,</hi> that are the <hi>ſtanding Plants and Olive Trees in the Houſe
of God,</hi> which are planted by the <hi>Fathers right hand,</hi> and none what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
can pluck up. In the former I have ſpoke to, Chriſt <hi>dwells as
in his Tents and mutable habitations,</hi> who in that reſpect are called
<hi>Temples of the Holy Ghost,</hi> that may ſo be defiled, that God may
deſtroy and caſt them out of his ſight for ever; but theſe we now
come to deſcribe, do Conſtitute that <hi>Mount Zion</hi> that cannot be
moved, that <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> which is made a quiet <hi>habitation,
a place of everlaſting Reſt, a Tabernacle that ſhall not be taken down</hi>
(as the firſt muſt, in order to be new built in the Regeneration) <hi>not
one of the Stakes thereof ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of
the Cords thereof be broken;</hi> but there the Lord will be for ever, a
place of broad Rivers and Streams that ſhall ſpring up into life eternal,
and that from the loweſt Ebbs, at firſt no higher than the Anckles,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51760:21"/>
become ſtill aſcending, not only to the heighth and ſtature of man in
his fulleſt perfection, but alſo above it, till it come to be a River to
ſwim in, a River, pure and clear as Criſtal, that proceeds from the
Throne of God and of the Lamb (the Son of man glorified) in the
midſt of the ſtreet; and on either ſide whereof is the Tree of Life, or
thoſe who live and feed upon that incorruptible Fruit.</p>
                  <p>The work which is wrought by Chriſt in and upon the <hi>two firſt
ſort of Profeſſors of his Name,</hi> is that which ſeals them and binds
them faſt up in the bundle of life unto the Redemption that is eternal,
and makes them to give witneſs to what Chriſt is and doth in his <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Miniſtry,</hi> as he ſends the holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of Truth, which
abides in them that are made Receivers of him, under an Obligation,
<hi>never to depart from them, nor ſuffer them to depart from him;</hi> that
is, he that ſtabliſheth us in Chriſt, pouring out that Anointing which
ſealeth us with the Seal of the living God, as with the Name of our
Father in our forehead, the effectual calling of whoſe Name upon us,
by working in us, and making us fit Veſſels to receive it and bear it,
is our Adoption, and that manner of admitting us unto the right and
dignity of Sons, which makes us heirs according to the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>And this is done by Chriſt, not as Creator, and the Giver of the
Law and Life of pure Nature upon its firſt Principles; but by Chriſt
as he miniſters that Spirit of Truth, which is the Inſpiration before-deſcribed,
that proceeds from the Father and the Son, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the holy Ghoſt, or third Perſon in the Trinity, whoſe work
is Perfection and conſummative of what is already in being, by the
Creation and Operation of the Son or Eternal Word; and yet cauſeth
ſo great an Alteration in the natural being of man, taken at his beſt,
from what it was before, and that ſo much for the better; with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to abundance and immutability of that which Nature it ſelf calls
<hi>good and righteous,</hi> that it juſtly deſerves to be call'd a <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or <hi>Regeneration,</hi> that gives a new Creature <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> far
excelling the <hi>firſt,</hi> and much differing in glory from it. To evidence
this,</p>
                  <p>Let us conſider Man in the righteouſneſs of his Natural being,
wherein he hath a right underſtanding of God's mind (in what is
required by the Law, which he conſents and agrees to, as that which
is righteous, and holy, and ſpiritual, and good) and a will to put it
in execution, as that which, in the doing thereof, he doth but his
duty, and which he is obliged to by GOD, and his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Engagement, and to continue therein under the danger of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51760:22"/>
Curſe upon failer. Here the Command is a Lamp, and the Law is
Light, to inſtruct man in his Duty; and the Spirit and Mind of man,
keeping to this Light, and walking up to it, and faithfully in it, is in a
good and perfect ſtate, by God approved and juſtified; ſo that there be
but a continuance in it: And this Chriſt ſeems to acknowledge to him
that put him the Queſtion, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 25. <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit
Eternal life?</hi> In the Anſwer he gives, bidding him do that which is
written in the Law, which ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, with all thy ſtrength, and with
all thy mind; do this, and thou ſhalt live:</hi> Where then lies the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty?
what is it that is yet wanting?</p>
                  <p>The difficulty lies in man's part, whereof he is not enough ſenſible,
and the want is, that of a Guide and Surety, to ſet and to keep man's
ſpirit right in the doing of that which the Law requires, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
God prizes and moſt eſteems: For there is a way that is right in
man's eyes, even in yeelding obedience to the Law of God, wherein
man glories, and is puffed up in himſelf, but hath no praiſe from
God; and this is from that ſpring and principle of activity which is
ſeated in the freedom of Will, which is natural to man in his firſt
righteous Nature, and was found in him before his Fall, and is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Reſtitution ſince, nay, is actually reſtored through the benefit of
his Death, more or leſs in every man, by that common Light and
Grace which Chriſt doth no more withhold from any man, than he
doth his Rain from raining upon the Juſt and Unjuſt; but in way of
further bounty, doth confer in large proportions where he pleaſeth, a
diſtribution of his Goods and Spiritual Gifts, in which he cauſeth the
Receivers thereof to differ one from another, according to the uſe he
intends them unto. By which enriching of man's nature upon this his
reſtored natural bottom of a free active righteous ſpirit, according to
the Law, whilſt the primitive mutability is ſtill continuing with him,
he is ſo far from being made a New Creature and truly regenerate (as
is but too generally conceived) that nothing but paſſing under the new
Creation-work, tranſlating man out of his primitive natural freedom
and activity, into an activity and Freedom of another kind, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to hinder this firſt freedom from engendring to bondage, and the
righteouſneſs accompanying it, from failing and ending in the death of
Hypocriſie and final Apoſtacy; which made Chriſt, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 31. to
deal ſo plainly with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that in this wavering ſpirit were for the
preſent ſuch as paſſed currant for Believers, and were ſo called by the
Evangeliſts; but Chriſt knew they were not of continuance; and ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51760:22"/>
told them, ver. 31. together with the Remedy which he had by him
for the cure of it. For they ſtood in need to be made free by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth; or rather, to be known of him that is True;
the Son that abides in the houſe for ever, who is able to bring them
into that ſtate of freedom, that ſhall make them <hi>free indeed,</hi> with an
impoſſibility ever to be imbondaged more, or to ſerve ſin as their
lord and maſter.</p>
                  <p>This mutable ſtate, wherein man did at firſt receive God's Image
by Creation, and doth in the way of Reſtoration again partake of it,
by vertue of the Miniſtry of Chriſt's firſt anointing and comforting
Preſence, in which he takes up his habitation in the ſoul, as a ſo jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and paſſenger, although there be given that knowledge of God's
Will and Mind to man, which is true, and as perfect and full, as the
Veſſel that takes it can bear; yet the weakneſs of the Veſſel is ſuch,
that it is like the wave of the Sea, toſſed with every wind when tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
ariſes, and is either of it ſelf apt to miſtake and miſunderſtand
the Rule given him to walk by, or to cloſe and fall in with a falſe
deceitful ſpirit, transforming himſelf into the Image of Righteouſneſs,
and imbrace him for the True one: for whatever Image of God that
which is a meer Creature, and no more, is found in, the old Serpent
knows how to imitate and perſonate the ſame, in the very likeneſs
wherein it ſhines forth in Chriſt's own Perſon, and with the ſame to
ſeat himſelf in the hearts of his followers, as in the Temple of God,
and to ſhew himſelf as far as that will go, for proof and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he is God, to the imbondaging and carrying captive by this
deceit, all that receive not the Truth in the love of it.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Image and knowledge of God, and of his Will,
which is given by the Truth, or by his coming into the Soul, who is
the true <hi>One,</hi> doth anoint and impreſs the Soul, with that Name of
God, which doth exclude by the very Nature of its evidence, all
poſſibility of falſhood, deceit, or uncertainty, as doth the Dayes-ſpring
of Light to the natural eye, which by its ſelf-evidence aſſures
it. It is that Light wherein is no darkneſs at all, but is able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
it ſelf, as that which is ſeparate from the darkneſs of every
counterfeit and falſe repreſentation. This comes only by the Law of
Faith, and true Regeneration, that Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, as he is
the Second and better Comforter, the Spirit of Truth which the
World neither doth, nor can receive. Chriſt therefore calls himſelf
<hi>the Truth,</hi> as he is the receiver and giver of this Anointing, as theſe

unto Life Eternal, as it is written, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. This ſpake he of the
Spirit, for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, that is in this Miniſtry,
and by the means of Chriſt's Manhead, becauſe Jeſus was not yet
Glorified. Jeſus was a man, and the moſt perfect righteous natural
man which ever was, the form of which is made in him Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
having its firſt mutability fixed, by being ſubjected and
made a Servant, though the elder, unto a New-ſpring of Light and
Divine Birth that was added to him, as he became the engrafted
Word, and wherein he and the Father are One, and not he, but the
Father doth the work; Therefore he ſayes, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>I am he
that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, and
have the Keyes of Hell and of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to this pattern of man's Natural Perfection made in
Chriſt incorruptible, and brought forth in perfect ſubjection and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervency
unto, and agreement with a more excellent birth of Divine
Glory, which Chriſt's Man-head is exalted unto, (in which he is
according to his Man-head, He that is above all, one with the only
begotten, that is in the Father's boſome, and hath the higheſt and
cleareſt <hi>ſight</hi> of God, beyond that of Angels themſelves) It is, that
all Regenerated ones that are made heirs of the Spirit, in the ſingle por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, are built up, and are Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Habitation of God, through the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the ſame Jeſus, that after this firſt pattern of humane
Perfection which is in him, gives only the Witneſs that he is a meer
and perfect man: and in the exalted and more heavenly ſtate of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
which he alſo hath, as he that God the Father hath ſealed
and admitted to the ſight of his own ſhape and very ſimilitude, hath
by Inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than the Angels, and
muſt alſo give the Witneſs of what he is, and in what Glory he lives,
as he inherits the Spirit in this double portion thereof: Therefore by
the ſame new creating Power, which he is intruſted to adminiſter, as
he gives the Holy Ghoſt, he produces this ſecond ſort of new men, and
adopted Children heirs according to the Promiſe, upon whom Chriſt
poures out his Spirit, not only by the meaſure, and pattern, or Rule
of the firſt Creation, but above it and beyond it, according to the
proportion that his own glorified Manhead hath obtained it in its
higheſt exaltation, admitting them into the ſame boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with himſelf, wherein he is as the only begotten; into which
boſome, and moſt intimate viſion of God: neither do the Angels nor
firſt ſort of Heirs and Children of the Son's Kingdom ever arrive, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51760:23"/>
is reſerved to be dwelt alone in by this Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> God's friend,
that are made Chriſt's peculiar Poſſeſſion, conſiſting of a ſelect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his choice Favourites and Friends that he Redeems from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all other men, to make as the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of his <hi>Creation</hi> to
God and to the Lamb, who are joynt-heirs with him of the double
Portion, and co-habit together with him in his Father's boſom, where
they ſee and Inherit his Glory in the Naked and Primitive purity,
which it hath in the Breaſt of God himſelf; Experiencing as well
what the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt is, when it is God's Name poured
out above meaſure, as well as by meaſure; that which <hi>Paul</hi> had ſome
taſte of, whether in the body or out of the body he could not tell, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his being caught up into the <hi>third Heavens,</hi> to the hearing of
things, impoſſible for him to utter in his Bodily ſtate, nor others to
receive.</p>
                  <p>And if thus we underſtand the <hi>third Heavens,</hi> as indeed we ought,
then the finding out the other <hi>two</hi> next below them, will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
ſince the <hi>ſecond Heaven</hi> is that wherein are the Angels and
Spirits of Juſt men made perfect, upon the laying down the Body;
and the <hi>firſt,</hi> that Preſence of Chriſt, and knowledge of his Name,
which he vouchſafes unto his Church and particular Saints, in the
converſe they have with him here below, in the Body, which <hi>Paul</hi>
doth alſo call <hi>a Heaven,</hi> Phil. 3. 20. where he ſayes, <hi>Our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation

which Chriſt is able, and doth appear to our Bodily ſenſual part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its change, and putting on that which is Incorruptible, as it muſt
do; and Chriſt's manhead thus conſidered, as it makes this <hi>threefold
Heaven,</hi> was lively repreſented and deſcribed by the form of building;
God cauſed the <hi>Ark</hi> to be built up, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 16. where the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections

both not without ſignifying this great Myſtery in the glorified man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of Chriſt, by the Spirit and Preſence whereof, he makes a
<hi>threefold Heaven,</hi> and way of converſe, with the Sons of men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the threefold degrees of Light and Glory; that from his Face,

1. That <hi>Adminiſtration of the Light of pure Nature,</hi> the effects
whereof upon the hearts of the Receivers, produces healing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
of the wound made by ſin, and renews a like frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in man, as to the kind of it, wherein he was at firſt Created, and
is ſtill exerciſing his firſt mutable and wavering Principles, that in time
of tryal fail, and ſo end in Apoſtacy and Death, through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and fault of the Veſſel, not of the Liquor, or Oyl which is
poured out, into theſe Lamps, that in his own Nature is Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
but is ſuffered to leak out by theſe broken and frail
Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Light of pure Nature and right Reaſon,</hi> fixed and
made incorruptible through Faith and Regeneration, whereby the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
frailty and leaking of the Veſſel is perfectly cured, without
changing the faſhion of it, any further than what is requiſite to bring
it into ſubjection and obedience to a ſupream Judgment and Will,
given as its guide and ſurety, to ſuſtain and influence the actings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
throughout.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> is the <hi>Light of Divine Love,</hi> which he that dwells
in, dwells in God, and is in the Light, as He is in the Light, beholding
divine beauty in its original, where it is moſt attractive, and binds up
the Judgement and Will of the beholders into its own likeneſs, moſt
willingly, and irreſiſtably, transforming them into the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>Love</hi> which caſts out fear, and all torment, in the cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
evidence, and greateſt aſſurance that the Creature can poſſeſs: And
by this Love it is, when not ſeen, that Faith works, and the Spirit of
Adoption, crying, <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> that Spirit and Preſence of the Son
that is ſent into our <hi>hearts,</hi> which we are knit into by an inſeparable
<hi>union,</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> is formed thereby into the likeneſs of him that
doth beget in either of the two laſt degrees of Light and quickning
before-mentioned: Both which do beget that <hi>Seed of Life in the
heart that is immortal,</hi> the <hi>Princely prevailing conquering Seed of
Believers, that are the true</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God, to whom all the Promiſes
are ſure;</hi> this is wrought by the coming of the <hi>Son</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi> into the
<hi>Soul,</hi> there to beget and form his own likeneſs in our Underſtanding
and Will, the making us know him that is true, and that we are in
him that is true, either according to this <hi>lower</hi> or <hi>higher birth</hi> of
himſelf, of which he calls us to partake, and ſo become Witneſſes
thereof in our ſelves, and unto others.</p>

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:51760:24"/>
This then, is the knowledge of the Truth which we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
doth make the Adopted Children of God free, with another
and better kind of Freedom than that wherein man was at firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in that mutable and Primitive ſtate of purity. And what this
Freedom is we ſhall ſhew, that is ſo worthy to be obtained and
fought after, in exchange for the other. This Freedom conſiſts in the
witneſſing every reſpect which is wrought in the Underſtanding and
Will of man by Regeneration and Divine birth, of the one or other
ſort, to render them of entire uſe and ſervice, unto that higher and
ſuperiour Will in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> the Lord from Heaven, that is
made and given of the Father, to be a quickning Spirit unto them in
a twofold capacity; Firſt, of their natural Head and Sovereign, whom
they are to ſerve as in relation of Subjects to their King and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
and therein fulfil and anſwer the very end of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and actually become thoſe righteous perſons againſt whom there
is no Law that can take hold of them to puniſh them, or take the
leaſt exception to their perfect Righteouſneſs, that have given to them
a conſtant and perpetual Will to do right to every one, and love the
Lord their God moſt intirely, by influence from their Head, who in
this reſpect is the common Parent to both the ſorts of Children, whom
he makes free Citizens, and Inhabitants of the <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi>
his own glorified man-head, which is the Mother of us all.</p>
                  <p>But, ſecondly, Chriſt, the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> comes forth alſo in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Headſhip to the <hi>ſecond ſort of theſe Children,</hi> which is, that of
<hi>Husband and Bridegroom,</hi> gathering them up into a ſtate of higher
Love and Duty than that of <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> and receiving them
unto more honorable uſe, in familiarity, intimacy, and a kind of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
comprehending the Love and Duty of <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>faithful
Servants,</hi> but in reſpect of the nearneſs of relation and union, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much the more excellent and tranſcendant. The Inſpiration and
holy Anointing which flows from Chriſt in this <hi>twofold Headſhip</hi> of
his, into the hearts of theſe his Members, hath that effect upon them,
as joyns them to him <hi>in unity</hi> and <hi>agreement of ſpirit,</hi> (or of <hi>judgment</hi>

Influence, as their Head, is their <hi>infallible Guide</hi> and <hi>firm Security</hi> in
all their operations, giving them ſuch an abiding and growth up in
all things, into him, in an entire reſignation and obedience to his Will,
as co-workers together in every thought, word and work, that they
cannot miſcarry, nor ſhall ever be hurt by the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> but ſhall
be rewarded with thoſe pleaſures that are at his right-hand and at his
left, in his Kingdom for evermore. And although this <hi>moſt perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
which is obtained by this binding and conjunction in unity and
agreement of ſpirit with Chriſt, be eſteemed by the Poſſeſſors of it of
price ineſtimable, yet it is the greateſt bondage and croſs that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
a wicked heart, and is that which is reſerved by Chriſt to be their
torment for ever, (in the end, which will be given by him to his <hi>firſt
Miniſtry,</hi> in the hearts where he is finally rejected) from whom,
after he is departed and withdrawn for a ſeaſon, as if they ſhould
never hear of him, (as indeed they ſhall not to their comfort) yet they
ſhall to their terrour and ſorrow be made ſenſible of him, by the faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which he will make of his Darts of enlightnings into the minds
of the wicked, as ſharp Arrows and a <hi>gnawing Worm</hi> that ſhall never

and ſelf-judging in their Conſcience, together with the juſt

                  <p>But, on the contrary, the truly regenerated ſouls are made willing
and exceedingly pleaſed to draw in this yoke with their Head, to ſee
with his eyes, and act by his quickning in all they do, and to put on

on that which is incorruptible, and is with God of great price, ſo
great, as no righteous workers have his praiſe and bleſſing, but theſe,

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51760:25"/>
to the condition the Church is in, whether of reſtraint or free<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom
from the Powers of the World. By thoſe which Chriſt puts in
to the Miniſtry of his Spirit under him, we are to underſtand ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he
gives his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> and <hi>Miſſion</hi> unto, as he is the Head of Nature

the knowledge of Chriſt in his <hi>healing and reſtoring work,</hi> or in
<hi>his regenerating and New-creation-building,</hi> before deſcribed; giving
their Witneſs <hi>according to what they themſelves have received of
the Spirit in the three diſtinct Diſpenſations of it,</hi> before expreſſed;
in the firſt of which, becauſe of the mutable ſtate of the operation
thereof, both in themſelves as well as in their hearers, they that are
eminent Preachers unto others by the excellency of Gifts with which
they are anointed and that from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may nevertheleſs themſelves
be found at laſt <hi>Caſt-awayes.</hi> But, in the other two, they which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
the <hi>Anointing</hi> thereof, become Pillars in the Houſe of God,
that never go out more, and may obtain the higheſt Order and Rank
of Miniſtry in the Church, even that of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the ſame way as
<hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did, by ſuch a Spiritual Light of Chriſt, as he ſayes,
1 Cor. 9. 1. <hi>Am not I an Apoſtle? have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt
our Lord?</hi> And as thus the Apoſtolical Order came to have being in
the Church, by the immediate ſight of <hi>Chriſt in Spirit,</hi> as we ſee in
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Caſe, which comprehends in it all other the inferiour Ranks of
Miniſters, whether <hi>Prophets, Evangeliſts,</hi> or <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers;</hi>
So there are of theſe inferiour Ranks (to the <hi>Apoſtles)</hi> which hear and
receive the knowledge of the Goſpel, and the holy Ghoſt, either
from the <hi>mouths of the Apoſtles,</hi> and by the <hi>laying on of their hands,</hi> as
did the <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> or by other ſubordinate inſtituted means; that
is to ſay, either inwardly, onely by the <hi>inspiration of Angels,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
ſent and authorized by Chriſt; as to <hi>Philip</hi> in the caſe of the
<hi>Eunuch</hi>'s Converſion; and to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> after
him, four hundred years together, before the written Word was
given, and who, before the Incarnation, were made uſe of to give
the Law, which is there called <hi>the Word ſpoken by Angels,</hi> Heb. 2. 1.
Or ſecondly, by the communication of ſuch Gifts, for interpreting and
opening of the written Word, as we find in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
and this by ſuch Prophetical Gifts, as not only the Officers did partake
of, to fit them for the Miniſtry; but, ſecondly, the very Members of
the Church alſo ſhared in, for the common edification of the Body.</p>
                  <p>So, that, either by <hi>inward Inſpiration from Angels, under Chriſt;</hi>
or, <hi>by the witneſſing Spirit of Chriſt immediately,</hi> which is the Spirit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51760:26"/>
of Prophecy; or, <hi>by Gifts of Abilities in a more ordinary way, for
the interpreting and opening the Scriptures,</hi> Chriſt hath alwayes had
his Labourers in his Harveſt. And all theſe ſeveral Degrees in the
Miniſtry, as they are found in ſubordination, ſubſerviency and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
one with another, in their place and differing meaſures, do
make ſweet harmony, and redound to great profit in the Church.
But if they break their Ranks, and the inferiour exalt and lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in preference above, and oppoſition to the ſuperiour and greater
meaſures, theſe then corrupt and ſet up for themſelves, or are made
uſe of by him that knows how to transform his miniſters into Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Righteouſneſs, to advance his Kingdom, and turn bitter and
implacable Enemies and Perſecutors of the Womans Seed, and true
Spiritual Worſhippers. Let it not then be ſaid, that to be againſt
the Miniſtry in this laſt ſenſe, is to be againſt all Miniſtry, eſpecially
ſuch who acknowledge <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Chief Miniſter and great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer
of God's Worſhip, and all thoſe to be his Miniſters that have
Unction and Miſſion from him, in all the Orders and Degrees of them,
wherein they are acknowledged by the Scriptures, whom God hath
pleaſed to make uſe of to bear the Witneſs committed to them during
<hi>Antichriſt's</hi> Reign, in a <hi>ſuffering, ſackcloth, propheſying ſtate,</hi> which
will not loſe its fruit, but <hi>become a ſweet ſavour of life unto life in
them that are ſaved,</hi> and <hi>a favour of death unto death in them that
periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We now ſhall proceed to the next Enquiry, which is,</hi> Who they
are that in Principles are oppoſit to theſe two Anointings, and the
Effects of them; and declare their Enmity by their continued War,
in the poſture of our Enemies or diſſembled Friends, both making up
but the ſame Kingdom of Darkneſs, which ſince Chriſts coming is
called <hi>Antichriſts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> are the two ſupporters of Chriſt's Throne;
with the friſt, God enlightens and quickens the natural beings of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and men, who in their mutable and uncertain ſtate are poſſeſſors
of Righteouſneſs in purity and perfection; whilſt they are and may
be ſtrangers to Truth, that is, firmneſs and certainty, which is as the
Crown and Top-ſtone to the firſt Building. And therefore the Light
of Truth, (which is a clearneſs in the Judgment, that had a right
diſcerning before, that doth fix it and aſcertain it beyond all poſſible
doubt and contradiction, and the activity of Truth, which is a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs
and preſſing forward in the Will, wherein may be found righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
operation before, to run in that race, and never fail nor faint) is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51760:26"/>
moſt neceſſary to follow and ſucceed, where the firſt goes before, as
that which is its conſummation and final perfection.</p>
                  <p>In the breaſt where theſe two Lights meet, imbrace, and kiſs each
other, there is the true <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim:</hi> the Divine enlightned
mind, which makes all thoſe wherein it is found, free Citizens of
the <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> and beloved Children and Subjects of <hi>Chriſts
Kingdom;</hi> As it is written, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 19, 20, 21. <hi>Light is come into
the world.</hi> Light in both theſe reſpects, is come to dwell with us in
our own nature, when <hi>the Word was made fleſh,</hi> and <hi>to be amongst
us, in our mouth and in our heart, to hear it and obey it.</hi> Whence
it is that this is ſaid to be <hi>the Condemnation of the World, that Light
is</hi> thus <hi>come in</hi> the perſon of our Redeemer <hi>the ſecond Adam, and
men have</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>loved Darkneſs better than Light,</hi> becauſe
of the <hi>contrariety</hi> that is in the <hi>evil deeds</hi> of men unto the <hi>very nature
of Light,</hi> which <hi>makes manifeſt and reproves them,</hi> and from thence
contracts hatred from evil men, very unjuſtly, who love not to be
diſcovered in their wickedneſs, nor to be under cenſure and reproof
for it; but perfectly hate thus to be diſcovered and judged: and that
is at bottom the quarrel and riſe of the enmity between the Subjects
of theſe two Kingdoms, of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and of <hi>Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hatred and enmity againſt the Light of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi>
which ſhine forth in Jeſus Chriſt, as in the head, and in his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and Children, as the members; in what hearts ſoever they are
found, are in general the oppoſit Principles we are now ſpeaking of;
and the Root or Cauſe whence thoſe ſpring, is from the love that ſuch
hearts at bottom do bear unto evil, that is to ſay, to unrighteouſneſs
and falſhood, which they prefer and adhere unto before the Light of
the Image of God, which is wrought out in Chriſt and in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe <hi>lovers of Darkneſs more than Light,</hi> we are to conſider;
Either, firſt, ſuch as are born blind, and are already darkned in their
underſtandings, and alienated in their wills by evil works, dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins.</p>
                  <p>Or, ſecondly, ſuch as have their Light freely reſtored to them again
for asking, and however, ſo much of it, as may make them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the need of more, and to diſcern the means of their perfect
cure.</p>
                  <p>Or, thirdly, Such, as, after their firſt Light reſtored, are offered the
gift of a better ſight than ever they had at firſt; which ſhall not
only enlarge what they had at firſt, in their primitive purity, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51760:27"/>
it in an endleſs life, without any poſſible danger ever to loſe it
more.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt; It is the condition of all Mankind in general, and
was the effect that followed upon the ſin of our firſt Parents, by which
door Death entred and paſſed upon all men, becauſe in them all had
ſinned. Nor did this befall the Children meerly or principally becauſe
of ſin, as if that were the end that God had in it; but, that the works
of God's Grace ſhould be manifeſted thereby: For, no ſooner did the
diſeaſe and wound appear, but God had provided a Phyſician and
healing Medicine, which declared the Caſe, as yet, (which Man was
in) not ſo deſperate, but he might be reſtored; and not only ſo, but
have an additional ſight given to him, that ſhould make him ſee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than ever he did before.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond; It is alſo that ſtate which is common to all that
have ſinned, and upon whom Death hath paſſed, as to the alienation
of their minds from the Life of God; whoſe teeth are ſet on edge by
the ſowr grapes that were eaten by our firſt Parents, and therefore by
way of free gift are reſtored by the benefit of the Ranſom paid by
the Redeemer on their behalf, to ſuch a degree of enlightning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
Righteous Life, as is a Lamp or Candle lighted in the ſoul of
every one that comes into the World; in which <hi>little,</hi> they are put to
the proof of their faithfulneſs, how far they care or deſire to hearken
to it, or not; that which is the work of the Law written in their
hearts by Chriſt, as a Record and Witneſs againſt them, if it be ſlighted
and abuſed, whereby there is a Witneſs ſet up in the very natural
Conſcience, as a light in a dark place, that is ever <hi>accuſing</hi> or <hi>excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi>
as the action done doth deſerve. To this <hi>Light in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
which is the <hi>Law within us,</hi> muſt every one ſtand or fall, as
to matter of information or proof how that ſoul hath ſhewed it ſelf in
this ſtate, whether a lover of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> more than of <hi>Light;</hi> for, this
will either ſhew it ſelf our Friend or our Enemy, as we behave our
ſelves in receiving of its inſtruction, and following its guide, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to its reproof; For, he that is faithfull in the leaſt, is to be
preſumed he will be faithfull in much; and he that is unjuſt in the
leaſt, will be alſo unjuſt in much; So that Chriſt may truly and juſtly
ſay to ſuch, <hi>If they have not ſhewed themſelves faithful in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Mammon, or uncertain Riches, who will commit to their
truſt the true Treaſure?</hi> And thence it is, that all thoſe who in this
ſtate of proof and tryal under this firſt diſpenſation of <hi>Light,</hi> declare
themſelves Enemies in a fixed Rebellion, and hardning againſt the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51760:27"/>
Teaching and Dictates thereof, they plainly ſhew that they love the
<hi>Diſeaſe</hi> better than the <hi>Remedy;</hi> and had rather continue <hi>blind,</hi> than
have their <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>limbs</hi> reſtored, to uſe them as they ought, and
by the <hi>Law</hi> they are obliged to do, for running with <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in the race of God's Commandements;</hi> and had rather <hi>periſh
in their ſins,</hi> than <hi>believe in Chriſt,</hi> and by <hi>believing, be freed and
ſaved from the wrath that is to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Natural Conſcience <hi>in this ſenſe corrupted, heardned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unreclaimable, by</hi> refuſing Reproof, and perfectly hating all thoſe
that ſet about their recovery and reſtitution out of this their bondage,
under what ever Name or outward Profeſſion of Religion, and Divine
Worſhip it be found in, <hi>doth afford the</hi> firſt ſort of Subjects, <hi>whereof
the</hi> kingdom of Darkneſs <hi>doth conſiſt; a Region like to that where</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
<hi>(coming in his Travels) did pronounce,</hi> The fear of God
is not in this place; <hi>nothing of</hi> Conſcience <hi>was there owned or
practiſed; but the Contrary, of open</hi> Prophaneneſſe <hi>or</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Third ſtate <hi>is that which is not of ſuch general extent, but a
more peculiar condeſcention and effect of God</hi>'s bounty and good will
to ſome ſinners beyond others, <hi>in admitting them to a</hi> farther and
higher proof than the former, <hi>and therefore doth vouchſafe them a</hi>
greater meaſure and gift of the Spirit, and work of Reſtauration, out
of their natural blindneſs, and death; <hi>for,</hi> with a mighty hand, and
a ſtretched out Arm, and with many Signs and Wonders, he brings
them, as he did <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, out of the houſe of Bondage, <hi>and</hi> by the
Angel of his Preſence, ſaved them from the hands of their Enemies,
and offered to lead them into the ſtate of reſt and immutability,
which he had prepared for them; <hi>and therein did propound</hi> to give
them a better ſight, and fuller fruition of himſelf, than in the way
of meer Reſtauration they could attain unto. <hi>For, as to the</hi> Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<hi>and</hi> Freedom <hi>out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>God's Work was perfect, and a
juſt and right God he had ſhewed himſelf to them; nevertheleſs,
they that were new come to have the uſe of their</hi> ſight, <hi>and their</hi> feet
<hi>again</hi> to be waſhed with Water, and anointed with Oyl, <hi>and when
they were</hi> in their blood, <hi>God bid them</hi> Live, and made them again
living Souls; <hi>yet, like an unwiſe and fooliſh People, they very evilly
requited this bounty and goodneſs of the</hi> Lord, <hi>and of the</hi> Rock <hi>that</hi>
begat them, <hi>and of the</hi> God <hi>that</hi> formed them <hi>they were very</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful,
<hi>and proved themſelves</hi> a very froward and provoking Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
Children in whom was no ſtedfaſtneſs, nor that cared to uſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51760:28"/>
the means to be made ſo when it was offered; but they rebelled and
vexed his holy Spirit: <hi>that is, as</hi> Steven <hi>interprets it,</hi> They blaſphemed
and reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, and refuſed the Teachings of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtry
by which the Truth is conveyed in the love of it, which would
for ever free them from the power and dominion of ſin, and for ever
fix them in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and make them Pillars in God's
Temple, never to be removed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are <hi>they,</hi> that becauſe they ſay they <hi>ſee,</hi> or have <hi>ſight</hi> enough
already, and neither <hi>need</hi> nor <hi>deſire better,</hi> therefore <hi>their ſin</hi> remains,
and is a <hi>ſin unto death;</hi> for which, <hi>God ſwears in his wrath, thèy
ſhall never enter into his reſt.</hi> The <hi>light</hi> of their <hi>eye</hi> upon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<hi>evil,</hi> and hates thoſe that <hi>ſee cleerer</hi> and <hi>better</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and cannot endure to hear of <hi>new lights</hi> that go beyond
theirs, or that is upon the <hi>encreaſing</hi> more and more unto the <hi>perfect
day.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In this</hi> evil mind, <hi>there is a luſting to</hi> Envy <hi>againſt the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> true heirs,
<hi>and a ſaying in the</hi> heart, Come, let us kill them, and the Inheritance
ſhall be ours: <hi>which ſo far doth, many times, tranſport them, that
they</hi> become <hi>the</hi> bittereſt Enemies <hi>to God</hi>'s choiceſt Saints <hi>and</hi> dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Children; <hi>and</hi> when they kill them, they think they do God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
<hi>and</hi> when they caſt them out, and make them as the ſcum and
off-ſcouring of the World, <hi>they ſay,</hi> Let God be glorified; <hi>theſe are</hi>
they <hi>that are neither</hi> hot <hi>nor</hi> cold; <hi>but under whatever</hi> forms of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>and</hi> different perſwaſions <hi>they may be in</hi> matters of God's Worſhip,
<hi>do give their ſtrength to the</hi> common Enemy <hi>of the</hi> true Saints; <hi>and
though they can no more</hi> cleave <hi>the</hi> one <hi>to the</hi> other, <hi>than the</hi> Iron <hi>to
the</hi> Clay, <hi>yet</hi> they both <hi>can ſit at</hi> one Table, <hi>deviſing the deſtruction

<hi>of the</hi> great Image, <hi>that</hi> figured out <hi>the</hi> univerſal Kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe are the</hi> Two oppoſite Principles, <hi>unto the</hi> Two Anointings,
<hi>and the</hi> effects of them <hi>in and upon the</hi> truly Regenerate ones. <hi>In theſe
Principles</hi> Satan lodges and dwells, <hi>as in</hi> his ſeat <hi>and</hi> ſuitable habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>in</hi> the hearts of his Children, <hi>who is the</hi> Father of all Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and Deceit; <hi>theſe</hi> flow from him <hi>as from their</hi> Fountain
and Well-head; <hi>and</hi> he <hi>is their</hi> Countenauce, Protection, and
Propagation, <hi>for the</hi> encreaſe <hi>and</hi> enlargement <hi>of his</hi> Kingdom of
Darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By the means of this</hi> Two-fold hatred <hi>that</hi> Satan <hi>begets in the</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his Kingdom, <hi>againſt</hi> the Light of God's Glory ſhining in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51760:28"/>
Face of Chriſt, <hi>and</hi> in the witneſs of thoſe that are the Members of
his Mystical Body here on Earth, <hi>he</hi> blows up a continual War, <hi>and</hi>
keeps on foot a fixed Enmity between the ſubjects of the one, and of the
other Kingdom; <hi>and the</hi> Enmity <hi>is ſtill</hi> the ſame in effect, <hi>whether it
be</hi> open and allowed, <hi>or</hi> diſſembled and hid; <hi>the</hi> hatred <hi>and</hi> oppoſition
<hi>is not the</hi> leſs <hi>in it ſelf, but the</hi> laſt <hi>of the</hi> two <hi>is the worſt, and moſt

                  <p>This he Heads, with a <hi>viſible</hi> Power, as well as ſowes the Seed of
it <hi>inviſibly,</hi> in the <hi>Children of his Kingdom;</hi> and either by <hi>violence</hi> or
<hi>fraud,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> hath never <hi>failed</hi> from the beginning of the World

on Earth, and is ſupported by humane Wiſdom and Power, centring
in the foreſaid <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>batred</hi> and <hi>prejudice</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſt and his

blood,</hi> over the <hi>true ſubjects and ſervants of Chriſt;</hi> and hath as
much as is in him, <hi>ſlain Chriſt's Witneſſes, and kept them under in a
moſt oppreſſed and diſperſed condition.</hi> Of this, the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam,</hi>
beginning in <hi>Sem,</hi> and ſo downward until <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Incarnation
and Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and as the Conſequence thereof, the rejection of the
Seed according to the fleſh) were the living and known examples in
their dayes, what Servitudes and Captivities were they not expoſed
unto, and did they not undergo? And at laſt the very viſibility of
their own Church and State, was wholly defaced and loſt, though
both of Divine Conſtitution, and ſupported not only with divine
Laws, but with the viſible ſignet of the Divine Preſence; and by
whom was this People (upon whom the Name of God was called)
brought under, perſecuted, and ſuppreſſed, but by thoſe who were
foretold by <hi>Dan. ch.</hi> 2. and moſt lively repreſented and deſcribed by
that <hi>great Image,</hi> which was the ſubject of <hi>Nebuchadnçzzar</hi>'s
Dream, that none but <hi>Daniel</hi> could rehearſe and interpret, ſignifying
the Perſons and their Succeſſors, that ſhould be found poſſeſſing the
Univerſal Empire, and Command of the World, during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of thoſe known <hi>Four Monarchs</hi> that have followed ſucceſſively
one after another, according as they were fore-told and charactered
out ſome thouſand years ago, and are now ſtanding upon their laſt
legs, the time drawing on apace, when the <hi>ſpiritual ſeed</hi> of the ſame
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51760:29"/>
                     <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhall be made <hi>heirs</hi> even of the World, by <hi>Faith?</hi> and
what was done by <hi>Abraham,</hi> in Figure and Type, as to his Conqueſt
over the <hi>Four Kings,</hi> Gen. 14. muſt have its accompliſhment in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
and Truth, by thoſe of his <hi>ſeed,</hi> that are the <hi>true Iſrael</hi> in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who by the Spirit of Life entring into them at the appointed
time, together with the Charge committed to them, of pouring out
the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> of the <hi>laſt Plagues</hi> of God, ſhall bring the final
<hi>downfal</hi> and <hi>deſtruction of thoſe Four Monarchs,</hi> and in and with it,
of the <hi>Kingdom of the Beaſt, and of Antichriſt;</hi> and bring <hi>home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
and receive the true <hi>Lots</hi> that have been <hi>ſojourners</hi> in the
<hi>Sodom</hi> of <hi>this World, all this time under the Power of their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as it did befal <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that were <hi>Abraham's
Natural Seed,</hi> under the <hi>three firſt Monarchies,</hi> and <hi>part of the
Fourth,</hi> (our Saviour ſuffering <hi>Death</hi> Under the <hi>Roman Empire)</hi> ſo
are the <hi>Scriptures</hi> very plain and expreſs (if conſidered with a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

the <hi>true anointed One,</hi> that is <hi>the Father of many Nations,</hi> as he is
the <hi>Second Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> whoſe <hi>ſtanding is by Faith,</hi> that if they <hi>exalt
themſelves,</hi> and become <hi>hardened, and reſiſt the Miniſtry of the Holy
Ghoſt</hi> (as the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were their <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> did) <hi>Chriſt</hi> will
then make it appear (alſo in the Caſe of theſe <hi>latter Jews</hi> (who ſay
<hi>they are ſo,</hi> but having <hi>not the Spirit and Nature of true Faith in
them, do lye, and deceive themſelves as well as others)</hi> that it is <hi>not
they</hi> that <hi>bear the Root,</hi> but the <hi>Root that bears them,</hi> who therefore
can <hi>caſt them off,</hi> as he did the <hi>others;</hi> and once more not only <hi>ſhake

way for that <hi>Kingdom of his that cannot be ſhaken,</hi> whereof we
have already ſhewed; and how nigh this is accompliſhing, and is
even at the very doors, we ſhall have occaſion to make mention of
more particularly, as the next and laſt Particular we are to ſpeak
unto.</p>
                  <p>For an <hi>Introduction</hi> whereunto, let me only mind you of ſome few
things that the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> layes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us on this behalf, declaring firſt the things that were to befal the
<hi>Heatheniſh Roman Empire,</hi> and <hi>the Church of God abiding under its
Protection, during the time of the firſt Six Seals,</hi> which by Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
continued till ſomewhat more than four hundred years after
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51760:29"/>
Chriſt j about the end of which period, that <hi>Empire,</hi> as <hi>Heathen,</hi>
diſſolved, and a <hi>new face of things, in Church and State, roſe out of
it, at laſt, for ſo mnch as concerned that part of the World, which
thereupon in Name became Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe the <hi>Spiritual part of the Church</hi> at that ſame time
began to be moſt <hi>ſuppreſſed,</hi> being forced to fly from the <hi>fury</hi> of the
<hi>Serpent</hi> into a <hi>wilderneſs-ſtate and condition;</hi> therefore the viſible
Conſtituted Frame of <hi>Civil</hi> as well as <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Power,</hi> called
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> were repreſented unto <hi>John;</hi> The <hi>Firſt,</hi> under <hi>the ſeven-headed
and ten-horned Beaſt that came out of the Sea;</hi> And the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>
under the <hi>two-horned Beaſt that came out of the Earth,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to what was under other ſimilitudes, intimated of them in the
<hi>Iron Legs,</hi> and the <hi>Feet</hi> and <hi>Toes</hi> of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's Image,
part of Iron, and part of Clay;</hi> Whereby the <hi>Iron leggs,</hi> are the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Power</hi> as it became Chriſtian, and retaining ſtill the Reliques of
the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> and by the <hi>Feet, part of Iron and part of Clay,</hi>
is meant, the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical State and Power,</hi> partly <hi>Papal,</hi> and partly
<hi>Reformed; as an earthly Jeruſalem yet viſible, and both enemies to
the Jeruſalem that is above, and yet not very good friends between
themſelves, whoſe continuance is meaſured out by the time of the ſix
Trumpets;</hi> that is to ſay, in the exerciſe of theſe three diſtinct Powers
under the Name <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> the <hi>one, Imperial and Magiſtratical;</hi>
the <hi>other, Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> in the <hi>two Horns and branches
of it,</hi> pretended unto, of Divine Right and Inſtitution; or whether it
be more diffuſive in a Collective Body of Church-Rulers; and as
more particularly it is expreſſed to laſt twelve hundred and ſixty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
dayes; that is to ſay, years, in the 11, 12, and 13 <hi>Chap.</hi> of
the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and by comparing what is ſpoken and deſcribed in
the foreſaid <hi>Chapters,</hi> with <hi>Chapter</hi> 17, concerning this Conſtitution
and Face of the Chriſtian Church and State, that was fore-ſeen to riſe
up out of the diſſolution of the Heatheniſh Roman Empire, and the
driving into the Wilderneſs the Spiritual part of the Church, made
up of thoſe who are ſaid, for the heavenlineſs of their Principles and
Converſe, to be thoſe that dwell in Heaven, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. and
<hi>chap.</hi> 13. 6. It ſeems very plain, that upon the Diſputes that was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ariſe in the Chriſtian Eccleſiaſtical State and Government, upon
the bottom of the Papacy and Rule in the Church, by one univerſal
viſible Head under Chriſt, here upon Earth, as one of the Horns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the ſecond Beaſt, by <hi>Daniel</hi> called the <hi>Little Horn</hi> (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
ſingle, becauſe he was moſt Potent, and for a long time was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51760:30"/>
able to uphold his Authority without any conſiderable cruelty and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
that was viſible) But in proceſs of time, the ſeparation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
happened, as <hi>John</hi> (in mentioning of the two-horned Beaſt)
did fore-tell, there would alwayes be within the bowels of the viſible
Church of the outward Court-worſhippers, a more and a leſs corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and backſliden part, the one of which compared with the other,
would or might be likened to the <hi>earthly Jeruſalem,</hi> in the temper it
was in when Chriſt was upon Earth, for <hi>perſecuting the Prophets,</hi> and
<hi>killing the Heir himſelf</hi> when he came amongſt them; As the other
might be to <hi>Samaria</hi> and the worſhippers of <hi>Jeroboams Calves,</hi> after
that he had headed the ten Tribes in their defection, not only in the
Civil State, but from the Purity of God's viſible Worſhip, kept up
according to God's Ordinances. This latter being the lively reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and all that acknowledge the <hi>Papal Authority,</hi>
as the <hi>chief Ruler</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the viſible Church throughout the
ſeveral States and Dominions of the Chriſtian Empire; the other figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that now is, and <hi>is in bondage with her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
diſtinguiſhing her ſelf from <hi>Popery</hi> on the one hand, and from
them that dwell in Heaven, as the true Citizens of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that
is above (the Mother of all thoſe that are Heirs according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe)
on the other hand: accounting the one <hi>Babyloniſh, Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
and <hi>Heretical;</hi> and the other <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> and <hi>Erroneous, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical</hi>
and <hi>Blasphemous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe the <hi>Woman,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls the <hi>earthly Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
(which was amongſt the <hi>Galatians</hi> in his dayes, as being in
bondage with her Children to the Law and worldly Rudiments, that
periſh in the uſing, <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not,</hi> as Objects of
Divine Worſhip, which feed moſt the outward ſenſes) doth make a
very fair ſhew in the fleſh, <hi>having the Form of Godlineſs, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Power of it;</hi> and withdrawing from, and diſowning the
Children of the Promiſe, that are of a more heavenly birth, and of

by <hi>John</hi> in his 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>They went out from us, but they
were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would, no doubt, have
continued with us,</hi> and not have made a manifeſt diſtinction of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from us; that is to ſay, from being <hi>followers</hi> (1 Theſſ. 2. 14,
15.) <hi>of the Churches of God, which in Judea are in Chriſt Jeſus;
that are the Circumciſion in Spirit, and have no confidence in the fleſh;</hi>
For which cauſe ſake, the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in adhering to the primitive
pattern, which ſhewed it ſelf in thoſe Churches, did <hi>ſuffer the like
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51760:30"/>
things from their own Country-men, the Jews,</hi> among whom they
lived, as thoſe Churches of God in <hi>Judea</hi> did from the <hi>Jews</hi> there,
<hi>who both killed the Lord Jeſus, and their own Prophets,</hi> and chaſed
out the chiefeſt of the Apoſtles from amongſt them; <hi>and they pleaſed
not God, and are contrary to all men;</hi> forbidding, under pretence of
too much familiarity with the Heathen and prophane World, that the
Goſpel ſhould be preached unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whereby they might be
ſaved, every way filling up their ſins, and bringing wrath upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the uttermoſt.</p>
                  <p>This is the Woman which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. that was <hi>drunk
with the blood of the Saints,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>and with the blood of the choiceſt
Martyrs of Jeſus;</hi> at which he wondred with great admiration, as
little expecting to find what he ſaw, or to reade that name written
upon her forehead, which he did, of <hi>Myſtery Babylon the great, the
mother of Fornications and Abominations of the Earth; with whom
the Kings and Inhabitants of the Earth commit Fornication,</hi> and have
been made <hi>drunk</hi> with it: For at laſt her falſe, unchaſte, whoriſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to her Lord and Husband, is diſcovered and made manifeſt, by the
open rejection of him in his Members, and by the Combination and
Conjunction which ſhe is found in with the <hi>ſeven-headed</hi> and <hi>ten-horned Beaſt</hi>
and his <hi>Adherents,</hi> under the <hi>Papacy,</hi> thereby to make
War with his <hi>Witneſſes</hi> and ſlay them, and expoſe their dead bodies
to <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> in the ſtreets of this <hi>earthly Jeruſalem;</hi> who
for her exceeding Apoſtacy and fierce Enmity againſt the true Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhippers,
is ſpiritually called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt, where alſo our Lord
was crucified;</hi> and though ſhe have ſtrengthened her ſelf, as one that
<hi>ſits upon many Waters,</hi> and who is the City <hi>that reigns over the Kings</hi>
(or chief eminent Perſons, men of Name) <hi>of the Earth,</hi> which the
Children of the <hi>earthly Jeruſalem</hi> are; yet (ſayes he) <hi>God determines
to bring her to Judgment,</hi> and, in order thereunto, the Inſtruments he
will employ therein, are the ſeveral Potentates and Kingdoms, that
have given their Power to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> who, at the time appointed,
ſhall find it their Intereſt to agree and become of one mind, in hatred
of this <hi>Whore,</hi> or unchaſte Spouſe of Chriſt, that ſitteth upon Peoples,
and Multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues, and ſhall therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
together <hi>to make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eat her fleſh,
and burn her with fire;</hi> For God hath put it into their hearts to fulfil
his Will, in this Judgment, which they are to execute, as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
formerly did upon the earthly material <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his days;
until which be fulfilled, they ſhall agree and hold together, giving
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51760:31"/>
joyntly their Counſel, Authority and Strength in ſupport and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Beaſt, that is the firſt and chief Horn of the two-horned
Beaſt, which is the <hi>Papacy.</hi> And how to give a right interpretation
of the things in this 17th Chapter, but by this Key, deſerves our very
ſerious conſideration, according to the uſual underſtanding of the
<hi>Papacy</hi> to be meant by this Whore, which is not denied to be a part
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a chief part, and to be alſo a Whore and Mother of
Fornications; but ſhe is ſo <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>avowedly,</hi> not ſecretly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſhew of Reformation; and there is not any myſtery or ſecret
in it, to find her out, as there is in the other caſe.</p>
                  <p>We come then in the laſt place, as the Concluſion of the whole, to
ſhew what Word and part of his Counſels, contained in the Promiſes
and Prophecies not yet accompliſhed, the Lord is now fulfilling in
theſe preſent diſpenſations of our day; and this, by the comparing
Scriptures with Scriptures, and obſerving what gradually hath been
fulfilled ſince the time of Chriſt's Aſcention to this day, and what
ſigns he hath before given of the times wherein we now are.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more poſitive and expreſs in the Scripture, as may
appear by what hath been already mentioned, (and for which many
particular Texts might further be alledged) than this, That there is a
<hi>Kingdom of the Everlaſting Gospel, which neither can nor ſhall be
ſhaken, that muſt be brought upon the ſtage here in this World;</hi> which
ſhall ſtand firm as a Rock againſt all oppoſition, and come forth as a
ſtone cut out of the Mountain without hands; that muſt break down
the viſible heads, which the Serpent hath kept up in and over the
whole Earth, for theſe many thouſand years together; by the means
whereof the true Children and Heirs have been kept out of their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
and have been neceſſitated to a Witneſſing and Propheſying
condition in a way of Sufferings, and of utmoſt cruel dealings and
oppreſſions from their implacable Enemies; to whom it hath been
given to make and continue War with them, till the courſe of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
be finiſhed. Of this <hi>bitter Cup,</hi> the Captain of our Salvation
drank the deepeſt draught, and had the greateſt ſhare; And leſt we
ſhould think he had put an end to the Sufferings of his Members by
one Death on the Croſs, he dealt plainly with his Diſciples in this
point, both before his Death, and alſo during the forty dayes he ſpent
upon Earth after his Reſurrection; for, when the two ſons of <hi>Zebedee</hi>
had hopes to have ſeen him in his own Perſon ſpeedily in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
before his Sufferings, and were deſirous the one to ſit at his
right hand, and the other at his left, in that day of his Glory and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51760:31"/>
Power, he intimates to them immediately that there is a Preparation
requiſit to be wrought in all that ſhall be thought worthy of that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which is, <hi>to drink of the ſame Cup, and to be baptized with the
ſame Baptiſm that he was baptized with,</hi> according to that true and
faithful ſaying, <hi>If we die with him, we ſhall live with him; if we
ſuffer with him, we ſhall reign with him.</hi> And ſo, when all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
together, a little before his Aſcention, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6, 8. asked him,
ſaying, <hi>Wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is in effect this to them, That until <hi>Iſrael's</hi> witneſſing-work be
over and finiſhed, that muſt prepare them to Rule, and ripen their
Enemies for the Judgment and Deſtruction appointed unto all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, that muſt firſt precede; the reigning-work, which they too much
looked for, and thirſted after, would not come, nor the dayes of it
begin. Now this witneſſing-work, which is to be finiſhed by the true
<hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, as the needful and requifit Preparation of you to Reign,
is, <hi>What is to be wrought in them upon their own hearts;</hi> and, <hi>what is to
be wrought by you as a Teſtimony born and given to the World on God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the latter of theſe is uſually made uſe of by God to accompliſh
the former, <hi>ſince all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (ſhewing forth
the Vertues of Him, that hath called them in a holy and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
ſhining as Lights in the World) <hi>muſt ſuffer Perſecution,</hi>
and are ſure to be hated and oppreſſed by the World and Powers of it,
by all wayes and means that may prove their Faith and Patience.
And theſe Tryals, which thus give proof of their Faith, do cauſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to have its perfect work in them, till which, they are not thoſe
meet veſſels fitted for their Maſter's uſe, as that he will dignifie them
to appear ſeated, as on his Throne, in their hearts; and thereby qualifie
them with a Power of Rule; ſo, as at their word, and by their prayers,
all things ſhall become poſſible to them; <hi>What they bind on Earth,
ſhall be bound in Heaven; and what they looſe on Earth, ſhall be
looſed in Heaven:</hi> For greater works than Chriſt himſelf did when
he was in the fleſh, they ſhall do, becauſe he is gone to his
Father.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The witneſſing-work is not only to be wrought in them,
to prepare them, in mind and body, to be meet veſſels for the uſe of
their Head (by them to ſhew forth his Wiſdom and Power, to the
glorifying of God in their ſpirits, and in their bodies, which are his;)
but the Light of it muſt be given out, and born in the ſight, and for
the profit and good of others, if the fault be not in themſelves that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51760:32"/>
ſhould benefit by it; unto whom the ſavour of the knowledge of
Chriſt, miniſtred by his faithful Witneſſes in their ſeveral places, and
callings, will prove in the iſſue, either a <hi>ſavour of life unto life,</hi> or of
<hi>death unto death,</hi> according as either it is received and valued, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and expelled. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>when he hath lighted a
Candle, putteth it</hi> in a ſecret place, neither <hi>under a Buſhel, but on a
Candleſtick, that they that come in may ſee the light:</hi> which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is interpreted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. where the inſtance is given, in
meeting of the whole Church together, <hi>in one place;</hi> that is, as many
viſible Saints and Believers as could well hear one another, in the
place they aſſembled in for their common Edification. In which
Church-meeting they were as a <hi>Golden Candleſtick,</hi> that did in ſuch
manner hold forth the ſhining Light of Chriſt's Truth and Holineſs, to
thoſe that came in, and were lookers on, and were not of the Society,
that by the Spirit of Prophecy, which in and among them of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church was exerciſed, it ſo fell out, that whoever came in,
deſirous to learn and be inſtructed, <hi>he was convinced of all, he was judged
of all,</hi> and the ſecrets of his heart were ſo manifeſt, that falling down
on his face, he worſhipped God, and went out and reported, <hi>that God
was in them of a truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is then the ſecond ſort of Witneſſing-work which by Chriſt
was intruſted to his Diſciples and Followers, to be exerciſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in, according to their ſeveral places and callings, till his return,
in the day wherein he is to come and judge the World in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that is, take an account, who they are that have acquit themſelves
as they ought to do in their witneſſing-ſtations and callings, and what
fruit their witneſs had, how it took place in the hearts of others among
whom they converſed, and what returns they met with from a wicked
and ingrateful world for all the labour of Love and Service they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongſt them: Of all which, Chriſt intends to take a formal and
judicial account at the time of the end that is ſet by him to this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing-work,
in his witneſſes, that upon this employment, Propheſying
in ſack-cloth, were to continue as in conſtant war and violent perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Powers of the world for twelve hundred and ſixty years
together. At the end of which time, the Judgment or time of Wrath
is to come; not that which is the final Judgment and Wrath of the
great Day, but a like proceeding of God towards the World, in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with it by Fire and Sword, upon the finiſhing the Teſtimony of his
Witneſſes, as he did by Water upon the firſt World, where he made
a viſible diſtinction <hi>between the Wicked</hi> and <hi>the Righteous,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51760:32"/>
them that truly <hi>fear God</hi> and are ſincere, and them that <hi>fear him
not;</hi> but are tainted and corrupted with Hypocriſie and Apoſtacy, as
is plainly expreſſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 18. <hi>And the Nations were angry, and thy
Wrath is come, and the time of the Dead,</hi> or the Cauſe of thy ſlain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
Witneſſes, <hi>that they ſhould be judged,</hi> and an Inquiſition made
after their Blood, and the hard uſage they have met with in the
World, in order now to receive Countenance and Reward for their
Sufferings, according to the nature of them, and the condition and
place in which they gave their Witneſs, whether they were <hi>Prophets</hi>
or <hi>Saints, that fear God's Name, ſmall or great;</hi> and to yeeld Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
and Deſtruction to impenitent and hardned Sinners, that they
may no longer <hi>corrupt the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, as in this place we may ſee, Chriſt lighteth up his
Candles in the World, of all ſorts and ſizes, and indeed in all places
of it from Eaſt to Weſt, and hath given the Light of his Glory and
Kingdom, as that Teſtimony which is appointed to be given and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in all the World, as a Witneſs to all Nations; and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after this is finiſhed, then the End comes, the End that God will
manifeſt of his patience and long-ſuffering which he hath exerciſed
towards the <hi>World,</hi> in forbearing to avenge the Cauſe of his <hi>Elect,</hi>
which hath been night and day crying to him, <hi>How long, Lord, how
long?</hi> which in this day of his Wrath he will avenge, and that ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and <hi>cut the work ſhort in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe we have ſaid, the Candles or Lamps which God lights
up in the World, for this his Witneſſing-work, ever ſince his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this day, (according to the Commiſſion he gave to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Act.</hi> 1. 8. and in them to all his Saints ſmall and great that fear
his Name (as we ſhewed before) are of ſeveral ſizes and kinds, it
may not be improper to declare them.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, Their Witneſſing-Lights may be ſuch as are in publick
Office and Place in the viſible Church; and ſo are either thoſe that are
in the Miniſtry, or thoſe that give their Witneſs, as the Body of ſome
particular Congregation, that own themſelves in the ſight of the world
as a Golden Candleſtick; or ſome particular Church-Aſſembly of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Saints in order and practice of the Goſpel, according to their
meaſure and light. And under this firſt head will fall all ſorts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Profeſſions of Godlineſs, that make the Rule of the Word
and Spirit of God, <hi>(the Ballance of the Sanctuary)</hi> the Standard by
which they deſire to regulate themſelves in their Doctrine, Worſhip
and Converſation, what-ever difference in Principles, or Miniſtry, of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51760:33"/>
the knowledge of Chriſt they are under, as hath been before opened
and diſtinctly ſpoken unto.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their Witneſſing-Lights may be Publick Perſons, with
relation to their Office in the Magiſtracy; For it is <hi>by me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
that <hi>Kings reign, and Princes do Juſtice:</hi> So that in the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of pure and impartial Juſtice, as a Magiſtrate, in whatever Place
and Calling we are ſet by God, and a lawful Appointment from men,
we keep on the right way, without turning on the right hand or on
the left, for fear or favour, diſcovering a juſt mind, that is, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and perpetual, or unchangeable will, to do right to all, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
diſcouragement, oppoſition and hatred we meet with in doing
our duty. This is a Light before men, which Chriſt will own in the
day of his appearance, to have been for his Service, and ſhall not
go without its due reward.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are alſo the ſame witneſſing Lights in the leſſer
ſphears of every man's particular ſtation and calling, which ſhine
forth in a perſonal, righteous, and blameleſs converſation; or where
their vote or conſent is given, in reference to the good of the Church
or State, or to the private Rule which every Maſter and Head of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
is by Chriſt entruſted with in reference to his own Children and
Family, who are under his charge, and not ſo much at their own
diſpoſe as his, who hath a right over them by God's Law and man's;
and by the duty of this relation, every man may be ſomewhat directed,
even by the world, what he is, and what Witneſs he gives, in the
meaſure of the Knowledge and Light of Chriſt he hath received; and
ſhall accordingly be taken notice of and judged by Chriſt, in the day
of his Judgment, miniſtring Perdition to ungodly men: In this little,
a faithfulneſs to Chriſt is expected, and that according to the meaſure
of Light received, and the Anointing we are under, of which there
hath already the ſeveral degrees and kinds been made known.</p>
                  <p>The uſe therefore that Chriſt makes of this Light in the world, that
theſe ſeveral wayes he makes to ſhine like Lightning from the Eaſt
to the Weſt, from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the utmoſt ends of the Earth, is, as to
the world, to leave them without excuſe, and ripen them as white
fields, to the harveſt of his juſt Vengeance, when the time is to put
in his Sickle. And as to the Witneſſes themſelves, to bring upon them
a time of refreſhing and reſt from the preſence of the Lord in the ſight
of their very Enemies, where a Table ſhall be prepared for them,
and their Cup ſhall be made to overflow.</p>
                  <p>This then being the Teſtimony that muſt be finiſhed, and theſe the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51760:33"/>
Witneſſes in their ſeveral Places and Callings, who have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in bearing and giving their Teſtimony in the World ever ſince
Chriſt's Aſcention; the courſe whereof hath had its progreſs from
Eaſt to Weſt, and is now come to theſe utmoſt ends of the Earth.
The Scriptures do with great clearneſs, as to the preſent diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our day, teach us three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That this Teſtimony is now upon its finiſhing point in the
World, and upon theſe times are brought all the concurring and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
Symptoms and Characters thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the time of the End, that is to ſay, the fore-told<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
day, in which Chriſt is to judge the World in Righteouſneſs, ſo as
to make up his Jewels on the one hand, and gather them as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Fruits into his Granary; and to kindle an Oven of his fiery
Vengeance, to burn up the VVicked root and branch, and gather
together the Tares to be burnt in unquenchable fire, is at the very
doors, and ready to open it ſelf upon us, as the day of Redemption to
the Good, and Terror and Amazement to the Wicked.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That this Day ſhall begin with the Riſing of the VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
clothing thoſe that then ſhall be in the World, with ſuch a
Miniſtry of Power and Glory, as ſhall qualifie them to diſcharge their
ſeveral <hi>Witneſs-bearing Duty,</hi> before ſpecified, with great applauſe,
and good reception from the World. God permitting none to ſtand
before them that make reſiſtance or oppoſition, which ſhall be as a
neceſſary fore-running diſpenſation for Chriſt's Perſonal Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Rule on Earth <hi>a thouſand years;</hi> but by theſe <hi>Savioxrs</hi> that
thus ſhall be brought up upon <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> as <hi>a Stone cut out without
hands; New Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs,</hi>
ſhall be conſtituted, and the <hi>four Monarchies</hi> utterly broken to pieces
and deſtroyed; and the <hi>Kingdom of Antichriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> brought
to final ruine and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The very mentioning of theſe three Particulars, without alledging
particular places of Scripture, will bring them to your mind, which
teach and ſpeak expreſly concerning the truth of them, and the matter
of fact it ſelf, as to what progreſs and courſe this witneſſing-work hath
made from <hi>Judea,</hi> where firſt it was lighted, ſtep by ſtep, into all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Kingdoms all the World over, who have been acquainted
with theſe VVitneſſes, and have ſeen their Light ſhining in theſe Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Candleſticks, and can give an account how from time to time
they have been put out and removed from one place to another, till at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt
the bodies of theſe two Prophets are found dead in the ſtreets of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51760:34"/>
the <hi>earthly Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> if they might be
ſuffered to be put into their Graves; and ſurely it is not without great
wiſdom that theſe Witneſſes are called <hi>Two,</hi> conſidering the <hi>two</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Miniſtries of Chriſt which they bear witneſs unto, and how each
Miniſtry hath <hi>two,</hi> out of whoſe mouth it receives its Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>But further. That this Teſtimony is upon its finiſhing point, let us
enquire whether the laſt ſlaying of the Witneſſes, declared by the ſight
of their dead bodies <hi>(Rev.</hi> 11.) fit to be put into their Graves, be not
already before out eyes. The right opening and underſtanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is of great uſe, as a key to many other moſt conſiderable and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
Scriptures. Theſe <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> as they juſtifie Chriſt's ſecond
Miniſtry, the knowledg of him in ſpirit, are the Saints in their inviſible
Church-ſtate, fled into the Wilderneſs, from the violence and rage of
Perſecution, which Satan ſtirred up againſt them by the viſible Church,
and Powers of the Civil Rule &amp; Government, called in for aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>How theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are <hi>two,</hi> we have ſhewed, being the two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Believers, which Chriſt's Myſtical Body hath been ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of, though rather myſtically figured out, than appearing as they
are, in the truth and brightneſs of their proper Glory, as Heirs of the
Spirit of Promiſe in the ſingle and double portion thereof.</p>
                  <p>Theſe in their Spirit, Nature and Principles have been diſowned,
perſecuted and ſlain, by the viſible Church, (as much as in them lies)
by expoſing of them to the utmoſt of bodily ſufferings and harms; and
this from the time that the viſible Church hath degenerated, grown
Papal, and been defended by the <hi>ten horns</hi> of her Civil Government
in the Weſtern Empire of the World; and the ſharpeſt and moſt
bitter Enemies to theſe two Witneſſes are the Reformed part of the
viſible Church, who declare their ripeneſs to be rejected by Chriſt,
and have the flood of the Papal Power and Tyranny let in upon them,
as they hate and reject the heavenly Seed and ſpiritual part of the
Church, and can find opportunity to go back again into Conjunction
with the Corrupt part of the viſible Church, to hinder the growth of
that which is Spiritual, rather than to go forward and become one
with it. So that it might be made appear in the whole progreſs the
Goſpel hath made from Eaſt to Weſt, the Reformed part of the
Church never loſt ground, nor was ſwallowed up again by the Papal,
till it ſelf firſt took up its ſtand, as to going on forward, and refuſed
to be more Spiritual and Heavenly, being fiercer enemies hereunto,
than any other whatſoever. And the greateſt demonſtration of this,
is given in the laſt act of this Enmity that hath been acted, and is yet
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51760:34"/>
in acting to the laſt ſlaughter which is to be made of the Witneſſes in
order to expoſe their dead bodies in the open ſtreets of this <hi>Earthly
Jeruſalem,</hi> where they are as ſpectacles to be ſeen <hi>three dayes</hi> (that
is, years) <hi>and an half,</hi> by them of Peoples, and Tongues, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,
and Nations, headed by the Papacy, who ſhall not ſuffer their
dead bodies to be put in their graves by the Inhabitants of the <hi>earthly
Jeruſalem,</hi> who were willing enough to do it, as exceedingly joyed
at the ſight of their dead bodies, but ſhall rather chuſe to quit thoſe
dead Carkaſes in way of contempt from any further proſecution of
them; and inſtead thereof, apply themſelves with the ſtrength of their
whole Party, to ſtrengthen and beſiege the <hi>earthly Jeruſalem,</hi> in whoſe
ſtreets the dead Carkaſes of the Witneſſes are to lye (in a way of open
reproach to be gazed upon) and ſhall make a gathering againſt it (as
<hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 2.) as to battel, ſo as the event of it ſhall be the taking of
the City, and the utter ruine of that part of the viſible Church, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from the other by the Name of <hi>Reformed;</hi> which when
it happens, will be a <hi>Fourth ſign:</hi> and by conjecture, this work is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
begun, and materials for this Siege, are not only in readineſs, and
the Deſign laid, and the Parties agreed, that are to undertake it, but
the open Defiance to the Battel is given, and both ſides fixed in their
reſolutions to abide the iſſue, which will not exceed the term of <hi>three
years and an half,</hi> before it be fully decided. Upon which deciſion,
that, according to <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 43. is to happen between theſe two parts of
the viſible Church, immediately after they find they cannot pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the way of piecing up together againſt thoſe that dwell in Heaven,
though it be both their intereſts, and that they earneſtly deſire and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
it. Nay, this <hi>Mount of Olives,</hi> on which this ſecond pair of
Witneſſes, or viſible part of the Church Reformed are, that ſhall
<hi>(Zach.</hi> 14. 4.) <hi>cleave</hi> alſo <hi>in the middeſt,</hi> as not being able to hold
longer together, or to faſten the one to the other; <hi>and the one part
ſhall go toward the Eaſt,</hi> into down-right Popery; <hi>the other unto the
Weſt,</hi> at the vaſteſt diſtance, and greateſt contrariety one to the other
that is imaginable; ſo as <hi>half</hi> of this Mountain of viſible Saints in
Name <hi>ſhall remove North,</hi> deeper into the Apoſtacy; <hi>and the other
half South,</hi> nearer to the Heavenly Jeruſalem; And in this ſtate of
things, when the <hi>Iron</hi> ſhall break the Kingdom of the <hi>Clay</hi> to pieces;
And again, that Kingdom of <hi>Clay</hi> ſhall divide and remove, one half
to the Eaſt, and the other to the Weſt, cauſing a moſt terrible Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
as in the dayes of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> at which time (of this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake)
the tenth part of the Papal Sea, ſhall make a final defection
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51760:35"/>
from her; and <hi>the Lord my God ſhall come, and all the Saints with thee;</hi>
that is to ſay, He ſhall Muſter up his Heavenly Troops, and take to
himſelf his great Power, in which he ſhall begin to reign, by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
of his Wrath and divine Vengeance upon his Enemies, in the
pouring out the <hi>ſeven vials,</hi> which <hi>is the time of the end;</hi> that is to ſay,
of ending the 1260 years for the two Witneſſes Propheſying in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
and the Womans remaining in the Wilderneſs, and the time
when the riſing of the Witneſſes doth begin, and <hi>that Saviours ſhall
come upon Mount Sion, and judge the Mount of Eſau ſpiritually,</hi> as the ten
Kings ſhall judge them outwardly, and give the fleſh of the Whore to
be torn in pieces and burnt with fire. Theſe, with others that might
be alledged, are the characters and ſigns, to prove the firſt particular,
that the Teſtimony which Chriſt declared ſo long ago, was to be given
by the Preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom in all the World, and
unto all Nations, is upon its finiſhing point.</p>
                  <p>The Second, which is the ending of that Diſpenſation, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a new one, by the pouring out of the <hi>ſeven vials,</hi> to the
utter deſtruction of Antichriſt's Kingdom, and the cutting out the
ſtone without hands, in preparation to the perfect deliverance of the
Church out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the compleat bringing them out of their
Captivity, in order to the actual Reſtoring the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is
that we ſhall likewiſe give ſome ſhort diſcovery of.</p>
                  <p>Two things are comprehended in the Reſtoring the Kingdom to
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> Firſt, <hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelf, the true Inhabitants and Citizens of the
<hi>New</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> muſt be reſtored to a Kingdom, that is
a viſible incorporated Society of Subjects, relating to the true <hi>David</hi>
their King, as their Soveraign and only Law-giver, diſclaiming all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reigning or exerciſing Dominion over them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thus reſtored to be a Kingdom, Chriſt will
ſhew and own himſelf viſibly their King, and the Univerſal Monarch
over the whole World, who at that time ſhall be one Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> under one of the <hi>two
Covenants,</hi> yielding either true or feigned Obedience; if not out of
Love, yet from the fear of Wrath &amp; Divine Vengeance, begun to be
revealed and poured forth upon all the Diſobedient. For no ſooner
ſhall the Vials begin to be poured out, but the time is come of <hi>Chriſt's
Wrath,</hi> that is to ſay, when he ſhall come forth in the viſible execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Royal Office and Power amongſt them, in the hands of
his undoubted Officers, executing Judgment upon all that ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his Peoples Freedom, and coming out from under their former
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51760:35"/>
ſervitude and bondage under the Kingdom of Antichriſt, and this in
order to reſtore <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto ſuch a conſtitution of a Kingdom which
Chriſt is to exerciſe over them, during the ſpace of a thouſand years.</p>
                  <p>And therefore that which firſt begins this new diſpenſation, called
<hi>the time of the end,</hi> is the riſing of the Witneſſes by an extraordinary
pouring out of the ſpirit, <hi>as the latter rain,</hi> which like <hi>Life from the dead</hi>
ſhall enter into them and ſet them upon their feet, and qualifie thoſe
in office amongſt them, as their Rulers in State or Church, with a like
and greater power than was given in the Type and Figure, to <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Elias,</hi> at whoſe word the earth was ſmitten with viſible plagues
and curſes as often as they ſaw cauſe to promote the end for which
they were ſent and employed; and ſo it muſt be again, in a much more
glorious diſpenſation, thereby to reſtore and conſtitute <hi>Iſrael</hi> into a
Kingdom, in deſpite of all oppoſition; which plainly evidences, that
ſuch a diſpenſation as this, is neceſſary, as that which muſt be prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and conducing to give the actual being and conſtitution of a
Kingdom, to a People that are found in ſo great and univerſal a ſtate
of ſervitude and bondage, far beyond that which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in, to whom
<hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent to bring them out of <hi>Egypt. Therefore behold the dayes
come, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 7, 8. <hi>that they ſhall no more ſay, the
Lord liveth which brought the Children of Iſrael out of the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
but the Lord liveth, which brought up, and which led,</hi> (a parallel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
to <hi>Moſes</hi> his bringing them up, <hi>and leading them as a horſe in
the Wilderneſs,</hi> Eſay 63.) <hi>the ſeed of the houſe of Iſrael out of the
North Country, and from all Countries whither I had driven them, and they
ſhall dwell in their own land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſpiritual ſeed of Iſrael, driven in the time of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into
the Wilderneſs, and kept ſlaves to the higheſt degree, during the reign
of Antichriſt, muſt have a time of gathering and bringing up into
their land under their own King, and the Nation that hath kept them
in bondage, God himſelf muſt and will judge more ſignally than he did
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> by which means this ſtone that hath been
fallen upon, and ſuppreſſed for ſo many hundred years, even theſe
fixed, unmoveable, chaſte followers of the Lamb, muſt riſe and ſtand
again upon their feet with great power and authority, ſo as they ſhall
not onely be a burthenſome ſtone for all people that burthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 3. to the cutting them in pieces, though
the people of the earth be gathered together againſt them; but <hi>verſ.</hi>
5, 6. <hi>In that day ſaith the Lord, I will make the Governours of Judah
like an hearth of fire in a ſheaf, and they ſhall devour all the people round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51760:36"/>
on the right hand and on the left; and Jeruſalem ſhall be inhabited
again in her own place, even in Jeruſalem, and the Lord himſelf ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in that day Jeruſalem, and he that is feeble amongſt them ſhall be as
David, and the houſe of David as God, as the Angel of the Lord before
them; ſo as the Governours of Judah ſhall ſay, there is ſtrength to me, and
to the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, in the Lord of Hoſts their God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know it is and will be Objected, that theſe places refer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that are the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which are
expected to be firſt received again, as Life from the dead, before theſe
promiſes ſhall be accompliſhed. In Anſwer to which, I ſhall only ſay,
There will indeed, upon the riſing of the Witneſſes, that ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
appear and be made manifeſt, that are the true and proper <hi>Jews,</hi>
a Nation advanced in love and glory from God, above all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and People, of which an account hath been given before; and then
it will be found, no other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation are to be eyed, but as they fall
within and are comprehended amongſt the <hi>Gentile</hi> fulneſs of thoſe
Nations that are to be ſaved.</p>

Face of the Times.</head>
                  <p>IT was the ſaying of Chriſt to the Generation he converſed with,
while in the fleſh, <hi>Ye hypocrites, ye can diſcern the face of the
skies, but can ye not, or how is it that ye cannot diſcern the ſigns of the
times?</hi> Why do you not ſet your ſelves to obſerve and ſpel out
the meaning of God's providential voice, given forth in harmony
with his written Oracles, by the Judgements which he is now execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the earth, as to that moſt pertinent and concerning Truth,
<hi>The near approach of the day of the Lord?</hi> It will ſurprize and overtake
the wicked that are in darkneſs, as a thief, and exceeding dreadful
will it be to them. But the Children of Light and of that day, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>to lift up their heads, when they ſee the ſignes thereof,</hi> (however
diſmal to their fleſhly part) <hi>for their Redemption draweth nigh, Luk,</hi>
21. 25, 28.</p>
                  <p>God is ſtill working and carrying on his deſignes in the world, on
the behalf of his People, as alſo over-ruling all the contrary actings
of his and their enemies, in purſuance of his decree, publiſhed at paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that ſentence upon the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>I will put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe
thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the latter branch of this ſentence, (which was firſt put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
God declares himſelf as to ſundry particulars, which do
ſummarily and fully contain his deſign and work throughout all
ages of the World, till it be accompliſhed, and the Myſtery of it finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as he hath declared unto his ſervants the Prophets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7.
Then the Saints Turne will come, to act his part in purſuance of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51760:38"/>
former branch of the Decree, for bruiſing of the Serpents head, and
giving an incurable wound to all his adherents.</p>
                  <p>There is indeed a great myſtery in the managing of this war, which
God declares he hath founded in the enmity ſet by him between the
ſeed of the Woman and ſeed of the Serpent. Matters are ſo contrived
in the moſt wiſe deſigne of God, that the ſeed of the Woman muſt
ſuffer firſt, and be on the loſing hand, (as to any outward quietneſs
and fair dealing that they are to expect in this world) for a long tract
of time, wherein the headſhip of this world, the Empire and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole earth ſhall be, as it were, in the hands of the evil
one, who ſhall be very much permitted to diſpoſe of the powers of it,
to his own inſtruments and creatures. But at the ſounding of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet, this time is to end, and be no longer. Then the ſeed
of the woman muſt break this headſhip, which Satan for ſo long time
hath exerciſed over the whole world, and deſtroy all thoſe worldly
Kingdoms that have been managed under his influence, to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.
<hi>Then Judgement will be given to the Saints of the moſt High.
They ſhall take and poſſeſſe the Kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever,</hi>
Dan. 7. <hi>Then the Kingdomes of this world ſhall become the Kingdoms of
our Lord and of his Chriſt, holding of him as their viſible head, who is and
was and is to come, and will take unto himſelf his great power for that
purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The particulars which are ſummed up, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 3. 15.) concerning
the nature of this war, and the manner of managing it, (explained ſince
by time and the hiſtory of things in the Scriptures) are theſe,</p>
                  <p>1. Let Satan do his worſt, and make all the Power and parties he
can, amongſt the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet God will have a Seed in the
World, called there the ſeed of the woman, that ſhall be in a ſtate of
fixed enmity and war againſt him and his ſeed.</p>
                  <p>2. For a long tract of time, Satan ſhal not be chained up nor reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from uſing all his skill and power, by himſelf and his inſtruments,
for the doing of his utmoſt in a way of war, to ruine, deſtroy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt the Seed of the Woman. For this end he ſhall be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have the ſubordinate exerciſe of the Empire and viſible Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the whole world, to be given and beſtowed as himſelf
will, for the ſtrengthening his intereſt, and encouraging of thoſe that
will be his creatures, and fall down and worſhip him.</p>
                  <p>3. The contrariety of mind and principles between theſe two ſeeds,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51760:38"/>
will be ſo fixed and unchangeable, that they will never give over con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
and fighting one with or againſt another, whatever it coſt them,
till the heel of the one be fully bruiſed, that is, till the ſufferings of
Chriſt yet behind in his body myſtical, and every member thereof, be
accompliſhed, by ſuſtaining loſs in the fleſh, even to death it ſelf;
and the head of the other fully broken, that is, till the headſhip and
viſible Government of the World be wholly taken out of the hands of
Satan and his inſtruments, and reaſſumed by Chriſt into his own hands,
and the hands of fit and meet Miniſters and Officers under him.</p>
                  <p>4. After a long time of patience under bodily ſufferings, not loving
their Lives unto the death, the ſeed of the Woman ſhall at laſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and fully overcome the ſeed of the Serpent, tread Satan and
his kingdom under foot, for ever and ever. The principal means they
ſhall rely upon for the bringing of this war to a good iſſue, is the way
of overcoming by the blood of the Lamb, (or force of Chriſts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
whoſe blood cries for vengeance againſt his enemies) as alſo
by the word of their Teſtimony (freely and boldly given forth by
them in their very ſufferings, whilſt worldly Power ſtands on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſide) which ſhall have its effect upon friends and foes, as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Life to the one, death to the other, a ſweet ſavour to God both
ways, proſpering in the thing whereto he ſends it, and performing all
his pleaſure, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15, 16. <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 11.</p>
                  <p>Purſuant to this counſel and decree of God, (declared, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
15.) he hath wonderfully and fignally preſerved the ſeed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
unto this very day. He hath given them being, preſervation and
protection in the midſt of all enemies, and in deſpite of all their
rage and oppoſition. He hath carried on his CAUSE, and upheld
righteouſneſs on the ſide of his People, whatever diſguiſes, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
or blemiſhes have been endeavoured to be put upon it, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and his adherents. The miraculous preſervation of the Womans
Seed, the Scriptures diſtribute into three principal Branches, which
diſtinguiſh the whole tract of time allotted to them for their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
into three great Periods and ſeaſons, wherein the ſeed of the
Woman hath received variation, as to the outward form and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things, though in mind, principles, and ſpirit, they continue
ſtill the ſame, in and under all theſe Changes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt appearance of the ſeed of the Woman, in order to enter
the liſt with the Seed of the Serpent, we find in the line of <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:51760:39"/>
which he begat of <hi>Eve,</hi> the Mother of all living. <hi>Abel</hi> the firſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
died before he had any iſſue, or means to propagate it. God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
that defect in the line of <hi>Seth.</hi> In this new line is carried on the
decreed enmity between the two ſeeds, till the Flood came and ſwept
away (in a manner) all mankind, from off the face of the earth. At
that time the firſt war ended. But the foundation and matter of a new
war, in this kind, is contracted into, and found even in the family of
<hi>Noah.</hi> The firſt war, begun in <hi>Adams</hi> line, and continued in <hi>Seths,</hi> was
(in a way of God's juſt judgement upon the whole world) brought to
an end by the Flood. The ſeed of the Woman was now narrowed and
diminiſhed into <hi>Noahs</hi> perſon and two of his ſons. The ſeed of the
Serpent was contracted into a leſs room yet, the other ſon.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Epocha</hi> of 1656 years, from the Creation to the Flood, is in
Scripture diſtinguiſhed as one great period of time and revolution of
things in the world, relating to this war between the two ſeeds, and
the event of it. It began in and with the Patriarchs, in the perſon of
<hi>Abel,</hi> whom <hi>Cain</hi> that was of that wicked one, flew. It continued all
along with the Patriarchs and their day on earth, who lived every one
of them hundreds of years: And it had its period in that univerſal
miniſtry of God's wrath and vengeance upon the whole world, which
in Scripture is called, <hi>THE DAY OF THE LORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond appearance then of the ſeed of the Woman and ſeed of
the Serpent alſo, we find in <hi>Noahs</hi> family. From the matter and fuel,
contracted into this narrow compaſs, does the fire of the war between
the two ſeeds break forth a-freſh, and another world (as it were) and
ſtate of things, diverſe from the forme, runder the government of the
Patriarchs, is brought upon the Stage. This new and differently ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
war, ariſes and is occaſioned from the differing minds and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
found in <hi>Noah's</hi> three ſons, <hi>Sem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet.</hi> The flood
having deſtroyed all the families of the earth, ſave <hi>Noahs</hi> onely, the
Government of the World came hereby to receive a conſiderable
change, becauſe the Right of the Empire of the whole world was now by
Gods Providence devolved upon the family of <hi>Noah,</hi> and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
upon himſelf in perſon, as the right heir of it. After him, it came
to <hi>Sem</hi> and his line, by God's ſpecial deſignation, though <hi>Japhet</hi> were
the eldeſt.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Noahs</hi> three ſons, as in type, the three ſorts of principles and
mindes, which influence this ſecond world of mankind, are deſcribed,
and (as I may ſay) perſonated, to the life. Theſe three principles
diſtinguiſh all perſons deſcended of <hi>Noah's</hi> family, throughout the
whole world, into three ſorts of Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:51760:39"/>
The ſame method does <hi>John,</hi> by way of allegory hold, <hi>(Rev.</hi> 12.
12.) calling one ſort of them, <hi>Inhabitants of Heaven,</hi> or thoſe that
dwell <hi>and have their converſation in Heaven;</hi> correſponding in their
Principle and way of Life, with the <hi>Jeruſalem that is above.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another ſort he tearms, <hi>Inhabitants of the Earth,</hi> or <hi>thoſe that dwell
on Earth;</hi> the tribes of the Earth, or citizens of the earthly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third are <hi>thoſe that dwell in the Sea,</hi> or are found in a ſtate of
<hi>deep darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>alienation from the Life of God, caſting up mire and
dirt, as raging waves of the troubled Sea,</hi> (Eſay 57. 20.) living in that
open heatheniſme and prophaneſs, that the greateſt part of the world
chuſe to abide in, notwithſtanding the offer of Liberty made to
them, by the ranſom paid on their behalf in the blood of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
                  <p>1. The mind that ſhews it ſelf in the firſt ſort of theſe <hi>Inhabitants,</hi>
is that which was in <hi>Sem;</hi> a holy, ſpiritual mind, <hi>ſet upon things above,</hi>
or <hi>in heaven, at Chriſts right hand.</hi> This, when it comes to operate, is
that active, living Faith of the new creature, <hi>which works by love.</hi> By
this Faith, or in this ſpiritual mind and principle of Life and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Abel offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice than Cain,</hi>
Heb. 11. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. The mind that diſcovers it ſelf in the ſecond ſort of inhabitants,
(thoſe that dwell on Earth, citizens of the earthly <hi>Jeruſalem)</hi> is that
which was in <hi>Japhet,</hi> as a middle wavering ſtate, perſwadeable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to good or evil; either to leave the earth and love of ſeen things,
and to aſcend and dwell in the tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> in order to be fixed and
ſet on things above, or elſe to cleave unto things ſeen, in affection
and deſire, and thence to deſcend, and draw back to perdition, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize
and lodge in the heatheniſh principles of <hi>Cham,</hi> and ſo partake
of his curſe as well as ſin. Thoſe that thus decline from the wavering
ſpirit and principles of <hi>Japhet,</hi> to the prophane ſtate of <hi>Cham,</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Scripture to be ſuch as <hi>having known the way of righteouſneſs, do
turn aſide from the holy command,</hi> and ſo come to have their lot amongſt
thoſe that <hi>are twice dead, and pluck'd up by the roots, whoſe latter end is
worſe than their beginning.</hi> For upon ſuch a fatal backſliding, ſuch an
irrecoverable fall in their own perſons, they come to be fixed in evil
<hi>and bound up with the fallen Angels in everlaſting chains under darkneſs,
unto the judgement of the great day,</hi>

                  <p>This wavering ſpirit of <hi>Japhet,</hi> conſidered ſingly in its own ſphear
and activity, (as neither advancing towards the tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51760:40"/>
things above; nor declining to the heatheniſh and prophane ſtate of
<hi>Cham)</hi> is that ſpirit which properly conſtitutes the <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the
fleſh, in diſtinction from the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, or Circumciſion of
the Spirit, on the one hand; and the heatheniſh uncircumciſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
on the other, whilſt God kept up the war in the line of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
or ſeed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh, till Chriſt's incarnation.
For in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s line, deriving from <hi>Heber</hi> and <hi>Shem,</hi> did God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
and maintain the war with the Seed of the Serpent, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
it till his ſignal rejection of that line, and utter cutting them off
from being any more a Nation and People of themſelves, at the laſt
ſacking and deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after the death of Chriſt, by the
hand of <hi>Titus Veſpaſian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The mind that declares it ſelf in the third ſort of Inhabitants,
who dwell in the Sea, or in the depth of alienation from the life of
God, (without any ſenſe or feeling of that which is morally and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
good according to the Law, hating and deſpiſing God's image
in any kind, where-ever it ſhines forth) is that which was in <hi>Cham.</hi>
For <hi>this</hi> was he curſed and judicially fixed in his bondage, as a ſervant
of ſin, reſembled by that ſervant under the Moſaical diſpenſation,
who for refuſing his freedom when offered, was bored thorow his ear,
in token of his perpetual ſervitude, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 6.</p>
                  <p>1. The firſt ſort of theſe Inhabitants are heavenly, having a mind
and principles fix'd in that obedience of Faith which is acceptable,
and by entring into God's Reſt through Faith, do become unmovable
in the right way of working Righteouſneſs, wherein they attain the
end of their hope, that is, <hi>the ſalvation of their ſouls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond are earthly, unfixed either in good or evil, waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between both, having a mind ſometimes ſerving the Law of God,
and ſometimes the law of ſin. Theſe, however they may draw near
to God with their words and tongue, their heart is alienated and at
a diſtance from him; at leaſt, may be, for ought they know, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the form of godlineſs they live in. For they are not able
to make a true and certain judgment of themſelves, till they partake
of that Anointing from above that can teach them all things. This is
that only that will enable them to keep the word of Chriſt's patience
in the day of their tryal. Without this Grace extended to them, and
poſſeſſed by them, they will become Apoſtates, forget they have been
waſhed from their old ſins, and will ſhew themſelves at laſt the moſt
hardned and bitter reſiſters of the holy Ghoſt and Power of Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>3. The third are like the Sea, foaming out their own filth, and
they are conſtant and fixed therein, having minds and conſciences
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51760:40"/>
ſeard and made harder than the nether milſtone, in works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Being paſt feeling, they have ſold themſelves to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Peradventure ſometime they may be made a little ſenſible of
the ſting and penalties of the Law, ſo as to make ſome ſlender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
and feigned profeſſions of obedience and ſubjection
thereunto, (the Devils alſo believe and tremble) but no hearty or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
repentance from dead works, or pure obedience of love, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the ſpirit of Adoption, and appearing in a ſteady amendment
of life, is to be found in them. Yea, they are by God himſelf judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
hardned, and unchangeably faſtned in their own choſen wayes
of darkneſs. They give themſelves up to work all uncleanneſs with
greedineſs, and God gives them up to vile affections, to take their
courſe, and fill up the meaſure of their abominations, till he ſee time
to ſtrike them once for all.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and laſt of the above-named minds or principles, are
the two extreams, in the one or other of which, the middle or ſecond
ſort of Inhabitants (that are in the wavering, changeable, contending
ſtate, with whom God is ſtriving by his Spirit) will come at laſt to
be unchangeably fixed. The perfect and righteous ſtate which Man
was at firſt created in, was this middle, wavering and unfixed ſtate
of perfection which was at firſt, and upon renewal thereof is again
capable to be guided by the Spirit of God (through Faith) into a
higher and better, or to be tempted and ſeduced by Satan into a
lower and far worſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſinful ſtate likewiſe into which mankind was plunged by the
firſt tranſgreſſion and fall of Man, is not fixed, or made immutable
and deſperate, until a new proof and tryal be made of all men. In
order to this, by vertue of the Blood of the Redeemer, and through
obſervation of the Rules appointed by God for recovery out of the
Fall, a reſtitution to the rectified Principles and Righteouſneſs of
our firſt Creation, is in Chriſt moſt certainly attainable by every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
without exception. For by Chriſt's Blood there is remiſſion to
be had for all ſins paſt, and a new tryal is propounded and ſet before
every one for time to come, upon the terms, and according to the
tenor of God's conditional, or abſolute Covenant. Hence it is the
War ariſes, and the Enmity is ſet, or comes to be fixed between the
two ſeeds, each ſerving, as it were, for the proof and tryal of the
unmovableneſs of one another, either in good or evil.</p>
                  <p>Through this was occaſioned the quarrel between the ſeed of the
Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent, growing up out of <hi>Noah</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
The uſurpation of the univerſal Government of the World in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51760:41"/>
favour and aſſiſtance of the Serpent's ſeed, was attempted and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
by <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his ſucceſſors. Afterwards it came into <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar's</hi>
hands, and by <hi>Daniel</hi>'s interpretation of that propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Image of worldly Monarchy that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw in a dream,
the continuance thereof in his line and three other ſucceſſive bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Univerſal Monarchy in the lines of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,
Grecians,</hi> and then <hi>Romans,</hi> was foretold. All theſe have been the
inheritors of <hi>Cham</hi>'s ſpirit, upholding a heatheniſh ſtate of Idolatry,
Ignorance and Prophaneſs, againſt the Kingdom and Obedience of
Chriſt, kept up and witneſſed unto, all along, in and by the line and
ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Sem</hi> downward, to the laſt ſack and utter
ruine of the Temple and City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under the <hi>Romans.</hi> The
chief memorables in this ſpace of time, that concern the oppoſit inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to theſe worldly Monarchies, were the eminent Call of <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to the Faith, the giving of the Law, the building and
rebuilding of the Temple, the long continuing of the Prophetical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the Jewiſh Church, Chriſt's Incarnation, Miniſtry, Death and
Reſurrection. About forty years after the Reſurrection of Chriſt,
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is deſtroyed by <hi>Titus Vespaſian,</hi> and there ended the ſecond
great Period and Revolution of this War, that was managed between
the two ſeeds. All along this ſecond War, the ſeed of the Serpent
was poſſeſſed of the Univerſal Monarchy of this World, had all the
countenance and aſſiſtance which that could afford. The main viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Protection vouchſafed by God on the other hand, to his Church
and People, was continued in the line of <hi>Abraham,</hi> accounting from
<hi>Sem</hi> downward, unto God's judicial rejection of that ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
according to the fleſh, upon their crucifying the Lord of
Glory.</p>
                  <p>In this ſecond War, we find the ſeed of the Woman bruiſed ſtill in
the heel and coming off with loſs. Yea, upon the winding up of this
ſecond great Day or Period of time, (wherein the Prince of Life
was by wicked hands put to death, and the whole Nation of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Church of God on Earth, rejected, and their Worſhip prophaned
and deſtroyed) the Devil might ſeem to himſelf and others to have
come off compleat conqueror. But the War is again renewed by the
Serpent and his ſeed, againſt the ſeed of the Woman, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
and brought forth again by the Regeneration, from amongſt
the very heatheniſh Nations of the World, that were not before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by God as a People of his, but given up, as it were, to the
dominion of Sin and Satan.</p>
                  <p>This third War had its foundation laid in the Incarnation, Death
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51760:41"/>
and Reſurrection of Chriſt, who (though a Son) was taught obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by ſuffering, and in the condition of a ſufferer obtained the
victory. <hi>Through death he deſtroyed him that had the power of death,</hi>
that is, <hi>the Devil.</hi> And <hi>by taſting death for every man, as became the
Captain of our Salvation, he was made perfect through ſufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This way of fighting and overcoming the Devil and Sin, was a
great myſtery till then, and the moſt unlikely of all other, ever to
break the Serpents head, and diſpoſſeſs him and his Inſtruments of
their worldly Thrones and Powers. Yet in this way of the Croſs,
by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their Teſtimony, do the
true Witneſſes of Chriſt manage and carry on this third War. One
thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, that is, yeares, have bin alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them for propheſying in ſackcloth, in a perſecuted, wilderneſs
condition. Then they are to riſe out of their graves, ſtand again upon
their feet, and prophecy with power. 'Tis paſt all diſpute, that the
conqueſt muſt fall on the ſide of the Lamb and his followers, at the
ending of this third great ſeaſon and revolution of time, wherein
the ſeed of the Woman hath ſtill been on the ſuffering hand. The
end of their ſuffering ſeaſon will be, when the ſeventh Trumpet
begins to ſound, immediately after the effect which the pouring forth
of the Vials ſhall have upon the Beaſt and his kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This is the Riſe, Progreſs and Iſſue that is given unto things in
the third Age of the World, called <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that was made to ſpring
up and have its being out of the deſtruction of the Jewiſh World,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11.</p>
                  <p>The cleer view and proſpect of things in this Chriſtian World,
(both as to the Civil and Church-government, as alſo the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Seeds, brought on again and continued) was given
by Chriſt unto the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> and revealed to him by his Angel in
the Book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For there we find the period that muſt
happen alſo to this third World, and to the Heavens and Earth, or the
Civil and Church-ſtate appertaining to it, and carried on under this
diſpenſation, in order to give place to a world to come, which is yet
to ſucceed. This World to come, will be of a more heavenly and
ſpiritual Conſtitution, as to the general ſtate and frame of things,
which is to be brought forth by Chriſt's ſecond appearance, upon the
ſpirits and bodies of men, on this ſide their compleat and utmoſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.
The final aſcending up to the Father, to ſit down at his
right hand, is after this world that is yet to come (or the thouſand
years Reign of Chriſt withall his Saints on earth) ſhall have had
its courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:51760:42"/>
Unto the riſen ſtate of Saints, when they ſhall begin to come forth
in their victorious poſture, and unreſiſtable power of Faith and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
doth the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſeem to refer, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>After two
dayes</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>or great ſeaſons of Affliction and Suffering</hi> (already
deſcribed) <hi>he will revive us, by the WORD's being made Fleſh, and
the day-ſpring from on high therein viſiting us.</hi> This <hi>(Hab.</hi> 3. 2.) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a reviving the work, or preſerving it alive in the midſt of the
years of Wrath and Oppreſſion from the Serpent and his ſeed, that
was yet to be under-gone for the ſpace of 1666 years after Chriſt's
birth, as will appear in its proper place. <hi>In the third day</hi> (ſayes <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea)</hi>
that is, at the end of it, when the Witneſſes are to ariſe, <hi>we ſhall
live in his ſight.</hi> By following on to know the Lord, we ſhall perceive
that his going forth in this his third great revolution of time, hath
been as the morning, ſhining more and more unto a perfect day, and
that his coming to us (according as hath been by him purpoſed) in
his <hi>firſt</hi> and in his <hi>ſecond Appearance,</hi> will be as the <hi>former and latter
rain unto the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>former rain of Chriſt's Spirit,</hi> in the ſeaſon of his firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
began at the day of Pentecoſt, in viſible gifts and diſtributions
of the holy Ghoſt, dividing to every man ſeverally, as himſelf plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
By this means he raiſed up a Miniſtry that formed and laid the
Foundation of the Primitive Church. That Church was upheld in
its original purity, more or leſs, as long as they kept the Word of
God's Patience, and withſtood the oppoſition made againſt it, after
a right manner, by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
Teſtimony, in the giving whereof, they loved not their lives unto
death. This appeared, all along thoſe hard and cruel Perſecutions
they under-went, until ſuch time almoſt as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came to the
Empire.</p>
                  <p>But to avoid Perſecution, Chriſtians then began to mingle Intereſt
with worldly Powers, and (to pleaſe Governours) took their reſt
in the outward Court, ſome out-ſide form of godlineſs, ſo as that
which we call Chriſtian Religion, became the Religion of the Empire
(or of the body of the Nation unto which it was received) as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and compelled by the Laws of the State, and power of the
Sword. This practice commenced and bears date about four hundred
years after Chriſt, from which time little of the <hi>former rain</hi> hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon ſuch viſible or ſtate Chriſtianity, in their Publick and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Meeting-places of Worſhip. That <hi>rain</hi> became then <hi>hidden
Manna,</hi> the peculiar food and refreſhing of the Woman and her ſeed
in the Wilderneſs, where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51760:42"/>
and half a time. From about the time that Chriſtian Religion hath
been made National, and in the Rules, Ordinances and Doctrines
thereof, been embodyed with the Laws of each Nation in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and ſo enforced by the Civil Sword, thoſe that truly keep the
Commandments of God and Teſtimony of Jeſus, have been driven
into a ſtate of deſolation, perſecution and diſperſion, and are ſo to
continue and be warred upon, forty and two Months, by the Earth
and her Inhabitants on the one hand, and by the Sea and her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
on the other.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe ſorts of Inhabitants and Enemies of the Church in the
Wilderneſs, do make up and conſtitute but one great City or incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
Society of the Serpents ſeed, ſpiritually called <hi>Egypt</hi> and
<hi>Sodom,</hi> under the headſhip of worldly Government, as it ariſes out
of the Sea. This worldly Government is ſtill but the ſame fourth
Beaſt and univerſal Romane Empire, in Principles of oppoſition to
the Kingdom of Chriſt and Seed of the Woman, as before. It ſeems
indeed to be now healed and reformed with the ſhew of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
under the headſhip of Church-Government and coercive
Power ariſing out of the Earth, or apoſtate Principles of the worldly
Church, departing from the Primitive Power, Purity and Patern;
retaining ſtill ſomething of the form of Godlineſs, but denying the
Spirit and Power thereof.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> carries the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and is willing to be <hi>rid upon by it,</hi>
finding great benefit and advantage by having the <hi>Whore</hi> upon their
<hi>back,</hi> for the propagating of ſervitude, and rooting out of the earth
the pure and chaſte Principles of the Primitive, Apoſtolick, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church.</p>
                  <p>Thus the War is managed between the <hi>two ſeeds</hi> in this <hi>third day.</hi>
Towards the latter end of this day is our lot fallen, who are at preſent
alive in this world. But before the period, and ſhutting in of this
day, the Sufferings of the Womans Seed ſhall have an end. Then,
that Miniſtry of the Spirit ſhall come in, which is compared to the
<hi>latter rain.</hi> This is that which ſhall break the Serpents head, utterly
tread him, his kingdom and followers under foot. This is that, which
(by the pouring forth of the ſeven Vials of the wrath of God upon
the kingdom of the Beaſt, to the utter ruine and deſtruction thereof)
will prepare the way for the coming down of the <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> out
of Heaven, as a Bride adorned for her Husband, and ſo, for the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years Reign of Chriſt on Earth. At the beginning of that Reign,
Satan ſhall be chained up, and there ſhall be no more Sea, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
worldly-Intereſt, and beaſtly Government left.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:51760:43"/>
In the <hi>evening-time</hi> of this <hi>third day</hi> or age of the World (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we now live) it ſhall be <hi>light,</hi> by the coming on of the Kingdom
and Reign of Chriſt, with all his Saints, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 5, 7.</p>
                  <p>This then that we have been deſcribing, is the third ſignal ſeaſon
or great revolution of things in this world, wherein the ſame War
that was from the beginning, hath been, and ſtill is carrying on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Seeds, under the name of Chriſtian, or of Chriſt's
followers. The Seed of the Serpent, under pretence of being for
Chriſt, do prove at laſt univerſally againſt him, moſt ſhamefully and
wickedly rejecting him, and falling in with the kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
in direct oppoſition to his Kingdom. This they will do, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that he hath been graciouſly ſtriving and contending by
the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, to work the whole World into a ſtate of
Obedience and Subjection to the Righteouſneſs of his Scepter. For
this end hath he been many hundred years giving forth the light and
glory of his Goſpel and Kingdom, from the Eaſtern parts of the
World to the Weſt, and ſuffered himſelf all along to be caſt off, and
his Members to be oppreſſed and troden under foot, by degrees, in
one Nation and Country after another, till at laſt it came to theſe
Weſtern parts, and was ſpread from hence in <hi>America,</hi> which with
theſe Nations we live in, ſeem to be the laſt piece of Ground this
Quarrel is to be fought out in. Yea, and probably this is the time as
well as the place, wherein the Witneſſes are finiſhing their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
being the laſt that are ſignally to be ſlain by the Beaſt, as the
proper accompliſhment of that Propheſie, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. The Beaſt is
repreſented here as generally in his aſcendant poſture, being gratified
with ſome remarkable Riſe in his affairs, as a lightning before death,
to enable him for the accompliſhing of this great counſel of God that
is to be acted upon the dead bodies of his ſlain Witneſſes, within the
three years and half before their riſing again and ſtanding upon their
feet. Then they are to enter upon the ſecond part of their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Miniſtry, compared to that of <hi>Eliah</hi>'s in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s time, and that
of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Egygt,</hi> when at their word they ſhall ſhut Heaven that it
rain not, have power over Waters to turn them into blood, and to
ſmite the Earth with Plagues as often as they will.</p>
                  <p>By them alſo Heaven ſhall be opened, and a fuller and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
diſcovery of Chriſt in Spirit miniſtred, than ever yet hath
been. Amongſt them ſhall be found thoſe ſeven Angels, or Officers
of the Church, to whom ſhall be committed the pouring out of the
ſeven golden Vials, full of the wrath of God. Theſe Vials contain
a like univerſal Miniſtry of Wrath and of the Judgement of God by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51760:43"/>
Fire, upon ungodly men, as was brought by Water upon the old
World in the dayes of <hi>Noah.</hi> This miniſtry of wrath by Fire, ſhall
put a period to the third ſtate of things in the world, as that by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did unto the firſt. Out of the deſtruction of the preſent World
and frame of things, by this fiery miniſtry of God's wrath, is the
thouſand years Reign of Chriſt to ſpring up, in that Kingdom of his
that ſhall never end.</p>
                  <p>And here bear with me in giving (by way of digreſſion) ſome
few broken Notions, in order to the better and more diſtinct open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt's Kingdom, which we ſhall find <hi>(Luk.</hi> 17. 20, 21. and
<hi>chap.</hi> 19. 11, &amp;c.) to be diſtinguiſhed into a Twofold ſtate;</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>A Kingdom inward.</hi> The <hi>Kingdom of God is within you;</hi> and is
the dominion of God in the Conſcience and Spirit of the Mind. This
Kingdom ſtands not, nor comes in or with any outward obſervation,
but is the commanding, ruling Principle of Life in the true Saint, as
a Law written in his inward parts. Chriſt's Kingdom, as thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
is intended, <hi>(Rev.</hi> 11. 1.) where it is called the <hi>Temple of
God,</hi> or the <hi>inward Court,</hi> and thoſe that worſhip there, glorifying
God in their Spirits. This Kingdom of Chriſt is capable of ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and being managed imwardly, in the minds of his People, in a
hidden ſtate, concealed from the eye of the world; By the Power
thereof, the inward ſenſes or eyes of the mind are opened and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,
to the drawing them upward to a Heavenly converſe, catching
and carrying up the Soul to the Throne of God, and to the knowledge
of the Life which is hid, with Chriſt, in God. Thoſe that are in this
Kingdom, and in whom the Power of it is, are fitted to flye with the
Church into the VVilderneſs, and to continue in ſuch a ſolitary, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed,
deſolate condition, till God calls them out of it. They have
VVells and Springs opened to them in this VVilderneſs, whence
they draw the VVaters of Salvation, without being in bondage to the
Life of Senſe, and the objects depending thereon, as <hi>touch not, taſte
not, handle not,</hi> which periſh in the uſing.</p>
                  <p>2. But Secondly, <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom is alſo outward;</hi> appearing to
ſenſe, and to the eye of the ſenſual or inferiour part of the mind,
which works only by bodily organs, judging by the ſight of that eye,
and the hearing of that ear, whoſe life is in and by the body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
in bodily exerciſe, and is therefore compared <hi>(Revel.</hi> 11. 2.)
to the <hi>outward Court,</hi> and the VVorſhip thereunto appertaining. This
is the Dominion of God in the Conſcience alſo, though but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
or ſenſual part of the mind, where it becomes a Law in our
Members, to put in execution and perform the Law of the Spirit of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51760:44"/>
our Mind, that ſo our very bodies may become the Temple of the
holy Ghoſt, and we may be able to glorifie God, not in our Spirits
only, but in our Bodies alſo, as clean Veſſels and earthen Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,
upon which may be written, <hi>HOLINESS TO THE
LORD, Zech.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>Now the Kingdom of Chriſt comes not properly to appear in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhew and viſibility, but as it ſhines forth in this lower and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
part of the Soul, witneſſing the Dominion and Power of God to
be there as a Law and commanding Principle, in, and over the outward
man. With reſpect to this kind of its Appearance, in affecting and
influencing the bodily part of man, and becoming the Life thereof,
it is capable to come forth in a Power and Glory that is <hi>corruptible,
fading, and that wears away;</hi> as alſo in that which is <hi>incorruptible and
abides for ever.</hi> The firſt of theſe is meant, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1, 2.) where
'tis ſaid, <hi>Now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what
we ſhall be: but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him,</hi>
(or have the like appearance with him) <hi>for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>
The Sons of God are not yet in the proper appearance of <hi>his Sons,</hi>
but do bear the form and appearance of the <hi>fleſhly man,</hi> to the <hi>making
a fair ſhew in the fleſh:</hi> They have their Treaſure but in an earthen
Veſſel, unredeemed from its preſent bondage unto corruption. But
the time is haſtening, when they ſhall in Spirit ſhine forth as the Sun
in its ſtrength, in the Kingdom of their Father, and their very bodies
ſhall be as the Firmament, tranſparent, and of ſervice to unvail the
glory of the inward man, and not cover and diſguiſe it, as now they do.</p>
                  <p>But, alas! <hi>This fair ſhew in the fleſh,</hi> which may alſo be made by
thoſe that are ſtrange Children, paſſes with moſt for the Kingdom of
Chriſt, even yet in theſe laſt dayes, ſome crying, <hi>Lo here;</hi> and ſome,
<hi>lo there;</hi> according to that form of ſervice and divine worſhip they
are perſwaded in their minds, is according to the Rule of God's
VVord, though it be but that only which appertains to the <hi>outward
Court,</hi> which is given up by God into the hands of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to
poſſeſs and tread under foot at their pleaſure. The Heavens hereof
are paſſing away with a great noiſe, and theſe worldly Elements are
melting apace; As a Veſture they ſhall be folded up and changed,
they ſhall periſh and wear old as a Garment, whilſt Chriſt's inward
and ſpiritual Kingdom ſhall remain, and in its due time come forth
in an appearance that ſhall be laſting and unſhaken for ever. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we receiving this Kingdom, which cannot be moved, let us hold
faſt, and have Grace, whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with
reverence and Godly fear. <hi>For our God is a conſuming fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:51760:44"/>
But to return, and apply our ſelves to the ſubject we were on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which is, To give the view of what Word God is fulfilling, and
what part of his Counſel he is executing among us, in this our day.
The Heavens are now black over our heads, the Sun is turned into
darkneſs, the Moon into blood, and mens hearts are failing them for
fear of what God is bringing upon the Earth. Great diſtreſs is in the
Land, and upon the Nations; Wrath is coming upon that People,
who ſay they are <hi>Jews</hi> and are not, but ſhall be found liars. The Sea
and the waves alſo, will roar; the prophane heatheniſh party of men
will be in great perplexity too.</p>
                  <p>Surely, the Figtree, and all the Trees are ſhooting forth; and after
this cruel, ſharp Winter that is (and for ſome ſpace is yet to be) upon
us, the Summer approaches that will make amends for all. Great
cauſe there is for the Sons of God to lift up their heads, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
that their Redemption draws nigh.</p>
                  <p>In this point, the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> will be every day more
and more opened, to give us light and inſtruction, the Providences
of God helping much every day too, as to the interpretation thereof,
together with the Spirit of Truth, that dwells and lives in the hearts
of Saints. Through mercy, the Lord who is that Spirit, hath not been
wanting in his Teachings of this kind to a poor Worm in my preſent
ſolitude and bonds. I ſhall have occaſion to tell you by and by, that
there appears cauſe to me of diſſent from Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> as to ſome appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
that are made by him in his learned Commentary on that
Book, when I come to ſpeak of ſome particulars concerning the
Witneſſes, and their twofold time and ſtate of propheſying.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Their</hi> thouſand two hundred and ſixty years propheſying in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
in a perſecuted wilderneſs ſtate.</p>
                  <p>2. Their <hi>propheſying in power and glory, during the ſpace of the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of the ſeven Vials of Wrath, as a fore-running Eliah-like Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
preparatory to Chriſt's thouſand years Reign on Earth.</hi> Yet, as
to that which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> calls his great Key for the opening of that
whole Book, to wit, his <hi>Synchroniſms</hi> or Contemporations of things,
which he finds to agree and fall out together in the ſame age and time,
I exceedingly reverence his Judgement, and look upon him as one
that hath moſt happily found out the hidden order and method, uſed
by the holy Ghoſt in that Prophetical Book.</p>
                  <p>This method being once known to the very rational judgment of
man, that may be exerciſed upon the matters contained in that Book,
they are thereby rendred much more eaſie and intelligible.</p>
                  <p>Let us alſo take it for granted, (as that which is the common
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51760:45"/>
judgment of thoſe that acknowledge the Scriptures) that in this Book
of the <hi>Apocalypſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> are contained and revealed, in an orderly method,
the things which were to fall out in the courſe of God's Providence
and wiſe ordering of matters for the good of the VVomans Seed,
during the third Day or Age of the world. This day reaches from
Chriſt's Aſcention (or departure into a far Country) to God's bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again this his only begotten Son into the world, that every tongue
may confeſs, and every knee bow to the honour of his moſt glorious
Name. Then ſhall he, in the quality of Univerſal King, as well on
Earth as in Heaven, enter upon and keep the poſſeſſion of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
againſt all Uſurpers and Oppoſers whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>This ſpace of time between Chriſt's Aſcention to Heaven, and
Reign on Earth, is meaſured out in three great and diſtinct Sections
or Diviſions, in the Book before-mentioned, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
and every of theſe three are again made to contain in them
ſeven Sub-diviſions of that portion of time that is allotted unto each
of them. Hereupon Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s own words are, <hi>The order of the Seals,
and in them, of the Trumpets, is certain and undoubted, to wit, the ſame,
which the number to every one aſcribed doth point out,</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
<hi>The reſt therefore of the Prophecies in that Book, being compared firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
themſelves, and afterwards with the Seals, by way of Synchroniſm,
the Order of the whole</hi> Revelation <hi>will be evident.</hi> This Aſſertion of
his I take to be moſt clear.</p>
                  <p>He therefore begins with that notable <hi>quaternion</hi> of Prophecies,
which are ſo very remarkable, by reaſon of the equality of their
times.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The firſt is, the Prophecy of the VVoman's remaining in the
VVilderneſs <hi>for a time, times, and half a time,</hi> or 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> as is
there more manifeſtly declared.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſecond is that of the ſeven-headed Beaſt, reſtored and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
forty two months.</item>
                     <item>3. The third is of the Court (or of the holy City) trodden under
foot by the Gentiles.</item>
                     <item>4. The fourth and laſt, is that of the <hi>two Witneſſes, propheſying</hi>
1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> that is, years.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Now although (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> well obſerves) the character of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of times will not be ſufficient to evidence that they are the ſame
times, but may be before or after, yet by other characters which that
Book affords, to make out the demonſtration, it ſeems very clear.
Theſe other characters he brings (as well he may) out of the twelfth
Chapter, where 'tis plain, that when the Dragon is caſt down by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51760:45"/>
                     <hi>Michael</hi> out of Heaven, the VVoman eſcapes from his <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> that he

                     </gap> to his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weapons, and applies himſelf to make war with the VVoman and
with the reſt of her Seed, to wit, thoſe which ſhe ſhould bring forth
in the VVilderneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. And for this purpoſe he gave his Power,
his Throne, and great Authority to the ten-horned Beaſt, out of the
Sea aſcending, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. it appears, that the times of the Beaſt and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of the VVitneſſes are equal, and that they are finiſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the end of the ſixth Trumpet, which ſhews they began and
held on together, the whole ſpace. The twelfth <hi>verſe</hi> ſhews the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention
of the VVitneſſes into Heaven, which puts a period to their
mourning Prophecy, as alſo that great Earthquake (wherewith the
Imperial City being overthrown, the Kingdom of the Beaſt comes to
be aboliſhed) noted by the very moment in which the ſecond Woe,
which is under the ſixth Trumpet, went out. On this, the third Woe
is quickly to enſue, at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet. In that
very moment of time that the Witneſſes, (whom the Beaſt aſcending
out of the bottomleſs pit had ſlain, being at the point of finiſhing
their Teſtimony in ſackcloth) were revived by the ſpirit of life from
God entring into them, and aſcending up into Heaven, the ſame
hour the tenth part of the City fell, by means of the great Earthquake.</p>
                  <p>Then matters are brought to that paſs, that the ſeventh Trumpet
ſounding, all the Kingdoms of the World become our Lord's and
his Chriſt's. In the ſame moment alſo, the Wrath of the Lamb
comes to be poured out by the Miniſtry of the Vials, and the Temple
of God is to be ſeen in Heaven, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The great Harlot, or</hi> myſtical Babylon <hi>(chap.</hi> 17.) <hi>is of the ſame

                  </p>
                  <p>The period of the Tyranny of the Beaſt, and of this Company of
the ſealed Virgin-Saints, is at the coming forth of the multitude of
Palm-bearers. For, out of what tribulation could they come, but of
the Beaſt's perſecuting the Saints? Therefore they leave the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Beaſt behind them, and are of one Myſtical Body or Church
with the <hi>ſealed Ones,</hi> and have been under the ſame Perſecution with
them; but are Saints of an inferiour rank and ſtation to thoſe that

tribulation under the perſecuting Beaſt) contemporize with the <hi>Whore</hi>
and the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> All theſe contemporize one with another, and fill up
the ſame ſpace of time. After this, ſucceeds the Miniſtry of the <hi>ſeven
Vials,</hi> at the Riſing of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the moment of their aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
into Heaven. This will come to paſs at the beginning of the

<hi>Witneſſes</hi> will come on. The power of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> and the pouring
forth of the <hi>Vials of God's Wrath upon the Kingdom of the Beaſt,</hi> will be
viſibly committed to them, and the time of the <hi>Beaſt's</hi> and <hi>Babylons
inclining to Ruine,</hi> or the <hi>viſibly declining ſinking ſtate of both,</hi> will fall
in together with this Diſpenſation of the <hi>Vials,</hi> to make way for the
<hi>Marriage of the Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>coming down of the New Jeruſalem out
of Heaven,</hi> to be ſeen as the Tabernacle of God amongſt men here on
Earth.</p>
                  <p>The remaining difficulty then is, to fill up the firſt of the three
great Sections and Diviſions of time, before-mentioned, to wit, the
ſpace which had an end put to it by the Womans actual flight into
the Wilderneſs. This began, when <hi>John</hi> received this Prophecy in
the Iſle of <hi>Patmos.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> very judicially ſummeth it up in
theſe three Particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. The value and preference which is put by God upon the ſtate
of the Church, as it anſwers to the <hi>inward Court</hi> of the Temple of old,
comparatively with thoſe who in their ſpirit, principle and way, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
but to the <hi>outward Court</hi> thereof, and the Worſhip appertaining
thereunto. The former have the true inward Circumciſion of the
heart in the ſpirit, <hi>whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.</hi> The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are thoſe, who, at beſt, have but the Circumciſion of the heart in
the letter, which labours to ſhew it ſelf in ſuch outward Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of language and practice, as may ſerve to keep up a ſhew or
form of Godlineſs in the ſight and to the well-pleaſing of man, whilſt
they are at an utter diſtance, even in their hearts, from the very life
and power of Godlineſs, that ſprings up from the new nature, that is
found in the true Circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and
anſwer to the <hi>inward Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:51760:46"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice of this in his time <hi>(Gal.</hi> 4.) where he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
between an <hi>earthly Jeruſalem,</hi> that is in bondage with her
Children, under the Covenant of Works or Dominion of the Law,
and a <hi>Jeruſalem above,</hi> which is free, and is the Mother of all that
Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who are Heirs according to the Promiſe. Theſe
are deſcribed <hi>(Rev.</hi> 12.) by <hi>the Woman clothed with the Sun that hath
the Moon under her feet, and upon her Head a Crown of twelve Stars.</hi>
This figurative deſcription ſhewes the Glory of the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
as it is <hi>above, inward and in ſpirit,</hi> who with her Children is in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
under the Covenant and Dominion of Grace. The ſame is
alſo ſignified by the <hi>inward Court,</hi> appointed to be meaſured by the
Reed of God, in diſtinction from the <hi>outward Court,</hi> which is not
meaſured, but abandoned and given up, as it were, to the power of
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to be by them troden under foot, and defiled.</p>
                  <p>2. In this ſame ſpace of time, falls out the impregnating of the
Woman, or her growing Great, ready to be delivered of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child.
The principal care of the Apoſtles, and other Teachers, who
ſucceeded in their Spirit, in the Primitive Church, (deſcribed under
the repreſentation of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Angels or
Officers appertaining to them) was, to be doing what had the moſt
conducible tendency to the haſtening and forwarding this birth of the
Man-child, which the Dragon oppoſed, diligently watch'd to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
reſiſt, and (if poſſible) to devour, as ſoon as born.</p>
                  <p>3. The ſeven-headed Dragon's lying in wait, and managing the
battel againſt <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, about the aforeſaid birth, muſt
needs contemporize with the <hi>two</hi> fore-mentioned Particulars. All
the <hi>three</hi> do therefore fill up the firſt ſpace of time, or age, ſucceeding
the Apoſtles, meaſured out by what is contained in the <hi>ſix firſt Seals;</hi>
and was fore told to <hi>John,</hi> as that which ſhould happen both to the
Church and World, until the Womans flight from the Dragon, after
this great battel in Heaven, and retiring into the Wilderneſs, there
to be nouriſhed of God, her appointed time.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>three</hi> are the immediate Antecedents of thoſe things, which
have been ſhewed to contemporize under the <hi>ſeventh Seal and ſix
Trumpets;</hi> that is to ſay, the diſtinguiſhing between the <hi>inward and
outward Court,</hi> with the Worſhip and Service appertaining unto each;
<hi>Secondly,</hi> The impregnating of the Woman: And then <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The
battel hereupon ariſing in Heaven, or within the Primitive Church,
and continuing a long time, till at length the Man-child comes to be
born. Then the Dragon loſes his credit and authority in the Church.
His ſubtilty in accuſing and laying falſe imputation; on the Brethren,

the truly pure and ſpiritual part of the Church) is detected. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
he is caſt out into the Earth, confined (as it were) to the
<hi>outward Court,</hi> and the Worſhippers and Service belonging to it, as
the only matter for him to work upon, for the increaſe of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by the number of Hypocrites and Apoſtates, drawn by him out
of the true Church. They were in truth never of it, though for a
while they were in it. At length, they find it their intereſt to make
a Separation from it; being ſenſual, and not having the Spirit, they
can no longer endure thoſe that have it, and that ſhine forth daily
more and more in the Life and Teſtimony thereof. The old Dragon
became hereby neceſſitated to manage and proſecute the War with
the earthly Weapons only of worldly Power and Government, in a
way of outward force and compulſion, exerciſed by the power of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws, and of the civil Sword. This Power and Sword, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
ſenſual, and malignant Church (founded and conſiſting in the
worſhippers and ſervice of the <hi>outward Court)</hi> getting into their
hands, or engaging it on their ſide, by mingling Intereſt with worldly
Governours, committed Whoredom, like <hi>Tyre,</hi> with all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the VVorld upon the face of the Earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23. 17. Yea,
this Beaſt with <hi>two horns,</hi> ſo influenced, encouraged and back'd the
<hi>ten horn'd</hi> Beaſt, that he became thereby fixed and engaged, in his
Mind as well as Power, to continue and carry on the War, <hi>forty and two
months</hi> longer, againſt the Woman and her Seed, and to blaſpheme
God, his Name, his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thus in brief Heads have we ſeen how the two firſt great Sections
or Diviſions of time, in the <hi>third Age,</hi> are filled up, to wit, the ſpace
from <hi>John's</hi> receiving the Prophecy of them in the <hi>Iſle of Patmos</hi> to
the end of the firſt battel, or war, made in Heaven, and (as the
iſſue of that) the catching up of the Man-child unto God and to his
Throne, and the Womans actual flight into the VVilderneſs, and
from thence to the riſing of the VVitneſſes, which puts a period to
the ſuffering ſeaſon, alloted to their Propheſying in Sack-cloth. And
as to the third and laſt Section of time, it is that which is meaſured
out by the ſounding of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> and the pouring out of the
<hi>ſeven Vials,</hi> which begins with the beginning of that <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and
continues till the <hi>Whore</hi> be judged, <hi>Babylon</hi> ſunk, and the whole
Kingdom of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> for ever ruined and deſtroyed. This makes
way for the marriage of the Lamb to be celebrated here on Earth, and
ſo, for the coming on of the Kingdom of Chriſt into the actual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of a viſible ruling Power and univerſal Empire over the whole
VVorld, for a <hi>thouſand years.</hi>

                     <hi>Having thus had a view of the diſtinct periods of time, together
with the matter of the Propheſies, which were to be fulfilled in and
under each of theſe diſtinct Revolutions, it will yet much prepare
and help our underſtandings, rightly to diſcern and look into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of this moſt excellent Book, if once we can but arrive at a
ſatisfactory opening, and interpreting (at leaſt, in ſome chief par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars)
the things which are ſignified under many of the Figures
and Allegorical Expreſſions, made uſe of throughout the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.
For Example: Let us conſider theſe;</hi> The ſeven Churches
and the Angels of them: The Throne in Heaven: The ſealed Book:
The Woman: The Dragon and his Angels: Michael and his Angels:
The Man-child: The throne and ſeat of the Dragon's Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
The outward and inward Court: The Floud, iſſuing out of the
Dragon's mouth: The diſtinguiſhed Inhabitants of the Heavens, of the
Earth, and of the Sea: The 144000 ſealed Virgins: The Palm-bearers:
The Remnant of the Womans Seed, that keep the Commands of God and
have the Teſtimony of Jeſus: The ſeven-headed, ten horn'd Beaſt: The
Beaſt's Image: The two horn'd Beaſt: The falſe Prophet: The Whore:
Myſtical Babylon: The great City that rules over the Kings of the Earth:
The Number of the Beaſt's Name: The two Witneſſes; their hidden or
obſcure Propheſying in Sack-cloth; their glorious Appearing and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying
in Power, and in a Wonder-working Miniſtry, like to that of
Moſes and Eliah: The Kingdom of the Beaſt, and his aſcent out of the
bottomleſs pit: The ſlaying of the Witneſſes, at the finiſhing of their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
or perioding of their Sack-cloth-Propheſying, and their lying Dead
in the ſtreets of the great City, ſpiritually called Sodom and Egypt: The
Witneſſes riſing and aſcending up into Heaven: The coming of the Wrath
of the Lamb: The ſight of Heaven opened, with the Temple and Ark
therein contained: The Harveſt and Vintage: The marriage of the
Lamb: The coming down of the new Jeruſalem out of Heaven; to be as
a Tabernacle of God amongst men on Earth, all the Kingdoms of this
World becoming the Kingdoms of the Lord and his Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Charge given <hi>John,</hi> by him that was dead and yet liveth for
evermore, the Amen, or everlaſting Truth of God <hi>(Rev.</hi> 1. 18, 19.)
was, to write; <hi>Firſt,</hi> The things which he had ſeen, in the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the fulneſs and excellency of Chriſt's Perſon, exhibited to
him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 17. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The things which are, or the ſtate of the
Church in his time, as it had for its chief places of abode, thoſe
principal Cities in <hi>Aſia,</hi> by name expreſſed, <hi>(chap.</hi> 2<hi>d. &amp;</hi> 3<hi>d.)</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Repreſentation in them, (as in Type and Figure)
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51760:48"/>
of the ſtate of the Univerſal Apoſtolick Chriſtian Church, which was
to continue under the ſeven diſtinctions of time, contained under the
<hi>ſeven Seals,</hi> under the laſt whereof, <hi>ſix</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> were (as
'twere) included. There was that alſo found in thoſe ſeven <hi>Aſiatick</hi>
Churches, that did typically repreſent the decreaſe and ſinking down
of a great Party in the viſible Chriſtian Church, into the Apoſtaſie
foretold in this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> until the very time of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> and laſtly, <hi>John</hi> was Commanded to write the things
which ſhall be hereafter, or which were to ſucceed that preſent ſtate
in which the then ſeven Churches were, at that time, reſpecting as
well the Corruption and Apoſtaſie, coming upon the face of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, as the continuance of it, with countenance and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from worldly Powers, till the ſounding of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet.</hi>
Theſe things that ſhall be hereafter, (when time ſhall be no longer,
or when the Myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, and all perſons and
things ſhall appear plainly and manifeſtly as they are) amount, in
general, to the Conſtitution and Concerns of that glorious ſtate
of the Church, which is to be from thenceforth, for evermore.</p>
                  <p>To proceed then to the Explicating of many of the chief Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Expreſſions in this Book of <hi>Revelations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. By <hi>the ſeven Churches in Aſia,</hi> let us underſtand, as in type,
the ſtate of the Chriſtian Church, characterized and deſcribed (as
<hi>Brightman</hi> intimates) under the diſtinct periods of time, held forth
by the things done, during the <hi>ſeven Seals,</hi> which reach to the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. By <hi>the Angels of the ſeven Churches</hi> are to be underſtood,
not only or principally, the Officers or Perſons miniſtring, but rather
the Light of the Goſpel in its diſtinct meaſures and degrees, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
according to the nature of the times and ſeaſons, which the
things done under the <hi>firſt ſix Seals,</hi> did occaſion. For upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
of that, there was cauſed a gradual and ſucceſſive removing
of each <hi>Candleſtick</hi> out of its place, and the Church ſinks down at
length into an univerſal Defection and Apoſtacy, as to the viſible
part of it. This renders it, in its concluding and final ſtate, ſo
naucious and loathſome to God, that he reſolves <hi>to ſpue them out of his
mouth, and reject them for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To confirm this, we find each Church to conſiſt of <hi>two</hi> very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſorts of Members; <hi>one,</hi> that are ſpiritual, prepared with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ſenſes, or eares to hear what the Spirit ſayes to the Churches:
the <hi>other,</hi> though they have the name and credit of Church-members,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51760:48"/>
yea, and in proceſs of time, the greateſt viſible Power and Sway in
it, ſaying they are <hi>Jews</hi> or right Heirs of Promiſe, yet are they not
ſo, but do lie. They are indeed of the Synagogue of Satan. They
came out from the ſpiritual and better part of the Church, as no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
able to joyn, and go along, or keep pace with them, in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Life and Converſation. Being ſenſual, and having not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
they ſeparate from the true ſpiritual worſhipper, ſeeking their
upholding and maintenance in this or that Form and Way, from the
Powers of the World. And having once got worldly Power and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſtrength and force on their ſide, they reſolved to perſecute
and make War upon the better and more ſpiritual part of the
Church, with earthly Weapons, and by compulſion of the Civil
Sword.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>The Throne in Heaven,</hi> deſcribed in the <hi>fourth Chapter,</hi>
is the Seat which God hath made for himſelf, in the Creature-being
of Chriſt the Mediator, as his own Sanctuary, from whence to iſſue
forth all his Authority and Power, decreed to be by him exerciſed,
whether in Heaven or on Earth, in the capacity of Head and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
King over all the works of God's hands. He that ſits on this
Throne, is the ſame that <hi>(chap.</hi> 19.) is cloathed with a Veſture
dipt in blood, and whoſe Name is called the WORD of God.
He is ſaid <hi>(chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.) to have <hi>ſeven horns,</hi> and <hi>ſeven eyes,</hi> which
are the ſeven Spirits of God, ſent forth into all the Earth; and this,
by his being made fleſh, and by his Death and Reſurrection, in
which he ſhewed himſelf the true Sanctuary, which God pitch'd, and
not man. This had been, in type, from the beginning, a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
high Throne <hi>(Jer.</hi> 17. 12.) deſigned from all Eternity to be
the Throne and the place of the ſoals of his feet, whoſe Name is the
WORD of God, in order to dwell in the midſt of the Children
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ever, and bear unto their ſight and enjoyment the clear
and compleat viſion of the inviſible God.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>The Book</hi> (chap. 5.) written within, and on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
<hi>ſealed with ſeven Seals,</hi> as it is part of the Viſion given to <hi>John,</hi>
is a deſcription of the inward and hidden meaning of the matter of
this Prophecy, whether as to that which more eſpecially concerns
the Affairs of the Church, or that which more generally relates to the
Affairs of the World and the Empire thereof. The <hi>ſeven Seals</hi> with
which it is ſealed on the back-ſide, do intimate the dark and myſtical
movings or diſpenſations of Gods Providence, that the ſeven-fold
diſtinction of time, under the <hi>ſeven Seals and Trumpets</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
as the method and way that Chriſt would take to open and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51760:49"/>
make known the inward writing, and to give ſo plain a Viſion of it,
<hi>that he that runs may read it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The matter of this Prophecy, as it peculiarly relates unto the
Church, contains in it the Church's progreſs and growth up in all
things into Chriſt her Head, according to the purpoſe of the Father,
which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus before the World was, and this,
in deſpite of all contradiction, or oppoſition, from the Serpent and
his Seed. In this reſpect it is, that <hi>(chap.</hi> 12.) the Man-child with
which the Woman was in Travel, comes at laſt to be born, and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on high, above the reach of Satan, as to any hurt that he could
do unto it. In the end, it becomes a Mountain, filling the whole
Earth.</p>
                  <p>As the matter of this Prophecy doth more generally relate unto the
World, that lies in the wicked one, and holds of the Serpent, as of
its univerſal Head and Ruler, it contains the wonderful workings
and contrivances of God's Providence, in favour of his Church, and
in rendring to every one according to their works, filling thoſe that
are of the World with the wayes of their own chuſing. By this
means, his worſt enemies are taught and made to acknowledge his
Juſtice and long-Suffering towards them, in and under all. His ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Counſels lead to the certain and final treading of all his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries under foot, and to the exalting of the horn of his Anointed, who
is both Lord and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>5. By <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> and the Altar, and them that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
therein, appointed to be meaſured, <hi>(chap.</hi> 11. 1.) is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the right Worſhip of God, as well with reſpect to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it, ſhining forth in the Perſon and Spirit of Chriſt, inwardly
known and converſed with, as with reſpect to the worſhippers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who are ſuch only as are qualified with ſpiritual ſenſes, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
them meet for ſuch Duty and Service, which they are called
to the performance of in their Spirits, and with their inward man.
But that which conſiſts in the outward and bodily exerciſe, deſcribed
by the <hi>outward Court,</hi> is given up, to be ſuppreſſed and troden under
foot by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for 1260 years, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>6. By <hi>the Holy City</hi> is meant <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of the great King
and Living God, the incorporated Society of Inhabitants or Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
that ſtand in relation to Chriſt, as his Subjects and Servants,
under the obligation of one or other Covenant, that is conditionally
or abſolutely. Thoſe that are his Subjects but in the conditional Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
are Citizens whoſe Names are only written in the Earth, who
(upon tryal and proof) do not remain ſo. Though they ſay they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51760:49"/>
are <hi>Jews,</hi> they are not, but do lie. Yea, they evidently diſcover
themſelves in the end, to be the very Synagogue of Satan. But
thoſe that are the Subjects of Chriſt, abſolutely, or in and by the
new and everlaſting Covenant, eſtabliſhed in all things and ſure,
they are ſuch Citizens, whoſe Names are written in Heaven, among
the living in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they become Pillars in the Houſe of
God, never to go out more, being found in a ſtate of Life and way
of converſe with, and worſhipping of God in Chriſt, wherein they
are ſecured from final Apoſtacy and Defection.</p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>Earthly Citizens,</hi> or the Inhabitants and Children of the
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on Earth, do prove at laſt to be as great enemies to their
King, as any among the heatheniſh and prophane World, when once
they revolt from his Scepter, disjoyn and ſeparate from the ſpiritual
and better part of the Citizens, whoſe Names are written in Heaven,
or in the Lamb's Book of new-creature Life, in a character that is
indeleble, and by vertue of that Covenant which cannot be broken.
And their great Deſign (when once actually ſeparated from the true
ſpiritual Worſhippers) is, by the calling in of ſtrength and aid from
the prophane World, to tread under the holy City, even the very
Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo to keep it under, that it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to have any Credit, Authority, or Power in the
World.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Citizens and Inhabitants of the Heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<hi>(chap.</hi> 7.) by thoſe <hi>that are ſealed with the Seal of the Living
God,</hi> and are either a Company certain, and numbred, making up the
144000 there mentioned; or elſe, a Company and Society of <hi>ſealed
ones,</hi> that in compariſon of the former are numberleſs, and of a more
large and univerſal extent, called (by way of diſtinction) <hi>Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of theſe <hi>ſealed ones</hi> do anſwer to the 24 Courſes of the
<hi>Levites</hi> of old, who were given unto God, inſtead of the firſt-born<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They ſtand in a peculiar relation to, and dependance upon the great
High Prieſt, as their Head, and do properly conſtitute and make up
that Aſſembly of the firſt-born, whoſe Names are written in Heaven.
Theſe are a Kingdom of Prieſts, repreſented before the Throne, by
the four and twenty Elders.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort of theſe <hi>Citizens and ſealed ones,</hi> do anſwer to the
whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> diſtributed into their four parts and
ſtations, round about the Ark, at a greater diſtance from the Throne,
a Kingdom of common Subjects, and leſs priviledg'd Children than
the former. Yet, theſe latter ſort of men ſhall be recounted as well
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51760:50"/>
as the former, to have been born in her, whom the Moſt High doth
eſtabliſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 5.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. there is notice taken of <hi>high or noble men,</hi> and <hi>of
low or common men.</hi> Theſe two Orders are eminently found in a ſtate
of perpetuity and continuancy, in Chriſt's own Kingdom. Both of
them have their original and foundation in the Manhead of Chriſt,
who is one manner of man, as <hi>he bears the form of a Servant, like unto
us</hi> earthly men, <hi>in all things, ſin only excepted.</hi> In this capacity he is
conſtituted King over the whole Earth. But he is another manner
of man, as he is called and made an High Prieſt after the Order of
<hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> without Father, without Mother, without Pedigree or
Deſcent, having neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life. It is
therefore ſaid of him in this ſecond ſenſe, <hi>Conſider how great this man
is, unto whom even the Patriarch</hi> Abraham <hi>gave the tenth of his ſpoyls.</hi>
And again, the ſame Apoſtle <hi>(Heb.</hi> 5. 11.) teſtifies, <hi>that of him he
had many things to ſay, that were hard to be uttered, ſeeing they were dull
of hearing,</hi> and ſlow to diſcern the diſtinction of that excellency and
perfection which ſhines forth in Chriſt's own humane nature, in the
twofold reſpect which we have mentioned.</p>
                  <p>8. By <hi>the Two Witneſſes</hi> then, we are hereby taught to underſtand
thoſe <hi>two ſorts of Citizens,</hi> or <hi>Inhabitants of the Heavenly Jeruſalem;</hi> the
word of whoſe Teſtimony is, according to this their twofold and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
birth, which makes them Kings or Prieſts with Chriſt, or both;
that is, joynt or co-heirs with Chriſt, in the dignity and perfection of
his Manhead, in one or both of theſe Conſiderations of it. This is
intimated, <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 43. 10.) <hi>Ye are my Witneſſes, ſaith the Lord, and my
Servant</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>whom I have choſen; that ye may know and believe
me,</hi> or be one in Judgment and Will with me, <hi>and underſtand that I
am he. Before me there was no God formed, nor ſhall be after me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And they are called <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> not only becauſe they know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, and are one in Spirit with him, as he is a glorified earthly
man, and a man alſo that is <hi>Michael,</hi> God's fellow; but as they Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
in Sack-cloth, or in a ſuffering ſtate, not loving their lives
unto the death, rather then ceaſe to be Witneſſes and to bear their
teſtimony to the Truth, when called thereunto, under the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of ſinners.</p>
                  <p>9. By <hi>the Woman</hi> (chap. 12.) <hi>clothed with the Sun, &amp;c.</hi> who being
with Child, cried, travelling in birth with a Man-child, and pained
to be delivered, is meant the true <hi>Sarah,</hi> or ſpiritual Womb of
Chriſt's dead body, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 7. 4.) which lawfully diſcharges us from
the Covenant of the Law, or obligation to act ſingly by the activity
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51760:50"/>
it gives, <hi>that we ſhould be married to another, even to him who is raiſed
from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit unto God,</hi> as quicken'd into
a life and activity much more excellent. There is therefore ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eyes of our Faith, the Law of the Spirit of Life that is in-Chriſt
Jeſus, riſen from the dead, for us hence-forward to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and live unto, as that birth of manly perfection, which ſhines
forth in him, who was crucified indeed in weakneſs, but was raiſed in
power, or a man of Power, in whoſe hands all Power in Heaven and
Earth is intruſted. And thoſe who become one, in conjunction of
Spirit with him, by the new and everlaſting Covenant, are with him
caught up to the Throne of God, in the one or other capacity (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
intimated) of the two ſorts of Citizens, that by the new birth
are members of the <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the remnant of the
Womans Seed, that keep the Commandments of God, and have the
Teſtimony of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>The great Conteſt and Battel which happened between the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi>
on the one part, (comprehended under the name of <hi>Michael
and his Angels)</hi> and the <hi>Serpent and his brood</hi> on the other, was, as
the one were Friends, and the other Enemies, to the Croſs and Death
of Chriſt, and as the Judgment, Opinions, and Practiſes of the one
or other made void, or elſe eſtabliſhed and advanced the Myſtery and
Efficacy of the Croſs and the Law of it, which thoſe that obſerve
and follow, <hi>peace will be upon them, as on all the Iſrael of God.</hi> In this
Quarrel the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> do fight under the protection and bleſſing of
<hi>Michael,</hi> their Head; as the other do under the ſupport and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of the <hi>Old Dragon,</hi> their Head.</p>
                  <p>10. By the <hi>Old Dragon</hi> we are to underſtand the Spirit that rules
in the Children of diſobedience, who is (for the preſent) Head and
chief Ruler over the World, as managing the univerſal Scepter
thereof, by Chriſt's permiſſion. The Enſigns and Characters of this
Empire (according to Scripture phraſe) is <hi>ſeven heads and ten horns,</hi>
intimating the nature, as well as perfection and univerſality of that
worldly Power, which is exerciſed by the <hi>Old Dragon,</hi> in waging war
againſt the <hi>Woman and her Seed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This War he is capable to manage, either as</hi> an Angel of Light, and
a falſe Prophet in the Church; <hi>or as an</hi> univerſal Monarch and Governor
in the World.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Capacity, as this <hi>Dragon</hi> transforms himſelf into an
<hi>Angel of Light,</hi> and Miniſter of Righteouſneſs, he works with all
Power, Signs, and lying Wonders. As <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in their Commiſſion, ſo do the Serpent's Seed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51760:51"/>
in Sheep's clothing and Chriſt's own likeneſs, reſiſt the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in
their Teſtimony, and oppoſe the Inhabitants of the <hi>Heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
by pretending a greater Friendſhip to Chriſt, and conformity
to his written Law, in all their words and actions, than the true
Seed of the Woman, having indeed the form of Godlineſs, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Power and Spirit thereof. After this manner did the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
and his <hi>Angels,</hi> in the Primitive Church, fight with <hi>Michael</hi> and
his <hi>Angels,</hi> to prevent the birth of the Man-child, and to keep up
the Credit and Authority of the Law, and their following after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
in the Principles, and upon the terms of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
in oppoſition to the Miniſtry of the Spirit, according to the
Promiſe and Tenor of the new and everlaſting Covenant. This
battel continued, in the Primitive Church, about four hundred years,
and came at laſt to this iſſue; Satan was caſt down out of Heaven,
upon an evident diſcovery of his deceitful workings and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
in the Teachings and Inſpirations which came out of his
mouth, as a falſe Spirit and Prophet, ſo that he was not able, ſingly
this way, to bear up any longer againſt the Power and Demonſtration
of the Spirit of Truth, in the mouth of the Saints, but found himſelf
neceſſitated to reſort to his earthly and worldly Weapons, the Power
of the Civil Sword, that ſo joyning both his Intereſts together, that
of the Magiſtrate and falſe Prophet, he might grow up into ſuch a
formidible poſture, as is mentioned, <hi>(Chap.</hi> 13. 4.) where it is
ſaid, <hi>Who is like unto the BEAST, or able to make War with
him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This poſture the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> beheld the <hi>Dragon</hi> putting himſelf
into, when the <hi>ſeven-headed and ten-horned Beaſt</hi> aroſe out of the Sea,
and the <hi>two-horned Beaſt</hi> out of the Earth. Both of theſe together
do become the Seat or Throne, to which the <hi>Dragon</hi> gave up his
Power and Authority. The firſt of theſe two Beaſts receives him, as
the old, unclean, prophane, heatheniſh Spirit; they that are meant
by that Beaſt, are ſtill the ſame in Principles, as before, only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
baptized into the name of the Chriſtian Profeſſion or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when Chriſtian Religion became the Religion of the Roman
Empire. Thus was that Beaſt healed of its former Wound, when
<hi>Paganiſm</hi> was deſtroyed and pull'd down.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the bare name of Chriſtian Religion, or out-ſide
Profeſſion thereof, without ſomething of real Reformation and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of inward Principles, was not of credit or authority enough, to
advance Antichriſt's Kingdom, therefore the Miniſtry of the Law or
firſt Covenant (even the knowledge of Chriſt according to the fleſh,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51760:51"/>
as it is capable to ſerve the Serpents Seed for a cover and vail of their
enmity againſt the Croſs of Chriſt, and Power of his Reſurrection)
doth ſpring up over the head (as it were) of the firſt Beaſt. This
ſecond Beaſt, or branch of Antichriſt's Subjects and Kingdom, with
two horns, like the Lamb, but ſpeaking as the Dragon, chuſes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to joyn Intereſt with the firſt Beaſt, than to ſuffer the Citizens
of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to come out of their Wilderneſs-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yet this earth or miry clay, cannot (when all's done) cleave
heartily and thorowly to the heatheniſh prophane Spirit of the firſt
Beaſt, but at laſt is preyed upon by it. This Earthly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
ſurprized, and overflowed as with a flood, by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Intereſt it ventured to call to its aſſiſtance againſt the true
Seed of the Woman, in which reſpect it is ſaid that the Earth helps
the Woman, the wrath of the prophane party of Antichriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or of the ten-horned Beaſt, being chiefly ſpent and poured
out upon that Profeſſing Party that make up the ſecond, or two-horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>11. By <hi>the Inhabitants of the Heavens, of the Earth, and of the
Sea, (chap.</hi> 12. 12.) are meant, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Citizens of the heavenly
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who are under Grace; <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Citizens of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who are under the dominion and curſe of the Law; And
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> The prophane Party who live under ſin, moving therein, as
in their Element, paſt feeling, by reaſon of the blindneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their hearts. This ſtate of Sin is nevertheleſs not unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
nor thoſe that are Captives under it, in a condition irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
for Chriſt died to redeem men out of it.</p>
                  <p>12. By <hi>the ſeven-headed and ten-horned Beaſt,</hi> ariſing out of the
Sea, is to be underſtood the Empire, or Governing Power of the
World, in whoſe hands ſoever it be found, as it is made the Seat and
Throne of Satan, and promotes the Intereſt of the Devils Kingdom
in corruption of manners, and prophaneſs, even by the countenance
of humane Laws, or at leaſt in the execution of them.</p>
                  <p>13. By <hi>the two-horned Beaſt,</hi> ariſing out of the Earth, we are to
underſtand the Uſurpation of the Prophetical Office of Chriſt, by a
falſe Spirit, or the ſaid Office as deceitfully executed in a private
Spirit of ſelf-byaſſed Reaſon, in disjunction from the Spirit of the
true Head, undertaking to counſel and lead men in the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the written Word, or other evident ſignification of God's
Will. This, once joyned with worldly Government and Power,
(made its vaſſal and ridden by it) is that Spirit and Principle for
promoting of worldly Religion, which is founded in, and ſupported
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51760:52"/>
by humane Laws, under the Name and Form of Chriſtianity. The
two-horned Beaſt and the falſe Prophet are therefore the ſame, as by
comparing <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>of chap.</hi> 19. is moſt clear.
And the ten-horned Beaſt is wont alſo to be called the Image of the
Beaſt; where ever therefore the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
together, (as they are, three times) there by the name of
the Beaſt is meant no other but the ten-horned Beaſt; as by the falſe
Prophet, the two-horn'd. Contrarily; where, with the Beaſt we
find coupled the Image of the Beaſt, (as <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.
<hi>chap.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp; chap.</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.)
there, by Beaſt is to be underſtood the falſe Prophet; and by his
Image, the ſeven-headed and ten-horn'd Beaſt, as reſtored. For
this Beaſt, ſeeing he acknowledgeth the falſe Prophet as his Reſtorer,
and ſuffereth himſelf to be guided by him, as his ſupream Lord,
<hi>(chap.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 14, 15.) he is (not without cauſe) called his Image,
not as repreſenting or bearing the ſimilitude of the two-horn'd Beaſt,
but he is the Image which the two-horn'd Beaſt, ſpeaking like the
Dragon, did reſtore, and which he challengeth for his own. To juſtifie
this; that very Image of the Beaſt, which the falſe Prophet did give
life unto, did cauſe that whoſoever would not worſhip the Image of
the Beaſt, ſhould be ſlain. To conclude, of the ſelf-ſame is the
Image of the Beaſt, and the Name or Number ſaid to be, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. 2.
The Name and Number ſeem not to be called the Name and Number
of any other Beaſt, than of the two-horn'd, as of the principal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Lord.</p>
                  <p>14. The <hi>Number of the Name of the Beaſt,</hi> being ſaid to be the
Number of a man, ſignifies that it is the ſenſual part of man's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Reaſon, become deviliſh, by joyning in combination with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
in his revolt from his true Head, and in exerciſing enmity againſt
all Righteouſneſs, upon one account or other.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>ſenſual part of man's Wiſdom</hi> ſavours and minds Earthly or ſeen
things, and delights in corporeal fleſhly objects, whether actually
corrupt, or only corruptible. This is the Wiſdom that is prevalent
with the generality of men in the World, according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of which, the Empire and Government of the World is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
and the judgment and interpretation of the very Law and
Word of God is made, for the Rule in matters of Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
This Wiſdom is in its beſt eſtate, unſtable and unfixed, ſo as
from the top and height of its honour, there is ſuddenly a being made
like the Beaſt that periſhes, and ſo a falling ſhort of the true Reſt.
This was the caſe of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who was created on the <hi>ſixt day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:51760:52"/>
and whoſe unſtable perfection is therefore numbered by <hi>ſix,</hi> thrice
repeated.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>ſenſual part of man's Wiſdom,</hi> is the executing or performing
Power of the Soul, in reference to the dictates and enlightnings that
declare themſelves in the intellectual and angelical part of the mind,
which many times ſerves and approves the Law of God, whilſt the
ſenſual part ſerves and obeyes ſin, and as with a Law of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from the Members, oppoſes and reſiſts the good and right Rule
which ſhines forth in man's intellect, and which we call ſound or
right Reaſon. But as this ſenſual part, in its movings and actings,
holds agreement and is in conjunction with the intellectual part, as
its Ruler and Guide, following the dictates thereof; ſo far the actings
thereof are ſound and right, holding conformity to the Law of God.
Thus even the ſenſual part (as ſubject to the right dictates of the
intellectual) is it ſelf a Rule unto humane action, and is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
and foundation of righteous Magiſtratical Government amongſt
men. Now when this Principle in Magiſtrates, ceaſes to be any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
found in a ſtate of down-right <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and comes to be healed
and reſtored out of darkneſs and prophaneſs, by receiving of the
Scriptures or written Word of God, (opened and interpreted by ſuch
as pretend to be commiſſioned and gifted for that purpoſe) unto which
it owes its healing and reſtoration, it doth by way of acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
receive and ſet up that prophetical Office, in an adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
countenanced by humane Laws and the Magiſtrates Power.
Where-ever this kind of Magiſtracy is, in both the branches of it,
both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, (ſetting up for themſelves and their
own Intereſts, in their own wills, in disjunction from Chriſt and
his Spirit, the true Head, and in oppoſition to the Remnant of the
Womans Seed, and their teſtimony in word and action) there is the
Kingdom and Seat of the Beaſt and Antichriſt, leading the People
over whom it is exerciſed, into ſervitude both of Soul and Body.
This is that Principle and Power, that after the limited time of 1260
years, muſt fall and be taken out of the way.</p>
                  <p>15. By <hi>the Witneſſes Propheſying in Sack-cloth,</hi> are meant the true
Circumciſion in Spirit, who Worſhip God in Chriſt Jeſus, and live
in a through-reſignedneſs of mind to him that is riſen from the dead,
who is the Spirit of Truth which is given them by the Father to be
their guide, of whom and of whoſe Teſtimony they are not aſhamed,
what ever diſgrace it be in, or however rejected by the Government
under which the Providence of God hath placed them. They do
therefore own it as their Principle, and make it their practice, to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51760:53"/>
bear and ſuffer under ſuch worldly Powers and Governments, in
Faith and Patience, whatever befals them for their Teſtimony's ſake,
without attempting to reſiſt the Powers that are, to diſturb their
peace or give them any juſt cauſe of offence.</p>
                  <p>They are called <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> becauſe of the word of their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which they forbear not to give in the worſt and moſt ſuffering
times, whatever it coſt them. And they are <hi>Two,</hi> deſcribed by two
Candleſticks, or Societies of Believers, and two Olive Trees or Sons
of Oyl, becauſe through Faith they are the receivers of the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which comes from the Holy One, and is Truth and no Lie. This
Anointing proportions it ſelf in its Gift, either according to the
meaſure it finds the Nature of man capable to take in and poſſeſs,
without any new addition of a diſtinct, ſuperiour capacity and recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
or elſe gives forth its ſelf in a vaſt and boundleſs communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein it is capable to flow forth into man, and to form in him
an anſwerable Reception thereunto, (beyond and above that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and meaſure of knowledge and diſcerning, which is proper to
man in his firſt make or building) to the extending and enlarging the
intellectual part of man's Being, into a more abundant fruition of
God, in a ſuperiority to that of Angels, even to a joynt inheriting,
ſeeing, and enjoying of God with the exalted humane Nature of the
Son of God, in that Name which he obtains above Angels, and
wherein he is more excellent than they. At this more excellent
Name of Chriſt, as it originally ſhines forth in Chriſt's own Perſon,
every knee muſt bow, and every tongue confeſs, to the glory of God
the Father.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two ſorts of Saints are in moſt intimate Union and inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
conjunction with the Lord that Spirit, who is the Son of man
glorified or juſtified in Spirit, and who hath the gift of the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in both the reſpects before-mentioned. The one ſort of theſe
Saints as well as the other, do with open face behold (as in a glaſs)
the Glory of the Lord, whether that, wherein he is perfect man, or
that wherein he is more than man, the man that is God's Fellow and
Equal, and ſo Superiour and Head to Angels, Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
aſcended far above all Heavens. And they are changed into
the ſame Image, reſpectively, whether of the one Glory or of the
other, by the Spirit of the Lord, or the Lord the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Two Witneſſes</hi> do live and abide in their Principles and word
of their Teſtimony, when their perſons die, and they have put off
their earthly Tabernacle. For the Witneſſing-work is carried on in
a ſucceſſion of new Witneſſes, brought upon the ſtage of this World,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51760:53"/>
one Generation after another, during the time declared of 1260
years, whilſt they are appointed to propheſie in Sack-cloth. And
when that ſuffering ſeaſon of theirs ſhall have an end put to it, (as
it muſt) the like two Companies and Societies of Saints (ſpirited
with the ſame Principles, that theſe ſackcloth or ſuffering Prophets
are of, both of them making but one Church and Houſe of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God) ſhall be quicken'd and rais'd up in Power, by ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
wrought in and upon their bodies (even here, in this life)
from the bondage of Corruption, as is called the <hi>Adoption</hi> of the
body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. This Adoption or Redemption of the body, on
this ſide the Reſurrection, will hold proportion very much, with
Chriſt's Transfiguration. This ſtate of the body is prophetically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. where we are given to underſtand that the bodies
of the Saints, or of thoſe that are wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs
of the Firmament, and their Spirits as the Stars for ever and ever.
For into ſuch an intimate relation and conjunction, will Chriſt, as he
is the Head of Angels, take and adopt the Spirits of Angels, and men
regenerated, with himſelf, and with one another, as by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on the Spirits of Saints, and by his and the influence of their
own Spirits on their bodily or ſenſual part, to reduce their bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo near a relation to, and conjunction with the Life of their Spirits,
and Chriſt in Spirit, as will raiſe and advance them into a heavenly
frame, and render them meet for ſo great a glory of Spirit, or emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
exerciſe of ſpiritual Life and Power. This will be a glory of
the body, not before known, as a common and general diſpenſation,
ſince the World began, nor yet hardly ſo eminently experienced even
by thoſe few choice Types and Shadowes of it, <hi>Enoch, Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Elias,</hi> or others. This is that ſtate of body, or of the very outward-man
and ſenſual part of the Saint, whereby Chriſt will be glorified in his
Saints, and admired in all thoſe that do believe.</p>

                     <salute>My Dear Heart,</salute>

                  <p>THe Wind yet continuing contrary, makes me deſirous to be as
much in Converſe with thee (having this opportunity) as
the Providence of God will permit; hoping theſe will come
ſafe to your hand. It is no ſmall Satisfaction to me in theſe ſharp
Tryals, to experience the Truth of thoſe Chriſtian Principles, which
God of his Grace hath afforded you and me, in our meaſures, the
knowledge, and emboldned us to make the profeſſion of. For ſurely
by this Fiery Tryal, which is from God appointed to try us, no
ſtrange or unuſual Diſpenſation of God hath happened to us, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from that which all his Servants and Prophets from the beginning
of the World to this day, have found alſo to be their Lot: Nor is it
other, than the Condition (as I may ſay) and Law, that all thoſe
muſt come under and ſubmit unto, that will approve themſelves
Chriſt's Diſciples indeed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 26, 27. And it is no ſmall Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that the greateſt Extremities we have already under-gone, and
which do as yet threaten, have found that ſtrength and rooting of the
Grace and Love of Chriſt in our Hearts, which cauſes us not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of being made more than Conquerors in the end, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
thoſe Conditions of peace, <hi>(verſ.</hi> 32.) which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with our being ſuch Diſciples of Chriſt, as will cheerfully
(when called to it) forſake all they have, in love to him, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to his Will.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould Chriſt ask us, <hi>Whether we be able to drink of the Cup he
drank of, and be baptized with the Baptiſm he was baptized with?</hi>
Was it not, to intimate, <hi>That if we die with him, we ſhall alſo live with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51760:54"/>
him; if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him,</hi> and have it granted to
us <hi>to ſit down with him, on the Throne of his Glory, our very Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding?</hi>
What would it be leſs, even in this world, if he ſhould
but pleaſe to cauſe, upon this occaſion of our Suffering, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, and of Glory, ſhould reſt upon us, and bring forth his
Kingdom within us, in Power, giving us that Mouth and Wiſdom
that will make us mighty in word and deed; that Faith, to which all
things are poſſible; that Spirit of Supplication and Prayer, that he
will alwayes hear and immediately anſwer? God's Arm is not
ſhortned; doubteſs, great and precious Promiſes are yet in ſtore, to
be accompliſhed in and upon Believers here on Earth, to the making
of Chriſt to be admired in them. If we come not to live here, in
the actual fruition and full accompliſhment of them, (as they will
be experienced by Believers, even on this ſide the death, or full
change of their mortal body) yet if we die in the certain fore-ſight
and embracing of them by Faith, this will be no ſmall bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>This dark night and black ſhade, which God hath drawn over his
Work in the midſt of us, may be (for ought we know) the ground-colour
to ſome beautiful piece, that he is expoſing to the Light. His
Sons muſt be manifeſted and evidently diſtinguiſhed from thoſe, who
ſay they are ſuch and are not. There is a glory to be revealed in them,
unto which their Suffering is made the needful Preparation; and this
is called the Redemption of the body. In that day, the tabernacling
of God in men ſhall be viſible. Their very bodies ſhall be the
Temple of the Holy Ghoſt. In them, as his Sanctuary, will God
dwell for evermore, whence ſhall be given forth ſuch viſible ſigns of
his extraordinary Preſence, as ſhall render it paſt diſpute, to the
ſight of every man, that God is in them and with them of a Truth.</p>
                  <p>This ſtate of entire reſignedneſs and ſubjection of our bodies to our
Spirits, and of our Spirits unto Chriſt, the Father of them, ſhall
certainly be brought to the view of the whole World. The eyes of
thoſe that ſee them, ſhall acknowledge them; and the ears that hear
them, ſhall bear witneſs to them, that they are the Seed and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
which the Lord hath bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Our body, thus conſidered, as capable of ſuch advance and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
is not meerly the outward caſe or ſhell, that muſt return to
duſt, but includes alſo the bodily, organical ſtate of Life, or that
ſouly, animal Life, which the Spirit of man exerciſes in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with his mortal body. In this kind of Life it is, we ſee, hear,
and ſpeak, have the exerciſe of our Senſes, after a diſtinct manner
from Angels and intellectual Subſtances, in a way of operation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51760:55"/>
to theirs, proper and peculiar to the rational Soul, as needing
and uſing the earthly Organs or Inſtruments of the mortal body.
There is alſo in man, that which is peculiarly called <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi>
in diſtinction from his Soul, or from the ſouly Life and activity of
the ſame Spirit, in and by its earthly body, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 23. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
or Mind of man, (as diſtinguiſhed from that life and operation
it performs in the mortal body, is capable, even while in the body,
to be awakened by the Father of Spirits, and come forth in a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
way, even of natural life, received by man in his firſt creation,
to act as out of the body, or without the uſe of bodily organs, as an
equal or aſſociate to the very Angels. Now becauſe the bodily and
inferiour powers of our mind, are the inſtruments of that converſe
we are ſubjected to in theſe dayes of our vanity, ſo that if we will be
ſociable, it muſt be by the uſe thereof, the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
all the action of theſe inferiour powers by the ſenſible organs
we make uſe of in the exerciſe thereof, under the name of the tongue,
when he ſaith, <hi>If any man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man,
and able to bridle the whole body.</hi> To bridle and regulate the tongue,
order all the language, action, and expreſſion of the animal powers
aright, is to bridle the whole body, under the government or ruling
authority of the Mind or Spirit, conſidered in its ſuperiour and
angelical kind of life and acting, as out of the body, or above and
without the uſe of bodily organs. The Mind or Spirit of man thus
conſidered, is as the Pilot that turns the Ship about, whitherſoever
he liſteth. If it well and truly exerciſe its governing power, it
cauſes the animal life in all the operations and affections thereof, to
obey its dictates and commands, however fiercely driven by contrary
Winds, falſe Doctrine, any corrupting violent influences of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
or men upon it, and fetches it off from whatever tumultuous
diſorder, its own ſenſual luſts and paſſions are ready to run it into,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 2, 5.</p>
                  <p>To be partaker of the Redemption of the body, is to be made this
perfect man, which is taught ſo to live and act, from right, ſpiritual
Principles, as not to offend in word, through the Power actually
conferred on him and exerciſed by him, for the bridling of the whole
body, in the ſence above declared, and for the keeping it in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Spirit or angelical part in him, in righteouſneſs and true
holineſs.</p>
                  <p>This taming of the tongue, or ſubduing of the bodily part in us to
the ſpiritual and intellectual, is a work of no ſmall difficulty, a thing
that is not to be purchaſed but at a dear rate. It may coſt us all that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51760:55"/>
we have, and no ill bargain neither, ſince by our words it is that we
ſhall be juſtified, and by our words we ſhall be condemned. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
we have brought under our body, and reduced it into a fixed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and entire reſignation to our Spirits, let us boaſt never ſo
much, that which is perfect is not yet come; even that perfection
which in a very eminent degree ſhall be experienced by the Saints
here on Earth, on this ſide the grave, and during their continuance
in the mortal body. This, for ought I can diſcern, will be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the preſent ſharp and fiery Tryals, that God hath brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his People all the World over. After they have ſuffered a while,
and the ſame Afflictions have been accompliſhed in the reſt of their
Brethren that are in the World, they may ſo far have the work of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
perfected in them, as, in this ſenſe, to become perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
wanting nothing, and to ſhine forth as ſo many bright morning
ſtars, and fore-running ſigns of the near approach of the brightneſs
of the Day of Chriſt's ſecond coming. This God hath ſet before
the eye of my Faith, as the mark for the price of the high Calling of
God in Chriſt Jeſus. This is that perfection, which by conformity
with Chriſt in his Death, and fellowſhip with him in his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is in a moſt eminent degree attainable, before our diſſolution
and the putting off our earthly Tabernacle. It ſhall be ſo far attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Power and Glory of Chriſt, that is to be revealed in us,
that it ſhall not much fall ſhort of a very Transfiguration. And the
ſtate of the then glorious Church will be no leſs than an Heaven upon
Earth, in the new Heavens and new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.
This glorious ſtate of things we look for, and therefore
are or ought to be haſting a-pace, unto the coming of that Day of
God.</p>
                  <p>Yet, when I ſay, until we experience this kind of perfection in
Power in us, that which is perfect is not yet come, my meaning is
not, that the incorruptible Seed and Principles of this very perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are not already ſeated and rooted in the inward man and in the
Spirit of the Mind, ſo ſoon as we are regenerated, and that Chriſt is
formed in us, dwelling in our hearts by Faith. Thus it is, that we
are all glorious within. Thus the Kingdom of Heaven is within us,
liken'd to the hidden Treaſure, which when a man hath found in the
field, he keeps it concealed, till he hath ſold all that he hath, and
bought that field. Faith, which is the ſubſtance of things hoped for,
and the evidence of that Glory which doth not yet appear, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly
expreſſed, when it is called <hi>a light ſhining in a dark place,</hi> that
is, in our bodily and ſenſual part, which continues ſo for a long time
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51760:56"/>
after our new birth. But thoſe that are all glorious within, muſt have
their time of manifeſtation, and be made all glorious without alſo.
The outward-man of the heart, and the <hi>outward Court</hi> of the Temple,
muſt come to be meaſured, and be of account and eſtimation, in the
ſight of the World. Then the whole body ſhall be full of light, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no part dark, as when the bright ſhining of a Candle doth give
thee light.</p>
                  <p>This is the Perfection which is near us, even at the very door,
ready to be teſtified and witneſſed unto, after another manner than
thoſe do pretend to, who are for the ſubjecting and keeping under the
body, but by thoſe mutable and wavering Principles of Perfection,
which amounts but to that viſibility of Saintſhip, which is the ſubject
of Apoſtacy, yet hath hitherto paſſed for currant Coin. Nor would I
have it thought, that I have already attained the powerful practice of
this holy Duty and Perfection, but it is much in my deſire, aim, and
hope. The difficult Circumſtances I am in, and that I am ſtill more
and more every day caſt into, by God's wiſe-diſpoſing Providence,
to the ſequeſtring me from the World, and with-holding all ſenſible
Comforts from me, ſo much as he doth, make me, in ſome ſort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
it is for a good end, and that out of love and faithfulneſs I
am made to drink of this bitter Cup, the better to help forward this
neceſſary work in me, and upon me, wherein conſiſts the glorious
Liberty of the Sons of God. If I may have and enjoy this, it would
ſeem a very little matter to me to be in outward bonds, baniſhment,
want, or any other afflictions. Help me then (in all your ſolicitudes
and cares about me) to what will further and advance this Work in
me.</p>
                  <p>The Lord grant me and mine to be content, if he deny us to live
of our own, and will bring us to the daily bread of his finding, which
he will have us wait for, freſh and freſh from his own Table, without
knowing any thing of it before-hand. Peradventure there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſweetneſs and bleſſing in ſuch a condition, than we can imagine,
till we have tryed it. This may add to my help, even our making
little haſte to get out of our Troubles, patiently waiting till God's
time come, wherein he will open the Priſon doors, either by Death,
or ſome other way, as he pleaſe, for the magnifying his own great
Name, not ſuffering us to be our own chuſers in any thing, as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hath been his way with us.</p>
                  <p>And why ſhould ſuch a taking up Sanctuary in God, and deſiring
to continue a Pilgrim and ſolitary in this World, whilſt I am in it,
afford ſtill matter of jealouſie, diſtruſt and rage, as I ſee it doth, to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51760:56"/>
thoſe who are unwilling that I ſhould be buried and lie quiet in my
grave, where I now am. They that preſs ſo earneſtly to carry on my
Tryal, do little know what preſence of God may be afforded me in it
and iſſue out of it, to the magnifying of Chriſt in my body, by Life
or by Death. Nor can they (I am ſure) imagine how much I deſire
to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, which of all things that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
me, I account beſt of all. And till then, I deſire to be made
faithful in my place and ſtation, to make confeſſion of him before
men and not deny his Name, if called forth to give a publick Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Witneſs concerning him, and to be herein nothing terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
What then will the hurt be, that I can or ſhall receive by the
worſt that man can do unto me, who can but kill the body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
open my Priſon door, that I may aſcend into the pleaſures that
are at Chriſt's right hand, prepared for thoſe that teſtifie and openly
diſcover their love to him, by not loving their lives unto the death.
Surely this will prove better, than to prefer ſin or evil (ſo much as
in appearance) unto Affliction and the Croſs, which Chriſt would
have me take up daily and follow him in.</p>
                  <p>If the Storm againſt us grow ſtill higher and higher, ſo as to ſtrip
us of all we have, the Earth is ſtill the Lords and the fulneſs thereof;
he hath a good ſtore-houſe for us to live upon. There is nothing
more deſtructive to us every way then the uncertainty we are in.</p>
                  <p>God can, and (if he think fit) will chalk out ſome way, wherein
he may appear by his Providence to chooſe for us, and not leave us
to our own choice. And being contracted into that ſmall compaſs,
which he ſhall think fit to reduce us unto, we may perhaps meet with
as true inward contentement, and ſee as great a mercy in ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration
from the World, as if we were in the greateſt outward
proſperity.</p>
                  <p>I know nothing that remains unto us, but like a toſſed Ship in a
ſtorm, to let our ſelves be toſſed and driven with the Winds, till he
that can make theſe ſtorms to ceaſe, and bring us into a ſafe Haven,
do work out our deliverance for us. I doubt not but you will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
endeavour to prepare for the worſt.</p>
