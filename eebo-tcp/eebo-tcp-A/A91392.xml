         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Controverſie about Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie
by reaſon of many miſtakes of
either ſide much time hath beene
ſpent to little purpoſe, and the right
and truth is yet as farre imbosked,
and buried in darkneſſe as ever it
was. Me thinks, the caſe is, as if two well imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd
Armies had marched forth for a mutuall
encounter, but both not taking the ſame way, there
never was yet any meeting in any one certain place,
where this great ſtrife might bee decided. Theſe
miſtakes and miſadventures on both ſides, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
have happened for want of an exact, and
adequate definition of Epiſcopacie firſt ſet downe,
and agreed upon by both, and then by both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purſued. It ſhall be therefore my care at this
time to begin with a definition of Epiſcopacy, and
that ſuch a one, as I ſhall take out of Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi>
one of the greateſt aſſerters, and in that the nobleſt,
of Epiſcopacy: and that which hee indevours to
maintaine as being of Divine right, I according to
my power ſhall indeavour to diſprove.</p>
            <p>The firſt definition given by the ſame Biſhop is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157098:3"/>
this; <hi>Epiſcopacy is an holy Order of Church-government,
for the adminiſtration of the Church.</hi> This definition I
hold to be too large, and unadequate for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
of this doubt, for <hi>Calvins</hi> diſcipline may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this definition be called Epiſcopacy, and
it may be affirmed that Epiſcopacie has bin in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
ſince God had never yet any Church, wherein
was not ſome holy Order of Church diſcipline for
better ruling of the ſame. And by the way, I muſt
here profeſſe to ſhake off, and neglect the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or anſwering of any thing which the Patrons of
Epiſcopacie have alledged, and ſtuft their volumes
withall, in defence of Order, and diſparity in the
Church; for let our Adverſaries be never ſo clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in this point, yet it is manifeſt, that no Church
was ever yet ſo barbarous as to plead for anarchy,
or a meere equalitie, neither did <hi>Calvin</hi> ever favour
any ſuch parity as was inconſiſtent with Order and
government, neither do we ſee any ſuch confuſion
introduced into <hi>Geneva</hi> it ſelfe, as our Hierarchiſts
ſeem to gainſay. To let paſſe all impertinent vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
our diſpute muſt be not whether Church poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
be neceſſary, or no; but whether that Church po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
which is now exerciſed in <hi>England</hi> be neceſſary,
&amp; unalterable, or no. And not whether ſuch parity
as is the mother of Confuſion be politique, or no;
but whether ſuch parity as now is at <hi>Geneva</hi> amongſt
presbyters be politique, or no: but my preſent ſcope
is not to defend the Presbyteriall diſcipline in all
things, it is only to maintain againſt the neceſſity of
ſuch an immutable Epiſcopacy, as is now conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; ſo far to defend parity, as our Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchiſts
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157098:3"/>
take advantage againſt it, for the upholding
of their own ſide. To this purpoſe I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chuſe but
ſay, that in nature that ſeems to be the beſt parity
which admits of ſome diſparity in Order, and that
ſeems to be the beſt diſparity which prevents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
with the moſt parity. And therefore we ſee
that our Saviour recommended as unlordly a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity
as might be, not unlike that of marriage, for
there is a great and ſweet parity in the tie of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke
between man and wife, and that is not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without ſome diſparity, yet that diſparity is
as little as may be, and that only for parities ſake,
<hi>Non aliter fuerint foemina vir<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> pares.</hi> But of this no
more; I come to Biſhop <hi>Halls</hi> next more exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions:
and they run thus; <hi>Epiſcopacy is an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Order of ſacred function appointed in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Church by the Holy Ghoſt, for the governing and
overſeeing thereof, and beſides the Word and Sacraments,
it is indued with power of Ordination and perpetuity of
juriſdiction.</hi> Or thus: <hi>A Paſtor ordained perpetuall
moderator in Church affaires with a fixed imparity exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
ſpirituall juriſdiction out of his owne peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandated
authority is a Biſhop.</hi> Or thus: <hi>Adde majority
above Presbyters, and power of juriſdiction by due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
for conſtant continuance, and this makes a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop:
take away theſe, and he remaines a meere Presbyter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to bee obſerved now that foure things are
here aſſerted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Epiſcopall power is ſuch as none are capable of, but
only men within Sacred Orders. A Biſhop muſt be a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
indued with power of Ordination, and ſpirituall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
by due Ordination, and without theſe hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
a meere Paſtor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:157098:4"/>
Secondly, Epiſcopall power is ſuch as is wholly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
upon temporall Rulers, Its inſtitution was from
the Holy Ghoſt in the Evangelicall Church, It muſt rule out
of its owne peculiarly demandated authority.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Epiſcopal power conſiſts in Ordination, and
ſpiritual juriſdiction, and in majority above Presbyters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Epiſcopal power is unalterable by any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
authority, it is perpetual by divine right, As it was
fixed, and where it was ſettled by Chriſt, and his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
ſucceſsors, ſo and there it muſt continue unchanged
til the worlds end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In briefe, the ſumme of all theſe definitions is
this:</hi> Epiſcopacy is a forme of Eccleſiaſticall policy inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by Chriſt, whereby a Superiour Order of Presbyters
is indued with a perpetual independent power of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſpiritual juriſdiction, and with majority above
Presbyters, and this power as it appertaines to all that
Order, ſo it appertaines only to that Order.</p>
            <p>And thoſe things which we oppoſe herein are
chiefly two; Firſt, we ſee no ground in the word
of God, why Biſhops ſhould arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſuch a peculiar, independent, perpetual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Ordination, ſpirituall juriſdiction, and ſuch
a majority above Presbyters, as now they injoy,
excluding from all ſuch power and majoritie, not
only all Laymen, and Princes, but alſo Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
themſelves. Secondly, if power of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſpirituall juriſdiction, and preheminence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the Clergie bee due only to Biſhops, yet
we complaine that now in <hi>England</hi> that power and
preheminence is abuſed, and too farre extended,
and to ſuch purpoſes perverted, as the Apoſtles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:157098:4"/>
practiſed or intended. Of theſe two points in
this Order: but for my part, I am no favourer of
extreames, ſome defend Epiſcopacie as it is now
conſtituted in <hi>England,</hi> as Apoſtolicall, others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it as Antichriſtian: my opinion is that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is not ſo faulty as the Governours have
beene, and that it is better then no government at
all, nay, and may be better then ſome other forms
which ſome Sectaries have recommended to the
World. And my opinion further is, that it is
not alike in all reſpects, and that it ought to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
examined and ventilated, and that ſo it will
probably appeare in ſome things unprofitable, in
ſome things inconvenient, in ſome things miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous:
in notihng neceſſary, or unalterable. And it
ought to be obſerved, that evill formes of policie
have been ſometimes well ordered and rectified by
good Commanders: and ſo the State of <hi>Boetia</hi> once
flouriſhed under <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and yet
it owed this proſperitie not to the government of
the Citie, for that was ill conſtituted, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
but to the Governours, for they were wiſe and
vertuous. The contrary alſo happened to <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
for that fared ill ſometimes and ſuffered much
diſtemper, becauſe though its fundamentall Laws
were good, yet its Kings and Ephorie were many
times tyrannous, and unjuſt. And this ſhould
teach Biſhops not alwayes to boaſt of the ſanctitie
of their Order: becauſe ſuch, &amp; ſuch, in ancient, and
modern times were Martyrs, or were humble, and
fortunate to the Church, nor always to blame all
other formes of government, for the faults of ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:157098:5"/>
&amp; ſuch Governors. But in this my enſuing diſcourſe
I muſt undertake almoſt all Churchmen, at leaſt
ſome, if not all, of all Religions, &amp; opinions. Papiſts
allow ſomthing to ſecular Magiſtrates in the rule of
the Church, but Supremacie of rule they do utterly
in very terms deny. The Proteſtants though divided
amongſt themſelvs, ſome placing ſupreme power in
Epiſcopacie, others in presbytery, yet both in effect
deny it to the King, though in words they pretend
otherwiſe. The grounds of this miſtake (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
are theſe; when our Saviour firſt gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to his Diſciples to preach, and baptiſe, and
to propagate the true faith in the World, Secular
authority being then adverſe thereunto, Hee was of
neceſsity to commit, not only doctrine but all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
alſo to the charge of his Apoſtles, and their
Subſtitutes only: Wherfore though Secular autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
be now come in, &amp; become friendly to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; willing to advance the ſpirituall proſperity of
the Church, aſwel as the temporall of the State, yet
Clergiemen having obtained poſſeſsion of power
in the Church, and that by Chriſts own inſtitution,
they think they ought not to reſigne the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
at the demand of Princes. And becauſe the
certain forme of diſcipline which our Saviour left,
and to whom it was left is doubtfully and obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet forth in Scripture, and is yet controverted of
all ſides, therefore ſome contend for one thing,
ſome for an other, but all agree in this, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
forme was appointed for thoſe times, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably
neceſſary for theſe, and that to whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
rule was deſigned, to Chriſtian Princes it was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:157098:5"/>
not, my drift therefore muſt now be, to diſcover the
erroneous conceits herein of all ſides, and to doe as
the <hi>Romans</hi> once did when they were choſen arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators
betweene two conteſting Cities, I muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
decree for the Plaintiff, nor Defendant, but for
the King, who is in this caſe a third party. I am of
opinion that ſome order and imparitie was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Primitive Church, in the very Houſe of
God, and therefore was ſo countenanced by our
Saviour: but for ought I ſee, that power which was
then neceſſary was not ſo large as our Prelates, nor
ſo narrow as our Presbyterians plead for, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it was, or whereſoever it reſted, queſtionleſs,
it is now unknown, and not manifeſt in Scripture:
but if it were manifeſt, and that ſuch as the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
or ſuch as the Presbytery mayntaines, it is ſo
far from being now unchangeable ſince Princes are
come in to doe their offices in the houſe of God,
that I think it cannot remayne unchanged without
great injury to Princes, and damage to the Church,
and by conſequence great diſhonour to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
And this is that now which I ſhall endevour
to confirme, and demonſtrate. In the firſt place
then, I am to impugne thoſe grounds <hi>whereby a ſole,
independent, perpetuall power of Church Government is
appropriated to Eccleſiaſticall perſons only: and whereby
Princes, &amp;c. are excluded as incompetent for the ſame.</hi>
That there is no ſuch thing as Ordination, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Juriſdiction due, and neceſſary in the Church
is not now to be queſtioned, the queſtion is what
perſons are moſt capable of the ſame, whether ſuch
as are commonly called Eccleſiaſticall, or no. It is
agreed by all, that God hath not left Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:157098:6"/>
deſtitute of ſuch remedies as are neceſſary to
its conſervation: and that rule and dominion being
neceſſary to that conſervation, where that rule and
dominion is granted, there all things neceſſary for
the ſupport of that rule and dominion are granted
too. It is further agreed alſo that Supream power
ought to be intire and undivided, and cannot elſe be
ſufficient for the protection of all, if it doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
overall: without any other equall power to
controll, or diminiſh it: and that therefore the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Temporall Magiſtrate ought in ſome caſes
to command Eccleſiaſticall perſons, as well as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:
but here lies the difference, the Papiſts hold,
that though ſpirituall perſons as they are men, and
Citizens of the Common-wealth in regard of their
worldly habitation are ſubject to temporall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
yet this ſubjection is due <hi>ob pacem commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
or <hi>quoad commune bonum,</hi> and that <hi>per accidens</hi>
and <hi>indirectè,</hi> and that no further neither, but only
<hi>ſecundum partem directivam, ſeu imperativam.</hi> Thus,
whatſoever they pretend to the contrary, they doe
erect <hi>regnum in regno,</hi> they give temporall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
an imperfect, broken right in ſome things, but
controlable and defeaſible by the ſpirituall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
in other things. And the World ha's had a
long ſad experience of this, whilſt Kings had the
Pope for their ſuperiour in any thing, they remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Supreame in nothing, whil'ſt their rule was by
diviſion diminiſhed in ſome things, they found it
inſufficient in all things, ſo that they did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
joyntly with the Pope, but were commanded
wholly by the Pope. And in Popiſh Countries
now Princes do ſuffer themſelves in word to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:157098:6"/>
from all ſpirituall Dominion, and execute
not the ſame in ſhew but by ſubordinate Clerks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, and that by privilege of the Popes grant,
but we know in truth they hold it, and uſe it as their
own, and the Pope is more officious to them, then
they are to him. And whereas the Canon Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
temporall Princes to puniſh the inſolence and
oppreſsions of Biſhops within their reſpective Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
<hi>modò ſint verae oppreſsiones,</hi> wee know this
comes to nothing, if Princes claime it not by ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
higher then Canon Law. For how ſhall this
be tryde? how ſhall it appeare, whether theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions
be true, and hainous, or no? if Biſhops
will not ſubmit themſelves in this tryall, and refuſe
to appeale, Kings are no competent Judges, nor can
take no juſt cognizance hereof: and what redreſſe
then is in the Kings power? Even Popiſh Princes
now know well enough how ridiculous this favour
of the Canoniſts is, &amp; therfore as the Popes fed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
heretofore with the name and ſhadow only of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Sovereignty in <hi>temporalibus,</hi> ſo they feed him
the like now in <hi>ſpiritualibus.</hi> Proteſtants diſſent
much from theſe Tenets, but becauſe many of
them, eſpecially Clergimen do not wholly diſſent
from all the grounds of theſe Tenets, therefore
they alſo doe partake in ſome errours, and abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the like nature: One <hi>Scotiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>That</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,
<hi>and our learnedeſt Proteſtant Divines, nay, even</hi>
Rainolds <hi>himſelfe though otherwiſe a Puritan, yet they
all hold, that there is due to the King, no ſpirituall but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a temporall rule over perſons and cauſes Eccleſiaſticall,
and that alſo by accident for the common peace ſake.</hi> Hee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:157098:7"/>
ſayes alſo <hi>that in his preſence at a</hi> Cambridge <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement,
the chiefe Biſhop was called</hi> Maximus Pater,
<hi>and that it was maintained that the care of ſpirituall
things did appertain to the chiefe Biſhop, and of temporall
to the King, and whereas it was at laſt concluded that all
was to be governed by the King,</hi> yet he ſayes <hi>queſtionleſs
the intent was civilitèr, not ſpiritualitèr.</hi> And if wee
look back to the primitives we ſhal find that in good
times before Popery had any conſiderable growth
Kings for penance were enjoyned to kneele to
Prieſts, and were not admitted to have ſeats in the
Chancell neere the Altar, no not amongſt the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons:
but were ſometimes ſubjected to heavie and
ſharp cenſures of Biſhops, and ſometimes ſtrucke
with the thunderbolt of Excommunication it ſelf.
And we ſhall find that the Name Church was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in common ſpeech to Churchmen only, and
the Name <hi>Spiritualitie</hi> was taken in the ſame ſenſe,
as if all other perſons had beene ſtrangers to the
Church, and had beene of a meere Temporall and
Secular condition: and by the name Clergie it was
intimated to the World, that the <hi>Sacerdotall</hi> fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was the only lot and patrimony of God: and
theſe uſages were <hi>ab antiquo.</hi> And wee ſhall finde
that the holieſt and learnedeſt Fathers of the
Church did ſeeme to preferre the Mitre before the
Diademe, and to dream of a Spirituall Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Prieſts more worthy and ſacred then
that of Emperours. And therefore <hi>Gregory</hi> of
<hi>Nazianzen</hi> in a Sermon before the Emperour ſays
thus to him: <hi>The Law of Chriſt hath committed you to
my Charge, and to my Pulpit: for we rule alſo and ours is a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:157098:7"/>
more excellent and perfect regiment.</hi> And comparing
further the rule of Prieſts with the rule of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Hee cals the one ſpirituall the other fleſhly, and
concludes that the ſpirit ought not to give place to
the fleſh, nor heavenly things to earthly.</hi> What
hee meant here by giving place, whether hee
meant it of externall ſubmiſsion, or internall awe
I cannot tell: but he left it uncertain. To the ſame
purpoſe that of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tends alſo: <hi>Thinke not, O
Emperour, that thou haſt any right over divine things: for
the Palace is for the Emperour, but Churches for Prieſts.</hi>
And that alſo of <hi>Athanaſius, Its neither lawfull for
us to hold a Kingdome upon earth: nor haſt thou O Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
power over ſacred things.</hi> Wee ſee they ſpeake
of their Miniſtery and Eccleſiaſticall vocation as
of a ſovereigntie, and rule, and that more ſacred,
then that of Princes, of which Princes were not
worthy, or capable. And to paſſe by the blinde
times of Popery wherein upon theſe grounds the
<hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops inthralled a great part of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
with temporall bondage, wee ſhall finde alſo
that ſince the abjuration of <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſervitude, yet
Proteſtant Miniſters themſelves have aſſumed a
ſanctitie more then is due. The Kings Supremacie
or Headſhip over the Eccleſiaſticall or Spirituall
State, Hee being accounted but meerly temporall
in compariſon of Prieſts is as ill wiſhed by many
Calviniſts, as by Papiſts, their word is of Secular
Princes, <hi>Iſtis non competit iſte Primatus.</hi> And as Sir
<hi>Thomas More</hi> ſuffered death in teſtimony of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelfe condemnes this Realme of
Blaſphemy for entitling <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth Supreme
Head of the Church here under Chriſt. And not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:157098:8"/>
only the Name, but the power it ſelfe which wee
give to Civill Magiſtrates he proteſteth againſt, as
that which had wounded him deeply, Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made thereby too ſpirituall, hee complaineth
that this fault did raigne throughout <hi>Germany,</hi> and
in ſome parts of <hi>France,</hi> to the taking away of
Spirituall Regiment, whilſt Princes were made
chiefe Judges as well in matters of doctrine as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that all which follow <hi>Calvin,</hi> which is
almoſt the generality of Proteſtants, beſides Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
hold Princes incompetent for ſpirituall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie,
accounting the intermedling of Princes
therein as an abolition, or prophanation of the
ſame.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that our contrary faction of
Hierarchiſts alſo, deny the Kings Supremacie in
<hi>Spiritualibus,</hi> though not in <hi>Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> and our
Prelats Style is <hi>providentia divina,</hi> not <hi>gratiâ Regis,</hi>
and as they iſſue Writs in their own Names, ſo they
uſe their owne armes in their Seales, and not the
Kings. And wee know it was my Lord of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries</hi>
induſtry of late to procure a Commiſsion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
five yeeres ſince, that all Biſhops Courts
might proceed without any ſubordination or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
to any other of the Kings Courts. So that
though they complaine of the Presbyterian Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and the doctrine of <hi>Calvin</hi> as injurious to
Princes, yet they themſelves ſeeme to be of the
ſame confederacie.</p>
            <p>But that I may not ſeem to miſreport, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret
any, I will cite only two Divines of prime
note, both defenders of Supremacie. <hi>Hooker ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:157098:8"/>
of that dutifull ſubjection which is due from all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to the Paſtors of their ſouls in reſpect of their ſacred
Order,</hi> affirmes <hi>that the ſame is as due from Kings and
Princes, as from their meaneſt vaſſals.</hi> Reverence due
to the Word, and Sacraments, and to Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
is not here meant, for that is as due from
Prieſts themſelves alſo, as from any other, it is
meant of reverence due to the perſons of Prieſts, &amp;
this he cals <hi>ſubjection, and challenges as due in reſpect of
their ſacred Order.</hi> And ſo <hi>Bilſon</hi> deſcanting upon the
words of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> after a comparative manner
(as <hi>Hooker</hi> did) inferres thereupon, <hi>that Prieſts have
a greater and perfecter regiment then Princes: For</hi> (ſayes
he) <hi>Prieſts governe the ſouls of men, and diſpenſe the
myſteries of God, whereas Princes are ſet to rule the bodies
of men, and to diſpoſe the things of this life, &amp;c.</hi> Hee
does not compare the offices but the Regiments of
Prieſts and Princes, and hee averres as confidently
that Prieſts governe the ſouls, and exerciſe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the ſpirits of Chriſtians, as that Princes
have no power at all, but over the bodies and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities
of their Subjects. And for theſe cauſes
the Croſier is generally preferred in Honour, and
Sanctitie, before the Scepter: to detect therefore
the errour of Divines herein, I will now truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
and throughly poize thoſe arguments which
they moſt rely upon. The firſt argument runs thus.
<hi>Spirituall things are not to be managed, and treated, but
only by ſpirituall perſons: but Princes are not ſpirituall,
Ergo.</hi> Wee muſt firſt underſtand here what is meant
by ſpirituall things, and ſpirituall perſons. If by
ſpirituall things here, ſuch things are meant as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:157098:9"/>
to God and to Religion, and as concerne
Gods ſervice in the Church, and the welfare of the
ſouls and ſpirits of men; ſo all men have a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
charge in generall: for all men by their generall
callings are ſervants to God, and are not only
bound to provide for their owne ſouls, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
alſo the worſhip of God, and the ſalvation of
other men. And in this reſpect that man which is
moſt pious, is moſt holy, and ſpirituall, and moſt
acceptable to God, and though his condition be
but private here in this World, yet his reward in
Heaven may be more glorious, then theirs who
have publike Offices and Dignities here, and whoſe
particular callings are farre more ſacred. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this internall holineſſe of perſons viſible only
to God, there is an externall, politicall holineſſe
alſo of perſons which ariſes from our particular
Functions in this World, and the meaſure of this
holineſſe, is the profit and conſequence of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
and employments. The Regall and Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotall
Offices have ever beene held comparatively
of all other the moſt holy, and worſhipfull, and
the reaſon is becauſe of all others they are the moſt
advantagious, and of moſt extenſive benefit to the
people of God. And therefore the perſon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
valued according to the function, and the
function according to its benefit, and not on the
contrary: The man is Honourable becauſe hee is a
King, and the King is honourable becauſe He is the
Conſervator of the people: and of this reaſon of
Honour man is able to Judge. God accepts of ſuch
a man to ſerve him in ſuch an honourable place;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:157098:9"/>
the place is not here honourable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe He ſerves
in it, but he is Honourable becauſe the place is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable:
and though of Gods meere acceptance of
the perſon no reaſon can be given, yet there is great
reaſon that all men ſhould bee Honourable with
men, as they are acceptable with God. God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> before other Nations; they
were a royall Prieſthood in compariſon of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
becauſe God by his peculiar choice of them
to his ſervice did give them that more then regall,
or more then Sacerdotall priviledge. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
in condition were more contemptible, and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
more incorrible than other Nations, but
becauſe God ſeparates them they are holy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God ſeparates them to ſerve him according
to his pure will, they are holy as Princes, and
Prieſts. Chriſtians alſo may now be termed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Prieſts in compariſon of the <hi>Iews</hi> in as much
as God of his free pleaſure is now more extenſive
and diffuſive of his graces amongſt us, that we may
adore him more ingenuouſly, more intelligently,
and more comfortably then the <hi>Jews</hi> did: and in
the like manner amongſt Chriſtians, Princes and
Prieſts are yet higher elevated above common lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
in as much as they have neerer acceſſe to God
at the Throne and at the Altar, and by their more
ſublime employments are more highly dignified, &amp;
more honorably conſecrated. With the Prince and
the Prieſt no man will enter into any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petition, but
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petition now being between the Prince &amp; the
prieſt, we muſt ſearch into the nature of this political
ſanctitie, that we may the better diſtinguiſh its de-grees.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:157098:10"/>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> wee ſee complains, that the perſons of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are made too ſpirituall, by our appropriating to
them ſpirituall authoritie: becauſe hee holds that
authority too ſpirituall for their perſons. The ſame
thing is here the reaſon of the ſame thing; ſpirituall
offices and ſervices belong not to Princes, becauſe
their perſons are not ſpirituall: and why are their
perſons not ſpirituall? becauſe their offices, and
ſervices are not ſpirituall. This is unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcholaſticall:
againſt the perſon no exception lies,
but ſuch as is drawn from the function; the perſon
is coruſcant only by the rayes of the function: they
which wil prove Kings to be not ſpiritual, muſt firſt
prove their offices to be meerly temporall, and not
on the contrary. Such proofs as infirme the Kings
power, and intereſt in <hi>ſpiritualibus</hi> are proper, ſuch
proofs let us heare. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſay directly, that Emperours have no right
over divine things, nor power over ſacred
things: but they are very briefe, and give no
reaſon for their allegations, nor doe they leave us
ſatisfied in their true meanings. The perſons and
offices of Kings were ever held ſacred, and if that
which is ſacred be not ſpirituall, it were good that
the difference were ſet forth between them. Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are for Princes, and Temples for Prieſts: but
palaces are not the ſole intereſt of Princes, ſo as that
they are excluded thereby from all power in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
nor is this a good reſult, becauſe prieſts may
not move in the Civill Orbe, therefore Princes may
not in the Eccleſiaſticall. But <hi>Nazianzen</hi> is more
full, and expreſſive of his reaſons, and thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
alſo are further preſſed by Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> let us
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:157098:10"/>
bend our forces thither. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> concludes <hi>the
regiment of Prieſts to be more perfect, and excellent then
that of Princes,</hi> and compares it to that of the ſoule
over the body, becauſe things committed to the
prieſts charge are heavenly and ſpirituall, whereas
Kings (he ſayes) <hi>have in their power things earthly, and
bodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y.</hi> He takes three things here for granted, Firſt,
<hi>that the office of a Prieſt is as properly and truly a power,
and rule, as that of Princes.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that the rule of
Princes extends only to earthly things.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
may be ſpoken of the whole order of Prieſthood,
that he applyes to every particular Prieſt.</hi> And thus hee
ſeems to attribute a greater ſanctitie not only <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive,</hi>
but <hi>extenſive</hi> alſo, to any prieſt, then to any
Prince. The gloſſe of <hi>Bilſon</hi> alſo hereupon is: <hi>That
Prieſts governe the ſouls of men, and diſpenſe the myſteries
of God, whereas Princes are ſet to rule the bodies of their
Subjects, and to diſpoſe the things of this life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the fruits and effects of their callings be compared,
the Preachers</hi> (he ſayes) <hi>paſses that of Princes by many
degrees of excellence and perfection: God giving earthly
food, and peace by the Prince, but heavenly grace and life
by the Word and Sacraments; which wee receive from the
mouthes, and hands of his Meſſengers. As to externall
power, and corporall compulſion: So Preachers are ſervants
to their brethren, Princes are Lords over them. Preachers
may reprove &amp; threaten, but Princes muſt ſeize the goods,
and chaſtiſe the bodies of offenders. Preaches may ſhut
the gates of Heaven againſt non-repentants: Princes muſt
root them from the face of the earth, and inflict the juſt
vengeance of their ſins in this world. And whereas the
Princes and Preachers functions concurre in ghoſtly and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:157098:11"/>
heavenly things, that the Preacher declareth, and the Prince
eſtabliſheth the word of truth: yet the Preachers ſervice in
theſe caſes excelleth the Princes: for that the word in the
Preachers mouth ingendreth faith and winneth the ſoule
unto God to ſerve him with a willing minde, whereas the
Sword in the Princes hand ſtriketh only a terrour into
men to refraine the outward act, but reformeth not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the heart.</hi> This is <hi>Bilſon's</hi> ſenſe, and I thinke
the ſenſe of almoſt all our Divines: by this is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi>
fully ſeconded and abetted, for firſt, the
true and proper rule of prieſts is not only aſſerted,
but alſo explained, for it gives grace and life by the
Word and Sacraments, it reproves and threatens,
it ſhuts the gate of Heaven againſt Non-repentants.
Secondly, the rule of princes is leſned, and that by
this inſtance: for that the preacher winneth ſoules
to a willing ſervice, but the prince by externall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
reſtraineth only from the outward act of ſin.
And thirdly, his compariſon is indefinite, betweene
Prince, and preacher, that which is implyed of
Prieſt in generall, hee ſeemeth to apply to every
prieſt in particular. I muſt frame my anſwer to
every particular. Power and Dominion of it ſelfe
is divine, and adde but infinite, or abſolute to it, it is
Divinitie it ſelfe. Nothing is more deſirable to man,
or more adequate to the aymes of intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
then power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Angels in Heaven are known
to us by the Names of Thrones, and Principalities,
Heaven it ſelf is knowne to us by the name of a
Kingdome: and our beſt devotion to God conſiſts
in aſcribing to him, honour, worſhip, ſubjection, &amp;c.
and the firſt and greateſt ſin of men and Angels, was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:157098:11"/>
an aſpiring to undue Power, and excellence. Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
perfection and bleſſedneſſe is the Unitie of the
Godhead, and that Unitie muſt needs ſubſiſt in
abſolute power, abſolute wiſdome, and abſolute
goodneſſe. Abſolute power alſo in order of Nature
(according to mans underſtanding) as a Father
gives being to abſolute wiſdome: as both give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to abſolute Goodneſſe. Whatſoever is in God
muſt needs be God, and of the ſame ſubſtance indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
and ſo infinite wiſdome, and infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
muſt needs be coeternall, and conſubſtantiall
with infinite power: yet this excludes not all order
of diſtinction; and according to order of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
it is more proportionable to our capacitie,
that infinite Wiſdome ſhould derive its divine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
from infinite power, then infinite power
from infinite Wiſdome. Unitie of perfect bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
cannot comprehend any thing more then this
Trinity, neither can it comprehend any thing leſſe:
and therfore though this word Trinity cannot have
any relation to the eſſence of God, or to his works
<hi>ad extra,</hi> which flow from the eſſence, yet to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
it may, and to his internall operations, wherein
one perſon is more generative then another. And
according to theſe internal operations of the Deitie
we ought (to ſpeak after the manner of men) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
prioritie of Order to infinite power, the firſt
perſon of the Godhead, in as much as wee cannot
conceive but that God is rather wiſe, as he is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,
and Good as hee is both powerfull, and
wiſe: then that hee is powerfull, as hee is wiſe, or
wiſe, and powerfull, as he is good. Having premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
theſe things in generall concerning power, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:157098:12"/>
dominion, and the excellence thereof, I am come
now to ſee what that power and Dominion is which
Churchmen clayme to themſelves. Our Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſts
uſe the words <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>regiment</hi> to deſcribe
all their actions, and employments: the <hi>Power of
Order,</hi> the <hi>Power of Juriſdiction,</hi> the <hi>Power of the
Word and Sacraments,</hi> and the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> all
their <hi>ſpirituall Offices,</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> are expreſſed in
commanding, and high terms, that they may ſeem
to owe no ſubordination, or dependence to any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
themſelves. And this art they further uſe,
when they would prove the excellence of their
ſpirituall rule, they derive it from preaching, and
the ſubordinate Offices of the Miniſtery, but when
they would exerciſe their rule, then they alleage
that to rule over Preachers is more, &amp; greater then
to preach: becauſe the ſpirits of men are properly
ſubject to no rule; and becauſe preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it
be one of Gods moſt effectuall Ordinances, yet is
no proper rule but a ſervice rather: therefore they
lay hold of Eccleſiaſticall juridiction for proofe
of their holy ſpirituall rule. And yet becauſe
Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is of it ſelfe no ſuch
divine ſublime thing, as the miniſtration of the
Word, and Sacraments, nor ſo incompetent
for Princes, as to the uſe of it, therefore their
proofs are chiefly grounded upon the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Word and Sacraments: but this ſlight
impoſture cannot ſo delude us: for either Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
juriſdiction is more ſacred and ſpirituall
then the miniſtration of the Word, and Sacraments,
or not; if it be, then theſe arguments drawne from
the Word and Sacraments are impertinent: The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:157098:12"/>
queſtion is whether Princes be capable of ſuch ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
or not, and this proves not the incapacity
of Princes, this only proves the honour of ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie:
but on the other ſide, if it be not, yet there
is the ſame impertinence, for if prieſts challenge to
themſelves power in things more excellent, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this excludes not Princes from things leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and holy: but wee ſhall not need to ſtick
here.</p>
            <p>The papiſts themſelves doe acknowledge, that
to preach, &amp;c. is leſſe then to rule, and to preſcribe
Laws to preachers, &amp;c. and <hi>Bilſon</hi> makes a plaine
confeſſion, that the Sacerdotall Office is rather
Miniſteriall, then Imperiall, and that ſuch reverence
and ſubjection as is due in ſpirituall affaires from
Princes is not due to the perſons of prieſts, but to
the Ordinances of God, and to the graces of the
Church: <hi>For</hi> (ſays hee) <hi>the word is to be ſubmitted to
in the mouths of Prophets, and the Ordinances are to be
honoured in the adminiſtration of Prieſts, but the perſons
of Prophets, and Prieſts, muſt not be objects to terminate
this ſubmiſsion, and honour. God is to be honoured in the
ſervice of his Miniſters, not the Miniſters in Gods ſtead:
for in theſe ſervices there is the ſame honour due to GOD
from Miniſters themſelves, as from Lay-men.</hi> And
therefore wee ſee if the greater Prieſt heare the
word, &amp;c. from the leſſe, this does not ſanctifie the
leſſe above the greater, as it would, if ſanctitie did
reſt in the perſon, and not in the Ordinance, or if it
did not paſſe from the actor, or inſtrument, to the
Author and Ordainer himſelfe. I thinke wee may
therefore proceed now from this, that power, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:157098:13"/>
Government is a thing in it ſelfe moſt awfull and
honourable, to this: that the trueſt owners thereof
next under God, whom the Church ever look't
upon as Gods immediate Vicegerents, and Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thereof, are Princes. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 2. writing
to the Church in the time of a Heathen, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Emperour, commands every ſoul to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the higher powers. He acknowledges power
in a very <hi>Nero,</hi> and that to be the higher power, and
to that higher power of that <hi>Nero</hi> he ſubjects every
ſoule Chriſtian and Heathen, Prieſt and Laymen.
For the ſame cauſe alſo the primitives in <hi>Tertullians</hi>
mouth make this humble profeſſion: <hi>Colimus impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorem,
ut hominem à Deo ſecundum, &amp; ſolo Deo mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem:</hi>
&amp; this profeſſion was made under the Reign of
wicked Emperours, to whom in Eccleſiaſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
more might be denied, then to ours: for
though <hi>Reges, in quantum Reges ſerviunt Deo,</hi> as Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, yet <hi>in quantum pii Reges,</hi> they ſerve
God the more gloriouſly, and have a neerer acceſſe
to God, and in that reſpect it may bee more truly
ſaid of them, that they are <hi>à Deo ſecundi, &amp; ſolo Deo
minores:</hi> and if ſo, how awfull and venerable muſt
this render their perſons, and with what ſubmiſſion
muſt we proſtrate our ſelves at their ſacred feet?
and that it may not ſeeme ſtrange that meer power
and rule in an unbelieving or wicked Prince ſhould
be ſo ſacred and inviolable, wee muſt take notice
that the wickedneſſe of Princes in ill commands
though it diſcharge us as to thoſe ill commands, yet
it does not diſcharge their power or rule either in
thoſe, or in any other: For when Princes rule well,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:157098:13"/>
they are to be obeyed, when ill, they are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
and this very indurance is an effect of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and ſubjection. <hi>Peter</hi> as a Citizen of the
Common-wealth is a ſervant to <hi>Nero,</hi> and though
in the meere conſideration of a Chriſtian, Hee has
not dependance upon <hi>Nero</hi> further then is to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by ſuffering under him in ill commands, yet
in all civill things, and things indifferent, his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
remayns undiſſolved. If <hi>Nero</hi> forbid <hi>Peter</hi> to
preach, contradicting God herein, whoſe power is
ſtill tranſcendent, this prohibition binds not <hi>Peter,</hi>
but if <hi>Nero</hi> uſe the Sword hereupon againſt <hi>Peter,</hi>
this ſword is irreſiſtible, becauſe though in this it
be injurious, in other things it is ſtill ſacred. This
one violence of <hi>Nero</hi> is tyrannous, but the authority
whereby this is done is not tyranny; For the ſame
ſword which offends one defends many ſtill, and if
one here be defended, many muſt be offended, and
the good of many is to be preferred before the good
of one. And yet if God had made <hi>Peter</hi> ſupreame
Judge of ſuch caſes, and had given him a power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,
it had been neceſſary that he had given
him withall ſome remedie, and ſufficient means to
ſupport the ſame Supremacy &amp; independent right:
for God gives no man an abſolute right without
ſome proper remedy appertaining to the ſame. The
uſe of power is not to intreat, or perſwade only,
for theſe may bee done without power, but to
command, and commands are vaine without
compulſion, and they which may not compell,
may not command, and they which cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
may not meddle at all except to intreat,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:157098:14"/>
or perſwade. Power then there muſt be, and that
power muſt be ſomewhere ſupreame that it may
command all good, and puniſh all evill, or elſe it is
inſufficient, and if all, then in religious as well as
in civill caſes, for Supremacie may be ſeverally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed,
but the right of it cannot be ſeverally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed:
if <hi>Peter</hi> may doe more then perſwade <hi>Nero,</hi>
the Scepter is <hi>Peters</hi> not <hi>Neroes;</hi> if hee may doe no
more, he is as meer a ſubject as any other Layman:
but in whetherſoever the power of commanding
reſts, it cannot reſt in both, the Scepter cannot be
ſhared, independence cannot be divided: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cannot obey both as equall Judges whilſt their
judgments remain contrary, nor ſerve both as equal
Lords whilſt their commands are contrary. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
and intreat in Miniſters, are the offices of a
bleſſed vocation, but they are not properly Enſigns
of Royaltie, and power: and if the ſpirits of men are
ſomtimes moved, &amp; won by the perſwaſions of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
as they may by other means, yet captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and commanded they cannot be: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if this be called power, it is but imaginary, and
improper, and ſuch as ought not to enter into any
compariſon, or rivalitie with that ſolid, ſenſible,
coercive, binding power wherewith God has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
his true Lievtenants upon earth. That power
which is proper, muſt include not only a right of
commanding, but alſo an effectuall vertue of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
obedience to its commands, and of ſubjecting
and reducing ſuch, as ſhall not render themſelves
obedient. The ſupreame civill Magiſtrate has this
power grounded upon the common conſent of
Mankinde, and as ſtrong as is the politicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:157098:14"/>
of humane nature in its ſupream Law of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
conſervation, ſo vigorous, and invincible is
this power. Had Prieſts any ſuch power or ſword,
we ſhould ſoon ſee it, and feele it, and voluntarily
ſtoop under it: but ſince they can pretend to none
ſuch, the meere noyſe of an imaginary ſpirituall
power and ſword muſt not deceive us. The ſword
muſt be of ſympathy and proportion anſwerable to
thoſe commands for which it was ordained, if the
commands be externall and politicall, the ſword
muſt not be inviſible, and meerly ſpirituall. If the
<hi>Pope</hi> can impoſe an oath upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us to ſtand to his laws,
and to obey his awards, our obedience being here
politicall, his power of impoſing Oaths muſt be the
like; for if he pretend a right, and have no remedy,
that is no power; &amp; if he have a remedy that is not
of the ſame nature with his command, it will prove
no remedy, it will be found vain and uneffectuall.
Wee cannot thinke that God has given the Pope
any power but for good, and wee cannot think that
power good, whereby the Pope may deſtroy Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of ſouls, and yet cannot reclayme, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
one. The Popes commands ſeeme to mee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
unnaturall, impious, the Pope herein
ha's no ſpirituall power to rectifie mee, or to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my errour to me, or to procure obedience from
me, that power which he ha's over my ſoule is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to exclude it from heaven, and to give it as a prey
to Satan, for not attributing more to him then to
my own conſcience, and naturall light. Can wee
think that God gave this new Power, never before
knowne, to theſe latter days out of mercy, that all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:157098:15"/>
except one handfull of men ſhould periſh by it, and
none at all receive benefit by it? It cannot be ſaid
that the ſame keys which ſhut heaven to ſo many,
open heaven to any one: for thoſe few which obey
the Pope, obey him either voluntarily, or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint:
and they which are conſtrained, obey him
as a Prince, not as a Prieſt, and bow under his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
not ſpirituall yoke: howſoever it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
pretended. Voluntary obedience alſo is ſuch
as is rendred without any externall influence from
the Pope; For the will is capable of no compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and if it were, my will would be as lyable to the
ſame as any other mans: and if the Pope may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
my will, and ſo open Heaven to me (as it were)
by his ſpirituall keys, and will not, tis his crueltie,
not my contumacie. Its no glory to the Pope, that
ſome few by blinde voluntary obedience acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the power of his keyes, in this hee has no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that ſword which was ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
in the hand of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> was as ſpirituall,
and as univerſally prevalent as the Popes. So much
of the imaginary rule and ſpiritual ſword of Prieſts,
as alſo of the reall effectuall dominion of Princes,
I ſhall now prove further, that the ſword of Kings
if it be not ſo ſpirituall, as the Pope pretends, to
cut off ſouls; yet it is more then temporall, and
extends to things moſt ſpirituall. The Founders
and Patriarchs of the World before the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> did not only governe the Church, but alſo
execute all paſtorall, ſpirituall Offices as they were
Princes, and Supream Potentates within their own
limits: they did not governe men as they were the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:157098:15"/>
Prieſts of God, but they did ſacrifice and officiate
before God, as they were the Heads, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of men. In thoſe times it was not held uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
or intruſion upon prieſts, for Princes to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
with their own hands, or to teach the will of
God with their own mouthes; it would have been
held preſumption if any elſe had attempted the
like, and a diſhonour to Gods ſervice. Nature then
taught that the moſt excellent perſon was moſt fit
for Gods ſervice in the Church, and that no perſon
could be more excellent, then hee which ſerved
God in the Throne. The word prieſt now may
have divers acceptions. In ſome ſenſe whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been called prieſts, <hi>viz.</hi> comparatively,
and in ſome ſenſe all Fathers of Children, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Servants are in the nature of prieſts, and in
more uſuall ſenſe all Princes, ſo farre as they have
charge and cure of ſouls, and are intruſted with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service within their ſeverall commands, are
more ſupereminently taken for prieſts: but the moſt
uſuall ſenſe is this. A Prieſt is hee which hath cure
of Souls, and a truſt of Gods worſhip by a more
peculiar kinde of publike and politike conſecration
and dedication thereunto: of ſuch conſecration, or
ordination, before <hi>Aaron,</hi> we read nothing, and for
ought I ſee, we are bound to believe nothing. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſideck</hi>
was a pious man, a devout Father, a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Maſter, nay, a zealous Prince and Commander,
but in all theſe reſpects hee had no priviledge nor
right to the denomination of prieſt more then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
Sem, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. had. You will ſay then how
is that denomination given him ſo peculiarly? This
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:157098:16"/>
denomination might be given not by reaſon of any
externall, formall, ceremoniall Unction, or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of hands, or any other ſolemne Dedication
or ſeparation before men: but in this reſpect, that
he did perhaps publikely officiate in the preſence of
all his Subjects, and perhaps in behalfe of all his
ſubjects, and this is a higher and bleſſeder Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Office, then any we read of in his predeceſſors
or ſucceſſors till <hi>Aarons</hi> dayes. It is probable that
God was ſerved in Families before <hi>Aaron,</hi> and
perhaps there were ſolemne days and Feaſts, which
all Families by joynt conſent did in ſeverall places
dedicate to Gods ſervice by ſtrict obſervance of
the ſame, but that any publike places were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for whole Congregations to joyne and meet
publikely in under the charge and function of any
one publike Prieſt, till <hi>Aaron</hi> is not ſpecified. This
only we may gueſſe by the ſpeciall name of prieſt
applied to <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> that perhaps being a prieſt
of <hi>Salem,</hi> he was the firſt that made the worſhip of
God ſo publike: and did not only by the generall
influence of his power take order for the ſervice
and knowledge of God in ſeverall Families, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
gather ſeverall aſſemblies of united Families,
and there publikely ſacrifiſe and officiate in behalf
of great, and ſolemne Congregations: wherein he
might far exceed <hi>Abraham.</hi> Howſoever its ſufficient
for my purpoſe, that this he might doe by vertue of
his Regall power and dignity without any further
conſecration or Sacerdotal inſtalment whatſoever.
And in this reſpect he was without predeceſſor, and
perhaps ſucceſſor, ſo that I think hee was the moſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:157098:16"/>
lively and Honourable type of our Saviour: for
<hi>Aarons</hi> Order was Subſtitute, and his conſecration
was performed by the hand of his Prince and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
and being ſo conſecrated, He did ſacrifiſe,
not as a Prince but meerly as a Prieſt. Whereas
<hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> received his Order from none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and ſo remayned not only independent, but
his ſervice alſo being both Regall and Sacerdotall,
as our Saviours alſo was, it was yet more Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in that it was Regall, then in that it was Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotall.
And this certainly ſutes beſt with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Order, for no Secular authority but his own
did concurre in his inauguration, hee was his owne
Anceſtor in this, in that his owne Royall dignitie
gave vertue to his Sacerdotall: and though hee
would not aſſume to himſelfe the externall Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Royalty in meer Secular things, yet in this he
would follow holy <hi>Melchiſedeck.</hi> But to paſſe from
<hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> within ſome few ages after wee finde
the Scepter and Cenſor ſevered; Wee finde no
prints of great Empires before <hi>Moſes,</hi> for in ſmall
Countries we finde divers petty independant prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities:
and it may be imagin'd that neither true
policie, nor wicked tyranny was then knowne in
ſuch perfection, as now it is. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at their
departure from <hi>Egypt</hi> were a great and formidable
Nation, as appeares by the combinations of many
other Potentates againſt them, yet at that time the
weightie charges both of prince and prieſt were
ſupported by <hi>Moſes</hi> alone. This was exceeding
grievous till <hi>Jethro</hi> in civill affaires, and till God
himſelfe in matters of Religion, for his further eaſe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:157098:17"/>
took much of his laborious part from off his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
Subordinate Magiſtrates were now appointed
in the State, and prieſts and Levits in the Church,
the Nation being growne numerous, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in Religion very various: but wee muſt not
think that <hi>Moſes</hi> was hereby emptied, or leſned of
any of his Civill, or Eccleſiaſticall authoritie: as
he retained ſtill Supremacie of power to himſelfe
in all things, ſo that Supremacy became now the
more awfull, and Majeſticall. The poet ſays of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<q>Maxima per multos tenuantur flumina rivos.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed did waters run backwards they
would ſpend and diminiſh themſelves by often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
in their courſes: but we ſee that in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
naturall Tracts many litle petty ſtreams of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiouſly
haſten to diſcharge themſelves into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſo that the more continued the courſe is, the
greater the ſtreams ever grow. It is ſo with power
both in Church and State: Sovereigntie is as the
mayne Ocean, of its vaſt abundance it feeds all, and
is fed by all, as it is the fountain to enrich others, ſo
it is the Ciſterne to receive and require back againe
all the riches of others. That which <hi>Moſes</hi> parted
with all and derived to others was for the better
expedition both of pietie and juſtice, that GOD
might be more duly ſerved, that the people might
be more quickly relieved, and that his own ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
might be the freelier disburdened: for as a man
hee could not intend univerſall buſineſſe: yet a
Prince he might well ſuperintend it in others. And
it is manifeſt that after the ſeparation of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:157098:17"/>
he did ſtill as ſuperiour to <hi>Aaron</hi> in the moſt
ſacred things approach God in the Mountain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the cuſtodie of the Law from Gods hand,
and to receive Orders from God for the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and all religious ſervices, and did performe the
act of conſecration to Prieſts, and did always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
with God by Prieſts, and command all men as
well Prieſts, and Levits, as other men. <hi>Hooker</hi> and
<hi>Bilſon,</hi> and I thinke moſt of our Divines doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
not only this, that <hi>Moſes</hi> retained all Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
Supremacie to himſelfe, but that hee left
the ſame alſo to his Succeſſours. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſayes that
by the ſame ſupreame power <hi>David, Aſa, Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,
Joſias,</hi> &amp;c. made thoſe Lawes and Statutes
(mentioned in ſacred Hiſtory) touching matters of
meer Religion, the affairs of the Temple, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God. And by vertue of this power the piety
and impietie of the King did alwayes change the
publike face of Religion, which the Prophets by
themſelves never did, nor could hinder from being
done. And yet if Prieſts alone had bin poſſeſt of all
ſpirituall power, no alteration in Religion could
have beene made without them, it had not beene
in the King, but in Prieſts to change the face of
Religion. And the making of Eccleſiaſticall
Lawes alſo with other like actions pertayning to
the power of dominion had ſtill been recorded for
the acts of Prieſts, and not of Kings: whereas we
now find the contrary. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſays this and more,
and <hi>Bilſon</hi> ſayes not one jot leſſe. Hee confeſſes the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kings were charged with matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:157098:18"/>
and the cuſtodie of both Tables, nay,
publiſhing, preſerving, executing points of Law
concerning the firſt table hee aſſignes as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
charge committed to Kings, as Kings, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being the foundation of policy. Hee inſtances
alſo in the good Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> who as they were
bound, ſo they were commended for their dutie by
God himſelfe, in removing Idols, purging abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
reforming Prieſts, renewing the covenant,
and compelling all Prieſts, Prophets, people, to
ſerve God ſincerely. Many of the learnedeſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
doe not gainſay this evident truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Stapleton</hi> being I ſuppoſe fully convinced of
it, ſeekes to anſwer and avoid it another way.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the times of thraldome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Iews</hi> were governed by the <hi>Perſians.</hi> How far
the <hi>Iews</hi> were left in <hi>Babylon</hi> to the free exerciſe of
their own Religion is uncertain, it may be conceived
that their condition was not always alike under all
Kings, but generally that they found more favour
there, then Chriſtians did afterwards under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Emperours: before this time there is no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Excommunication, or any ſpirituall Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,
wee reade nothing of <hi>Maranathaes,</hi> or
<hi>Anathemaes,</hi> but now perhaps ſome ſuch govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might take place: for where no peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
Miniſtery is, the Magiſtrate is fitteſt to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate
before God, and where no Magiſtracie is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Miniſters are fitteſt to preſerve order. Some
Papiſts that wil undertake to prove any thing out of
any thing alleage <hi>Cain</hi> as an inſtance of Excom. as if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:157098:18"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> were ſo a Prieſt, as that hee were no Prince,
and had power to excommunicate in caſe of ſo
horrid a murder, but not to execute any other Law:
or as if <hi>Moſes</hi> would proceed againſt adultery by
temporall puniſhment, when <hi>Adam</hi> had proceeded
againſt murther by ſpiritual: but not to inſiſt longer
upon theſe conjecturall paſſages, I come to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
days, &amp; his government alſo being Regal, as
wel as Sacerdotall, nay, being rather divine then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I ſhal not ſtay there neither. Our mayn ſtrife is
how the Apoſtles &amp; their ſucceſſors governed after
his Aſcention during the times of perſecution: but
little need to be ſaid hereof: For in Scripture wee
finde the Apoſtles themſelves very humble, and
unlordly, and tranſacting all things (according to
our Saviours command and example) rather by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
and evidence of the ſpirit, then by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and conſtraint, and if any difference was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Biſhop and a Prieſt, it was in outward emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
or majoritie very ſmall: and the very termes
themſelves were promiſcuouſly applyed. In the
next enſuing times alſo wee finde by ancient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
that <hi>Omnia communi Clericorum conſilio age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur:</hi>
and after that Epiſcopacy had gotten ſome
footing, yet, as another ancient teſtimony informes
us, <hi>except â Ordinatione,</hi> ſetting Ordination only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
it challenged no priviledge above Presbyters:
but as I have ſaid before, whatſoever authority did
reſide in the Clergie whilſt temporal rule was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Church, and whilſt miraculous power
of binding and looſing ſinners, and of opening and
ſhutting Heaven was ſupplyed by the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:157098:19"/>
for the emergent neceſſity of thoſe times, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thereof no longer remayning, it ought now to
remayne no longer as it did, but to devolve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into the Tempor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll Rulers hands; from
whence it was not taken by Chriſt, but where it
was then abuſed, and made unprofitable by the
owners themſelves. If wee doe imagine that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> had Epiſcopall power, and by that
Epiſcopall power did ſend out proceſſes, and keep
Courts, and holds pleas of all Teſtamentary, and
Matrimoniall Cauſes, and Tithes, Faſts and all
other which our Biſhops now clayme; and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
all grievances for the preventing of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Church, during the malignity of Secular
power; if wee take all this for granted, though it
be ſome thing too large to be granted, yet ſtill wee
ought to conceive that this power was conferred
upon them not in derogation of Secular authoritie,
but for neceſſities ſake, till Secular authority ſhould
againe come in, and undertake the ſame offices,
which <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were now to performe:
when confuſion cannot otherwiſe bee prevented,
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> ſhall governe, but when it may
be prevented by that authoritie which is moſt
competent, and when more perfect order ſhall bee
more naturally and juſtly induced, what injury is
this to <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus?</hi> Why rather is it not an
eaſe and comfort to them, that they have now lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
more ſeriouſly to attend their own proper fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and miniſtration? <hi>Hookers</hi> owne words are,
<hi>if from the approbation of Heaven the Kings of GODS
own choſen people had in the affaires of the Jewiſh Religion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:157098:19"/>
ſupreame power, why ſhould not Chriſtian Kings have the
like in Chriſtian Religion?</hi> And <hi>Bilſon</hi> having mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the ſupremacie of the Jewiſh Kings, <hi>Hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
the like to the whole function.</hi> Hee ſayes, <hi>it is the
eſſentiall charge of Princes to ſee the Law of God fully
executed, his Son rightly ſerved, his Spouſe ſafely nurſed,
his houſe timely filled, his enemies duly puniſhed,</hi> and this
he ſayes, <hi>as it was by</hi> Moſes <hi>preſcribed, and by</hi> David
<hi>required, ſo it was by</hi> Eſay <hi>propheſied, by Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by</hi> Paul <hi>witneſsed, and by the Primitive Fathers
conſented too.</hi> Hee ſayes further, <hi>that what the Jewiſh
Kings had, Chriſtian Kings ought to enjoy, and therefore
Eſay</hi> (ſays Hee) <hi>propheſying of the Evangelicall times,
foretold that the Church ſhould ſuck the breaſts of Kings
and Queens, and that milk which thoſe breaſts ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
He interprets <hi>to be ſpirituall milk.</hi> Now what
can be added to this, what more excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Regiment then this had <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them by vertue of their Epiſcopall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
What more ſacred, what more ſpirituall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
could they performe in the Church? What
could Gods children ſuck from their breſts other
then milke, then ſincere, ſpirituall milke? Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> agrees to this, when hee ſays <hi>that Kings,
as Kings, ſerve God, ſo as none but Kings can doe,</hi> and
when he confeſſes, <hi>that Chriſt came not to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſovereigntie.</hi> And the Church in <hi>Tertullians</hi>
words, <hi>aſcribing worſhip to their Heathen Emperours,
as being ſecond immediatly to God, and inferiour to none
but God,</hi> ſays as much as words can expreſſe. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of internall ſanctitie <hi>Peter</hi> may be more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:157098:20"/>
then <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſo may <hi>Lazarus</hi> perhaps then
<hi>Peter:</hi> but in regard of that civill ſanctitie which is
viſible to mans eye, <hi>Caeſar</hi> is to be worſhipped more
then <hi>Peter. Caeſar</hi> is to be looked upon as next in
place here to God, betwixt whom and God no
other can have any ſuperiour place. Wiſdome and
goodneſſe are bleſſed graces in the ſight of GOD,
but theſe are more private, and Power is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
more perfect, and publike, and viſible to
man then either: if Miniſters do ſometimes in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and goodneſſe excell Princes, yet in Power
they doe not: and therefore though wiſdome and
goodneſſe may make them more amiable ſomtimes
to God, yet Power ſhall make Princes more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
amongſt men. There is in heaven no need
of Power in the glorified creatures, and yet the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
creatures are there differenced by Power: it
is hard to ſay that one Angell, or Saint differs from
another in wiſdome, or in holineſſe, yet that they
differ in power and glory we all know. The twelve
Patriarchs and the twelve Apoſtles ſit in heaven
upon higher Thrones, then many Saints which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
here in this life might be endued with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
portion of wiſdome, and holineſſe then they
were: and by this it may ſeeme that there is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of externall ſanctitie of power diſpenſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the free power of God even in Heaven
alſo, and that that ſanctity is ſuperiour to the other
more private ſanctity of other graces, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences.
And if power in heavenly creatures where
it is of no neceſſity has ſuch a ſupereminent glory
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:157098:20"/>
appertaining to it, with what veneration ought wee
to entertain it on earth where our common felicitie
and ſafetie does ſo much depend upon it? Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
here wee ſee is a narrow excellence, without
wiſdome, and power: and wiſdome in men that
have neither power, nor goodneſſe, ſcarce profits at
all: but power in infants, in women, in Ideots
hands is of publike uſe, in as much as the wiſdome
and goodneſſe of other men are ready to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by it, and its more naturall that they ſhould
be obſequious and officious in ſerving power, then
that the tranſcendent, incommunicable, indiviſible
Royalty of power, ſhould condiſcend to bee at
their devotion. And for this reaſon when Princes
are ſaid to be <hi>ſolo Deo minores,</hi> and <hi>Deo ſecundi,</hi> this is
ſpoken in regard of power, and this being ſpoken in
regard of power, we muſt conceive it ſpoken of the
moſt perfect excellence, and dignity, and ſanctitie
that can be imagined amongſt men on earth. And
for the ſame reaſon, when Princes are ſaid to ſerve
God as Princes, and ſo to ſerve him as none other
can, we muſt conceive this ſpoken alſo with reſpect
to their power, in as much as wiſdome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in other men cannot promote the glory of
God, and the common good of man, ſo much as
power may in them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Stapleton</hi> takes foure exceptions to thoſe
times, whereby if it bee granted that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Kings had ſupreame Eccleſiaſticall authority, yet
hee ſayes, <hi>it does not follow that our Kings now ought
to have the ſame.</hi> Hee ſayes, firſt, <hi>That the Iewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:157098:21"/>
was of farre leſse dignitie and perfection then ours
is: ours being that truth of which theirs was but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowiſh
prefigurative reſemblance. Our anſwere here is,
that the Religion of the</hi> Jews, <hi>as to the eſſence of it, was
not different from ours, either in dignitie or perfection.
The ſame God was then worſhipped as a Creatour, Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Sanctifier, and that worſhip did conſiſt in the ſame
kinde of love, feare, hope, and beliefe, and the ſame cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and juſtice amongſt men. The Law of Ceremonies,
and externall Rites in the bodily worſhip of God, did dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from our diſcipline, that being more pompous and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious:
but the two great Commandements which were
the effects, and contents of all heavenly, ſpirituall, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible
worſhip, and ſervice, whereby a love towards God
above that of our ſelves, and a love towards man equall
with that of our ſelves was enjoyned, theſe two great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
were then as forcible, and honourable, as they
are now. Sacrifice was but as the garment of Religion,
obedience was the life, the perfection, the dignity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the life, perfection, and dignitie of that obedience
conſiſted then in thoſe weighty matters of the Law, Piety, and
mercie, as it now does; but if the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Religion was
leſſe excellent, and more clogged with ſhadows, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in its outward habit, what argument is this for the
Supremacie of Regall, rather then Sacerdotall power? The
more abſtruſe and dark the forme of that worſhip was, and
the more rigorous ſanctity God had ſtamped upon the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and inſtruments, and formalities of his worſhip, and
the more frequent, and intricate queſtions might ariſe
thereabout, me thinks, the more uſe there was of Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
honour, and prerogative, and the leſse of Regall in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:157098:21"/>
matters of the Lord: I ſee not why this ſhould make Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
more ſpirituall then their Order would beare, but
Prieſts rather.</hi> His ſecond reaſon is. <hi>That all parts
of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Religion, Laws, Sacrifices, Rites, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
being fully ſet down in writing, needing nothing but
execution, their Kings might well have higheſt authoritie,
to ſee that done: Whereas with us there are numbers of
myſteries even in beliefe which were not ſo generally for
them as for us neceſſary to be with ſome expreſſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
underſtood, many things belonging to externall
government, and our ſervice not being ſet down by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ordinances, or written, for which cauſe the State of the
Church doth now require that the ſpirituall authoritie of
Eccleſiaſticall perſons be large, abſolute, and independent.</hi>
This reaſon is every way faulty: for as to matters
of Diſcipline and externall worſhip our Church is
leſſe incumbred with multiplicity of Rites, ſuch as
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals carnall and beggerly rudiments, and
in this reſpect there is the leſſe uſe of Eccleſiaſticall
authoritie amongſt us: and if popiſh Biſhops doe
purpoſely increaſe Ceremonies, that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
their own power, they ought not to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their own fraud. And as for matters of
faith and doctrinall myſteries, we ſay according to
Gods ancient promiſe knowledg doth now abound
by an extraordinary effuſion of Gods Spirit upon
theſe latter dayes; wee are ſo farre from being
more perplexed with ſhadows, and myſticall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities,
or with weighty diſputes, that we are, and
ought to be a great deal leſſe, and we doe the rather
ſuſpect all popiſh traditions, and additions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:157098:22"/>
becauſe wee ſee they make uſe of them for
the augmenting of the power and regiment of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.
And yet if knowledge did not abound, if our
Religion were more cloudie, and if the Scriptures,
Councils, Fathers, and all learning were now more
imperfect to us then they are, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not imagin how an
unco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fined abſolute dominion of Churchmen ſhold
be more neceſſary the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Princes. For if abſolutenes
of power be of neceſſary uſe in intricate perplexed
myſteries &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſies, yet why muſt that abſolute
power be more effectuall in Prieſts then Princes? is
not the counſel of Prelats the ſame, and of the ſame
vigor to ſolve doubts, and determine controverſies,
whether their power be ſubordinate, or not? doth
meer power ad to the knowledg of Prieſts? or is the
power of Prieſts more virtuous for the promoting
of truth, then the power of Magiſtrates? how comes
this vaſt irreconcilable difference betwixt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church and State? In matters
of Law, in matters of policy, in matters of
war, unlimited power in ſuch as are moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and expert does not conduce to the ſafety
of the Common-wealth: ſubordinate Counſells are
held as available for the diſcerning of truth, and far
more available for the conſerving of peace and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And who can then aſſigne any particular ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reaſon, why matters of religion ſhould not as
well be determined in the conſiſtory by dependent
Prelates, as matters of Law are by the Judges and
Juſtices in their tribunals, where they ſit as meere
ſervants to the King?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:157098:22"/>
               <hi>His third exception is:</hi> That God having
armed the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion with a temporall ſword,
and the Chriſtian with that of ſpirituall puniſhment
only, the one with power to impriſon, ſcourge,
put to death, the other with bare authoritie to
cenſure, and excommunicate, there is no reaſon
why our Church which hath no viſible ſword ſhould
in regiment be ſubject unto any other power then only
to that which bindeth and looſeth.</p>
            <p>This reaſon taketh it for granted, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Jewes the Church and State was
the ſame, had the ſame body, the ſame head,
the ſame ſword, and that head was tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and that ſword was materiall. This we
freely accept of: but in the next place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reaſon at all given, it as freely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes,
that Chriſtians now have only a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſword in the Church, as that Jews had
only a temporall one. A diametricall oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
is here put betwizt Jews and Chriſtians
in Church Regiment, and yet no cauſe
ſhewed, or account given of that oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>We have very good colour to argue, that
without ſome ſtrong reaſon ſhewed of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
Chriſtians ought not to bee ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to that excellent diſcipline of the Jewes
which God himſelf ordered, and to introduce
I know not what ſpirituall rule in prejudice of
temporall rule: but how will <hi>Stapleton</hi> prove,
that amongſt Chriſtians the Church and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:157098:23"/>
State are two divided bodies, ſo as they
may admit of two ſeverall heads, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
ſwords, the one temporall the other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
the one yielding precedence as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
the other predominating as ſpirituall?
This wee deſire to ſee fortified with better
proofs.</p>
            <p>Hooker <hi>in his eighth booke not yet publiſht
has a learned cleere diſcourſe to ſhew the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie,
and injuſtice of this blind preſumption.</hi>
Hee allows that a Church is one way, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
another way defined, and that they are
both in nature diſtinguiſht, but not in ſubſtance
perpetually ſevered. Since there is no man <hi>(ſayes
hee)</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but the ſame is
a member of the Common-wealth, nor any of the
Common-wealth, but the ſame is of the Church,
therefore as in a figure triangle, the baſe differs
from the ſides, and yet one and the ſelf-ſame
line, is both a baſe and a ſide: a ſide ſimply, a baſe
if it chance to be the bottome, and to underlie the
reſt. So though properties and actions of one doe
cauſe the name of a Common-wealth, qualities
and functions of another ſort give the name of a
Church to a multitude, yet one and the ſame mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiude
may be both. Thus in <hi>England</hi> there's none
of one Corporation, but hee is of the other alſo, and
ſo it was amongſt the Jews. Two things cauſe this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe profeſsours of the true Religion
ſomtimes live in ſubjection under the falſe, ſo the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:157098:23"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> did in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſo the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi>
under <hi>Nero,</hi> in ſuch caſes true profeſſors doe civilly
only communicate with the State; but in matters of
their Religion they have a communion amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
This now is not our caſe, and therefore theſe
inſtances are not proper amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In all States there is a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſpirituall and temporall affaires and perſons,
but this proveth no perpetuall neceſsity of perſonall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
for the Heathens always had their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Laws and perſons and cauſes ſevered from their
temporall, yet this did not make two independent
States among them: much leſſe doth God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
true Religion to any Nation diſtract it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
into ſeverall independent communities, his end
is only to inſtitute ſeverall functions of one and the
ſame community. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Hooker <hi>moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly,
and profoundly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee muſt not here expect any ſatisfaction
from our Adverſaries, why there ſhould be
leſſe diviſion betweene Church and State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and leſſe uſe of two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſwords, then is amongſt us: 'tis ſufficient
that they have ſaid it. There's no crime ſo
ſcandalous amongſt our Church-men, or
wherein they claime ſo much ſpirituall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of juriſdiction as adultery, yet amongſt
the <hi>Iews</hi> that crime was carnall, not ſpirituall;
and its puniſhment was death inflicted by the
Civill Judge, not damnation denounced by
the Prieſt. Now if adultery in theſe days were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:157098:24"/>
better purged away, and leſſe countenanced in
our Chriſtian Courts then it was amongſt the
Jews, there might ſomething be alleaged to
preferre our moderne inventions before Gods
owne Statutes, but when Eccleſiaſtiall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhall therefore incroach upon Civill, that
by, I know not what, pecuniary corruptions
and commutations, vice, and ſcandall may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
we doe ſtrangly dote to ſuffer it.</p>
            <p>For his laſt reaſon he ſays: <hi>That albeit, whilſt
the Church was reſtrained into one people, it ſeemed
not incommodious to grant their Kings generall
chiefty of power, yet now the Church having ſpread it
ſelf over all Nations great inconvenience muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
grow if every Chriſtian King in his ſeverall Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie
ſhould have the like power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this reaſon its preſumed, that all the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe
ought to have but one head on earth,
and that <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be its Court, and that it
muſt be indued with Oraculous infallibilitie,
and ſo to remayne till the Worlds end: and
this muſt bee admitted out of ſome obſcure
generall Metaphors in Scripture, or elſe God
has not ſufficiently provided for the wiſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his Catholike Church. Man can
ſcarce imagine any thing more miſchievous,
or impoſſible, then that which theſe goodly
Politicians have invented to be profitable, nay
neceſſary for the univerſall government of
Mankind: for what one man can receive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
either in temporall or ſpirituall affaires,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:157098:24"/>
or direct finall, unerring diſpatches to all
the remote climates of the earth at one time?
or what a curſed vexation were it for all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of all languages and cuſtomes to be chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to One City, thither to travell for all finall
determinations, and there to attend confuſed
ſentences, and in the mean time to endure at
home endleſſe diſſentions, and hopeleſſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
under the inſufficient rule of ſubordinate
limited Princes and Biſhops? Surely had <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
preached any ſuch groſſe doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his ragged, barbarous <hi>Arabians,</hi> hee
had never tamed and broken them ſo eaſily to
his wretched uſurpation: Tis wonderfull that
our Anceſtors could drink of ſuch a cup of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication
in the worſt of times, but that the
nauſeous dregs of its bottome ſhould now be
obtruded upon us in theſe golden, ſhining
dayes, is almoſt paſt belief.</p>
            <p>The Pope never yet had the rule of a third
part of the World, but ſo far as hee ha's had it
he ha's given ſufficient teſtimony how inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
great Monarchies are, both to the
Governour, and the governed. And where
the yoke of <hi>Rome</hi> ha's prevailed, what ha's
that infallible judgement, and unlimitable
power, which the Pope pretends to for our
good, what ha's it availed the Church of
God? when the Eaſterne Churches were in
Unitie, this gave them occaſion to depart, and
revolt, but when the rent was, what vertue
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:157098:25"/>
had the Pope to reduce them to unite? The
like may bee asked concerning all Proteſtant
Countries now falne from Romiſh obedience,
nay of al Turks &amp; Heathens not yet ſubdued to
the triple crown; if Chriſt intended the Popes
infallibilitie for the diſcovery of all errors and
hereſies, and his ſupremacie for the ſubjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of al ſuch as would maliciouſly perſevere
in diſcord errours and hereſies, how comes
this intention to be ſo defeated, and fruſtrated?
if the Popes keyes be potent enough for both
theſe purpoſes, why does he not force all men
to come in within his ſheepfold? and if not,
why does he pretend ſo much? Would Chriſt
put into one Biſhops hand an univerſall Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſuch as the World never before heard of,
ſuch as hee himſelfe here on earth never exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
and yet leave it contemptible to the
greateſt part of the World? if ignorance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
and incredulity, let the key of knowledge
aſsiſt us, and bring us into light; if ſtubbornes
and perverſneſſe have hardned our hearts, let
the key of power diſſolve and bruize us: and if
hee can doe neither of theſe, what vertue is
there in the Roman Oracle, what benefit is
there in that prophetick chaire? what priviledge
ha's <hi>Peter</hi> more then <hi>Iohn?</hi> Shall the Citie of
<hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe be upheld and ſecured from ever
erring and falling away, and ſhall not <hi>England,</hi>
ſhall not <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhall not all Nations be the
like? The power of the Pope is the ſame in all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:157098:25"/>
Countries, if it faile in <hi>England,</hi> it may faile at
<hi>Rome;</hi> if it faile not at <hi>Rome,</hi> it would not faile
in <hi>England,</hi> but that the Pope is leſſe propitious.
O why ſhould his mercy bee more narrow,
then his vertue? O let him once againe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
aſcend his reverent chaire, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate
generall Councils, and there poure
out the treaſures of his inſpired breaſt let him
there give judgements as cleere, pure, irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and as obvious to humane apprehenſion as
Scripture it ſelf, nay, if ſomething more ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
then Scripture be neceſſary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of all our ſtrifes, let him give us Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in a phraſe more powerful then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
ever uſed, and preſcribe rules more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
then God himſelfe, or Chriſt in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
ever preſcribed, and if Kings and
Emperours ſtill make reſiſtance, let him put on
his robes of Majeſty and terrour, let him paſſe
over them as Serpents and Baſilisks, whilſt the
ſtroke of his foot upon the earth fils all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
with battalions of armed men: nay if ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall
forces come not in faſt enough, let him
ſhake the Heavens with the thunder of his
voice, and call downe Seraphims to his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and let the higheſt orders of Heaven
give teſtimony to his earthly Deity. I might
frame the like expoſtulations after a ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our own Prelats alſo, but I forbeare:
for if God ha's given them ſole knowledge
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:157098:26"/>
to determine all controverſies, and power to
enact all Eccleſiaſticall Canons, doubtleſſe hee
ha's given them ſome binding coercive force
correſpondent thereunto: and if ſo, why doe
they not expel all diſſention by it? if their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
extend no further then to exhortation, why
do they urge commands upon us? if they have
a commanding power, why do they not ſecond
it with due compulſion?</p>
            <p>And as this is ſufficient to prove indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
power due to Chriſtian Princes in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
whatſoever, ſo Hiſtorie makes it as plaine
that Chriſtian Princes at their firſt entrance,
till Popery beganne to intoxicate them, did
clayme, and exerciſe the ſame as their due.
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> had <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> given him
for his Title, and wee know hee ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
no leſſe, and wee know his Succeſſours
for divers Ages did aſſume and verifie the ſame
Title as their due. And therefore <hi>Bilſon</hi> proves
out of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and other Hiſtorians, <hi>That in
the Primitive Chriſtian Emperours times all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
affairs did depend upon Emperours: and that
the greateſt Synods, and Councels were called at their
appointment: and that Appeals from Councels were
reſerved to them, and ſometimes over-ruled by them:
and that all Eccleſiaſticall Laws were by them ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
confirmed, and repealed; and that the greateſt
Prelates were by them ordered, and commanded: and
that whole Provinces and Kingdomes were by them

And this truth, the learnedſt of Papiſts will nor deny, and
thoſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> do deny the ſame rely upon ſome particular excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
onely, and have very few inſtances before the Popes
inthronization at <hi>Rome,</hi> and theſe of matters of fact, and
not rights alledged neither. <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Elder is one
maine Inſtance, and he when ſtrife was betweene the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and the Orthodox Chriſtians would not take upon him
to determine the ſame, his modeſt Anſwer was, <hi>non eſt
meum judicare inter Epiſcopos,</hi> And <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayes of him;
<hi>Inhabilem ſe ponderi tanti putabat eſſe Iudicii. Valentinian</hi> here
was a pious Emperor and Orthodox, but his blame was (as
<hi>Socrates</hi> juſtly taxes him) that though he honoured thoſe that
were of his true faith, and ſound opinion, yet he in the meane
time let the <hi>Arians</hi> doe what they liſt. And this cannot
be excuſed, for if hee was doubtfull of his owne faith, this
was ignorance: and if Hee was not, and yet tolerated <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi>
this was neglect in him: and if he did ſhunne this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
as burthenſome to him, this was impious: and if as
intricate, this was inconſiderate. For what if hee could not
judge as a Biſhop, could not he therefore judge by Biſhops;
was not the learning and knowledge of all Biſhops, at his
command to be imployed, as if it were his owne? Biſhops
themſelves might erre, and diſſent, and in that point many
of them did erre, and hold againſt the truth: and without his
ayde this diviſion was irreconcileable; but by his influence
and ſuperintendence; truth might obtaine a faire tryall, and
Biſhops themſelves might be convinced by Biſhops. This
caſe in Divinity might be too intricate for his ſole judgment,
and too pondrous for his actuall determination: but what he
could not doe ſingle, and perſonally, Hee might well effect
by the counſell and advice of his moſt moderate, and diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed
Clergie: for in Divinity the Prince is as in juridicall,
or Martiall affaires, As he is not alwayes the ableſt Divine,
ſo neither is he the ableſt Lawyer, nor the ableſt Souldier,
and yet by the advice of Divines, Lawyers, and Souldiers,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:157098:27"/>
He may conclude that wiſely which neither He without them
nor they without him could ever have concluded. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
againſt this remiſſe, cold ſlackneſſe, and haeſitancy of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi>
we may oppoſe the politike, and couragious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius</hi> and diverſe other pious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
who all did compoſe debates, and end controverſies, and
vindicate Truth and Religion from many errors and abuſes,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> otherwiſe had bin endleſſe, and remedileſſe. After the firſt
5. or 6. hundred yeares <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> began to invade the rights of
Royalty by the Sophiſtications, and impoſtures of the See
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and till this laſt Age, Princes almoſt every where
did blindly and ſuperſtitiouſly too farre abandon their owne
right, but by the light of Nature, the wiſeſt Kings in all
Countryes were ever the moſt refractory, and moſt impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of the Popes tyranny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the moſt ignorant times,
ſome there were found, that made reſiſtance to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Much bloud was ſhed upon this Theme in diverſe other
Countries, and even in our own ſtories we find, that though
<hi>England</hi> was prone otherwiſe to be the Popes Aſſe, yet in the
quarrell of ſupremacy it was jealous, and had almoſt perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
conflicts. I will only cite one ſtory. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond
was a very puiſſant Prince, and in all other things except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Eccleſiaſticall. He was fortunate and victorious: but his
miſery was, that He raigned in ſuch an Age as the Pope was
in his Zenith, and had to doe with <hi>Becket</hi> of all the Popes
dependents the moſt ſeditious. <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of the greatneſſe of his Spirit and wit, had paſſed
theſe Lawes; That no Appeal ſhould ſtand, That no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
ſhould go out of the Realme, That no Tenant <hi>in Capite</hi>
ſhould bee excommunicated; That no officiall of the Kings
ſhould be interdicted without the Kings leave, and conſent,
And that Clergimen ſhould be ſubject to ſecular judgement,
and that Lay-men under the King, ſhould judge of Tythes,
and other cauſes Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
            <p>At theſe juſt and neceſſary Lawes, the Clergie hitherto
reſted quiet, if not contented, but now a moſt rebellious
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:157098:27"/>
               <hi>Becket</hi> ariſes to ſpurne againſt them, and in his mouth they
are dangerous incroachments, and breaches upon the
Church. Rather than hee will ſubſcribe to theſe ſo long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht
Lawes; He departs the Kingdome in contempt of
the King, and with all violence and bitterneſſe that may bee
incenſes the Pope, the King of <hi>France,</hi> and all the <hi>Italian</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> Biſhops againſt his naturall Lord. The King at firſt
gallantly relyes upon the edge of his temporall ſword, and
whets it ſharper in behalfe of his legall prerogative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for
ſome yeares together ſtands out againſt the danger of the
Popes confounding blow; but at laſt when <hi>Becket</hi> the fierce
Traytor was ſlaine, through the execrations and anathemas
of the Pope, and by the threats and exclamations of the
King of <hi>France,</hi> and diverſe other Biſhops and Potentates;
He is beaten from his ground, ſwearing fealty to the Pope
and his ſucceſſors, and admitting of Appeales to <hi>Rome.</hi> Long
it was before hee would ſubmit himſelfe in this conteſtation
betwixt a ſubject, and himſelfe to the Romiſh Tribunall, or
yeeld to any condemnation being untryed, and unheard; and it
appeares by the <hi>Popes</hi> forbearance of his laſt thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbolt, that
the Pope was diffident in his power, and durſt not ſentence
him, if He had not yeelded before the ſentence. But I leave
<hi>Popery,</hi> &amp; come now to our reformed times. The dead time of
night being now over, <hi>Luther</hi> began to crow in <hi>Germany,</hi> and
to give notice of light ready to dawn upon the Earth: and no
ſooner did that light appeare, but that diverſe Princes began
to awake, and to ſhake off that blind ſervitude of <hi>Rome</hi> which
had ſo long layne upon them, and lock'd up their ſenſes like
a deepe ſleepe: How be it the light was not alike welcome
to all, ſome fully and wholly gave it entertainement, others
opened ſome Curtaines onely, and ſo yeelded themſelves
to a little further ſlumber. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was well pleaſed with that Doctrine which diſcovered
his owne independence, and the weakeneſſe of the Popes
Prerogative: but thoſe further monſtrous, deformed errors,
and ſuperſtitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are founded upon its abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:157098:28"/>
Prerogative, and are as inconſiſtent with light, as the
Prerogative it ſelfe; He tooke no delight to looke upon. So
farre as his owne intereſt, and worldly advantage was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by the beames of the Goſpell, ſo farre his eyes
thought it amiable And ſo farre Biſhop <hi>Gardiner</hi> though a
Biſhop was ready to aſſiſt him: but ſo farre as his ſpirituall
intereſt, and the generall advantage of his Subjects was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
ſo farre, Hee and <hi>Gardiner</hi> both could remaine as
blind as Sir <hi>Thomas More:</hi> Tis wonderfull that ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted
a man, as Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> was, ſhould lay downe
his life in juſtification of the Popes ſupremacie; but tis more
wonderfull that <hi>Gardiner</hi> ſhould ſee the weakeneſſe of that
ſupremacie, and yet ſtill adhere to diverſe other Popiſh
ſuperſtitions as abſurdly reſulting from the ſame principles.
The State of <hi>Venice</hi> alſo out of meere policy has long been
at defiance with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo farre as meere rules
of Government guide, and direct it: but in all other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
deluſions, and impoſtures it is as dead, as heavie-eyed,
as ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Spaine, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> alſo, though they
ſpeake not the ſame, yet they now doe the ſame as <hi>Venice,</hi>
they all ſhut up and impale the Popes Authority within <hi>Peters</hi>
Patrimony, leaving him no command but within his owne
<hi>Italian</hi> territories, and yet beſides his authority they caſt off
nothing elſe: ſo much doe we generally eſteeme Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Heaven, and our temporall advantages before the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of our ſoules. But let reaſon of State bee what it will,
The Parliament here agrees to annex to the Crowne of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the eighth and his ſucceſſors whatſoever ſole, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
power was before challenged in Eccleſiaſticall and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things by the Pope, or any Church-Man whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
And <hi>Hooker</hi> ſeemes both to confeſſe and juſtifie the
ſame, for ſayes H, <hi>Our Kings of</hi> England <hi>when they are to take
poſſeſsion of the Crown, have it painted out before their eyes, even
by the very ſolemnities, and rights of their inauguration, to what
affaires by the ſame Law their ſupreme power and authority
reaches. Crowned we ſee they are, and Inthronized, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:157098:28"/>
the Crowne a ſigne of Military dominion, the Throne
of ſedentary or Iudiciall, The Oyle of Religious, and ſacred
power.</hi> Hee here Attributes as ſupreme a rule, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
in Religious and ſacred affaires, as Hee does
either in Military, or Iudiciall, and hee accounts that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Ceremony of Vnction, as proper to the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
as that of Crowning, or Inthroning.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, it is now a great objection againſt this
chiefly of Dominion, that it may deſcend to Infants under
age, as it did to King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth: Or to Women, as
to Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and whatſoever wee may
allow to men, ſuch as <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, yet it ſeemes unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
to allow it Women, and Children. The Papiſts
thinke this objection of great moment, and therefore <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
in great diſdaine caſts it out, that in <hi>England</hi> they had
a certaine Woman for their Biſhop: meaning by that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Q. <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> And Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her ſelfe knowing what
an <hi>odium</hi> that word would draw upon her, both amongſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
and many Proteſtants alſo, conſults her Biſhops about
it, and by their advice ſets forth a declaration, certifying the
world thereby, that ſhee claymed no other Head-ſhip in the
Church, but ſuch as might exclude all dependency upon
forreigne Head-ſhips, and ſecure her from all danger of being
depoſed.</p>
            <p>How this paper could ſatisfie all, I cannot ſee: My
thinkes the Biſhops in this did as warily provide for their
owne clayme, as the Queenes: for whatſoever power
Shee had in the Church, it was either abſolute, Coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate,
or Subordinate. If it was ſubordinate, Shee was in
danger of depoſition, and was to bee ordered, and limited,
and commanded by her Superior. If her power was Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate;
She had no more power over her equall, than
her equall had over her: and it being as lawfull for her equall
to countermand, as it was for her to command: her power
would be as eaſily diſabled and made fruſtrate by her equalls,
as her equalls by hers. In the laſt place therefore if her power
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:157098:29"/>
or headſhip were abſolute, why did not her Biſhops uphold
and declare the ſame? Such dallying with indefinite expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and dazelling both our ſelves &amp; others with meere am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities
does often very great harme, for uncertainty in Law
is the Mother of confuſion, and injuſtice, and this is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of uncertainty. According to this obſcure declaration
of ſupremacy in the Queenes paper many Papiſts at this day
take the Oath penned in the Statute for that purpoſe: they
will abjure the Popes ſupremacy, as to depoſition of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
but not in any thing elſe: and they will hold the King
ſupreme, as to all depoſers, but not as to all men elſe. Thoſe
which are not bloudy, and dangerous, but by the light of
nature abhorre regicides, reſt themſelves upon theſe ſhallow
diſtinctions: but ſuch as are Ieſuitically furious, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous,
break through them as meere Cobwebs: and the more
ſecure Princes are from the other, the leſſe ſafe they are from
theſe. Theſe men will ſtill inſiſt upon abſolute ſupremacy
ſomewhere to reſt; and that it cannot reſt in Women, or
Minors, they will ſtill inſiſt upon this argument, If the
Queene be not competent for that lower Order to whom the
Word and Sacraments are committed, then ſhee is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
for that higher Order which has power over the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
but the Queene is not competent for the lower, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not for the higher. They ſay, that to preſcribe Lawes
to Preachers is more than to preach: and to have power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Ordination is ſomething greater, than to enter into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and therefore the Law cannot juſtly give that which is
more, and greater, when God denyes that which is inferior,
and leſſe. Our Divines make a very ſhort unſatisfying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to this. Their reply is, that though our Biſhops owe
ſome kind of ſubjection to Kings, yet the authority of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not from Kings, but from Chriſt Himſelfe,
Chriſt they ſay, giveth the Commiſſion, Kings give but a
permiſſion only. All the power at laſt of our Kings, which
is acknowledged equall with that of the Iewiſh, and has been
ſo farre all this while magnified, and defended againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:157098:29"/>
inables them now no further, than to a naked permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in religious affaires, their moſt energeticall influence is
permiſſion.</p>
            <p>Tis true, the Commiſſion of the Apoſtle was from <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
His <hi>Ite &amp; docete,</hi> was their authority: And ſo it remaines ſtill
to all their ſucceſſors; but is it therefore a reaſon, that there
is now, no other Commiſſion neceſſary? Where <hi>Chriſts</hi>
Commiſſion was particular, it was good without any other
humane commmiſſion, nay permiſſion it ſelfe was not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite:
the Contents of that Commiſſion was not only <hi>Ito, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceto:</hi>
but <hi>Tu Petre, Tu Paule,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ito, doceto:</hi> but now there
remaines nothing of that Commiſſion, but the generality,
<hi>Ito, doceto:</hi> the particularity requires now particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
and meere permiſſions will not ſerve the turne. And
as for ſucceſſion, we may ſuppoſe that our Saviours firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
was vigorous, as to that purpoſe, but we muſt know,
That the Apoſtles being both Governours and Preachers, all
that commiſſion which was given them as Governours, was
not given them as Preachers. There muſt ſtill be ſucceſſors
to the Apoſtles in Governing, and Preaching: but its not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the ſame men now ſhould ſucceed in both offices,
and that whatſoever was commanded or granted to the one
office, the ſame ſhould bee granted and commanded to the
other The Civill Iudges and Councellors of State under
the King are not without Generall Commiſſions from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to doe juſtice, and preſerve order in their ſeverall ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
ſtations, and yet they depend upon particular commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
too from Gods immediate Vice-Gerent. And it ſeemes
to me a weake preſumption, that Officers in Religion ſhould
have more particular Commiſſions from GOD, than
Officers of State: or that Princes ſhould bee more permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and leſſe influent by way of power in the Church, than
in the Common-Wealth. He that obſerves not a difference
betwixt theſe times under Chriſtian Princes, and thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unbeleeving <hi>Caeſars,</hi> is very blind, and He is no leſſe, that
thinks particular Commiſſions now as neceſſary when Princes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:157098:30"/>
joyne to propagate the Goſpell, as they were when ſupreme
power was abuſed for its ſubverſion: And ſo makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt a <hi>Nero,</hi> and a <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Did <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
gaine the ſtyle of Head-Biſhop, or Biſhop of Biſhops meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by permitting the true worſhip of God? And let us lay
aſide the ſtrangenes of the Name, and apply the thing, I
meane the ſame Epiſcopall power to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as
was to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and what abſurdity will follow? What is
intended by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which may not bee as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
applyed to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as to <hi>Conſtantine?</hi> If the
Patriarchs, and Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and firſt Chriſtian Emperors
had juriſdiction, and a legiſlative power in the Church, nay
had dominion over all thoſe which did exerciſe judiciall
power in the Church, and were ſo exalted in ſanctity, and
dignity above meere Prieſts, ſhall Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> bee bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and diſabled for the ſame power and honour meerely by
the prejudice of her Sex? The very Papiſts themſelves do
grant to ſome Abbatiſſes power of juriſdiction over ſome
Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and this power they hold to be more
honourable, than that of ſuborninate Monkes, and Prieſts
which officiate under them; and yet to officiate they will
not grant to Abbatiſſes, though they grant more than to
officiate. Therefore wee ſee this rule doth not alwayes
hold; that Hee which may not undertake the leſſer charge,
ſhall not undertake the greater; for the meere ſanctity of the
perſon is not alwayes that which gives Law in theſe caſes.
Though the perſon bee not voyd of ſanctity, yet ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unfitneſſe, and defect may ſtop and barre in leſſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and yet bee no ſtop, nor bar at all in matters of a
more excellent, and ſublime nature. So it is with Infants
and VVomen, though the poſſeſſion of a Crowne be more
ſacred and honourable, than admiſſion into Orders; yet they
ſhall bee held more capable of a Crowne, than of Orders;
becauſe perſonall imbecillity, and naturall inferiority (as I
may ſo ſay) is leſſe prejudiciall in civill, than in religious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
and in matters of function and ſervice, than in matters
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:157098:30"/>
of priviledge, and command. God had confined the right
and honour of the Prieſt-hood amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to one
Tribe, and Family onely, and therefore <hi>Vzziab</hi> might not
invade that right, and honour to the infringing of Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
command, and in this reſpect <hi>Vzziah</hi> was qualified for
a Scepter, yet not qualified for a cenſer; He was qualified for
that authority which was more ſacred, yet not for that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which was leſſe. So perhaps it is now under the Goſpell,
women are expreſly barred from the Altar, that very Sex is
preciſely excluded, and excepted againſt by God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they may
not Miniſter in the Church: yet this is no exception, but that
they may Raigne in the Throne, and yet this ſeemes not to
prove that that miniſtration is more holy, than this raigning,
but rather that it is more difficult, and ſuch as requires more
perſonall ability, and naturall perfection. For let <hi>Vzziahs</hi> caſe
over-rule us. That w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> diſabled <hi>Vzziah</hi> for the ſervice of the
Altar was not perſonall incompetence, or want of ſanctity:
for then the ſame had diſabled him for all higher, and more
excellent offices. But we know that <hi>Vzziah</hi> was not ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled:
for he was capable of the Scepter, and by vertue of
his Scepter, the whole Temple, and all the ſacred things ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
all the Order of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> the whole Law
of God, and the ſtate of Religion, and Policy, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
welfare of all Gods holy beloved people were within
his guard, and protection, And will any man conceive this
to be leſſe excellent, than to ſacrifice? By vertue of the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Moſes</hi> did conſecrate Prieſts to ſerve at the Altar, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
their ſervice at the Altar: by vertue of the Scepter
<hi>Salomon</hi> did build, and dedicate the very Temple, and Altar
it ſelfe, with his owne mouth, bleſſe both them, and thoſe
Prieſts which were to attend them: by vertue of the Scepter,
<hi>Vzziah</hi> himſelfe did inherit the ſame power, and holineſſe,
and dignity which <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Salomon,</hi> or any of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
had, And ſhal all this ſeeme leſſe worthy and excellent to
us, than to ſerve with a cenſer? In this <hi>Hooker</hi> fully concurres
with me. He diſtinguiſhes betweene an Ordinary and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:157098:31"/>
Iudge, and He allowes it unfit for Princes to ſit as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Iudges in matters of Faith and Religion: and yet hee
denies not their ſupreme right and influence of judging. For
(ſayes H.) an Ordinary Iudge muſt be of qualities, which
in a ſupreme Iudge are not neceſſary, becauſe the perſon of
One is charged with that, which the others meere authority
diſchargeth, without imploying himſelfe perſonally therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It is an error to thinke that the Kings authority can have no
force in doing that, which himſelfe perſonally may not doe:
for it is impoſſible, that at one and the ſame time, that the
King ſhould order ſo maine and different affaires, as by His
power every where preſent are ordered in Peace and Warre;
at home, and abroad.</p>
            <p>And the King in regard of Nonage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be unable
to performe that thing wherein yeares of diſcretion are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
for perſonall action, and yet his authority is ſtill of
force: And therefore it is a maxime, that the Kings authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
never dyes, or ceaſes from working.</p>
            <p>Sundry conſiderations then may be effectuall to hold
the Kings perſon from being a doer of that, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his power muſt give force unto. In civill affaires
nothing doth more concerne the duty, or better beſeeme the
Majeſty of Kings, than perſonally to adminiſter juſtice. Yet
if it bee in caſe of Felony, and Treaſon; Lawyers affirme
<hi>(Stanford l. 2. c. 3.)</hi> that well may the King commit his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to an other, to judge betweene him, and the offender:
but the King being himſelfe there a party, cannot perſonally
ſit there to pronounce judgement. Here we ſee ſometimes
the King cannot be poſſibly preſent to act his part, ſometimes
defect of knowledge may hinder him, ſometimes other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
as being a party, and the like, may barre him from
doing thoſe things, which notwithſtanding by his ſubſtitute
power muſt bee done: and yet this preferres not ſubſtitutes
before him. So in <hi>Vzziahs</hi> caſe, the Prieſt-hood was for
very ſufficient reaſons in policy, ſevered from the Kingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and that by Gods owne approbation, and command,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:157098:31"/>
               <hi>Vzziah</hi> ſhall not now conjoyne, and unite them again out of a
fond pragmaticall humor to the diſ-inheriting of the Tribe
of <hi>Levi,</hi> to the diſſervice of the Crowne, to the hinderance
of Religion, and to the violation of Gods command. If
<hi>Vzziah</hi> will content himſelfe to move in his owne ſuperior
Orbe, and leave the Prieſts of God to their owne regular
ſubordinate motions, his influence ſhall give vigor to thoſe
actions in them, which are with more honour to him done
by them under his ſuperintendence than by himſelfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
For as the Ordinary Iudge deputed by the King, in
caſes where the King Himſelfe either cannot be preſent, or
hath not skill to determine, or may not legally intereſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
does give judgment, not by vertue of his owne, but by
vertue of the Kings authority, and does therefore acquire
more honour to his Majeſty, than to himſelfe: So in the
Church the Prieſt miniſtring in that imployment, which in
all places the King cannot miniſter in, and which is too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for ſome Kings to miniſter in, and prohibited to others,
yet is not hereby greater or holyer than the King, but even in
his very actuall adminiſtration it ſelfe, He is ſo dependent, and
derives ſuch vertue from the Kings ſupreme, ſpirituall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that the King is ſupreme, and he but the ſecondary agent
therein. But Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> will yet ſay, that the Prieſt in
the worke of converſion winnes the ſoule to a willing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and that the Princes worke only by externall, politicall
terror, which begets not <hi>virtutis amorem,</hi> but only <hi>formidinem
panae,</hi> and therefore it ſeemes that the worke of the Miniſter
and the Prince, differ not only in order, but alſo in kinde, the
one being far more ſpirituall and divine than the other. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
hereunto, that if power doth only induce a ſervile feare
of puniſhment, and ſo cauſe of forcible forbearance of ſin, and
if preaching only make a voluntary conqueſt upon the ſoule,
then by the ſame reaſon, the power of Biſhops as well as the
power of Civill Magiſtrates is of leſſe value than preaching:
but this none of our adverſaries will agree to. My next
anſwer therefore is, that Preachers in the wonderfull worke
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:157098:32"/>
of regeneration are not in the nature of Phyſicall cauſes, they
are rather in the nature of the meaneſt inſtrumentall cauſes
under GOD: they are but as Veſſels in the hand of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
men, from whence the ſeed Corne is throwne into the
ground. If the Corne fall into the furrow, and there fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
God opens and enlives the wombe of the Earth, God
ſends ſhowres and influence from Heaven, God bleſſes the
ſeeds with a generative, multiplying vertue, nay God caſts it
into the furrow, from the mouth of the Preacher, and as He
uſes the mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h of the Preacher, for the effuſion of his grain;
ſo He uſes the Princes power as his Plough, to breake and
prepare the ground: and in this caſe, the uſe and ſervice of the
plough is as Noble, as that of the Buſhell.</p>
            <p>Neither is the office of Kings the leſſe Glorious, becauſe
they can uſe force; nor Miniſters the more Glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they may uſe none but ethicall Motives, and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
for power it ſelfe being a Glorious, Divine thing, it
cannot bee ignoble to uſe it in Gods cauſe. And therefore
wee ſee <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and other good Kings are commended for
uſing compulſion: and diverſe other Kings which uſed it
not for the removing of Idolatry, and ſuppreſſing of the high
places, did grievouſly offend God, and draw curſes upon
themſelves, and their ſubjects. And whereas it is objected
that force and compulſion reſtraineth only from the act of ſin,
but reſtraineth not the will from the liking thereof. We ſee
common experience teaches us the contrary. For <hi>Scotland,
Holland, Denmarke, Sweden, Bohemia, England, &amp;c.</hi> Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
great changes of Religion within a ſhort ſpace, and theſe
changes were wrought by the force of civill Magiſtrates, and
could never elſe without ſtrange miracles from Heaven have
been ſo ſoone compaſſed: but theſe changes are not the leſſe
Cordiall, and ſincere, becauſe civill authority wrought them.
Authority it ſelfe hath not ſo rigorous a ſway over the ſoules
of men, as to obtrude diſliked Religions univerſally: it muſt
perſwade as well as compell, and convince, as well as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eat alterations cannot eaſily, and ſuddainly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:157098:32"/>
bee perfected. And in this reſpect the Proclamations of
Princes become of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>entimes the moſt true, and powerfull
preaching that can be: and tis beyond all doubt, that if prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
were as a Phyſicall cauſe in the act of regeneration of
ſinners, or reformation of Nations, yet the edicts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Princes are ſometimes more efficacious Sermons
than any which wee heare from out our Pulpits. For let us
ſuppoſe that a conſiderable number of our Miniſters were ſent
into <hi>Mexico,</hi> or <hi>Perue,</hi> to preach the Goſpell of Chriſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the poore blinde Savages, could wee hope for ſo
great ſucceſſe thereby without the concurrence of ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there, as we might, if ſome of them would aſſiſt, and
joyne to advance the ſame word and doctrine by their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and power, which our Miniſters ſhould publiſh with
their art, and eloquence? If we caſt our eyes back upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, alſo we ſhall ſee that before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> favoured
Religion, the Goſpell ſpread but ſlowly, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a wonderfull confluence of heavenly ſignes and miracles,
wrought by our Saviour, and his Diſciples; all which we
may ſuppoſe had never bin in ſuch plentifull meaſure ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the world, had it not bin to countervaile the enemity and
oppoſition of ſecular authority.</p>
            <p>And it may be conceived, that had the <hi>Caeſars</hi> joyned
in the propagation of CHRISTS Doctrine, more
might have beene effected for the advantage of Religion by
their co operation, than all Chriſts Apoſtles, Biſhops, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Evangeliſts, and other Elders did effect by their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
gifts and ſupernaturall endowments. We ſee alſo
that <hi>Conſtantines</hi> converſion was of more moment, and did
more conduce to the proſperity, and dilatation of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
than all the labours, and endeavours of thouſands of
Preachers, and Confeſſors, and Martyrs which before had
attempted the ſame. And to deſcend to our late reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wee ſee <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, though very young, in a
ſhort time diſpelled the miſts of Popiſh error and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and when no men were more adverſe to the Truth than
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:157098:33"/>
the Clergy, yet He ſet up the banner thereof in all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and redeemed millions of ſoules from the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Hell, and <hi>Rome.</hi> In the like manner Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
alſo, though a woman, yet was as admirable an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God in the ſame deſigne, and what ſhe did in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
diverſe other Princes about the ſame time did the like in
many other large dominions: whatſoever was effected by
miracles in the hand of Miniſters, after our Saviour, the ſame
if not greater matters were ſooner expedited by the ordinary
power and wiſdome of Princes, when Miniſters were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
oppoſite thereunto.</p>
            <p>And as we ſee the ſpirituall power of Princes how ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevalent it is for the truth, ſo ſometimes we ſee moſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
effects of the ſame againſt the truth. Religion was not
ſooner reformed by <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, than it was deformed
againe by Queene <hi>Mary.</hi> And though many godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
were here then ſetled, as appeares by their martyrdoms:
yet all thoſe Miniſters could not uphold Religion with all
their hands ſo ſtrongly as Queene <hi>Mary</hi> could ſubvert it with
one finger of her hand onely. One fierce King of <hi>Spaine</hi>
bound himſelfe in a curſed oath to maintaine the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to extirpate all contrary Doctrines out of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines:
if many pious Miniſters could have defeated this oath,
doubtleſſe it had not ſo farre prevailed, as it doth: but now
wee may with teares bewaile in behalfe of that wofull Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
that one Kings enmity in Religion, is more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
than a thouſand Miniſters zeale is advantagious. And
by the way let all Princes here take notice what a dreadfull
account of ſoules, God is likely to call them to: Fort is not
the Clergy that are ſo immediately and generally reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
when Religion is oppreſſed, or not cheriſhed, and when
ſoules are miſled, and ſuffered to goe aſtray, the abuſes of the
very Clergy it ſelfe will be only ſet upon the Princes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
for according to that vaſt ſpirituall power which He
hath put into their hands, yea according to that vaſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
power, ſo will God certainly require at their hands. Let
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:157098:33"/>
Princes know that preaching is not the onely meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
nor are Miniſters the only Preachers, nor that the
Sacraments are therefore efficacious becauſe the Clergy only
may adminiſter them; Let them know that though Miniſters
call themſelves only ſpirituall Perſons, and the Lot of <hi>God,</hi>
and the Church of Chriſt, and put them into the number of
Temporall, and Lay-men, and limit them to ſecular things:
yet God will not be ſo abuſed; they muſt make an anſwer
to him for things moſt ſpirituall, and for the improvement of
thoſe graces and prerogatives which belong to Gods moſt
beloved inheritance, and honoured ſervants, and neere Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in his Church. And let Miniſters alſo on the other ſide
learne to acknowledge that Character of Divinity which is
ſo much more fairely ſtamped upon Princes, than it is upon
them, and let them not rob Princes of that influence in ſacred
things: which they of themſelves can never injoy. For as
Princes ſhall anſwer for them if they imploy their power to
the depreſſion of Miniſters; ſo ſhall Miniſters alſo anſwer
for Princes if they coſen Princes out of their ſupreme power,
out of pretenſe that Gods meſſage is ſo delivered to them.
Let Miniſters aſſiſt Princes in their religious and ſpirituall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
as <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> did <hi>Moſes.</hi> Let them not contend
for ſupremacy in the higheſt offices of devotion, but like
humble ſervants let them account it their moſt ſupreme ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to attend upon that ſupremacy. Let them in the moſt
glorious ſervices of Religion looke upon Princes, as <hi>Ioab</hi> did
upon his Maſter in martiall exployts. Let them be jealous
of themſelves, that no part of honour due to the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
power of Princes, may reſt upon the ſecondary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
but returne to the firſt and higheſt movers. And thus
ſhal more honour and ſanctity paſſe from Miniſters to Kings,
and more efficacy and vertue from Kings to Miniſters, and
more grace and happineſſe from both to the people.</p>
            <p>Another occaſion of miſtake, and error in <hi>Nazianzen,</hi>
and <hi>Bilſon</hi> ſeemes to be, that in comparing the great fruits of
Princes, and Prieſts, in their ſeverall functions, they both
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:157098:34"/>
ſpeake of the whole order of Prieſt hood: as if every <hi>Prince</hi>
were therefore leſſe ſpirituall, or excellent than every Prieſt,
becauſe all Prieſts in ſome things excell ſome <hi>Princes.</hi> If we
ſpeak of a <hi>Prince</hi> and all the Clergy within his dominion,
perhaps we may ſay he is <hi>univerſis minor,</hi> and yet he may be
<hi>ſingulis major:</hi> perhaps he may not doe ſo much good in the
Church as all his Clergy, yet he may doe more than a great
number of them. And yet for my part, I am of opinion,
that all the Clergie are ſo dependent, and borrow ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
from the Kings ſupreme ſpirituality (as I may ſo ſay)
that whatſoever good they doe, they ought not to let the
honour thereof terminate in them, but returne to him upon
whom they depend. And now I thinke, theſe things being
made cleere, that Princes are ſacred in reſpect of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
rule, and ſpirituall in reſpect of their ſpirituall rule,
and that Prieſts have no proper rule at al over mens ſpirits, or
in any Eccleſiaſticall caſes, but derivative, and ſubordinate to
<hi>Princes.</hi> I may conclude, that there can be no office, nor acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo ſacred upon Earth, for which <hi>Princes</hi> are incompetent
in reſpect of perſonall ſanctity.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as it is moſt erroneous to argue, that <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
are not capable of ſpirituall rule, becauſe their perſons
are not holy enough: So it is moſt undenyably true, and
we may ſafely argue, on the contrary, that no mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
can bee more holy than ſuch as God hath honoured,
and intruſted with ſuch ſupremacy of ſpirituall rule, as He
hath done <hi>Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe next argument which raiſes the Miter above the
Diadem is drawne from the power of the Church in
Excommunication: and it is framed thus. That ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
which makes Princes to be above the Church, and
free from Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, is abſurd; but ſuch is here
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:157098:34"/>
maintained, <hi>Ergo:</hi> by the word Church may be meant the
Catholike Church, or ſome Nationall Church: The
Church Triumphant, or the Church Militant: th Church
which was from the beginning, and ſhall be to the end, or the
Church which now is. We apply the Title of Head ſhip to
Princes over no Churches but ſuch as are under their preſent
Dominions, and that Head-ſhip we account ſubordinate to
Chriſts, and we allow with Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in ſome ſenſe,
that the King is <hi>Intra,</hi> and not <hi>ſupra Eccleſiam:</hi> For he is not
ſuch an univerſall ſupreme Head as Chriſt is, but is a member
under Chriſt the Head. Yet this impugnes not, but that the
King may in an other ſenſe be both <hi>intra,</hi> and <hi>ſupra,</hi> as to his
owne dominions: for take the Church for Eccleſiaſticall
perſons, and ſo the King may governe all under Chriſt, but
take it for Eccleſiaſticall graces, and ſo the King may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
He may be ſuperior to Prieſts, yet acknowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority
to Scripture, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore with
that of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> may well ſtand; Thou
raigneſt King together with Chriſt: Thou ruleſt together
with him; Thy ſword is from him; Thou art the Image of
God: And ſurely this is ſomething more glorious than can be
applyed in ſo proper and direct a ſenſe to any Clergie-man
whatſoever. But let us briefly ſee what this ſpirituall ſword
of Excommunication is, which the Church, that is, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
only clayme, and wherewith they thinke they may as
freely ſtrike Princes, as Princes may doe them with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</p>
            <p>The grounds in Scripture for Excommunication, are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall,
not all intending the ſame thing, yet all are blended
and confounded by Clergie-men to the ſame purpoſe: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we ought to put a great difference betweene Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and Non-communication, and in Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
betweene that ſpirituall ſtroke, and puniſhment, which
was ordinary in caſe of contempt, and that which was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
in caſes of moſt hainous nature. Non-communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be ſuppoſed to have beene from the beginning; and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:157098:35"/>
by common equity; for Gemmes were never to be caſt to
Swines, nor the priviledges and Treaſures of the Church to
bee imparted to ſuch as were enemies and ſtrangers to the
Church. Heathens and Publicans hated the Religion of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> and therefore it was hatefull to the <hi>Iewes</hi> to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with them, either in matters of Religion, or in offices of
friendſhip. The <hi>Iewes</hi> did not forbeare all civill converſing
with them, but all familiarity they did forbeare, and yet the
forbearance of familiarity was no proper puniſhment to
them: Nor was it a thing ſpiritually inflicted by authority,
but by generall, and naturall conſent practiſed. So men of
the ſame nature, as <hi>Publicans</hi> and Heathens now, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as
hold our Religion contemptible, or whoſe profeſſion is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
to Religion, they ought to be to us as they were to
the <hi>Iewes;</hi> to mingle familiarly with them cannot ſtand with
our owne ſafety, or the honour of Religion, or the Law of
common decency: but thoſe whom we account as <hi>Publicans,</hi>
we doe not make <hi>Publicans,</hi> whom we ſhun as infectious, we
doe not puniſh as rebellious: their actions we doe generally
deteſt, but their perſons we doe not judicially condemne.
Princes under the Law might not eate of the Shew bread,
nor approach the Sanctuary being in a polluted condition, nor
in caſe of Leproſie might they be admitted into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the Lord, ſo nor baſtards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but theſe are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Non-communion, not of Excommunication: and
the reaſon of Non-communion is perpetuall, ſo that if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in open contempt of the Sacraments ſhould deſire them at
the Miniſters hands, Miniſters ought rather to dye than to
adminiſter them. But to deny the Sacrament is not any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
obduration, or caſtigation; to this denyall, no ſpeciall
authority is neceſſary, neither to that authority is any coercive
force internally working upon the ſoule granted. <hi>Cain</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
committed an unnaturall murther was generally abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
amongſt his brethren and abandoned as unfit for humane
ſociety: but this was a crime proper for the temporall ſword,
and if this was a proper puniſhment it was temporall. And it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:157098:35"/>
is plainly cleered to us, that adultery it ſelfe by Gods Law
was puniſhed by the temporall, not ſpirituall ſword, and that
<hi>abſciſsio animae</hi> amongſt the <hi>Iewes</hi> was ever ſpoken of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
puniſhment by death, the inffliction whereof was only
left to the temporall Magiſtrate; and that there was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
obſerved betweene Crimes Spirituall, and Crimes
Temporall. Non-Communion, then we grant to have bin
of ancient uſe, and perpetuall, but we wiſh great caution and
circumſpection to be had therein amongſt Chriſtians, for as
viſibly prophane perſons are to be rejected, ſo no former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe
ought to be cauſe of rejection, where the party
with outward profeſſions of repentance, and geſtures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
craves the myſteries at the Miniſters hands, as almoſt
all Chriſtians doe. For in ſuch caſe if the Sacrament, then
the word alſo may be denyed, and ſo no manner of ſalvation
ſhall be left to ſuch as have bin formerly vitious, whatſoever
their preſent demeanour be.</p>
            <p>To come now to Excommunication, or the Spirituall
Sword, and ſentence of the Church, as it was uſed in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times, yet ſo wee finde differences of it amongſt our
Divines. That inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> which was ſaid to be
<hi>traditus Satanae,</hi> as <hi>Chryſostome</hi> conceives, was not ejected out
of the Church by ordinary excommunication, but was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
left to Satan, <hi>ut percelleretur vulnere malo, aut morbo,</hi>
and ſuch was the puniſhment of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and his Wife, and
of <hi>Elymas, &amp;c.</hi> according to <hi>Ierom, Ambroſe, Theodoret,
Oecumenius, Theophylact, &amp;c.</hi> This excommunication, if it
may be called ſo, was a corporall puniſhment, and there is
no appearance of any internall obduration by the binding
power of the Miniſter: and it was miraculous, and therefore
though it was of uſe then, when the Keyes of Church-men
could not erre, and when a Temporall Sword was wanting,
yet now it is utterly uſeleſſe, and aboliſht. For any other
excommunication of preſent and perpetuall neceſſity in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
regiment there is little proofe in Scripture, it is
the ſpirituall Scepter of our <hi>Hierarchriſts,</hi> without which their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:157098:36"/>
Empire would appeare meerely imaginary: and therefore
their zeale is ſtrong for it, though their grounds be weake.
It ſeemes to me a very darke deduction, that the Keyes of
Heaven in the Goſpell muſt needs import reall power, and
juriſdiction in Church-men, and onely in Church-men; and
that that power and juriſdiction muſt needs intend ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſword, as our preſent form of excommunication is, and
that that ſword is as miraculous as it was, or as uſefull, as if it
were miraculous; and that the ſtroke of it is meerly ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and not to be ſupplyed by the temporall ſword: and that
Princes are as well lyable to it as other Lay-men. <hi>Ierome</hi>
ſayes, that with God not the ſentence of the Prieſt, but the
life of the ſentenced party is look'd upon, and regarded; and
ſayes he, <hi>Vt Leproſum mundum vel immundum Sacerdos facit,
Sic alligat vel ſolvit Presbyter.</hi> It ſhould ſeeme our Prieſts
now have the ſame power to try and diſcerne ſcandalous
perſons amongſt us, as the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> had Leapers in their times:
and no man ſuppoſes that the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Prieſts had any vertue,
or force in their judgements to purge ſuch as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
or to infect thoſe which were cleane, they were held
the moſt fit and impartiall judges, but the matter to bee
judged of was viſible, eaſie, and ſenſible. So much as this,
no man will deny to our Miniſters, for if they binde, and ſhut
Heaven to perſons ſenſibly profan, not altering at all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of ſuch as they binde, and ſhut out, this is no ſuch
ſtrange Spirituall Sword, and Celeſtiall power, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent
dominion, as they have hitherto pretended to,
neither is it of any ſuch great conſequence in the Church of
God.</p>
            <p>But if Miniſters can yet by vertue of their Keyes, either
ſearch into the reines and hearts of hypocrites, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
did, or alter the condition of ſuch as are ſubject to
them, either by abſolving, or obdurating the guilty, or
can effect any remedy in the Church for the taking away of
ſcandall, by their ſpirituall power, which the temporall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
doth not effect as the Apoſtles may be ſuppoſed to have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:157098:36"/>
done; This is more than the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Prieſts ever profeſſed,
this is ſupernaturall, and wee ought to admire it. I doe
not beleeve that our Miniſters will lay clayme to any ſuch
miraculous vertue and infallibility, and if they did, I hope
they would give us ſome ſignes and demonſtrations ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by opening Heaven to thouſands, and by confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all incorrigible oppoſers of Religion. If <hi>Nero</hi> had
reſorted to <hi>Peters</hi> miniſtery, deſiring to bee made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the Word and Sacraments, out of fraud and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
<hi>Peter</hi> doubtleſſe would not have refuſed him, and
caſt him off, without a certaine inſight into his hypocriſie:
but if <hi>Peter</hi> did diſcerne his hypocriſie, and reject him, yet
our Miniſters cannot diſcerne the like, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reject in the like manner. With us take Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as a ſpirituall puniſhment, as it hardens, and drives
from Repentance (for ſo the ſhutting of Heaven inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates)
and our Miniſters ſhould bee cruell to uſe it where
they are ignorant of the heart: and take it as a wholeſome
remedy, and fit meanes to draw to repentance, as corporall
puniſhments, ſometimes are (though it bee ſtrange to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
the like of ſpirituall) yet their vertue being ignorantly
applyed, is no proper vertue. For in caſe of utter impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and open perverſeneſſe, Heaven is ſhut without the
Miniſters power: and in caſe of fained penitence, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Key cannot open effectually, though he diſcerne not the
fraud: and in caſe of true penitence, if the Miniſter be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
yet Heaven will not remaine ſhut. Howſoever if Prieſts
may now Excommunicate as they pretend, yet this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not, that they may excommunicate Princes. We know
the Primitives did uſe excommunication, very moderatly, and
tenderly, and not without great policy, and reſpect had to
the good of the Church, and therefore Saint <hi>Aug.</hi> openly
avers, that excommunication is a proud, pernicious, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
attempt, when it is denounced againſt any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
number of people, <hi>ubi periculum ſit ſchiſmatis.</hi> We muſt
know that it is of worſe example when it is uſed againſt <hi>Princes</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:157098:37"/>
than diverſe other great bodies and ſocieties: in as much, as
one Prince is of more conſequence and power than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of other Lay-men. We know alſo that in all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
there is a neceſſity of legall tryall to precede convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and that great multitudes may be convented, examin'd,
ſentenced, and puniſhed with leſſe diſturbance of peace, leſſe
violation of Majeſtie, and leſſe obſtruction to policy, than
thoſe which ſway the Ball imperiall. And if the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Princes might bee upon due tryalls without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
yet the execution of the ſentence would produce more
grievous and rigorous events in them, than in private men:
for how ſhall the people honour, obey, and worſhip him in
the State as Gods Lievtenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, whom they ſee accurſed, cut
off, and abhorred in the Church as the Devils Vaſſall? That
which was obtruded upon private men at firſt as a wholſom
Corroſive plaiſter for their ſpirits, declined after into corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
penances, and after that into pecuniary mults: but what
have beene the ſufferings of private men in compariſon of
that which Princes have loſt hereby to the Clergie? Vpon
the Excommunication of Princes, whole Nations have bin
interdicted, whole States ruined, the innocent with the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
the Prince with the people all have bin ſacrificed to
bloud thirſty Prieſts, under pretence of Obedience to the
holy Church.</p>
            <p>It will be objected, that if Princes be not this way puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they are no other way puniſhable, and that it is very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
in the Church, that there ſhould be any ſcandall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and no meanes left for its purgation, and expiation.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, The <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Kings did ſinne in the moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
manner that can be imagined; yet God aſſigned no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Rulers for their Caſtigation, and the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
were alſo free from any coercive reſtraint or puniſhment,
and this God ſuffered, and we muſt ſuppoſe, that if it had bin
ſo extremely and publikely miſchievous, God would not
have ſuffered it. Beſides, in civill tranſgreſſions of the Law
Prieſts doe not uſually clayme juriſdiction (though Saint
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:157098:37"/>
               <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vindicated murder upon <hi>Theodoſius)</hi> for ſo their
power would be as temporall, and as large as the Princes,
and yet there is no reaſon why God ſhould not have left a
judicatory to puniſh civill violations in all men whatſoever, as
well as Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place alſo, if ſcandal ſhal not remaine unpuniſhable
in the ſupreme temporall Magiſtrate, yet it ſhall in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
and that is a miſchiefe of the ſame nature as the other.
For if the King ſhall abide the judgement of this Biſhop, or
that Conſiſtory, yet what judgment ſhal that Biſhop or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory
abide? If this ſpirituall ſupremacy reſt in any one,
that one muſt be unpuniſhable: for two ſupremes are things
incompatible: and if this ſupremacy reſt in more than one,
this is not conſiſtent with Monarchy: for either the one or
the other muſt be predominant, and tranſcendent. We reade
that <hi>lustinian</hi> did command the Clergy to be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
by excommunication, ſuſpenſion, and deprivation, and
we cannot deny this to be his right, and all other Princes in
the like manner, when miſdemeanours are ſcandalous in the
higheſt Cleargy-men, or Conſiſtores; and we know that ſuch
command and conſtraint in <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> is more than to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
ſuſpend, or deprive. We may juſtly therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
that <hi>Iustinian</hi> having a power above excommunication,
ought not himſelfe to be excommunicated, by thoſe which
were under his power: for ſo the excommunication of the
inferior would diſable the excommunication of the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.
And ſince excommunication cannot be promiſcuouſly
and oppoſitely uſed by two, one againſt the other, without
variance, and confuſion, but either the one, or the other
muſt be above excommunication, it is more reaſonable that
the higher bee exempted, and priviledged than the lower.
And ſo it is a ſtronge argument, that Princes are not liable
to excommunication, becauſe even in the power of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
it ſelfe their function is more excellent, and their
power more ſublime, than theirs is, which excommunicate
under them, and at their command, the Prince doing herein
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:157098:38"/>
the nobler office—<hi>quantum qui navem temperat, anteit—
Remigis officium—</hi> but when it is argued againſt Princes, that
they may be excommunicated by Prieſts; becauſe they beare
offices leſſe ſacred, and ſerve God in places leſſe glorious than
Prieſts, the grounds are here utterly falſe, and repugnant to
all right reaſon, and ſound Divinity. Let us not then doubt
to ſubmit all things under one ſupreme on Earth, ſubmitting
him to his ſupreme in Heaven; For it is no ſmall thing, as
we imagine, in ſuch caſe to be left to the ſearching judgment
of God, for God is not negligent of his office therein, nor
need we doubt, or hold our ſelves utterly remedileſſe, whilſt
we can ſay truly, <hi>Omne ſub regno graviore regnum eſt.</hi> And
let us not miſtake our ſupreme on earth, for if God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have left us a ſpirituall ſword and miraculous judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
under the Goſpell, never before knowne, or uſefull to
the world, and that of perpetuall neceſſity, doubtleſſe he
would have left us ſome cleere command in Scripture, and
not have involved his meaning in metaphors ſo intricate, and
ambiguous.</p>
            <p>THe next argument againſt the Soveraigne Dignity
of Kings is this. If ſervants are to be meaſured by
the degree of their Maſter whom they ſerve, they
are the greateſt ſervants, which ſerve Chriſt: But Miniſters
ſerve Chriſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> This can decide nothing for Princes and
Prieſts, ſerving both the ſame Maſter; The argument hath
the ſame force for Princes, and for Prieſts, and if it be further
ſaid, that Chriſt as a Prieſt, is greater than Chriſt as a Prince,
and that Princes therefore ſerving under him as a Prince, are
not ſo great as Prieſts ſerving under him as a Prieſt, I ſhall
deny that to bee ſo, for Chriſt as Mediator was inferior to
his Father, and all workes of his regiment over the Church
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:157098:38"/>
are not done by him as Mediator, but doe belong to his
Kingly Office, and as to his Kingly power, He is equall with
the Father.</p>
            <p>THe next Argument therefore of truer force is this:
There can be no office more ſacred, or dignity more
excellent, then ſuch as is ſignified under theſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Titles of <hi>Gods, Starres, Angels, Embaſſadors, Rulers,
Fathers, Stewards, Paſtors, Leaders, Teachers:</hi> but theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Titles are applyed to Miniſters, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Wee will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
all theſe Honourable badges given to Miniſters,
and duely given: and wee will acknowledge theſe no empty
words without truth, and ſo make words and things contrary:
and we will acknowledge the Function of Miniſters to bee
more venerable than any amongſt men, beſides that which
beares the ſword, the Embleme of Gods imperiall Majeſtie.
But to ſuch as are Gods ſword-bearers upon Earth, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Miniſters ought to give place, and pay ſubjection, as
humbly as any others. The preminence of Kings, we hold
to be three ways manifeſt: in order, in meaſure, and in kind.
In the very ſanctity of the Prieſt-hood it ſelfe we conceive
the miniſtration of Prieſts to be ſubordinate to Princes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as to ſuperintend in the moſt religious affaires is due
to Princes, and to officiate only to Prieſts, and to ſuperintend
is more than to officiate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In meaſure we conceive Princes excell alſo,
in aſmuch as in religious affaires ſuch Prieſts have the charge
of ſuch flockes, and ſuch Biſhops of ſuch Prieſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all both
Biſhops, Prieſts, and flockes are under the Kings charge. And
not only in religious affaires, but in civill alſo the authority
of Princes is both intenſive, and extenſive many wayes, where
Prieſts may not at all intermeddle. And though to governe
Chriſtians as Chriſtians, be the moſt tranſcendent honour of
Kings; yet to governe men, as men: and not only to governe
but to governe well, is a thing of divine impreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:157098:39"/>
Thirdly, in kinde the regiment of Princes is far excelling,
for the regiment of Kings is a true proper regiment aſſiſted
with reall power, decored with externall honour, founded
in the generall conſent of men, and bleſſed by the gratious
influence of God, but the rule of Prieſts is but ethicall, or
metaphoricall only, its utmoſt vigor is but perſwaſive, and is
not at all coercive, either inwardly, or outwardly: and that
ſubjection which it challengeth is not to it ſelfe, but to the
Word and Sacraments, whereto it ſelfe rendreth as much, as
it requireth from others. This generall anſwer might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but to each particular Title we will briefly reply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Miniſters they are GODS, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuch as are
under their cure: but then as they are GODS to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ſo Princes are GODS to them. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> was
a God to <hi>Aaron,</hi> though <hi>Aaron</hi> was a God to his inferiors.
Miniſters are Stars, but not in magnitude equall to the Sun;
neither is their light and influence ſo independent as the Suns.
Miniſters are Angels, <hi>viz.</hi> upon earth, and their internall
piety is like a ſhining rayment to them amongſt men, but
they ſerve under Gods on Earth, whoſe robes of Majeſty are
every way reſplendent, as well externally as internally. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are Embaſſadors, but all Embaſſadors perſons are not
of the like honour, nor all their Embaſſages of the like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor all their Commiſſions of the like extent: and in
all theſe reſpects, Preachers are inferior to <hi>Princes,</hi> being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to them, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was to <hi>Moſes</hi> for a ſpokeſman, or an
Interpreter only. Miniſters are Rulers, <hi>viz. quoad vim dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivam,</hi>
but not <hi>quoad vim coactivam.</hi> Miniſters are Fathers,
<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as have been Gods inſtruments to regenerate us,
and ſo as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayes, they are the Fathers of our
ſoules, and perhaps, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes, in this reſpect they
are more to be honoured than our naturall parents. But Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
alwayes, and onely are not ſo our Parents, and they
that are ſo our Parents, are not ſo phyſicall, and ſelfe effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
cauſes as our naturall Parents are: but if they may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
more honour than our fleſhly Parents, yet this advances
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:157098:39"/>
them not above Kings, who are both politicall, and Spirituall
Fathers alſo. <hi>Fabius</hi> the Conſull, though he was to pay Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reverence to his naturall Father, yet he was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a greater meaſure of the ſame from him being his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
ſon: and it did not miſ-beſeeme him to prefer the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
right before the phyſicall: Yet <hi>Fabius</hi> here was a meere
Magiſtrate, and in that farre leſſe glorious than our Chriſtian
Magiſtrates are; Miniſters are Stewards, but not the higheſt
in the houſe of <hi>God;</hi> for <hi>Princes</hi> are Stewards alſo and only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to God, but they are accountable to <hi>Princes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
And as Stewards doe provide food for thoſe, by
whom themſelves are fed, and manage only but one part of
their Lords affaires: ſo it is with Miniſters: under <hi>Princess</hi>
Miniſters are Paſtors, Leaders, Teachers, their Doctrine is
their food wherewith they comfort the people, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
is the light wherewith they ſecure them from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
they feede by their exhortations, and guide by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
but all theſe are offices of a ſervant, rather than
priviledges of a Maſter, and even in theſe offices they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
alſo. So the <hi>Pilot</hi> at Sea may have the ſafety of his
<hi>Prince</hi> committed to his direction, charge, and rule: So the
Commander in Warre gives order for all affaires of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,
aſſigning to the King Himſelfe a fit ſtation: So the
Iudge in matters of Law by his juſt decree bindes the right
of his owne Maſter: So the Phyſition limits and preſcribes
rules of diet, and ſets downe Lawes of exerciſe to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord.</p>
            <p>In all theſe caſes there is a kinde of Obedience due from
Kings, and that obedience implyes ſome kind of inferiority:
and yet this obedience of the King, doth not drowne the
higher and greater obedience of the Subject, nor doth this
inferiority contradict that which is of a farre other quality,
and degree. In the ſelfe ſame manner alſo the Prieſt offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
in the Church, perhaps before the King, perhaps before
his owne Metropolitan, at this time, in this place, and in this
office, there is honour, reverence, and obedience due to him
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:157098:40"/>
from the King, and Metropolitan: yet this doth not exempt
him from that ſtronger and holyer tye of ſubjection, awe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſubordination, by which he is alwayes bound to thoſe
which governe him in other things; when <hi>Ambroſe</hi> therefore
ſayes <hi>Honor &amp; ſublimitas Epiſcopalis nullis poterit comparatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
adaequari:</hi> and againe, <hi>Nihil poteſt eſſe in hoc ſeculo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentius
Sacerdotibus, nihil ſublimius Epiſcopis reperiri:</hi> wee
anſwer, if he here include Princes, as having Epiſcopall
power, and a juriſdiction both over Prieſts and Biſhops, we
agree hereunto, but if he exclude Princes, we exclude this
from our beliefe. And againe when he ſayes: if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Epiſcopall ſublimity to the brightneſſe of Kings, or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems
of Princes, that of Kings and Princes will be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
than leade, compared with gold: we anſwer, if he here
intend the meere ſecular authority of Princes in things meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
temporall, we ſuppoſe ſome mild conſtruction may bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed:
but if he ſpeake of the intire Soveraignty, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of Princes, and put that as lead in compariſon of
the golden Miter, we reject him as erroneous. That which
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes, that more awe is due to Prieſts, than to
Kings and Princes, we admit alſo in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to the
Embaſſages of God in their mouthes, not to their perſons:
and thoſe Embaſſages alſo and inſtructions we oppoſe to the
meere civill Ordinances of Kings, not to religious injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherein Princes are ſent with larger Commiſſion than
they are. And whereas hee ſayes further of the power of
Prieſts, that God Himſelfe would not impart it to Angels,
or Arch-Angels wee may adde alſo nor to <hi>Princes:</hi> yet
this concludes nothing to the derogation of Angels, or Arch-Angels
or Princes. For the Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they have
not the ſame Miniſtery in the ſame kinde, and order, yet they
have a more glorious and heavenly, and conſequently ſo may
Princes. That which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes alſo that Princes
beare the Image of God, Biſhops of Chriſt, We willingly
conſent to, and yet by Biſhops here we do not intend only
ſuch Church-Governours as our Biſhops now in <hi>England</hi> are,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:157098:40"/>
but all other ſuch as doe the ſame offices over Gods people,
whatſoever their ſtiles, or externall additions be otherwiſe.
And theſe things we conceive ought to receive ſuch conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
becauſe our Saviour Himſelfe did alwayes decline all
State and pompe, and recommend the ſame lowly preſident
to his followers; with ſtrict command not to exerciſe any
Lordly Dominion, nor to aſſume the Name of <hi>Rabbi</hi> upon
them, ever preſſing this; That he came to ſerve, and not to
be ſerved. And yet in the meere Name of Lord, or <hi>Rabbi</hi>
there could be no offence, if the power and grandour belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thoſe names, had not bin diſpleaſing to him: and if it
was diſpleaſing in thoſe his immediate <hi>followers</hi> whom he had
made governours as wel as Preachers, and for their better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
had indued with many miraculous gifts, to diſcerne
ſpirits, and to open and ſhut Heaven: and inriched with many
other weighty graces, we cannot imagine it ſhould now be
pleaſing in our Miniſters, where leſſe power is neceſſary, and
leſſe vertue granted. However it is farre from our meaning
to detract or derogate any thing from that internall reverence
which is due to Chriſts Embaſſadors, and Stewards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
the Church, we know that he that deſpiſes them, deſpiſes
Chriſt Himſelfe, according to Chriſts own words, our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is only to place them next and in the ſecond ſeate of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
after Princes, and Rulers, and Iudges which have Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
committed to them by God, either mediately, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
<hi>Cyp.</hi> ſayes well, that our Saviour being King and
God did Honour the Prieſts and Biſhops of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> though
they were wicked, for our inſtruction: we grant that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ought in this to be imitated, and that all Prieſts whether
they have ſuch command or no, as the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> had, or whether
they bee Religious or no: yet for Chriſts ſake which is our
High-Prieſt, and their Head, we ought to pay all reverence
and awe to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:157098:41"/>
THe laſt Argument urged is this. That Order which
is of the greateſt neceſſitie in Religion, without which
no Church can at all ſubſiſt, is moſt Holy and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
but ſuch is the ſacerdotall order, for Religion had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
under the Apoſtles without <hi>Princes,</hi> and that it never
had nor could have under <hi>Princes,</hi> without Prieſts: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
This is no way true, for Religion can have no being without
men, and men can have no being without government, and
therefore as to this firſt, and moſt neceſſary being, wee
may juſtly ſay, that the Goſpell it ſelfe was as well prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which hated it, as by <hi>Peter</hi> which preached it:
For <hi>Peter</hi> did owe his civill being to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and without this
civill being, his Eccleſiaſticall being had periſhed. Beſides
<hi>Peter, &amp;c.</hi> was not only a Preacher, but alſo a Governor,
and thoſe offices which he did as a Governour, might be as
much conducing to the welfare of Religion, as thoſe which
hee did as a Preacher: and yet for want of the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
further aſſiſtance, both offices were ſome way defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
and perhaps, had bin wholly unprofitable, had not
miraculous gifts and graces ſuperabounded to ſupply that
defect. Howſoever, it is more true, that after the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Religion did ſubſiſt under <hi>Princes</hi> onely without Prieſts,
for untill the Prieſt-hood was ſevered in <hi>Aron, Adam, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck,
&amp;c.</hi> were not ſo properly Prieſts, as <hi>Princes:</hi> for
though they performed the offices of Prieſts, yet they had
no other Conſecration to inable them therefore, than their
Regall Sanctity, and ſublimity. If the meere officiating did
make a Prieſt, then the Prieſt-Hood were open to all: and
if ſome right and warrant be neceſſary, it muſt orginally
flow from <hi>Princes,</hi> and they which may derive it to others,
have it, till they derive it, in themſelves. The eſſence of
Prieſt-Hood doth no more conſiſt in the rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:157098:41"/>
of Conſecration, than Royalty doth in Coronation:
and the due warrant of lawfull authority being that eſſence,
before that warrant granted, we muſt looke upon authority
as including that warrant within its vertue: and after that
warrant granted, as not exhauſted of its vertue. When the
Prieſt-hood was ſeparated from the greater, and confered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the inferior, ſome formall Ceremonious reſignation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was thought neceſſary: but before that reſignation till
<hi>Moſes,</hi> wee may well conceive that Princes did officiate in
their owne rights, without borrowing any thing therein from
Ceremonies, or from any higher power than their own.</p>
            <p>I have now done with Arguments of the firſt kinde,
which are urged againſt the ſanctity, and competence of
Princes, in Eccleſiaſticall and Spirituall things. I come now
to anſwer ſuch things as are further objected againſt other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of qualification in them, eſpecially in learning, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and theologicall underſtanding.</p>
            <p>THe maine argument here, is thus: Whoſoever is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to direct to Truth, is alſo fitteſt to command for
Truth: but Miniſters being moſt skilld in Divinity
are moſt fit to direct, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer hereunto, I muſt make appeare.</p>
            <p>1. That Miniſters are not alwayes moſt learned.</p>
            <p>2. That the moſt learned are not alwayes the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p>3. That learned and judicious men are not alwayes Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
and ſound in faith.</p>
            <p>4. That there is no neceſſitie in policy, that the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
judicious, and ſincere men ſhould be promoted to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
power in the Church.</p>
            <p>And firſt, we deny not that the bleſſing of God doth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
accompany the due act of Ordination, to adde gifts and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:157098:42"/>
abilities to the party ordained: we only ſay, that Gods grace
like the winde hath its free arbitrary approaches and receſſes,
and is not alwayes limited, or neceſſitated by the act done of
conſecration. And we ſay alſo, that as God uſually ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
Miniſters for their function, ſo he doth alſo Kings: and
when he did lay his command upon Kings to have a Copy of
his Law alwayes by them, to reade and ſtudy it for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
we conceive it is intimated to us what kinde of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is moſt fit for Kings, and what kinde of grace God
doth moſt uſually ſupply them withall. <hi>King Edward</hi> the
ſixth, Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>King Iames</hi> of late, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
memory were ſo ſtrangly learned and judicious in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that we may well thinke there was ſomething in them
above the ordinary perfection of nature: and had they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
relyed leſſe upon the greateſt of their Clergie in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
concerning the intereſt and honour of the Clergie, the
Church might have been more free from theſe controverſies,
and diſturbances at this day.</p>
            <p>Counſellors of State were by a wiſe King of <hi>Spaine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to Spectacles, and ſo may Prelates alſo, but as the
ſame King well obſerved, thoſe eyes are very wretched
which can ſee nothing at all without them. Tis as much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in Princes to look into the particular intereſts of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
and not to be too light of beliefe, as tis to do nothing
without counſell and to ſuſpect their owne imaginations. If
we did attribute to our Iudges a freedome from all fallibility
and corruption, and ſo intruſt all Law into their hands, this
would be as dangerous, as to allow Iudges no credit at all. The
Anabaptiſts which rely only upon their own private Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſmes
are not miſlead into greater idolatry, and ſlavery than
the Papiſts, which renounce their owne light, and reaſon, to
caſt themſelves wholly upon the directions of their Ghoſtly
Fathers. Our Prelates at this day have not ſo rigorous an
Empire over our beliefe as the Papiſts grone under, yet they
have given us a taſte of late, what Canons ſhould be held
moſt religious and fit for us, if we would admit all to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:157098:42"/>
which they thinke fit to bee impoſed upon us.
And truely when Clergie men were confeſſed to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Oracles and infallible Chaires of Divinity in the world,
twas but a modeſt Law my thinkes, that all Lay-men being
on Horſe-backe, and meeting Clergy-men on foote, ſhould
perpetually diſmount, and reſigne their horſes to Clergie-men:
ſure thoſe times which thought this reaſonable, and juſt
were prety modeſt times, and Lay-men did not deſerve ſo
good. In the ſecond place alſo admit Clergie-men to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and alwayes learned, yet the learnedſt men are not alwayes
the wiſeſt, and fitteſt for action. Sometimes where great read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
meets with ſhallow capacities, it fumes like ſtrong Wine
in their heads, and makes them reele, as it were, under the
burthen of it: it cauſes ſometimes greater diſquiet both to
themſelves, and other men. In our Anceſtors dayes when
all learning was ingroſſed by the Clergie, and thruſt into
Cloyſters, and Colledges from the Laity, yet there were many
grave and wiſe Stateſ-men that were as an allay to the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and vaine exceſſes of the Clergie, or elſe this State had
bin often ruined. But admit in the third place, that Clergie-men
are alwayes more learned and wiſe than all Lay-men, yet
we ſee they are not more free from errors, hereſies, and jars
amongſt themſelves, than other men, but rather leſſe. When
Schiſmes riſe amongſt Divines, as they doe almoſt perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Divines being thereby banded, and divided againſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
what can the poore Laicke doe? both ſides he cannot
adhere to, and if he adhere to this, that ſide condemnes him,
and if to that, this condemnes him: if hee make uſe of his
judgment herein, than hee truſts himſelfe more than the
Prieſt, and if he uſe not his judgment at all; He commits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
meerly to fortune, and is as likely to embrace the wrong,
as the truth: if he apply himſelfe to the Major party, that is
hard ſomtimes to diſcern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if it be diſcernable, yet it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times, the erroneous party. The Papiſts are not the major
part of Chriſtians, Chriſtians are not the major part of men,
The orthodox amongſt us are not the major part of <hi>Calviniſts
Calviniſts</hi> are not the Major part of Proteſtants.</p>

Before the Law the Minor part worſhipped the true <hi>God,</hi>
and amongſt thoſe which worſhipped the true God, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
part were heartily his ſervants, and made a Conſcience
of their wayes. After <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo when the <hi>Iewes</hi> began to
mingle with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and other bordering Heathens in
the manner of their ſacrifices and high places, a very ſmall
part ſometimes kept it ſelfe pure from thoſe pollutions, and
innovations. And in that great rent under <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ten tribes
of twelve eſtranged themſelves from God, ſet up a new ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
falſe worſhip in <hi>Bethel.</hi> And we reade long before the
Captivity, that <hi>Ephraim was divided against Manaſſeh, and
Manaſſeh against Ephraim, and both againſt Iudah. Iudah</hi> alſo
it ſelfe was never wholly untainted, for from the Captivity,
ſundry ſects, and factions had diſtraited it, in ſo much that
when our Saviour came into the world, there was ſcarce ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
or truth to be found, and that that was, was not moſt
eminently amongſt the greateſt Scribes, Phariſees, or Prieſts.
In all thoſe times if there was ſuch an infallibility in the
Chayre of <hi>Moſes</hi> (as the Papiſts dreame of) it did but little
availe the world, for he that then would have ſought for the
true way to walke in, diſclaiming utterly his owne light and
underſtanding He muſt not have ſought it amongſt the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:
and if he had ſought it amongſt the Prieſts, he would
have ſeene diviſions there: and if amongſt Prophets, Hee
would have found the ſame there alſo. God did not deliver
Oracles, nor inſpire Prophets, at all times upon all occaſions
for the ceaſing of differences, and conteſtations; He did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in love, but not without all Majeſty; He did ſhew grace,
but not according to obligation. After our Saviours Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
a bleſſed Spirit of infallibity did reſt upon the Church
to direct in intricate debates, and to prevent ſchiſmes, till
a perfect Goſpell was eſtabliſht: but this Spirit in thoſe very
times had not reſidence in any one mans breaſt at all times, to
give judgment in all things. The greateſt of the Apoſtles
might ſeverally vary and diſſent in points of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and therefore they had conſultations ſometimes, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:157098:43"/>
when conſultations would not ſatisfie, they did aſſemble in
a greater body; and when thoſe aſſemblies were, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Spirit did not alwayes manifeſt it ſelfe in thoſe
which were of higheſt order, but ſometimes the inferior did
reprove and convince the ſuperior, and the ſuperior did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and yeeld to his inferior. But after one age or two, when
the Spirit of God had conſummated, the maine eſtabliſhment
of Religion, though it preſerved the Church from a totall
deviation, it ſecured not all parts thereof from all groſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayling
rents, and Apoſtaſies, neither did it affixe it ſelfe, or
chuſe any certaine reſting place in any one part of the world
more than an other. Three ages being now runne out, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of a foule nature beginning to ſpring up and increaſe with
Religion, it pleaſed God to ſend <hi>Constantine</hi> to ayd the
truth againſt error, and impiety: in his power now it was to
congregate Biſhops of the beſt abilities, for the diſcuſſing and
diſcovering of truth, and for the upholding the ſame being
diſcovered. When Biſhops contended againſt Biſhops, and
Presbyters againſt Presbyters, and when Arianiſme was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by as great a number of Divines as it was oppoſed, ſo
that from the wiſdome of Divines, no deciſion could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
then doth the power and policy of one Emperor, by
Divines remedy, that, which a thouſand Divines by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
could never have remedyed. From the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
the Orthodox party could obtaine no ſuccour, till <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
Scepter proved more vertuous than his Croſiers: and
when the Councell was by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> called, and ordered,
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was not the onely Oracle in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
neither had that great trouble of aſſembling been, if one
Biſhop had then bin more oraculous than all. The ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
alſo which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did in his dayes, many other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Emperors did in their raignes: and had not they done them,
no one Biſhop could; for the Catholike Biſhops were many
times inferior in number, and power to the Heretikes: and if
the Pope had then had the power to utter Oracles, yet not
having power to inforce, and authoriſe the ſame upon all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:157098:44"/>
oppoſites, hee could not have advantaged Religion amongſt
Heretikes, more than hee doth now amongſt Proteſtants,
Iewes, Turkes, or Pagans. If God gave infallibility to one
Biſhop, for the availe of all the world, why doth not that
Biſhop availe the whole world? Why is ſo great a light put
under a Buſhell? Why are not all men illuminated by it?
And if God had no regard therein but to that remnant which
worſhips the Pope, if his only ayme therein was at the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Papiſts, why is this made a ground of univerſall
authority to the Pope, or of generall priviledge to all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops?
But I am to ſpeake now to Proteſtants which hold
no one Biſhop infallible, but the whole order of Biſhops
freer from fallibility, than any other condition of men: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſuch, I ſhall inſtance in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe what multitudes
of Divines; of learned, profound Divines; of politike,
Sagacious Divines for many ages together have beene drunke
and bewitched with the ſuperſtitions, Idolatries, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and hereſies of that inchanting City? Can it bee
thought ſafe for Princes and Lay-men wholly to abjure their
owne underſtandings, and yeeld themſelves Captives to the
dictates of Divines only, when ſo many Millions of them
for ſo many ages, notwithſtanding all their exquiſite learning
and rare abilities, devote themſelves to ſuch ſottiſh impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
and groſſe impieties, nay to ſome ſuch infernall, diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
tenets? Can men ſtill perſiſt to give up their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
wholly to other men for their callings ſake, or for
their learning and wiſdome ſuppoſed, when we ſee this is the
very ſame rock, whereupon <hi>Rome</hi> ſuffers Ship-wrack, and this
blind opinion the very ſnare wherein ſo great a part of the
world ſtill lies intangled? But I will avoydeprolixity.</p>
            <p>And now in the fourth place, I come to ſhew, that if we
will take all theſe things for granted, and aſcribe all learning,
knowledge, and freedome from variance to all Clergie-men
and to Clergie-men only, yet it doth not follow that they are
neceſſarily to rule, and command in chiefe. Nay I ſhall make
it appeare, that it is not only not neceſſary, but that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:157098:44"/>
wayes miſchievous, that the ableſt Divine ſhould alwayes
be ſupreme in all cauſes, and over all perſons Eccleſiaſticall.
Power and wiſdome are things of a different nature, for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cannot ſtand with inferiority, but wiſdome may be as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
in a man of meane condition as in a man of high
quality; and power if its ſupremacy be divided, it is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed:
but wiſdome the more it is diſperſed, the more the
vertue of it is increaſed. Wiſedome often is contented to
ſerve, and to accept of a low dwelling, but power ceaſes to
be power if it dwell not in ſublimity, and have honour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it. To be wiſe, and to be contemned, dejected, ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are things compatible, they are things frequent: but to be
potent, is the ſame thing as to be great, to be ſacred, to bee a
commander of other mens wiſdome: Nay to be potent hath
no terme convertible, but to be potent. Power in the State, is
preſerved as the Arke was in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church, it is priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from common ſight, and touch in all well conſtituted
Common wealths, it is united in ſome one perſon only, and
to him ſo lineally intayled, that it may never dye, never ceaſe,
never ſuffer any violent motion, or alteration. Power is as the
ſoule of Policy, of ſo exquiſite, and delicate ſenſe, that nothing
but the wings of <hi>Cherubims</hi> is fit to guard and incloſe it, from
all rude approaches: vacuity in nature is not a thing more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred,
or ſhunned with greater diſturbance, and with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confuſion of properties, than the leaſt temeration, and
eclipſe of power in the State. How abſurd then is this axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome,
which makes power ſervile to wiſdome, not wiſdome to
power, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſubjects power to ſo many tranſlations, &amp; compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
and ceſlations, as often as time ſhall diſcover ſuch and
ſuch excellencies in ſuch, and ſuch men? If power ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be at the devotion of ſuch men, as for the preſent appear
moſt wiſe, if ſhe ſhal be made ſo cheap, and vulgar, and proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
daily to ſo many uncertainties, what quiet can ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to the world? Nay what bloud wil ſhe not procure? I
need ſay no more: this axiome is neither conſiſtent with
Monarchicall, nor hereditary rule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:157098:45"/>
For firſt, if the moſt knowing Divine ſhall alwayes be
ſupreme Commander in all Church affaires (for more than
this the Pope never claymed) then by the ſame reaſon the
moſt knowing Stateſ-man ſhall be ſupreme in the Palace, the
moſt knowing Souldier in the Campe, the moſt knowing
Lawyer in the Tribunall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo Monarchy ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not into the ariſtocracy, or democracy, which are formes
not utterly corrupt, but into poly-coirany, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more unpoliticke.</p>
            <p>All Nations have ever rejected this broken confuſed
rule of many ſeverall independent Commanders, which
cannot chuſe but injoyne impoſſible things ſometimes: for
all theſe commanders may at the ſame time uſe the ſame
mans ſervice in ſeverall places, and in this they never can be
ſatisfied: wherefore we may well account this rule as bad as
anarchy it ſelfe. Nay even Religion it ſelfe by this meanes
may be diſtracted into ſeverall ſupremacies, for He that is the
ableſt Divine in polemicall points and in deciding controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
may not be ableſt in poſitive points, or matters of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and yet here the one hath as good title to abſolute
power in his ſphere, as the other hath in his. And as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
cannot, ſo ſecondly, neither can hereditary right ſtand
with this alwayes uncertaine, variable title of ability, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
in knowledge. Nay poſſeſſion of ſupremacy is here
no good plea: For he that was the greateſt, and moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man laſt yeare, is not ſo this yeare, neither perhaps will
he be next yeare, that is ſo this yeare. A thouſand incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
and inconveniences attend upon this paradox: for the
abilities of men are very hardly tryable, and diſcernable: and
if they were not, yet the ſubjecting of power to the perpetual,
giddy changes of new elections would ſoone confound us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our old Chaos againe, as the Poets word is.</p>
            <p>The three principall acts of power are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, to make Lawes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to give judgement according to Lawes made.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to execute according to the right intent of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:157098:45"/>
In the making of Lawes alſo according to <hi>Tully,</hi> there is
three things neceſſary: 1. <hi>Invenire. 2. Diſceptare. 3. Ferre.</hi>
The invention of all neceſſary Lawes is almoſt perfect alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to our hands; Thoſe Lawes which God ordained for the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> and thoſe which our Anceſtors found out for us, are
daily before our eyes, and little can now be added of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
except only for illuſtration of what was ambiguous
before. In the Church alſo is leſſe want of perpetuall altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and additions of Canons, than in the State, our miſery
is, that we ſucceed Anceſtors which were oppreſt with too
vaſt a Church diſcipline. Our reformation hath rid us of
ſome part of this burthen, but yet no ſenſible man can chuſe
but ſee, that our Eccleſiaſticall Courts are yet of larger juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and fuller of trouble, than ever the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> were, or
thoſe of the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The reaſon of this is, becauſe
wee ſtill rely too much upon Divines herein, and they for
their own profit, and power are ſtill as willing to uphold their
own Tribunals as ever they were. Did they thinke it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honour to ſerve at the Altar than in the Conſiſtory,
and did they take more delight in Preaching, than attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuites, they would not ſtudy New Canons, but diſcharge
themſelves of many old ones: and ſo eaſe themſelves and us
too, and reſtore backe againe to the Civill Magiſtrate that
which Popery firſt uſurped, and their ambition hath ſince
continued. Howſoever if Miniſters can adde any Articles
to the Doctrine of our Church for the better preventing of
Schiſmes, or frame any orders for the more decent perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of Gods worſhip in the Church, I would not exclude
them from propoſing it; I only deſire that ſince they are men,
and may have private intereſts and reſpects to the prejudice
of other men, they may not ingroſſe all power of propoſing
what they liſt, and to exclude all others from the like power.</p>
            <p>And in the ſecond place, if Clergie men only ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
all Eccleſiaſticall Lawes; yet it is moſt unjuſt that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Lay-men ſhould be held utterly uncapable of venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating,
and debating the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:157098:46"/>
               <hi>Id quod omnes tangit ab omnibus tractari debet.</hi> Nature hath
printed this in us, if the Prieſt propoſe any thing tending to
the diſſervice of God, that diſſervice will draw the ſame guilt
upon me, and all others, as upon him, and it ſhall not excuſe
me or others, that he pretended his judgment to be unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
and ſhal it then here be unlawfull for me and others to
uſe any endeavour for the prevention of this guilt? If Angels
from Heaven ſhould ſeduce me, I were inexcuſable: and when
Miniſters, whom I know to bee ſubject to the ſame naturall
blindneſſe, and partiality as I am, and to whom I ſee generall
error may be a private advantage, in matters of this private
advantage, ſhal I be allowed no liberty to ſearch, and trye, and
to uſe my beſt art of diſcuſſion? If this were ſo, <hi>God</hi> had made
my condition deſperate, and remedileſſe, and I might ſafely
attribute my error, and deſtruction to the hand of God alone:
but this no man can imagine of God without great impiety.
God hath declared himſelfe contrary herein, for he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
none from error though never ſo learned, nor leaves
none excuſable in error though never ſo unlearned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we will
blindly truſt others, tis at our own perill, He will require it at
our hands; but if we will ſeeke induſtriouſly, we ſhall finde, if
wee will knock at his dore, He hath promiſed to open to us.
And if private men ſtand accountable for their owne ſoules,
whatſoever the Prieſts doctrine or commands be, how much
more ſhall Princes, and Courts of Parliament anſwer for
their wilfull blindneſſe, if they will depart from their owne
right and duty in ſifting, and examining al ſuch religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
as concerne them, and all others under their charge?
Shall they ſit to treate of Lether, and Wooll, and neglect
doctrine and diſcipline? Shall they conſult of the beauty and
glory of the kingdom, and transfer Religion to others, which
is the foundation of all happines? Shall they be ſollicitous
for tranſitory things, and yet truſt their ſoules into other mens
hands, who may make a profit of the ſame? Let us not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate
our ſelves, let us honour Divines, and reverence their
counſels, but let us not ſuperſtitiouſly adore them, or dotingly
in-ſlave our ſelves to their edicts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:157098:46"/>
THe 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. thing in making of laws is that which we term
<hi>ferre Legem:</hi> and till this act of carrying, paſſing or
enacting give the binding force of Law to it, how
good and wholſome ſoever it be after all debate, yet it is but
as the counſell of a Lawyer, or the preſcription of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And here we maintaine, that if Divines are the moſt
fit, to invent, and diſcuſſe Eccleſiaſticall Conſtitutions, yet
they have not in themſelves that right and power which is
to imprint the obliging vertue of Lawes upon them. The
forme or eſſence of Law is that coercive, or penall vertue by
which it bindes all to its obedience: and all cannot be bound
to ſuch obedience, but by common conſent, or elſe ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
compulſion: take away this binding vertue, and it is
no Law: it is, but a Counſell, wherein the inferior hath as
much power towards his ſuperior, as the ſuperior hath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his inferior. If then Divines will vindicate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a Legiſlative power in the Church, they muſt deduce
the ſame either from the common conſent of the Church, or
from ſome other authority to which all the Church is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and to which the whole Church can make no actuall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
If they clayme from common conſent, they muſt
produce ſome act of State, and formall record to abet their
clayme, and common conſent muſt alſo ſtill ſtrengthen the
ſame, or elſe by the ſame that it was conſtituted, it may ſtill
be diſſolved; and if they clayme from ſome higher externall
authority, ſtronger than common conſent, they muſt induce
that authority to give vigor to their Lawes, and to uſe means
of conſtraint againſt all ſuch, as ſhall not voluntarily yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the ſame. And it is not ſufficient for them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God for their authority, without ſome ſpeciall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
words from Gods owne mouth, for God gave no man
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:157098:47"/>
a right, but he allowes him ſome remedy agreeable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and God is ſo great a favourer alſo of common conſent,
that though hee hath an uncontroleable power above it,
yet (as <hi>Hooker</hi> obſerves) He would not impoſe his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Lawes upon his people, by the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their free, and open conſent. And if God, which cannot
doe unjuſtice, nor will impoſe lawes, but ſuch as are profitable
to us, and yet hath an undiſputable Empire over us, will ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
common conſent; ſhall man which may erre, and doe
injurie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is of leſſe value then communities, and wants
might to inforce and put in execution his owne commands,
uſurpe that which God relinquiſhes? Take it for granted that
Prieſts cannot erre out of ignorance; or be perverted by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intereſt, and that they are ſuperior to all Chriſtians under
their charge: yea grant them a right to make what Canons
they pleaſe, and grant them no power to compell obedience
to the ſame, and to puniſh diſobedience to the ſame, and this
would take away peace, and cauſe much miſchiefe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
every where, and this we cannot thinke God would
be the Author of.</p>
            <p>How ridiculous are the Popes anathemaes to thoſe which
renounce his allegiance, they ſeem to us but meere Epigrams
ſent abroad to provoke laughter? And yet why doe they not
appeare as ridiculous in <hi>Italy,</hi> as in <hi>England?</hi> were it not for
common conſent, they were not in more force amongſt <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
then <hi>Engliſhmen:</hi> and there is no more true naturall vigor
in the Popes Bulls, to procure common conſent in <hi>Italy,</hi> then
in <hi>England:</hi> we may gather then from hence, that there is no
Eccleſiaſticall Supremacie, but founded upon the ſame baſis
of common conſent, as temporall ſupremacie is, and being ſo
founded, it cannot be Divine, or unalterable, or above com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent ſo as to have any efficacie without, much leſſe
againſt it. That ſome Nations are gull'd, and cozen'd out of
their conſents, is no preſedent for us, for as many Nations are
addicted to <hi>Mahomits</hi> commandes, as are to the Popes: and
in this the dominion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is as ſpirituall as the Popes:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:157098:47"/>
and is as ſtrong a caſe to over-rule us, as the Popes: for if
conſent were to be forced, the Pope might as well force <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi>
as Chriſtians: and if it be free, his Empire depends
as much upon it, as <hi>Mahomets.</hi> They then that have erected
a Spirituall ſupremacie, not depending upon common conſent,
have been in a great error, and they that ſlight common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as not capable of a ſpirituall ſupremacie, ſeem to have
been as much miſtaken. Many of our Divines ſay, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
are temporall Courts; and ſo not of ſpirituall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and others ſay, that they may as well frame acts to
order the Hierarchie in heaven, as to diſpoſe of Eccleſiaſticall
things on earth: both theſe ſeeme to me verry erroneous. The
Argument methinks is equally ſtrong: as God would not
give a right to binde up other men by Statutes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
but he would give ſome power withall to drive
men by conſtraint to obſerve, and yeeld obedience to the
ſame: ſo He would not indue any Prince, or Court with ſuch
power, but He would give a right of binding equall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniall
to that power. Princes of themſelves are ſacred, as I
have proved, and ſpiritually ſacred; how much more then
are they accounted ſitting in Parliament: and if Princes in
Parliament, how much more Princes, and Parliaments; for
to Princes on their awfull Tribunalls, is ſomething more due
then at other times, but to Princes in Parliament, there is moſt
of all due, in regard that there they are inveſted with more
then their owne naturall power, common conſent having
not derived all power into the King: at any other time, or in
any other place: but reſerved much thereof till a full union be
in Parliament; beſides, ſetting aſide the ſanctity of power
in Parliaments: yet in regard that they are aſſiſted with the
beſt counſell of Divines, ſo they ought not to be accounted
meere Temporall Courts: for what better adviſe can thoſe
Divines give out of Parliament: then in Parliaments: Some
Parliaments in <hi>England</hi> have made ſome Eccleſiaſticall acts,
<hi>excluſo clerò;</hi> nay that which was the the moſt holy act, which
ever was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England, viz.</hi> The Reformation of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:157098:48"/>
Religion, was paſſed <hi>invito clero:</hi> and when theſe things are
not only legall, but honorable, ſhall we limit Parliaments in
any thing wherein the votes of the Clergie are concomitant,
and concurrent, with the Laytie? <hi>Hooker</hi> ſayes, that the moſt
naturall and religious courſe for the making of Lawes, is, that
the matter of them be taken from the judgement of the wiſeſt
in thoſe things whom they concerne, and in matters of God
(he ſaies) it were unnaturall, not to thinke the Paſtors of
our ſoules a great deale more wiſe than men of ſecular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings:
but when all is done for deviſing of Lawes, it is the
generall conſent of all, that gives them the forme, and vigor
of Lawes. This we allow of for the moſt part, but wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this to be underſtood of ſuch Divines, as in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Parliaments, are <hi>omni exceptione majores;</hi> for it was
not unnaturall in the beginning of the Reignes of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Sixth, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to thinke that the Lords and
Commons were better Judges of Religion, than the Biſhops
and the Convocation houſe, as matters then ſtood in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
For the whole body can have no ſiniſter end, or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to blinde them: but the whole Clergie, which is but a
part of the whole body may, and therefore the whole body is
to judge of this, and when they ſee a deviation in the Clergie,
and obſerve the occaſion of it, they muſt not blindly follow
blinde guides, but doe according to that light which God
hath given them. And certainly, it were contrary to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
which every man hath in the Truth, that any ſhould be
obliged to receive it from other mens mouths, without
any further inquiry, or judgement made upon the ſame. The
meaneſt man is as much intereſſed and concerned in the truth
of Religion, as the greateſt Prieſt, and though his knowledge
thereof be not in all reſpects equally eaſie: yet in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
it may be eaſier, for want of learning doth not ſo much
hinder the light of the Laymen, as worldly advantage, and
faction ſometimes doth the Prieſts. Examples of theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite:
corruption in the Church before our Saviour, and in
our Saviours daies, and ever ſince hath oftner begun amongſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:157098:48"/>
the greateſt Prieſts, Rabbers, and Biſhops, than amongſt the
meaner Laitie. And for this cauſe, God requires at every
mans hands an account what doctrine he admits, what Lawes
he obeys, holding no man excuſed for putting blinde confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his ghoſtly Father, and not taking upon him to weigh
and try how ſure his grounds were. And if every private
man ſtand ſo reſponſible for his particular intereſt in the
Truth, being equally great in the Truth? ſhall not whole
States and Nations, whoſe intereſt is farre greater than their
Prieſts or Biſhops is, give a ſadder account to God, if they
leave themſelves to be ſeduced by ſuch men, which are as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to error as themſelves? If wee conſider the meere
matter of Lawes, they are either profitable for the Church,
or not: if they are profitable, why ſhould wee thinke that
Princes and Parliaments want power to impoſe Lawes upon
themſelves, for the availe of their owne ſoules, they ſtanding
to God accountable for the ſame, according to the greatneſſe
of their owne intereſt? and if they are not profitable, there is
no obedience due to them, whether Prieſts, or Princes make
them, and that they be not profitable, is equally doubtfull
whether Prieſts, or Princes make them. Take then Lawes to
be queſtionable, as all humane are, and lyable to examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and being made without common conſent, they binde
not at all, and being made by common conſent, they binde
all either to obedience, or to ſufferance. It is Gods owne
Law, that ſuch as ſhall except againſt the validity or obliging
vertue of common conſent, ſhall die the death: for no peace
can ever be in that State where any inconſiderable partie ſhall
not acquieſce in the common Statutes of the land. Thoſe
Lawes which Heathen Emperors made by common conſent
againſt Chriſtianity, were not wiſe Lawes, But they were
Lawes, there was no pietie, but there was vigor in them: and
doubtleſſe the very Apoſtles, which might not lawfully obey
them, yet might not lawfully contemne them. Two things
are objected againſt the Eccleſiaſticall power of Parliaments.
1. That it is more due to Princes. 2. To Councells, or Synods.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:157098:49"/>
Tis true anciently Princes were the only Legiſlatives: the
old rule was, <hi>Quicquid placuerit Principii Legis habet vigorem.</hi>
But we muſt know, that Princes had this power by common
conſent, and doubtleſſe till policy was now perfect, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
twas ſafer for Nations to depend upon the arbitrary,
unconfined power of Princes, then to have their Princes
hands too far bound up, and reſtrained, but ſince Lawes have
bin invented by common conſent, as well to ſecure Subjects
from the tyranny of their owne Lords, as from private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
amongſt themſelves: and thoſe Common wealths
which have left moſt ſcope to Princes in doing of good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the leaſt in doing acts of oppreſſion, are the wiſeſt
but ever this golden axiome is to bee of all received: That
that is the moſt politicke prerogative which is the beſt, but
not the moſt limited. But this objection makes for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for whatſoever power was veſted before in Princes
and their Councells, the ſame now remaining in Princes and
the beſt, and higheſt of all Counſells, <hi>viz.</hi> Parliaments
Counſells, alſo and Synods, are as improperly urged againſt
Parliaments, for Counſells and Synods did not at firſt clayme
any right, or in dependent power, they were only called by
the ſecular Magiſtrate, as Eccleſiaſticall Courtes for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of ciſſention in the Church, and they were as meere
aſſiſtants, called <hi>ad conſilium,</hi> not <hi>ad conſenſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 480 yeares after the eſtabliſhment of Chriſtians,
Religion, from the firſt to the ſeventh <hi>Conſtantine</hi> there were
but fixe generall Counſells called, and thoſe in diſputes of a
high nature: all other Lawes were eſtabliſht without Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meniall
Counſells, by the private inſtruction of ſuch Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
as Emperors beſt liked. The truth is, no univerſall
Counſell ever was at all, becauſe there never yet was any
univerſall Monarch, or Pope, whoſe power was large en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough
to call the whole world: but Princes to the utmoſt of
their bounds, did in that ſpace of time congregate Biſhops
out of all their dominions in thoſe ſixe caſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet we do
not finde that thoſe ſixe Counſels, though they have more
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:157098:49"/>
reverence, yet claymed more power than any other Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Synod. Without queſtion no leſſe power than the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
could have bin ſufficient to cite, and draw together ſo
great a body, or to order them being met, or to continue
their mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, and no leſſe power could animate their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
with univerſall binding vertue, then the ſame, that ſo
convened them. But it is ſufficient, that Counſels have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and that appeales have been brought againſt them, and
that redreſſe hath beene made by Emperors in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
called for that purpoſe: for this takes away from them
that they are either ſupreme, or ſole, or infallible judges of
Religion: and this being taken away they cannot be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to have any over-ruling ſuperiority, or priviledge above
Parliaments. The aſſiſtance of Counſels, and Synods ſcarce
any oppoſes, ſo that they be not indeed with an obliging, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
force above Parliaments, or preferred in power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
common conſent, which is the ſoule of all policy and
power, and that which preſerves all Churches and States
from utter ruine, and confuſion: and this no wiſe man can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
too. So much of the firſt act of power in paſſing, and
promulgating of Law; I now come to the ſecond: In giving
judgment according to thoſe Lawes. But little need here be
ſaid, for if we did yeeld Clergie-men to be the moſt skilfull
and knowing Iudges in all matter of doctrine and diſcipline,
this is no argument at all, for their ſupremacy, or indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
neither can any difference be ſhewed why ſubordinate
power in Eccleſiaſticall judgments ſhould not be as effectual,
and juſtifiable, as in temporall, and it is ſufficiently cleered
that poly coirany is not to bee received in any Church or
Kingdome: and therefore I haſte to the third act of power
which conſiſts in uſing compulſory meanes for procuring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
If Prieſts had any ſuch ſpirituall ſword, as they
pretend, vertuous and efficacious enough to inflict ghoſtly
paines upon ſuch as diſobey them, doubtleſſe it would reform
as well as confound, and procure obedience, as well as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe
diſobedience: and then it would as much advance thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:157098:50"/>
Empire, as the temporall ſword doth the Princes. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it would have ſome ſenſible efficacy, and worke to good
ends, and men would not nor could not chuſe but bow, and
ſubmit themſelves under it, but now a ſpirituall ſword is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
whilſt the gaining of a temporall ſword is intended,
and nothing is more plaine to be ſeene. Its not to be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at therefore if the people feare not any binding power,
where they ſee no looſing, nor regard the ſhutting of thoſe
keyes, which cannot open: nor tremble at that thunder, and
lightning which is accompanied with no perceiveable vertue
of warmth and moyſture, to open and refreſh, as well as to
breake, and burne. But I have touched upon this already,
and ſo I now leave it.</p>
            <p>THe next Argument is taken from the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> policy, for
they ſuppoſe that the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Prieſt-Hood was inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
in <hi>Spiritualibus,</hi> and they ſuppoſe that the
ſpirituall knowledge and ability of the Prieſts and Levites
was the ground of this independency. Here we ſay firſt that
there are diverſe reaſons why more power and preeminence
was requiſite amongſt the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Prieſts than is now. <hi>Bilſon</hi>
gives foure differences, and I ſhall add two more: for firſt the
Prieſts, and Levites were then a great body, they were a
twelfth part of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had many Cities and their territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
wherein they lived a part from other Tribes, and in thoſe
Cities and precincts a civill rule was as neceſſary as els where
and that rule could not be adminiſtred without inequality, and
power, and in this they much differed from our Miniſters.
Secondly, Prieſts, and Levites were then the onely ſtudied
Booke-men and Schollers of that Nation, learning was at a
low ebbe, the judiciall as well as the Ceremoniall Lawes
were ſcarce knowne, or reade by any but that tribe: and in
this the State of our times is farre different. Thirdly, The
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:157098:50"/>
Prieſts and Levites had then a naturall command and ſignio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in their owne families, over their owne deſcendents wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
now no ſuch ſuperiority can have place amongſt our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie-men.
Fourthly, The Prieſts and Levites had then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of a different nature, ſome of them were more eaſie, as
to ſuperintend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others more toyleſome, as to ſacrifice,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome more holy, as to offer incenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others more
meane, as to ſlaughter beaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo different orders were
accordingly appointed, but no ſuch difference of ſervice is
amongſt our Prieſts in our Churches. I ſhall adde alſo fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that there were then many Ceremonies, and Types, and
rites of worſhip, about which many differences might ariſe
hardly to be decided without ſome appointed Iudges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
now the abolition of thoſe externall rudiments, and clogs
hath diſcharged us of all ſuch queſtions, and ſcruples in the
Church. And ſixthly the whole forme of Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was then externally more majeſticall, and dreadfull, and
it was convenient that ſome correſpondence ſhould bee in
pomp, and ſplendor between the perſons which did officiate,
and the places wherein they did officiate. As there was a
<hi>Sanctum</hi> more inacceſſible than the outer Court, and a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory
more reverend than either, and as ſome Altars, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
were more ſolemne, and venerable than others: ſo it
was fit that perſons ſhould bee qualified accordingly with
extraordinary honor, and priviledge but this reaſon now cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
amongſt us. There was no inherent holines in that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
more than is in ours, nor no more internall excellence in
thoſe Prieſts, than in ours: and yet we ſee an externall ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
was than thought fit for thoſe times, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
did not ſeeme to countenance in his Church. The ſame
glittering garments are not now uſefull for our Prieſts, nor
the ſame ſanctimonious forbearance, and diſtance due to our
Chancels; and for ought we know all other grandour, and
luſtre of riches, power, and honour falls under the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but in the next place our anſwer is, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all theſe differences which may much more plead for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:157098:51"/>
power and preeminence amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> than amongſt us,
yet we do allow to our <hi>Clergy</hi> more power, and preeminence
than was knowne amongſt the <hi>Iewes.</hi> There is no colour in
Scripture that there were ſo many Eccleſiaſticall Courts in
<hi>Iudea,</hi> ſo thronged with ſutors, ſo peſtred with Officers, ſo
choaked up with cauſes of all kinds, as matrimoniall, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
and many the like: there is no colour, that in ſo
many ſeverall diviſions of the Land, beſides, ordinary tithes,
and indowments, they had any Eccleſiaſticall Lords to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
ſo many ſeverall Caſtles, Palaces, Parkes, Manors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
They had one Miter, we have many. They had one <hi>Prieſt</hi>
richly attired, but with Ornaments that were left for the uſe
of ſucceſſive generations, we have many, whoſe bravery is
perpetually freſh, and various. <hi>Alexander</hi> might perhaps
wonder at the ſumptuous habit of one of <hi>Aarons</hi> Succeſſors,
but if <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe ſhould ſee the Majeſticall equipage of
diverſe of our Arch-Biſhops, or <hi>Cardinals,</hi> as they paſſe from
one tribunall to an other; He would think his own Religion
ſimple, and naked to ours. Beſides though the <hi>Iewes</hi> had but
one High-Prieſt, in whom was concerned all the State and
glory of their Clergie, yet he alſo was ſo farre from claym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any independent power, that in the moſt awfull of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
affaires, as conſulting with God, receiving the Law,
building and dedicating the Temple, ordering, and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prieſts, and their ſervices, making Lawes, and ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
all holy perſons, places, and things, in all theſe things
hee was inferior to the <hi>Prince,</hi> not ſo much as executing the
ſame by ſubordination. That Scotch Gentleman therefore,
which undertakes to prove the independent, unalterable juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of Biſhops, as its now injoyd, and accounted divine in
<hi>England,</hi> both from the Law and the Goſpell, is as much to
be applauded for his confidence, as for his wit.</p>
            <p>One Argument more is brought by ſome <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to the
ſame purpoſe, but it is ſcarce worth repetition. They ſay, <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
was but a meane Prophet, yet its written of him, that he
was appointed over Nations and Kingdomes, to pull up, to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:157098:51"/>
beate downe, to deſpiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they inferre that what a
Prophet might doe, a <hi>fortiori</hi> a Prieſt may doe. But this is
not literally ſpoken as true of <hi>Ieremies</hi> own exployts; The
Prophet was here Gods inſtrument to foretell, and proclaime
them, but God had other inſtruments to execute them, and
thoſe inſtruments in probability were Princes, not Prophets,
nor Prieſts. Princes, Prophets, and Prieſts, may all be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God in the ſame ſervice, yet not all ſerve alike ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably:
for wee muſt looke further ſometimes than into
the meere names of things, becauſe ſome names of ſervice
import the nature of command, and ſome names of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
import the nature of ſervice. The word, Nurſe, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſomething of ſervice, but more of power, and this is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applyed ſometimes to Princes, for the office of Princes is
to ſerve thoſe who are ſubject to their power. On the other
ſide, the word, Guide, expreſſes ſomthing of power, but more
of ſervice, and this may be fitly applyed to <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
for their skill may make them ſerviceable in ſomethings
to thoſe which in others are ſerved by them. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
theſe two firſt points, that there is no priviledge either
of Sanctity or Knowledge which can exalt Prieſts, above
<hi>Princes,</hi> or intitle them to that ſpirituall regiment in the
Church, which they would faine pretend to. Further at this
time I have not leaſure to proceed, I muſt now leave this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſpoken, and all that which naturally will reſult from it,
to the Iudicious.</p>
