            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is nothing hereby intended to impugn the<hi> Abrogation of the TEST: </hi>May His Majesty's Sacred Will and Pleasure be fulfill'd; and may the Rights of the<hi> English Peerage </hi>remain Inviolable. But there seems to have been an absolute Necessity, for the AUTHOR of the<hi> Reasons for Abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the TEST, </hi>to have Repeal'd his most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Invectives against the<hi> Nonconformists, </hi>and his Tempestuous Indignation against<hi> Dissenters </hi>in general; so diametrically opposite to the Serene and Pious Desires and Resolutions of His Majesty, to make His Subjects happy, and unite them to Him as well by Inclination, as Duty; and to have shew'd his Compliance to His Majesty in all His most Laudable and Generous Designs, before he had singl'd out that particular Point of the<hi> TEST, </hi>meerly to hook in a Plea for<hi> Transubstantiation, </hi>and his own New modell'd Notions of<hi> Idolatry. </hi>But let Others, whom it may concern, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64497:4"/>
those<hi> Controversies: </hi>The present Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whether his Lordship of<hi> Oxon, </hi>have Retracted his Discouses of<hi> Ecclesiastical Polity, </hi>or at least, those Passages in them, which run so apparently counter to His Majesty's<hi> Gracious Declaration for Liberty of Conscience? </hi>Otherwise he may seem to have calculated his<hi> Writings </hi>for the various<hi> Meridians </hi>of<hi> State; </hi>and his<hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments </hi>will not bear that Weight, which (tho' the same, yet) coming from Another Person, they would have done.</p>
            <p>NOW, there cannot be a more certain<hi> Touch-stone </hi>of Truth of the<hi> Bishop</hi>'s, or<hi> Arch-Deacon</hi>'s (which you please, for they are both the same Person's)<hi> Ecclesiastical Polity, </hi>than the<hi> Declaration </hi>it self: Only, out of his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Charity, the<hi> Arch-Deacon </hi>has Peopled the<hi> Kingdom </hi>with such a dreadful<hi> Canaille, (</hi>all but those of the<hi> Church of England) </hi>that Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment it self might wonder well, were his unconscionable<hi> Epithetes </hi>to be allow'd, that so Gracious, so Indulgent, so Soft and Calm a<hi> Declaration, </hi>should come forth in Kindness to such a Rabble: For<hi> Those </hi>whom His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

calls<hi> His Good Subjects, </hi>the<hi> Arch-Deacon </hi>continually strigmatizes with the foul<hi> Epithetes </hi>of<hi> Iugglers, Dissemblers, Wicked Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, Hypocrites,<note place="margin">

            <p>The<hi> Declaration </hi>expresses His Majesty's<hi> Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Desire to Establish His Government on such a Foundation, as to make His Subjects happy, and unite Them to Him as well by Inclination, as Duty; which He thinks can be done by no means so effectually, as by Granting Them the Free Exercise of their Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the<hi> Arch-Deacon</hi>'s<hi> Politicks </hi>are of another Strain: For, in his<hi> Preface </hi>to his<hi> Ecclesiastical Polity, </hi>p. 12. he say; <q>That the Aim of his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> is, by representing the Palpable Inconsistency of <hi>Phanatick</hi> Tempers and Principles, with the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare

            <p>
               <q>Pag. <hi>52. of the same</hi> Preface: If Princes <hi>(says he)</hi> would but consider, how liable Mankind are to abuse themselves with serious and conscientious Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they would quickly see it to be absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the Peace and Happiness of their <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> that there be set up a more severe <hi>Government</hi> over Men<hi>'s Consciences,</hi> than over their <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Immoralities.</hi>

               </gap>hal<hi>'s</hi> Vindication, <hi>(for it is not Pag'd) you shall find it thus written:</hi> They (<hi>meaning the</hi> Phanaticks, <hi>or Complainants against the</hi> Penal Statutes) have been so long accustom'd to undutiful <hi>Demeanor,</hi> that it is to be fear'd, they are grown too Head-strong and Incorrigible, to be aw'd into a

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And at the Bottom of the same Page:</hi> To this Peevishness of their <hi>Humors,</hi> I might add the Restlesness of their <hi>Minds,</hi> that is always displeas'd with the settled Frame of Things, (innuendo, <hi>the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Penal Laws</hi>;) and that no Alterations can sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy.

            </p>
            <p>But, (<hi>in the same</hi> Preface) should it ever so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hereafter, that any <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> should be prevail'd with to deliver up the <hi>Church, (That is to say, to dispence with the</hi> Penal Laws <hi>and</hi> TEST; <hi>for the</hi> TEST, <hi>notwithstanding the Reasons against it, must be included in this long</hi> Parenthesis, <hi>because the</hi> Church <hi>fram'd it)</hi> he had as good, at the same Time, resign up his <hi>Crown.

Government, through the</hi> Non-conformity <hi>to the</hi> Arch-Deacon<hi>'s</hi> Ecclesiastical Polity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is another Reason, why His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty was graciously pleas'd to</hi> Think, Force in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of meer Religion <hi>directly contrary to the Interest of Government; and that is,</hi> Spoyling of TRADE.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trade! cries the</hi> Arch-Deacon: <hi>Trade! No. Let Grass grow about the</hi> Custom-House, <hi>rather than abate one Tittle of my</hi> Ecclesiastical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: For, (<hi>in his</hi> Preface <hi>to his</hi> Ecclesiast. Pol. <hi>Pag. 49.</hi>) 'Tis notorious, <hi>(says he)</hi> that there is not any sort of <hi>People</hi> so inclinable to <hi>Seditious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi> as the <hi>Trading Part</hi> of a <hi>Nation</hi>; and their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogance</hi> naturally increases with the <hi>Improvement</hi> of their <hi>Stock.</hi> And if we reflect upon our late Miserable <hi>Distractions,</hi> 'tis easie to observe, how the <hi>Quarrel</hi> was hatcht in <hi>Trade,</hi> Men's <hi>Shops,</hi> and cherisht by the Zeal of <hi>Prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: (By the way, this is plausible Nonsense all over.) But he goes on, Pag. 50.</hi> 'Tis a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry odd, and preposterous Piece of <hi>Policy,</hi> to design the enriching this sort of <hi>People,</hi> while their Heads are distemper'd with <hi>Religious Lunacies. And, Pag. 51.</hi> He is a very silly Man, and understands

nothing of the <hi>Follies, Passions,</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> of <hi>Human Nature,</hi> who sees not there is no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so ungovernable, as a <hi>Wealthy Phanatick. And therefore, (Pag. 48.)</hi> I confess, I cannot but smile, when I observe how some, that would be thought wonderful grave and solemn <hi>Statesmen,</hi> labour with mighty Projects of setting up this and that <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> in their several respective <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations</hi>; and how eagerly they pursue these Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Attempts,</hi> beyond the Great <hi>Affairs</hi> of a more Publick <hi>Concernment,</hi> (<hi>Meaning the dreadful and terrible Execution of the</hi> Penal Laws;) and how wisely they neglect the <hi>Settlement</hi> of a whole <hi>Nation,</hi> for the Benefit of a <hi>Village</hi> or <hi>Burrough? Very pleasant</hi> Ecclesiastical Polity! <hi>No Man must eat or drink, or maintain his Family: The grand Relation of Human Necessities, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one upon another, must stand still, to oblige the</hi> Arch-Deacon<hi>'s</hi> Ecclesiastical Polity. <hi>Here's a</hi> Quietus est <hi>for above the Third Part of the Nation. None but those that can swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a</hi> Surplice, <hi>and adore the</hi> Parochial Levite, <hi>must weave Camlets at</hi> Norwich, <hi>make Bays at</hi> Colchester, <hi>Spurrs at</hi> Rippon, <hi>Nayls at</hi> Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migeham, <hi>or Saddles at</hi> Burford. <hi>For why?</hi> There
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64497:12"/>
is not any sort of People so Seditious, as the Trading Part of the Nation. <hi>So that, supposing the Greater Part of the</hi> Trading Part of the Nation <hi>be, as the</hi> Arch-Deacon <hi>calls them,</hi> Phanaticks, <hi>and</hi> Nonconformists, (<hi>that is, Men Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously scrupuling the Ceremonies of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England) <hi>they must either be</hi> Scourg'd into better Manners <hi>with</hi> Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and Thorns;<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is yet behind one more Reason urg'd in the</hi> Declaration, <hi>and that is this</hi>; That Force in Matters of meer <hi>Religion,</hi> never obtain'd the End for which it was imploy'd; <hi>wherein His Majesty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares Himself the</hi> more Confirm'd, by the Reflections He had made upon the Conduct of the Four last Reigns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, here's the utter Subversion of the</hi> Arch-Deacon<hi>'s</hi> Ecclesiastical Policy; <hi>All meer Labour in vain, abundance of Ranting, Raving, Reviling expressions, insomuch, that the</hi> Arch-Angel <hi>was more civil to the</hi> Devil, <hi>than the</hi> Arch-Deacon

What are now become of all his Politick</hi> Let but's? <hi>In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to Bishop</hi> Bramhall<hi>'s Vindication</hi>; Let but the <hi>Government</hi> think it seasonable at any time to Reprieve them (<hi>meaning the</hi> Dissenters) from the Severity of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and they immediately start up into that Confidence, as to imagine themselves the only Darlings of <hi>State.</hi> Let but the <hi>Publick Rods</hi> be removed from their Backs, and they are presently full of Expectations to have them put into their own hands.

            <p>
               <hi>Many other Passages might have been Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of his several Bitter (if they may not be said to be Scurrilous) Invectives against the</hi> Dissenters; <hi>but here are sufficient to make it apparently Manifest, that the</hi> Author <hi>of the</hi> Ecclesiastical Polity, <hi>was as great a</hi> Dissenter <hi>from the mild and tender Maxims of his Majesty's Government, and his constant Sense and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,

of a long time professed and declared upon several Occasions in Matters of Religion, as the</hi> Dissenters <hi>were dissatisfied with the Rigid Severity of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>or, at least, with the Principles of his</hi> Ecclesiastical Polity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which makes it seem questionable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Person, who has brandish'd his Pen with that Virulency, against the</hi> Dissenters <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and His Majesty's Royal Opinion, and the Mature Results of his most serious Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may be a proper Champion against the</hi> Test? <hi>For most certainly, there has been much more said already, and much more to the purpose, than he has produced.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>As for the</hi> Papists, <hi>he deals with them after such a rate, that no Man living knows where to have him. In his</hi> Preface <hi>to Bishop</hi> Bramhall<hi>'s</hi> Vindication, <hi>he seems neither to Love nor Fear 'em: For that, as long as the Church of</hi> England stands in Power and Reputation, it will easily beat back and baffle all the Attempts of <hi>Rome,</hi> and its Adherents; Their Plausible Reasons being evidently no more, than little Tricks and Sophisms, and seem intended by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, rather to abuse the Simple, than satisfie the Wise, Their Innovations are so undeniable, and the Design of the Church of <hi>England's</hi> Reformation, so apparently <hi>Apostolical,</hi> that those People must needs argue at a strange wild rate, that will be demonstrating against Experience, and Ocular Inspection. <hi>So then, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation made by the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in the Points of</hi> Transubstantiation, Worship of Images, Adoration of the Host, and Invocation of Saints, <hi>being</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64497:15"/>
Apostolical; <hi>What must be thought of his</hi> Reasons <hi>against the</hi> Test? <hi>Nay, there is</hi> Nothing could preserve the <hi>Papists</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hiss'd out of the <hi>Pit,</hi> but that they are extreamly Confident, and most <hi>Readers</hi> sufficiently ignorant: So that the Church of <hi>England</hi> may safely defie all their Opposition. She does not stand upon such Trembling Foundations, as to be thrust down with Bull-rush <hi>Spears,</hi> and <hi>Oral Traditions,</hi> with <hi>Labyrinths,</hi> and Castles in the <hi>Air.</hi>

               <hi>But then his Heart misgives him again, and he begins to fear the Return of</hi> Popery <hi>into the Nation, should the</hi> Nonconformists <hi>joyn with the</hi> Papists: <hi>And therefore, at the End of his</hi> Preface, <hi>he begs the</hi> Hearty Prayers <hi>of his Friend,</hi> for the Peace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; for when That is gone, <hi>(fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel Frost)</hi> 'twill he hard to find out Another, with which any, that are either Honest or Wise, will be over forward to joyn in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>

               <hi>Notwithstanding all this, upon better Consideration, as it were in Compassion of the despis'd Weakness of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and her Adherents, he undertakes to furnish Them with better Arguments of his own, than any they have Themselves, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate</hi> Transubstantiation, <hi>and clear them from</hi> Idolatry: <hi>For which he strains an Argument deduc'd from the</hi> Cherubims, <hi>that cover'd the</hi> Ark. <hi>And yet, in his</hi> Defence <hi>of his</hi> Ecclesiastical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>Pag. 285, 286. he condemns both</hi> Turk <hi>and</hi> Pope <hi>together in a Breath; the One for</hi> giving Divine Worship to a lewd Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor; <hi>the Other, to a</hi> Senseless Piece of Matter. <hi>And thus, what, by Vertue of</hi> Apparent, Apostolical Reformation, <hi>he call'd (Before) a</hi> Senseless Piece of Matter, <hi>he has (Now) cover'd with the</hi> Cherubim<hi>'s</hi> Golden Wings, <hi>and render'd Adorable by</hi> Scripture-<hi>Warrant: But,</hi> Bene scribit, qui bene intelligitur; <hi>What he has Written, he has Written.</hi>
