            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As it is graunted by <hi>Galen</hi> in his third booke <hi>De methodo medendi:</hi> and wee who day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke and practise in Surgery, according to the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Arte, aswell in greeuous woundes, vlcers, and Fistules, as other hyd and secrete diseases vpon the body of man, dayly vsed by vs in S.

encouraged to dedicate this litle worke of the Anatomy, being his and our trauells, to you as Patrons of this booke to defend against the rauening Iawes of enuyous Backby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which neuer cease by all vnlawfull meanes to blemish and deface the workes of the learned, expert, and well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed persons.

            <head>A TREASVRE FOR <hi>English men, conteyning the Anatomie</hi> of mans bodie: Compyled by Thomas Vycarie, Esquire, <hi>and Sergeant Chirurgion to King Henry the eight, to K.</hi> Edward the sixt, to Queene Marie, and to our most gratious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth. And also chiefe Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion of S Bartholomewes Hospitall. for the vse and commoditie of all vnlearned practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioners in Chirurgerie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere I shall declare vnto you, shortly and briefely, the sayings, and the determinations of diuers ancient Authors, in three points, verye expedient for all men to knowe, that entend to vse or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the mysterie or art of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie. The first is, to knowe what thing Chirurgerie is: The second is, how that a Chirurgion should be chosen: And the third is, with what properties a Surgion shoulde be indued.</p>
            <p>The first is to know what thing Chirurgerie is. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I doe note the saying of <hi>Lamfranke,</hi> whereas he sayth: All things that man would knowe, may be knowen by one of these thrée things: That is to say, by his name, or by his working, or els by his verie being and shewing of his owne properties. So then it followeth, that in the same manner we may know what Chirurgerie is by thrée things. First, by his name, as thus: The Interpreters write, that Surgerie is deriued out of these wordes, <hi>Apo tes chiros, cai tou ergou,</hi> that is to bée vnderstanded: a hand working, and so it may be taken for all handie artes. But noble <hi>Ipocras</hi> sayeth, that Surgerie is hande wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in mans bodie, for the verie ende and profit of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11852:7"/>
is hande working.</p>
            <p>Nowe the seconde manner of knowinge what thinge Chirurgerie is, it is the saying of <hi>Auicen</hi> to bee knowen by his beeing, for it is verelye a medecinall science: and as <hi>Galen</hi> sayeth: hée that will knowe the certaintie of a thing, let him not busie him selfe to knowe onely the name of that thing, but also the working and the effect of the same thing.</p>
            <p>Nowe the thirde waye to knowe what thinge Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie is, It is also to bee knowen by his béeinge or declaring of his owne properties, the whiche teacheth vs to woorke in mans bodye with handes: as thus: In cuttinge or openinge those partes that be whole, and in healing those partes that bee broken or cut, and in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away that that is superfluous, as Warts, Wennes, Skurfulas, and other like. But further to declare what <hi>Galen</hi> sayeth Surgerie is. It is the last instrument of medicine: that is to saye, Dyet, Pocion, and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie: of the which three, sayeth hee, Dyet is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest, and the moste vertuous. And thus hee sayeth, whereas a man may bee cured with Dyet onely, let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee giuen no manner of medicine. The seconde instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Pocion: for and if a man may bee cured with Dyet and Pocion, let there not bee ministred anye Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie. The thirde and last instrument, is Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie, through whose vertue and goodnesse is remooued and put awaye many gréeuous infirmities and diseases, which might not haue béene remooued nor yet put awaye, neither with Dyet, nor with Pocion. And by these thrée meanes it is knowen what thing Chirurgerie is. And this suffiseth for vs for that poynt. Nowe it is knowen what thing Chirurgerie is, there must also bee chosen a man apt and meete to minister Surgerie, or to bee a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion. And in this poynt all Authors doe agree, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11852:7"/>
a Chirurgion shoulde bee chosen by his complexion, and that his complexion bee veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> temperate, and all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers well proportioned<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For <hi>Rasis</hi> sayeth: Whose face is not seemely, it is vnpossible for him for to haue good manners. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> the great Philosopher wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Epistles to the noble King <hi>Alexander</hi> (as in those Epistles more playnlye doeth appeare) howe hee shoulde choose all such persons as shoulde serue him, by the fourme and shape of the face, and all other members of the bodie. And furthermore they saye, hee that is of an euill complexion, there must néedes followe like c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Wherefore it agréeth that a Chirurgion must be both of a good and temperate complexion, as is afore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed. And principally, that hée be a good liuer, and a keeper of the holye commaundementes of God, of whome commeth all cunning and grace, and that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye bé<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> not quaking, and his handes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tedfast, his fingers long and small, and not tremblinge: and that his lefte hande bée as readie as his right hande, with all his lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes able to fulfill the good workes of the soule. Nowe heere is a man meete to bée made a Chirurgion. And though hée haue all these good qualities before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yet is hée no good Chirurgion, but a man verie fitte and méete therefore. Nowe then to knowe what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and conditions this man must haue before he bee a perfect Chirurgion.</p>
            <p>And I doe note foure thinges moste speciallye that euerye Chir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nious: The fourth, that hee bee well mannered. The first (I sayde) hee ought to bee learned, and that hee knowe his principles, not onely in Chirurgerie, but also in Phisicke, that hee maye the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

in naturall Philosophie, and in Grammer, that he speake congruitie in Logike, that teacheth him to prooue his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions with good reason. In Rhethorike, that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him to speake séemely and eloquently: also in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, that teacheth him to knowe things natural, and not naturall, and things against nature. Also he must knowe the Anatomie, for all authors write against those Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons that worke in mans bodie, not knowing the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie: For they be likened to a blinde man, that cutteth in a Uine trée, for he taketh more or lesse then he ought to do. And here note wel the saying of <hi>Galen</hi> the prince of Philosophers, in his <hi>Estoris,</hi> that it is as possible for a Surgion not knowing the Anatomie, to worke in mans bodie without errour, as it is for a blinde man to carue an Image and make it perfect. The seconde, I sayde, he must be expert: For <hi>Rasus</hi> sayeth, he ought to know and to sée other men worke, and after to haue vse and exercise. The thirde, that he be ingenious or wittie: for all things belonging to Chirurgerie may not be written, nor with letters set foorth. The fourth, I sayde, that he must be wel manered, &amp; that he haue all these good conditions here fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: First, that he be no spousbreaker, nor no drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karde. For the Philosophers saye, amongest all other things, beware of those persons that followe drunkennes, for they be accompted for no men, because they liue a life bestial: wherefore amongst al other sortes of people, they ought to be sequestred from the ministring of medicine. Likewise a Chirurgion must take héede that he deceiue no man with his vaine promises, for to make of a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great, because he would be counted the more famous. And amongest other things, they may neither be flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, nor mockers, nor priuie backbyters of other men. Likewise they must not be proude, nor presumptuous, nor detracters of other men. Likewise they ought not

               <p>A Corde or Tendon is a consimple or officiall member, compounde and spermaticke, synowy, strong, and tough, meanely betwéene hardnes and softnesse, and meanly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and flexible, and in complexion cold and dry. And the Corde or Tendon is thus made: The synewes that come from the braine and from <hi>Mynuca,</hi> and goe to mooue the members, is intermingled with the Lygamentes, &amp; when the synewes and Lygamentes are intermingled together, then is made a Corde. And thrée causes I perceiue why the Cordes were made: The first is, that the Synewe alone is so sensible that hee may not suffer the great labour and trauell of mouing, without the fellowshippe and strength of the Lygament that is insensible, &amp; that letteth his great féeling, and bringeth him to a perfect temperaunce, and so the Cordes moue the limmes to the will of the soule. And this Corde is associated with a simple fleshe, and so thereof is made a brawne or a Muskle, on whom he might rest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his trauell. And this Brawne is called a Muskle. Then when this Corde is entred into this brawne, he is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into many small thréedes, the which be called wylle. And this will hath thrée properties. The first is in length, by whose vertue that draweth it hath might: The second in breadth, by whom the vertue that casteth out hath might: The third in thwartnes, in whom the vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e that holdeth hath might: and at the end of the Brawne those thréedes be gathered together to make an other Muskle. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Nowe I will beginne at the Artere. This Artere is a member cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11852:10"/>
is of complexion colde and drye. And all these Arteres haue two cotes, except one that goeth to the Lunges, and he hath but one cote that spreadeth abroad in the Lungs, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with him to the Lungs blood, with the spirite of life to nourish the Lungs withall: and also that Artere bringeth with him from the lungs ayre to temper the fumous heate that is in the heart. And this Artere is he that is called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria venalis,</hi> because he hath but one cote as a vaine, and is more obedient to be delated abroad through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>l the lungs, because that the blood might the sooner sweate through him: whereas all other Arters haue two cotes, because one cote may not withstande the might &amp; power of the spirite of life. Diuerse other causes there be, which shalbe declared in the Anatomie of the brest. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Ueyne is a simple member in complexion cold and drye, and spermaticke, like to the Artere, hauing his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Lyuer, and bringing from the Liuer nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue blood, to nourish euery member of the body with. And it is so to be vnderstanded that there is no more difference betwéene these two vessels of blood, but that the Artere is a vessell of bloud spirituall or vitall. And the Ueine is a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of bloud nutrimentall, of the which Ueines there is noted two most principall, of the which one is called <hi>Vena porta,</hi> the other is called <hi>venacelis,</hi> of whom it is too much to treate of nowe, vntill we come to the Anatomie of the wombe. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The flesh is a consimiler member, simple, not sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, and is ingendred of bloud congeled by heate, and is in complexion hote and moyst. Of the which is noted thrée kindes of fleshes: that is to say, one is soft <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> pure flesh: the second is muskulus, or hard &amp; brawny flesh: the third is glandulus, knotty, or kurnelly flesh. Also the commodities of the flesh be indifferent, for some be common to euery kind of flesh, and some be proper to one manner of flesh alone.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11852:11"/>
The profites of the flesh be many, for some defend the body from colde as doth clothes: also it defendeth the body from harde thinges comming against it: also through his moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture he rectifieth the body in sommer, in time of great heate. Wherefore it is to be considered what profitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is in euery kind of fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sh by himselfe. And first of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and pure flesh, which fulfilleth the concauities of voyde places, and causeth good forme and shape: and this flesh is founde betwéene the téeth, and on the end of the yard. The profite of the Brawny flesh or muskulus flesh, shall be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Anatomie of the armes. The profits of the Glandulus flesh are these: First, that it turneth the bloud into a cullour like to himselfe, as doth the fleshe of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans paps turne the menstruall bloud into milke: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Glandulus flesh of the Testikles, turneth the bloud into sparme: thirdly, the Glandulus flesh of the chéekes, that ingendreth the spittle. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The next is of Fatnes, of the which I find thrée kinds: The first is <hi>Pinguedo,</hi> and it is a consimilar member, not spermatike, and it is made of a subtill portion of bloud congeled by colde: and it is of complexion colde and moyst, insensible, and is intermedled amongest the partes of the flesh. The seconde is <hi>Adeppes,</hi> and is of the same kinde as is <hi>Pinguedo,</hi> but it is departed from the flesh besydes the skinne, and it is as an oyle heating and moysting the skinne. The third is <hi>Auxingia,</hi> and it is of kinde as the others be, but he is departed from the flesh within foorth about the kidneys, and in the intrayles, and it helpeth both the kidneys and the intrayles from drying by his vnctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then come we to the skinne. The Skinne is a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile member or officiall, partly spermatike, strong and tough, flexible and sensible, thinne and temperate, Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there be two kindes: One is the Skinne that couereth

the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And he is made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, because he should be a good dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of heate from colde, and of moystnesse from drynesse, that there should nothing noy nor hurt the body, but it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth warning to the common wits thereof. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Hayres of euery part of mans body are but a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of members, made of the grosse fume or smoke pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out of the viscoues matter, thickned to the forme of hayre. The profitablenesse of him is declared in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie of the head. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Nailes likewise are a superfluitie of members, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of great earthly smoke or fume resolued through the naturall heate of humours, and is softer then the Bone, and harder then the Flesh. In complexion they be cold and dry, and are always waxing in the extremitie of the fingers and toes. The vtilitie of them are, that by them a man shall take the better holde: also they helpe to clawe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die when it néedeth: Lastly, they helpe to deuide things for lacke of other tooles, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11852:12"/>
for the eyes For beastes that haue no heades, haue the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne or instruments of Wits in their brests. Therefore God and nature haue reared vp the head of man onely for the eyes, for it is the hyest member of man: and as a behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or watchman standeth in a high Towre to giue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the enemies, so doth the eye of man giue warning vnto the common Wits, for the defence of all other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body. Nowe to our purpose. If the question be asked, howe many things be there conteyning on the head, and howe manie thinges conteyned within the head? As it is rehearsed by Guydo, there be but fiue conteyning, and as manie conteyned: as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ayre, the Skinne, the Flesh, the Pannicles, and the Bone, neyther rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Ueyne nor Artere. The which Anatomie can not be truely without them both, as thou shalt well perceiue both in this Chapter, but specially in the next. And nowe in this lesson I shall speake but of Hayre, Skinne, Flesh, Ueynes, Pannicles, and Bones, what profitte they doe to man, euerie of them in his kinde. Of the Hayre of the head (whose creation is knowen in the Anatomie of the simple members) I doe note foure vtilities why it was ordeyned: the first is, that it defendeth the Brayne from too much heate, and too much cold, and many other outward noyances: The seconde is, it maketh the forme or shape of the head to séeme more séemelier or beautifuller. For if the head were not heyred, the face &amp; the head should seeme but one thing, and therefore the heyre formeth and shapeth the head from the face: The thirde is, that by the cullour of the heyre is witnessed and knowen the complexion of the Braine: The fourth is, that the fumosities of the Brayne might assende and passe lightlyer out by them. For if there were a sad thing, as the skinne or other, of the same nature as the heyre is, the fumosities of the brayne might not haue passed through it so lightly, as it doth by the hayre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:11852:12"/>The Skinne of the head is more lazartus, thicker, and more porrus, than any other Skinne of any other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the bodie. And two causes I note why, One is, that it kéepeth or defendeth the braine from too much heat and colde, as doeth the haire: The other, it discusseth to the common wittes of all things that noyeth out wardly, sor the heyre is insencible: The third cause, why the Skinne of the head is more thicker then any other Skinne of the body, is this, that it kéepeth the braine the more warme, &amp; is the better fence for the brayne, and it bindeth and kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the bones of the head the faster togither.</p>
               <p>Next followeth the Flesh, the which is al Musculus or Lazartus flesh, lying vppon <hi>pericranium</hi> without meane. And it is made of subtile Wille, and of simple flesh, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, Ueines, and Arteirs. And why the flesh that is all musculus or lazartus in euery member of a mans body was made is for thrée causes: the first is, that by his thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he should comfort the digestion of other members that lye by him: The second is, that through him euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is made the more formelyer, &amp; taketh the better shape: The third is, that by his meanes euery member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye draweth to him nourishing, the which others withold to put forth from them, as it shalbe more plainlyer spoken of in the Anatomie of the wombe.</p>
               <p>Next followeth <hi>Pericranium,</hi> or the couering of the bones of the head. But here it is to be noted of a Ueyne &amp; an Artere that commeth betwéene the flesh and this Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium, that nourisheth the vtter part of the head, and so entreth priuily through the commissaries of the skull, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Brayne and to his Pannicles nourishing: of whose substance is made both Duramater, and also Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium, as shall be declared in the partes conteyned in the head. Here it is to be noted of this Pannicle Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, that it bindeth or compasseth all the bones of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11852:13"/>
head, vnto whome is adioyned the Duramater, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a part of his substance, howbeit they bee separated, for Duramater is nearer the braine, and is vnder the skull. This Pericranium was made principally for two causes: one is, that for his strong binding togither he should make firme and stable the feeble commissaries or seames of the bones of the head: The other cause is, that it shoulde be a meane betwéene the hard bone and the soft flesh.</p>
               <p>Next is the Bone of the Pot of the head kéeping in the Braines, of which it were too long to declare their names after all Authors, as they number them and their names, for some name them after the Gréeke tongue, and some after the Arabian, but in conclusion al is to one purpose. And they be numbred seuen bones in the pan or skul of the head: the first is called the Coronal bone, in which is the Orbyts or holes of the Eyes, &amp; it reacheth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the browes vnto the middest of the head, and there it méeteth with the second bone called Occipissial, a bone of the hinder part of the head called the Noddel of the head, which two bones Coronal and Occipissial be deuided by the Commissaries in the middes of the head. The thirde and fourth bones be called Parietales, and they be the bones of the sideling partes of the head, and they be deuided by the Commisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries both from the foresaid Coronal and Occipissial. The fifth and sixth bones be called Petrosa or Mendosa: and these two bones lye ouer the bones called Parietales, on euery side of the head one, like skales, in whome be the holes of the eares. The seuenth and last of the head is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Paxillarie, or Bazillarie, the which bone is as it were a wedge vnto all the other seuen bones of the head, and doeth fasten them togeather. And thus be all numbred: the first is the Coronal bone: The seconde is the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pissiall: The thirde and the fourth is Parietales: The fifth and the sixth is Petrosa or Mendosa: and the seuenth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11852:13"/>
is Parillari, or Bazillari. And this suffiseth for the fiue things conteyning.</p>

               <p>NExt vnder the bones of the head withinfoorth, the first thing that appeareth is Duramater, then is Piamater, then the substance of the Braine, and then Uermy formes and Retemirabile. But first to speake of Duramater, whereof, and how it is sprong &amp; made: First it is to be noted of the Ueine and Arteire that was spoken of in the last Chapter before, how priuily they entred through the Commissoris or seames of the head, &amp; there by their vnion together, they do not onely bring and giue the spirite of life and nutriment, but also doe weaue themselues so togeather, that they make this pannicle Duramater. It is holden vp by certaine thréedes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe comming through the saide commissoris, running in to Pericranium or pannicle that couereth the bones of the head. And with the foresaide Ueyne and Arteire, &amp; these thréedes comming from Duramater, is wouen and made this Pericranium. And why this panicle Duramater is set from the skul, I note two causes: the first is, that if the Duramater should haue touched the skul, it should light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue béene hurt with the hardnesse of the bone: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cause is, that the matter that commeth of woundes made in the head pearsing the skul, should by it the better bée defended and kepte from Piamater, and hurting of the brayne. And nexte vnto this pannicle there is another pannicle called <hi>Piamater,</hi> or meeke mother, because it is so softe and tender vnto the brayne. Of whose creation it is to bée noted as of Duramater, for the originall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11852:14"/>
of their first creation is of one kind, both from the Hart and the Lyuer, &amp; is mother of the very substance of the braine. Why it is called Piamater, is, for because it is so soft and tender ouer the braine, that it nourisheth the braine &amp; fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, as doth a louing mother vnto her tender childe or babe, for it is not so tough and harde as is Duramater. In this pannicle Pia mater is much to bee noted of the great number of Ueynes and Arteirs that are planted, rame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying throughout all his substance, geuing to the brayne both spirite and life. And this Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And the aforesayde spirite or breath taketh a further digestion, and there it is made animal, by the eleboration of the spirite vitall is turned and made animal. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, why there be mo pannicles ouer the braine then one, is this, If there had beene but one pannicle onely, eyther it must haue beene harde, or soft or meane betweene both: If it had beene hard, it should haue hurt the brayne by his hardnesse: if it had beene soft, it should haue béene hurt of the hard bone: and if it had béene but meanely neither hard nor soft, it should haue hurt the brayne by his roughnesse, and also haue béene hurt of the hard bone. Therefore God and nature hath ordeyned two pannicles, the one harde, and the other soft, the harder to be a meane betwéene the soft and the bone: and the softer to be a meane betwéene the harder and the braine it selfe. Also these Pannicles be colde and drye of complexion, and spermaticke.</p>
               <p>Next is the Braine, of which it is marueilous to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered and noted, how this Piamater deuideth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Brayne, and lappeth it into certaine selles or

But here yee shall note that euery Uentrikle is diuided into two partes, and in euery parte God hath ordained and set singular and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall vertues, as thus: First in the foremost Uentrikle God hath founded and set the common Wittes, otherwise called the fiue Wittes, as Hearing, Séeing, Féeling, Smelling, and Lasting. And also there is in one parte of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>is Uentrikle, the vertue that is called Fantasie, and he taketh all the formes or ordinances that be disposed of the fiue Wittes, after the meaning of sensible thinges: In the other parte of the same Uentrikle is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Imaginatiue vertue, the which receiueth of the common Wittes the fourme or shape of sensitiue things, as they were receiued of the common wittes withoutfoorth representing their owne shape and ordinances vnto the memoratiue vertue. In the middest sel or ventrikle there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ounded and ordeined the Cogitatiue or estimatiue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: for hee rehearseth, sheweth, declareth, and déemeth those thinges that bee offered vnto him by the other that were spoken of before. In the thirde Uentrikle and last there is founded and ordeined the vertue Memoratiue: in this place is registred and kept those things that are done and spoken with the senses, and keepeth them in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie vnto the putting foorth of the fiue or common wittes, or orgaynes, or instruments of animall woorkes, out of whose extremities or lowar partes springeth My<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uca, or marowe of the spondels: of whome it shalbe spoken of in the Anatomie of the necke and backe. Furthermore it is to bee noted, that from the foremoste Uentrikle of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11852:15"/>
brayne springeth seuen payre of sensatiue or féeling se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, the which be produced to the Eyes, the Eares, the Nose, the Tongue, and to the Stomacke, and to diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes of the bodye: as it shal be declared in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomies. Also it is to bee noted, that about the middest ventrikle is the place of Uermi formis, with curnelly flesh that filleth, and Retemirabile, or wonderfull caule vnder the Pannicles, is set or bounded with Arteirs only which come from the heart, in the which the vital spirite by his great labour is turned and made animal. And yee shall vnderstande that these two bee the best kept partes of all the body, for a man shall rather dye, then anye of these shoulde suffer any manner of gréefes from without foorth, and therefore God hath set them farre from the heart. Héere I note the saying of <hi>Haly Abbas,</hi> of the comminge of small Arteirs from the heart, of whome (sayeth hée) is made a marueylous net or caule, in the which caule is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed the Brayne, and in that place is layde the spirite of féeling, from that place hath the spirite of feeling his firste creation, and from thence passeth to other members &amp;c. Furthermore yee shall vnderstande that the brayne is a member colde &amp; moyst of complexion, thin, &amp; meanly vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, &amp; a principal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, &amp; an official me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber &amp; spermatik. And first, why he is a principall member, is, because he is the gouernor or the treasurie of the fiue wits: And why he is an officiall member, is, because he hath the effect of fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and stering: And why hée is colde and moyst, is, that hée shoulde by his coldnesse and moystnesse abate and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the exceeding heate and drought that commeth from the heart: Also why it is moyst, is, that it shoulde bee the more indifferenter and abler to euery thing that shoulde bee reserued or gotten into him: Also why it is softe, is, that it shoulde giue place and fauour to the vertue of ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: And why it is meanely viscous, is, that his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11852:15"/>
shoulde bée strong and meanely tough, and that they shoulde not bee letted in their woorking through his ouermuch hardnesse. Here <hi>Galen</hi> demaundeth a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is this, Whether that féeling and moouinge be brought to Nerues by one or by dyuers? or whether the aforesayde thing bee brought substancially or radically. The matter (sayeth hee) is so harde to searche and bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that it were much better to let it alone and passe ouer it. <hi>Aristotle</hi> intreating of the braine, sayeth: The Brayne is a member continually moouing and ruling all other members of the bodye, giuing vnto them both fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and moouinge: for if the Brayne hée let, all other members bée let: and if the Brayne bée well, then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther members of the bodye bee the better disposed. Also the Brayne hath this propertie, that it mooueth and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the moouing of the Moone: for in the waxinge of the Moone the Brayne followeth vpwardes, and in the wane of the Moone the Brayne discendeth downwardes, and vanisheth in substance of vertue: for then the brayne shrinketh togeather in it selfe, and is not so fully obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the spirite of feeling. And this is prooued in men that be lunatike or madde, and also in men that bee epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentike or hauing the falling sicknesse, that bée most grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the beginning of the newe Moone, and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quarter of the Moone. Wherefore (sayeth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) when it happeneth that the Brayne is eyther too drye, or too moyst, then can it not woorke his kinde: for then is the bodye made colde: then are the spirites of life melted and resolued awaye: and then followeth féeblenesse of the Wittes, and of all other members of the bodye, and at the last death.</p>

                  </gap>y <hi>Galen,</hi> that these senewes bée hollowe as a réede, for two causes: The first is, that the visible spirite might passe freely to the Eyes: The seconde is, that the forme of visible thinges might freely be presented to the common wittes. Nowe marke the going foorth of these senewes: When these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes goe out from the substance of the Brayne, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth through the Piamater, of whose substance hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Pannicle or a Cote: and the cause why hee taketh that Pannicle is to kéepe him from noying, &amp; before they enter into the skull, they meete and are vnited into one senewe the length of halfe an inche: and then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte againe into two, and eche goeth into one eye, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring through the brayne panne, and these senewes bee called <hi>Nerui optici.</hi> And thrée causes I finde why these Nerues are ioyned in one before they passe into the Eye: First, if it happen any diseases in one eye, the other should receiue all the visible spirite that before came to bothe: The seconde is, that all thinges that wee see shoulde not seeme two: for if they had not béene ioyned together, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing shoulde haue séemed two, as it doth to a worme, and to other beastes: The thirde is, that the Senewe might stay and helpe the other. But here vpon <hi>Lamfranke</hi> accordeth much, saying, that these two Senewes come together to the Eyes, and take a Pannikle both of Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mater and of Duramafer, and when they enter into the Orbyt of the Eye, there the extremities are spread abroad, the which are made of thrée substances: that is to saye, of Duramater of Piamater, and of <hi>Nerui-optici.</hi> There be engendred thrée Tunikles or Cotes, as thus: Of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

And it is to be vnderstood, that eche of these thrée Tunicles be deuided, and so they make sixe: that is to say, iij. of the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And thus you maye perceiue the springing of them: as thus, of Duramater springeth Sclirotica and Cornua: of Piamater springeth Secondina and Unia: and of Nerui optici springeth Coniunctiua. Now to speak of the humors which be thrée, &amp; their places are the middle of the Eyes: of the which the first is Humor Uitrus, because he is like glasse, in colour very cleare, red, liquit, or thinne, &amp; he is in the inward side next vnto the brayne: and it is thinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the nutritiue blood of the Christalin might passe, as water through a sponge should be clensed &amp; made pure, and also that the visible spirit might the lightlyer passe through him from the brayne. And he goeth about the Cristaline humour, vntil he méete with Albuginus humour, which is set in the vttermost part of the Eye. And in the middest of these humours Uitrus, &amp; Albuginus, is set the Crystaline humour, in which is set principally the sight of the Eye.

Ouer these two is set Colatorium, that we call the Nosethrils: and it is set betwéene the Eyes, vnder the vpper part of the Nose. And it is to be noted, that this concauitie or ditch was made for two causes: The first is, that the ayre that bringeth foorth the spirite of smelling might rest in it, till it were taken of the orgaine or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of smelling: The second cause is, that the super <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Brayne might be hidden vnder it, vntill it were clensed: And from his concauitie there goeth two holes downe into the mouth, of which there is to be noted thrée profits:. The first is, that when a mans mouth is close, or when he eateth or sléepeth, that then the ayre might come through them to the Lunges, or els a mans mouth should alwayes be open: The seconde cause is, that they helpe to the relation of the forme of the Nose: for it is sayde, a man speaketh in his Nose when any of these holes be stopped: The third cause is, that the concauitie might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ensed by them when a man snuffeth the Nose, or draweth into his mouth inwardly. The Nose is a member consimple or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, appearing without the face, somewhat plicable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it should the better be clensed. And it is to be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that it is compound and made of skin &amp; lazartus flesh, and of two bones standing in maner trianglewise, whose extremities be ioyned in one part of the Nose with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronall bone, and the nether extremities are ioyned with two grystles, and another that diuideth the Nosethrilles within, and holdeth vp the nose: Also there be two conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities or holes, that if one were stopped the other should serue: Also there is in the Nose two Muskles, to helpe the working of his office. And <hi>Galen</hi> sayth, that the Nose sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the Face most: for where the Nose lacketh (sayth he)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11852:18"/>
all the rest of the face is the more vnséemely. The Nose should be of a meane bignes, and not to excéede in length, or breadth, nor in highnes. For Aristotle sayth, if the Nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrilles be too thinne, or too wyde, by great drawing in of ayre. it betokeneth great straightnesse of heart, and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thought. And therefore it is to be noted, that the shape of the members of the bodie, betokeneth and iudgeth the affections and will of the Soule of man, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher sayeth. The temples be called the members of the head, and they haue that name because of continuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. And as the science of the Anatomie meaneth, the spirite vital is sent from the heart to the brayne by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teirs, and by veines and nutrimentall blood, where the vessels pulsati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Also the temples haue dents or holes inwardly, wherein he taketh the humour that commeth from the brayne, and bringeth the eyes asléepe, and if the saide holes or dentes be pressed and wroung, then by trapping of the humour that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth, he maketh the teares to fall from the Eye. The Chéekes are the sideling partes of the face, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne in them Musculus flesh, with Ueynes and Arteirs, and about these partes be many Muscles. <hi>Guido</hi> maketh mention of vij. about the chéekes and ouer lip. And <hi>Haly Abbas</hi> sayeth, there be twelue muscles that moue the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iawe, some of them in opening, and other some in closing or shutting, passing vnder the bones of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, And they be called <hi>Temporales:</hi> And they bee right noble and sensatiue, of whose hurt is much peril. Also there be other Muskles for to grinde &amp; to chewe. And to all these Muscles commeth Nerues from the brayne to giue them féeling and mouing: and also there commeth to them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arteirs and Ueines, and chéefly about the temples, and the angles or corners of the Eyes and the Lippes. And as the Philosophers saye, the chéefe beautie in man is in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11852:19"/>
chéekes, and there the complexion of man is most knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as thus: If they be full, ruddy and medled with temperate whitenesse and not fat in substance, but meanly fleshly, it betokeneth hoat and moyst of complexion, that is, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin and temperat in coller. And if they bee white colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, without medling of rednesse, and in substance fat and soft, quauering, it betokeneth excesse &amp; superfluitie of colde and moyst, that is flegmatike: And if they be brown in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or cytrin, yelowe, redde, and thinne, and leane in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betokeneth great drying and heate, that is chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike: And if they be as it were blowen in colour, &amp; of litle flesh in substance, it betokeneth excesse and superfluitie of drynes and cold, and that is Melancolie. And as <hi>Auicen</hi> sayeth, the Chéekes doe not onely shewe the diuersities of complexions, but also the affection and wil of the hart: for by the affection of the heart, by sodaine ioye or dread, hee waxeth either pale or redde. The bones or bonye partes, first of the chéekes be two: of the Nose outwardly, two: of the vpper Mandible, two: within the Nose thrée: as thus, one diuiding the Nosethrils within, and in ech Nosthrill one, and they seeme to be rowled like a wafer, and haue a hollownesse in them, by which the ayre is respyred &amp; dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to the Lungs, and the superfluitie of the Brayne is purged into the mouthwardes, as is before rehearsed. But <hi>Guydo and Galen</hi> saye, that there be in the face nyne bones, yet I cannot finde that the nether Mandible should be of the number of those nyne: for the nether Mandible accompted there, proueth them to be ten in number. Of which thing I will hold no argument, but remit it to the sight of your eyes. The partes of the mouth are fiue, that is to saye, the Lippes, the téeth, the tongue the Uuila, and the Pallet of the mouth. And first to speake of the lippes, they are members consimile or officiall, full of Musculus flesh, as is aforesaide, and they were ordeined for two
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11852:19"/>
causes, one is, that they shoulde be to the mouth as a doore to a house, and to kéepe the mouth close til the meate were kindly chewed: The other cause is, that they shoulde bee helpers to the pronouncing of the speache. The téeth are members consimile or officiall, spermatike, and hardest of any other members, and are fastened in the chéeke bones, &amp; were ordayned for three causes: First that they shoulde chewe a mans meat, er it should passe down, that it might be the sooner digested: The seconde, that they shoulde be a helpe to the speach, for they that lacke their téeth doe not perfectly pronounce their wordes: the thirde is, that they should serue to beastes as weapons. The number of them is vncertaine, for some men haue mo, and some lesse, they that haue the whole number haue xxxij. that is to saye, xvi. aboue, and as many beneath, as thus: two <hi>Dwallies,</hi> two <hi>Quadripulles,</hi> two <hi>Cannines,</hi> eight <hi>Morales,</hi> &amp; two <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sales.</hi> The Tongue is a carnous member, compounde &amp; made of manye Nerues, Lygaments, Ueynes, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teirs, ordayned principally for thrée causes: The first is, that when a man eateth, the Toung might helpe to turne the meate til it were well chewed: The seconde cause is, that by him is receiued the taste of swéete and sower, and presented by him to the common wittes: The thirde is, that by him is pronounced euery speache. The fleshly part of the tongue is white, and hath in him nine muskles, and about the roote of him is Glandulus, in the which be two welles, and they be euer full of spittle to temper and kéepe moyst the tongue, or else it woulde waxe drie by reason of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Uuila is a member made of a spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous flesh, hanging downe from the ende of the Pallet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the gullet of the throat, and is a member in complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion colde and drie, and often tymes when there fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth rawnesse or much moystnesse into it from the head, then it hangeth downe in the throat, and letteth a man to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11852:20"/>
swallowe, and it is broad at the vpper ende, and small at the nether. It was ordeined for diuerse causes, One is, that by him is holpen the sounde of speache, for where the Uuila i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> lacking, there lacketh the perfect sound of speach. Another is, that it might helpe the prolation of vomites: Another is, that by him is tempered &amp; abated the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of the ayre that passeth to the Lungs: Another is, that by him is guided the superfluities of the brayne that commeth from the coletures of the Nose, or else the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities should fall downe soudenly into the mouth, the which were a displeasure. The Pallet of the mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth nothing else but a carnous Pannikle, &amp; the bones that be vnderneath it haue two diuisions, One along the Pallet from the diuision of the Nose, &amp; from the opening of the other Mandible vnto the nether ende of the Pallet, lacking halfe an inche, and there it deuideth ouerthwart, and the first diuision is of the Mandible, and the seconde is of the bone called Paxillarie or Bazillarie, that sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and byndeth all other bones of the head together. The skinne of the Pallet of the mouth is of the inner part of the stomacke and of Myre, and of Ysofagus, that is the way of the meate into the stomacke. The way howe to knowe that such a pannicle is of that part of the stomacke, may be knowen when that a man is touched within the mouth, anon he beginneth to tickle in the stomacke, and the néerer that he shall couche vnto the throte, the more it abhorreth the stomacke, and often times it causeth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>omacke to yeeld from him that is within him, as when a man doeth vomite. Also in the mouth is ended the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extremitie of the Wesande, which is called Myre or Isofagus. And with him is contayned <hi>Trachia arteria,</hi> that is, the waye of the ayre whose holes be couered with a lap like a tongue, and is gristly, that the meate and drinke might slyde ouer him into Isofagus: The which

grystle when a man speaketh it is reared vp, and couereth the waye of the meate: and when a man swalloweth the meate, then it couereth the way of the ayre, so that when the one is couered the other is discouered. For if a man open the waye of the ayre when he swalloweth, if there fall a crum into it, he shall neuer cease coughing vntil it be vp againe. And this suffiseth for the face.</p>

From the hole of the first spondel springeth the first payre of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, betwéene the first spondel and the seconde, and so foorth of all the rest in like manner as of these. Also these senewes receiue subtil wille of the senewes of the Brayn, of the which wille, &amp; senewes, and flesh, with a pannicle, make the composition of Muskels, Lazartes, &amp; Brawnes, the which thrée things are all one, and be the instruments of voluntarie mouing of euery member.

And they are ordained for this cause, that when the Senewes bée wearie of ouermuch labour with mouing and trauayle, that they might rest vpon them as vppon a bedde. The seconde flesh is musculus, from whome springeth the Tendons and cordes that mooue the head and the necke, which be numbred twentie, as is afore declared: The thirde flesh replenisheth the voyde places, &amp;c. The thirde parte of the necke is called <hi>Gutture,</hi> and it is the standing out of the Throte boll. The fourth parte is called <hi>Gula,</hi> and the hinder parte <hi>Ceruix,</hi> and hath that name of the Philosophers because of the marrowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Ridge bones.

               <head>The Anatomie of the Lungs.</head>
               <p>THE Lungs is a member spcrmatike of his first creation, and his naturall complexion is colde and drye, and in his accidentall complexion he is colde and moyste, lapped in a Neruous Pannicle, because it should gather togeather the softer substance of the Lungs, and that the Lungs might féele by the meanes of the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, that which he might not féele in him selfe. Nowe to proue the Lungs to be colde and drye of kind, it appeareth by his swift stéering, for he lyeth euer wauing ouer the heart, and about the heart. And that he is colde and moyst in rewarde, it appeareth well, that hee receiueth of the brayne many colde matters, as Cataries, and Rumes, whose substance is thinne. Also I finde in the Lungs thrée kindes of substance: One is a Ueyne comming from the Liuer, bringing with him the Crude or rawe parte of the Chytle to féede the Lungs: Another is <hi>Arterea venealis,</hi> comming from the heart, bringing with him the spirite of life to nourish him with: The thirde is <hi>Trachia arteria,</hi> that bringeth in ayre to the Lungs, and it passeth through all the left part of them to doe his office. The Lungs is deuided into fiue Lobbes or Pellikels, or fiue portions, that is to saye, thrée in the right side, and two in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>fte side. And it was don for this cause that if there fel any hurt in the one part, the others should serue and doe their office. And thrée causes I find why the Lungs were principallye ordeined: First, that they should draw cold wind, &amp; refresh the heart: The second, that they should change &amp; alter, and purifie the aire before it come to the heart, least the heart were hurt &amp; noyed with the quantitie of the aire: The third cause is, that they should receiue from the hart the fumous

superstuities that he putteth foorth with his breathing, &amp;c. Behind the Lungs toward the Spondels, passeth Mire or Isofagus, of whom it is spoken of in the Anatomie of the neck. And also there passeth both Ueynes and Arteirs, &amp; al these with <hi>Trachia arteria,</hi> doe make a Stoke, replete vnto the Gullet with Pannikles, and strong Lygaments, and glandulus flesh to fulfil the voyd places. And laste of al is the Midriffe, and it is an officiall member, made of two Pannikles, and Lazartus flesh, and his place is in the middest of the body, ouerthwart or in bredth vnder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the spirituall members, departing them from the matrix. And thrée causes I finde why the Midriffe was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained: First, that it should diuide the spirituals from the nutrates: The second, that it should kéepe the vital colour or heat to dissend down to the nutrates: The last is, that the malicious fumes reared vp from the nutrates, shoulde not noy the spirituals or vitals &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The womb is the region or the citie of all the Intrails, the which reacheth from the Midriffe down vnto the share inwardly, and outwardly from the Keynes or Kydnes, down to the bone Pecten, about the priuie partes. And this womb is compound and made of two thinges, that is to say, of <hi>Syfac</hi> and <hi>Myrac. Syfac</hi> is a Pannicle, and a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber spermatik, official, sensible, senowy, compound of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til wil, and in complexion cold and dry, hauing his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the inner Pannicle of the Midriffe. And it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined because it should conteine and bind togither all the Intrals, and that he defende the Musculus so that hee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse not the natural members. And that he is strong &amp; tough, it is because he should not be lightly broken, &amp; that those things that are conteyned go not foorth, as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to them that are broken, &amp;c. <hi>Myrac</hi> is compound and made of foure things, that is, of skin outwardly, of fatnes, of a carnous pannicle, and of Musculus flesh. And that it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11852:25"/>
is to be vnderstanded, that all the whole from <hi>Syfac</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is called <hi>Myrac,</hi> it appeareth well by the wordes of <hi>Galen,</hi> where he commaundeth, that in all wounds of the wombe to sewe the <hi>Sifac</hi> with the <hi>Myrac,</hi> and by that it proueth that there is nothing without the <hi>Sifac</hi> but <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac.</hi> And in this <hi>Myrac</hi> or vtter part of the womb, there is noted eight Muscles, two Longitudinals. procéeding from the shéeld of the Stomacke vnto <hi>Os Pecten:</hi> two Latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals comming from the backwardes to the wombe: and foure transuersè, of the which two of them spring from the Ribbes on the right side, and go to the left side, to the bones of the Hanches, or of Pecten: and the other two spring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ribbes on the left, and come ouer the womb to the right partes, as the other before doth. Here it is to be noted, that by the vertue of the subtil wil that is in the Musculus lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudinal, is made perfect the vertue attractiue: and by the Musculus transuerse is made the vertue retentiue: and by the Musculus latitudinal is made the vertue expulsiue.

Also hee sayeth, that in woundes persing the wombe there shall not bee made good incarnation, except <hi>Sifac</hi> bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with <hi>Mirac.</hi> Nowe to come to the partes conteyned within: First, that which appeareth next vnder the <hi>Sifac</hi> is <hi>Omentum,</hi> or <hi>Zirbus,</hi> the which is a Pannicle coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the stomacke and the Intrals, implanted with many Ueines and Arteirs, &amp; not a little fatnes ordeined to kéepe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11852:26"/>
moyst the inward parts. This Zirbus is an official mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, &amp; is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound of a veyne &amp; an Arteir, the which entreth &amp; maketh a line of the vtter tunikle of the stomacke, vnto which tunikle hangeth the Zirbus, and couereth all the guttes down to the shayre. Two causes I finde why they were ordained: one is that they shoulde defende the nutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues outwardly: the second is, that through his owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and vertue he should strength &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Next Zirbus apeareth the Intrals or guttes, of which <hi>Galen</hi> sayeth, that the Guttes were ordeined in the first creation to conuey the drosse of the meate &amp; drinke, and to clense the bodie of their superfluities.

And two causes I find why he was ordained there: The first is, that by the melancolious superfluities that are ingendred of the Lyuer which he draweth to him, hee is nourished with: The second cause is, that the nutritiue blood should by him be made the more purer &amp; cleane, from the drosse and thicking of melancolie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And next of the Reynes and Kidnes: It is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, that within the region of the Nutrites backwards, are ordeyned the Kidnes, to clense the blood from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie superfluities, and they haue eche of them two pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, or holes, or neckes: by the one is drawen the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Uenakelis by two veynes, which are called <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na emulgentes,</hi> the length of a finger of a man, and issueth from the Lyuer: and by the other is sent the same water to the Bladder, and is called <hi>Poros vrithides.</hi> The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Kidnes is Lazattus flesh, hauing longitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wil. And their place is behinde on eache side of the Spondels, and they are two in number, and the right Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lyeth somewhat higher than the left, and is bound fast to the backe with Lygaments. The Philosopher sayeth, that mans Kidneys are like to the Kidneys of a Cowe, ful of harde knottes, hauing in him many harde concauities, and therefore the sores of them be harde to cure. Also they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11852:29"/>
are more harder in substaunce then any other fleshly Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ber, and that for two causes, one is: that he be not much hurt of the sharpnesse of the vrine: The other is, that the same vrine that passeth from him might the better be altered and clensed through the same. Also there commeth from the harte to eache of the kidneys an arteire, that bringeth with him bloud, heate, spirit, and lyfe. And in the same maner there commeth a veyne from the. Lyuer, that bringeth blood to nourishe the kydeneys. called blood nutrimentall, The grease of these kydneys or fatnes is as of other inward me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but it is an officiall member, made of thinne bloude, congeled and cruded through colde, and ther is ordeined the greater quantitie in his place, because it should receaue and temper the heate of the kydneys, which they haue of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sharpnesse of the water. Now by the kydneys vpon the Spondels passeth <hi>Venakelis,</hi> or <hi>venacaua,</hi> which is a veine of great substaunce, for he receyueth all the nutrimentall bloud from the Lyuer, and from him passeth many small pypes on euery side, and at the Spondell betwéene the shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he deuideth him selfe whole into two great braunches the one goeth into the one arme, &amp; the other into the other, and there they deuide them selues into manye veynes, and braunches: as is declared in the armes.</p>

And first of the parts conteining: as of Myrac, Sifac, and Zirbus, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough spoken of in the Anatomy of the wombe. But as for the bones of the Hanches, There be of the parts of the backe thrée Spondels of <hi>Ossa sacri,</hi> or of the Hanches, and thrée <hi>cartaliginis</hi> spondeles of <hi>Ossa caude,</hi> called, The Tayle bonne. And thus it is proued, that there is in euery man xxx. spondels, and thus they are to be numbred: In the necke seauen, in the Ridge twelue: In the Reynes fyue: and in the Hanches six, And it is to be noted, that euery Spondell is hollowe in the middest: through which hollowenesse pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Nuca from the brayne, or the marrowe of the backe. And some Authors say, that Mynuca is of the substaunce that the Brayne is of, for it is lyke in substance, and in it selfe geueth to the Nerues both the vertue of mouing and féeling. And also euerye Spondell is holed on euerye side, through the which holes both artiers and veynes, doe bring from the Harte and the Lyuer both lyfe and nourishement, lyke as they doe to the Brayne: and from the pannicle of Mynuca or the Marrowe of the backe, through the holes of the sides of the Spondels, springeth foorth Nerues motiues and there they intermeddle themselues with the strong Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments that be insencible, and so the Lygamentes rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And by this reson many Authors proue, that Mynuca is of the same Substaunce that the Brayne is of, and the Pannicles of the Nuca is of the same Substance of the Pannicles of the Brayne. &amp;c. And eche of these spondels be bound fast one with an other, so that one of them maye

not wel be moued without another. And so al these spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels togither, contayned one by another are called the Ridgebone, which is the foundation of all the shape of the body. They with the last spondel be conteyned or ioyned to the bones of the Hanches, and they be the vpholders of all the spondels. And these bones be small towardes the tayle bone, and broad towardes the Hanches, and before they ioyne and make <hi>Os pectinis.</hi> And so they be broad in the partes of the Iles, and therefore some Authors calleth it <hi>Ilea.</hi> And ech of these two bones toward the Liuer hath a great round hole, into the which is receiued the bone cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Vertebra,</hi> or, The whorle bone, Also besides that place there is a great hole or way, through the which passeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue Musculus, veynes, and Arteirs, and goe into the Thyes. And thus it is to be noted, that of this bone <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cten,</hi> and the bone <hi>Vertebra,</hi> is made the iuncture of the Thye.</p>
               <p>Now to speake of the partes conteined, the first thing that commeth to sighte, is the bladder, the which is an officiall member, compound of two neruous Pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nicles, in complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion colde and drye, whose necke is carnous, and hath mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to withholde, and to let goe: and in men it is long, and is contained with the yard, passing through <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> but in women it is shorter, and is contained within the <hi>Vulua.</hi> The place of the bladder is betwéene the bone of the Share and the tayle gutte called <hi>Longaon,</hi> and in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men it is betwéene the foresaid bone and the Matrix. And in it is implanted two long vessels comming from the Kidneis, whose names be <hi>Porri vrichides,</hi> bringing with them the Urin or water from the Kidnes to the Bladder, which priuily entreth into the holes of the pannicles of the bladder, by a natural mouing betwéene tunicle &amp; tunicle, &amp; there the vrin findeth the hole of the nether tunicle, and there it entreth priuily into the concauitie of the bladder,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11852:30"/>
and the more that the bladder is filled with vrin, the strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be the two tunicles comprised togéether, for the holes of the tunicles be not euen one against another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the bladder bee neuer so full, there may none goe backe againe. The forme of it is rounde, the quantitie of it is a pitcher full, in some more, and in some lesse, &amp;c. Also there is founde two other vessels called <hi>vaza semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> or the spermatike vessels. And they come from Uena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelis, bringing bloud to the Testikles, as wel in man, as in woman, in the which by his further digestion it is made sparme or nature in men. They be put outwarde, for the Testikles bee without, but in women it abydeth within, for their Testikles stande within, as it shalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared hereafter.</p>
               <p>Nexte followeth the Matrix in women: The Matrix in woman is an officiall member, compounde and Nerueous and in complexion cold and dry. And it is the féelde of mans generation, and it is an instrument susceptiue, that is to say a thing receauing or taking: &amp; her proper place is betwéen the bladder and the gutte <hi>Longaon,</hi> the likenes of it, is as it were a yarde reuersed or turned inwarde: hauing testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles likewise, as aforesayd, Also the Matrix hath two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauities or selles, and no moe, but all beastes haue as many selles as they haue pappes heades. Also it hath a long necke lyke an vrinall, and in euery necke it hath a mouth, that is to say, one within, and an other without. The inner in the tyme of the conception is shutte, and the vtter parte is open as it was before: and it hath in the middest a Lazartus pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, which is called in Latin <hi>Tentigo.</hi> And in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Pannicle, is founde two vtilities: The first is, that by it goeth forthe the vrine, or els it should be shedde throughout all the <hi>Vulua:</hi> The second is, that when a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth set her thies abroade it altereth the ayre that com meth to the matrix for to temper the heate. Furthermore

Furthermore, it is said, that of this Embreon is ingendred the Hart, the Lyuer, the Brayne, Nerues, veines, Arteirs, Cordes, Lygaments, Skinnes, Gristles and bones, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to them by kindly vertue the menstruall bloud, of which is ingendred both flesh and fatnes. And as writers say, the first thing that is shapen be the principals, as is the Hart, Lyuer, and Brayne. For of the Hart springeth the Arteirs, of the Lyuer the Ueines, and of the Brayne the Nerues: and when these are made, Nature maketh &amp; sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth bones and grystles to keepe and saue them, as the bones of the head for the Brayne, the Brest bones and the Ribbes for the Hart and the Lyuer. And after these sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth all other members one after another. And thus is the child bred foorth in foure degrées, as thus: The first is, when the sayde sparme or séede is at the firste as 'it were mylke: The seconde is, when it is turned from that kinde into another kinde, is yet but as a lumpe of blood, and this is called of <hi>Ypocras, Fettus:</hi> The third degrée is, when the principals be shapen, as the Hart, Lyuer, and Brayne: The fourth and laste, as when all the other members bee perfectly shapen, then it receiueth the soule with life and breath, and then it beginneth to moue it selfe alone. Now in these foure degrées aforesaid, in the first as milke it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth vii. dayes: in the second as <hi>Fettus</hi> ix. dayes: in the thirde, as a lumpe of flesh ingendring the principals the space of ix. dayes: and the fourth vnto the tyme of full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all the whole me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, is the space of, xviii. dayes: So is there, xlvi. dayes from the daye of conception vnto the day of full perfection and receiuing of the soule, as God best knoweth.</p>
               <p>Now to come againe to the Anatomie of the Hanches: Then come we to <hi>Longaon,</hi> otherwise called, The tayle gutte, whose substance is panniculer, as of al the other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, the length of it is of a span long, stretching nigh to

Also the yarde hath a skinne, &amp; about the head thereof, it is double, and that men call <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pusium,</hi> and this skinne is moueable, for through his conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration the spermaticke matter is the better and sooner ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and sooner cast forth from the Testicles: for by him is had the more delectation in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

he is without a fellowe, and he is full of Marrowe, and is rounde at either ende: The roundnesse that is at the vpper ende is called <hi>Vertebrum,</hi> or Whorle bone, and boweth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and is receaued into the boxe or hole of the hanche bone: and at the lower and towards the Knée there it hath two roundes, which be receaued into the concauities of the bone of the legge, at the knée, called the great Fossels. Ther is also at the knée a rounde bone called, The knée panne. Then followeth the legge, wherein is two bones, called <hi>Focile maior,</hi> and <hi>Focile minor,</hi> the bigger of them passeth before, making the shape of the shinne, and it is called the shinne bone, and passeth downe making the inner ancle. The lesse passeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knée backwards, dissending down to the vtter ankle, and there formeth that ankle. &amp;c. The bones of the foote are, xxvj. as thus, Fyrst, next the ankle bone is one, called in Latine <hi>Orabalistus:</hi> nexte vnder that towardes the Héele is one, called <hi>Calcany:</hi> and betwéene them is an other bone called <hi>Os Nauculare:</hi> In the seconde ward there be foure bones, called <hi>Raceti,</hi> as be in the hands. In the third and fourth warde be, xiiij. called <hi>Digitori:</hi> and v. called <hi>Pectens</hi> at the extremities of the Toes, next to the nayles. And thus be there in the foote, xxvj. bones with the Legge from the Ankle to the Knée, two in the Knée, and one rounde and flatte bone, and in the Thye one. And thus shall you finde in the whole Legge and Foote, xxx. bones. And this suffiseth for young Practicioners.<pb facs="tcp:11852:32"/>
