         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

have brave Names, but mean
Actions; ſome brave Actions,
and mean Names; and ſome

In the firſt number <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed</hi>
may not unfitly be reckoned, who in
excellency of Name, was ſecond to none,
and yet in depravity of Manners had few
equals. For we are aſſured by the Learned
in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Language, that <hi>Mahumed</hi>
comes of a word ſignifying <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Honor;</hi>
and that this Notation of his Name, was but
a preſage of his future Actions, whereby he
merited and purchaſed both. Others ſay,
<hi>Mahumed</hi> imports <hi>Thanksgiving;</hi> which is to
be underſtood, with reſpect to their duty of
Gratitude, who believe he procured great
benefits for them. And that there might
want nothing of lucky Abodement in the
Name of this Great Impoſtor, ſome of his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94943:6"/>
               <hi>flattering Doctors</hi> Paraphraſe it by <hi>A Man of
Deſires,</hi> which in Latin we may call <hi>Deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
And this notice of the Name they
confirm, by a Sacrilegious application of the
7 verſe of <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. to <hi>filthy Mahumed,</hi> which
was ſolely intended of the moſt <hi>Holy Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Writing and Pronunciation of
this Name, there wants not variety, both
among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins:</hi> ſome ſpelling
it <hi>Machumet,</hi> and <hi>Machumeth;</hi> and others
<hi>Mohummed,</hi> and <hi>Muhammud:</hi> but as to the
<hi>Moors</hi> (whom we are chiefly to follow in this
matter) thoſe of <hi>Barbary</hi> both Write and
Pronounce it, <hi>Ahmet,</hi> a Name familiarly
given to their Sons, as votive of their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and commemorative of their Prophet.
But though the Name of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> or <hi>Ahmet,</hi>
be now of very ordinary and common uſage
among the <hi>Muſulmin:</hi> yet it was of old a
very great ſecret, and not lawful for any to
bear, whom they did not conjecture might
prove to be that Prophet, whom (they now
ſay) was ever expected by them. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Muhumedans</hi> produce a Tradition,
which Age hath made Authentique among
them, <hi>How that there were but three Men who
were ever known by the Name of</hi> Mahumed,
<hi>before their Prophet; to whom their Parents
gave this Name, in hopes they might prove that
Apoſtle of God, whom they expected.</hi> Now
that the <hi>Arabians</hi> had a Tradition, that they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94943:6"/>
ſhould have an Apoſtle ſent unto them by
the Name of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> ſeems not obſcurely
intimated by that ſevere Warning the falſe
Prophet gave his followers, in the ſixth
Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> (ſtyled the Chapter
of <hi>Arrah</hi>) where <hi>Mahumed</hi> having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
thoſe who fought in rank and file
for his Law, he bids them, <hi>Remember, that</hi>
Moſes <hi>ſaid to his people, Ye ſhall do me (that
is,</hi> Mahumed) <hi>no harm: ye ſhall know in the
end, that I am the Meſſenger of God. But
God ſeduced them from the right way, when
they departed from obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
he judgeth the wicked.</hi> Theſe are
the expreſs words of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> But leſt
the ſingle teſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould not be
ſufficient to procure belief to what he had
ſaid, he produceth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſpeaking to the
ſame purpoſe, <hi>Remember, that</hi> Jeſus <hi>the Son
of</hi> Mary <hi>ſaid, O ye Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I am
to you the Apoſtle of God, who hath ſent me
to verifie and confirm the old Teſtament, and
to declare unto you, that there ſhall come a
Prophet after me, whoſe Name ſhall be</hi> Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
(ſaith <hi>Dy Ryers</hi> French Tranſlation)
whoſe Name is <hi>Achmed</hi> (ſaith another Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>) that is, <hi>Mahumed.</hi> Now
if the old <hi>Arabians</hi> had not by ſome blind
Tradition been taught to expect a Prophet
under the Name we now ſpeak of, it would
have been infinitely below the cunning and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94943:7"/>
ſagacity of this great Cheat, to have cited
ſayings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to a purpoſe of
which they before had never had the leaſt
footſtep or intimation. And I am induced to
believe, that all this was occaſion'd by ſome
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> corrupt Gloſs concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi>
and a miſtake about the promiſe of ſending
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> for to this day, the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medans</hi>
apply the promiſed Miſſion of the
<hi>Paraclete,</hi> to relate unto <hi>Mahumeds</hi> coming,
and that in him it was certainly fulfilled. And
that this may not be looked upon as a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of mine own, we find thoſe Learned
and Ingenious perſons, who have given us
an account of the <hi>Mahumedan</hi> Doctors in this
particular, do always bring them in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the truth of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Prophetick Office,
by applying to him, what our Saviour ſpoke
of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17.
Though it is manifeſt to every attentive and
ſober Diſcerner, that there is not in that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Text the leaſt ground whereon to build
ſuch an extravagant conjecture. But yet
we cannot deny the great ſubtilty of <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
in making ſuch pretended promiſes to
have their accompliſhment in his own meſſage;
as alſo in making uſe of a dark Tradition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> concerning their
promiſe of an Apoſtle. And I take the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
management of the ſaid Tradition, to
have been the firſt Engine of raiſing <hi>Mahumed</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94943:7"/>
to the reputation of a Divine Meſſenger.
Though it cannot be denyed, but he was a
Man of ſo <hi>great aſſurance,</hi> that if he had not
been aſſiſted with any ſuch Tradition, his
<hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> would ſufficiently
have tempted him to aſpire both to a Prince
and a Prophet, as we may ſhow in due
place.</p>
            <p>But yet for all this, I find not <hi>Mahumed</hi>
very forward in juſtifying his pretences upon
the ſcore of Predictions concerning his
coming, though his Doctors are very zealous
in aſſerting his Apoſtleſhip, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Prophecies, among which they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
the words of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 33. 2. <hi>The
Lord came from</hi> Sinai, <hi>and roſe up from</hi> Seir
<hi>unto them; he ſhined forth from Mount</hi> Paran.
The <hi>Mahumedan</hi> Doctors from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
of a triple manifeſtation of God to
Man: Firſt, by <hi>Moſes</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,

and laſtly, at <hi>Paran</hi> by <hi>Mahumed,</hi> which
(they ſay) is a great Hill near <hi>Mecca.</hi> By the

<hi>Mahumedan</hi> Writers moſt Blaſphemouſly
abuſe the ſecond verſe of the 50 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> to
the coming of their Apoſtle; becauſe in the
<hi>Syriack</hi> there is found the word <hi>Mahmud,</hi>
which they abſurdly, and againſt all ſenſe of

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94943:8"/>
either in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, or in the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the <hi>Syriack</hi> word, there is not

as Men excellently verſed in both Languages

any farther, I ſhall diſmiſs it with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
that the great Paraſites of <hi>Mahumed,</hi>
according to his threefold ſtate, aſſign him a

            <p>HAving (in the antecedent Chapter) with
equal brevity and plainneſs, ſet down
what more egregiouſly imported the Name
of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> and intimated the Holy
Scriptures that are forced to inſinuate his
being deſigned for a Prophet; I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
with the ſame perſpicuity and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to give an account of his Parentage.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94943:8"/>
And not to engage in the differences which
in this concern are to be met with, between
the <hi>Saracen</hi> and Chriſtian ſtories; I ſhall
through this whole diſcourſe chiefly adhere
to the former, as being in all likelihood more
competent to furniſh us with <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend;
whoſe riſe we ſhall take from the place
of his Nativity, which is not a little contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Writers;
both being deſirous to have him ſpring from
their own Nation, and to be honoured with
his Genealogie. But the prevailing opinion
makes him a Native of <hi>Mecca,</hi> a known Town
in <hi>Arabia the Happy.</hi> Where his Pedegree is
unanimouſly derived from <hi>Iſmael,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Jo. Andreas Maurus,</hi> married an
<hi>Ethiopian</hi> Idolatreſs, by whom he had Twelve
Children; namely, <hi>Nabayath, Caydar,</hi> or
<hi>Kedar, Abdael, Nabſam, Maſna, Doama,
Maſſa, Hadab, Thema, Jackour, Naphis, Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
Theſe being diſperſed through <hi>Arabia,
Armenia, Perſia,</hi> took after their Mother, and
became great Patrons and Propagators of
Idolatry. Some of them Worſhipt the Sun,
others the Moon, others Fire, and others the
Angels. But one of the Brothers is ſaid to
have faln ſo greatly enamour'd of the Tree
<hi>Betulamar,</hi> that he made it his God; and
another is ſaid to have been no leſs tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with zeal and affection toward an old Idol,
called <hi>Bohinun.</hi> But thoſe of their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94943:9"/>
who kept their Paternal Habitations at
<hi>Mecca,</hi> remained conſtant Votaries to the
Idol <hi>Allech Alleze;</hi> of which in due place.
But to proceed. <hi>Iſmaels</hi> Children being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed,
as aforeſaid, his ſecond Son <hi>Caydar</hi>
returned, and ſetled at <hi>Mecca,</hi> (as moſt aſſure
us) where his Poſterity continued two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
eight hundred years; for ſo long the
<hi>Mahumedans</hi> derive their Prophets deſcent
from this <hi>Caydar.</hi> About which period, there
hapned to be born one <hi>Abdalla,</hi> who by a
general agreement of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Hiſtories,
is concluded to have been <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Father.
<hi>Abdalla</hi> ſignifies, (ſay the <hi>Moors) The ſervant
of God;</hi> among whom it is an uſual Name,
and often given to the Chriſtian Renegado's,
as the ſignification of the happineſs of their
Converſion, as they vainly imagine. This
<hi>Abdalla</hi> was ſorely perſecuted (ſaith <hi>Elma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi>)
by the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe he was a very
warm and ſturdy aſſertor of Idolatry. He
was the Son of <hi>Abdolmutleb;</hi> who, in a fit of
zeal, is ſaid to have vowed to ſacrifice him
to God, <hi>if he ſhould be the Father of ten
Children;</hi> or, <hi>ſucceed happily in digging the
Fountain</hi> Zemzem. But <hi>Abdolmutleb</hi> having
obtain'd his requeſt, was very loth to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
his <hi>Abdalla;</hi> whereupon, he reſolved to
commute, and redeem him with an Hundred
Camels. <hi>Abdalla</hi> being thus delivered from
the raſh vow of his Father, was at yeats of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94943:9"/>
Maturity married to one <hi>Hemina,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Vahebus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abdamonaſus.</hi>
But here it muſt be confeſſed, that there has
been no ſmall difference about <hi>Hemina's</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
ſome making her to be the Daughter
of <hi>Hayab,</hi> and <hi>Halima,</hi> who dwelt not far
from <hi>Mecca.</hi> But there are ſome, who make
<hi>Hemina</hi> to be the Daughter of one <hi>Guabbin,</hi>
a perverſe <hi>Jew;</hi> but <hi>Jo. Andreas Maurus,</hi> who
had been a <hi>Moreſco Alfaqui,</hi> or Prieſt, and
had no doubt fair opportunities to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the deſcent of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> though
he makes <hi>Hemina</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Guabbin,</hi>
yet he ſpeaks not a word of his Religion.
The <hi>European</hi> ſtory of <hi>Mahumed</hi> makes him
deſcended of a <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolater, and a Pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
<hi>Jew;</hi> though I am inclin'd to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinion, from the Antipathy between
the old <hi>Arabians</hi> and the <hi>Jews;</hi> which was
ſo irreconcileable, that it can ſcarce be fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
they ſhould take one another in Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.
And this antipathy aroſe, eſpecially
from the different nature of their Religious
Rites; the one being punctual obſervers of
Unity in the God-head, and the other given
up to Polytheiſm. Beſides, both the old
<hi>Arabian,</hi> and the <hi>Jew,</hi> were at that time equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cautious not to mingle and confuſe their
Tribes by inter-Marriages one with another,
and much more with thoſe of a different
Tongue and Religion; which tempts me to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94943:10"/>
believe, that the ſtory of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Mother
being a <hi>Jew,</hi> is fabulous, and without warrant.
Nor is their Tradition any more Authentique,
who make him of a very mean and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
Extraction: for the <hi>Arabick</hi> Authors,
<hi>Albunaſar</hi> and <hi>Elmacinus,</hi> make him not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobly
deſcended; and <hi>Erpenius</hi> calls it a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
error to opine otherwiſe. 'Tis true, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humeds</hi>
Family was ſunk very low, and had
a long time been under the great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of a narrow Fortune: but this had
not forfeited the Honor of their <hi>Deſcent,</hi> or
loſt them the reputation and credit of <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
among their Tribes. In whoſe propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and diſtinction, no Nation have
been ever more ſcrupulous and careful, than
the old <hi>Arabian.</hi> Having been ever vigilant,
leſt by Forreign Marriages their Tribes and
Genealogies ſhould receive diſturbance and
interruption. And therefore either out of
imitation, or emulation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they
preſerved the Law of Marrying within their
ſeveral and <hi>diſtinct Caſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hottinger</hi> tells us, out of <hi>Ibu Chalican,</hi> a
famous <hi>Arabian</hi> Author, that <hi>Eminal,</hi> the
<hi>Prophets Mother</hi> (upon whom (ſaith <hi>Chalican</hi>)
be <hi>Peace, and the Prayers of God</hi>) ſprang of
the <hi>Koraiſhites:</hi> where I cannot omit to tell
my Reader out of <hi>Hottinger,</hi> as he doth me
out of <hi>Ibu Chalican,</hi> that it was the Cuſtom
of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> to ſignalize their Tribes for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94943:10"/>
ſome Vice, Vertue, or Skill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the
Tribe of <hi>Thoal</hi> was known by the Name of
<hi>Good Marks-men;</hi> inſomuch, that one who
drew an Arrow well, was Proverbially ſaid
to be as good an Archer as <hi>Thoalus.</hi> The
Tribe of the <hi>Garae</hi>'s, by reaſon of their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Riches, were called the <hi>Wealthy.</hi> But
the <hi>Koraiſhites,</hi> from whom <hi>Mahumed</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
was known by the Title of <hi>Noble.</hi>
Now among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Koraiſhites,</hi>
and <hi>Nabatae</hi>'s made up the extremities; the
one being eſteemed the moſt Honourable, and
the other the moſt Vile among the Tribes:
whereupon, they uſed by way of Proverb,
to ſignifie the loweſt and higheſt rank of Men,
by ſaying, <hi>From the</hi> Nabatae's <hi>to the</hi> Korai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhites:
from the later, <hi>Mahumed</hi> undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
derives his Parentage; and from them too
he received his greateſt oppoſition, none
more ſtubbornly reſiſting his deſigns, as
ſcorning any of their Lineage ſhould ſet up
for an Impoſtor and Tyrant; for ſo they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
all who ſpoke againſt their Idol, and
under the pretence of Religion ſought for
Empire.</p>

               <p>Of Mahumeds Birth and Education,
&amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving taken this ſhort proſpect of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humeds</hi>
Pedegree, our next ſtep is to
his Conception and Birth; for the <hi>Arabians</hi>
are ſo punctual in his Legend, that they tell
us the time of his Conception, and that it
was upon a Friday, in the Month <hi>Dulhajiah,</hi>
when God (ſay they) tranſmitted <hi>all his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
light by</hi> Abdulla, <hi>into the Womb of</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina.
And albeit we meet with no diſcord
as to the Day and Month of <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
Conception, yet Writers are not ſo well
agreed as to the Year of his Birth, which
ſome place in the 571, others in the 570,
but the moſt in the 620 year of Chriſtianity.
And notwithſtanding this difference among
Chronologiſts about the date of the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
Nativity, yet the general opinion of
the <hi>Saracens</hi> makes him to be born upon a
Monday, and that his Nativity was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with many Miracles, whereof Seven were
more egregiouſly remarkable, and follow in
this order.</p>
            <p>1. His Mother <hi>Emina</hi> was free from all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94943:11"/>
thoſe pains when ſhe bore him, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to all other Women in Childbirth.</p>
            <p>2. She felt no anxiety, nor trouble of
Mind, nor apprehenſion of danger, as is uſual
to the reſt of her Sex in that condition.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Mahumed</hi> being pulled from his Mother,
fell upon his face, by that humble poſture to
teſtifie his Worſhip to God; and while he
was thus proſtrate, he cryed out, <hi>O Mother!</hi>
and then lifting up his head, he ſpoke theſe
words diſtinctly; <hi>I declare, That there is no
God, except the one true God, and that I am
his Legat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Mahumed</hi> was born Circumciſed, as
<hi>Adam,</hi> according to the <hi>Jews,</hi> was created.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>From the minute of</hi> Mahumeds <hi>Birth,
the Devil and his Angels were excluded
Heaven. Now the meaning of this Miracle,
depends upon this ſtory:</hi> The <hi>Moors</hi> believe
that the Devils were wont to aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and to hear the private diſcourſes of
the Holy Angels, and to ſteal away their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
but when their Apoſtle <hi>Mahumed</hi> was
Born, they were forbidden to aſcend any longer.
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this ſuddain excluſion, they repair to
<hi>Abliſus</hi> the <hi>old Devil,</hi> and made him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with what had hapned; and how they
were debarr'd all future entrance into Heaven:
upon which tydings, he order'd them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
the Earth, from Eaſt to Weſt, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what new thing had laſt faln out.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94943:12"/>
They obey'd his command, and journeyed up
and down, till they came to <hi>Mecca,</hi> where they
came to an Houſe that was environed with
Angels, out of which a fire aſcended up to
Heaven, and the Angels likewiſe in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
order. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this diſcovery, they return'd
to <hi>Abliſus,</hi> whom they told what they had
ſeen; who at the hearing of the ſtory, gave
a ſudden and fearful ſhriek, ſaying, A ſign is
gone out, whereby we are admoniſhed, that
God will have mercy upon the Sons of Men, and
therefore we are forbid to aſcend Heaven.</p>
            <p>6. His Nurſe <hi>Alima</hi> had been always dry
of one Breaſt; but ſhe no ſooner began to
give <hi>Mahumed</hi> ſuck, but it was as full of Milk
as the other.</p>
            <p>7. At his Birth, a voice was heard from the
four corners of <hi>Caaba;</hi> from the firſt was
heard, <hi>Preach, the truth is come, and no lye
will appear, or return.</hi> From the ſecond it
was ſaid, <hi>Now cometh an Apoſtle of your ſelves,
with whom is the mighty.</hi> From the third
was heard, <hi>Light, and a manifeſt Book is ſent
unto you from God.</hi> And from the fourth
corner iſſued theſe words, <hi>O Prophet, we have
ſent thee to be a Witneſs, Evangeliſt, and
Monitor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the ſeven Wonders, which are
confidently maintained to have hapned at
<hi>Mahumeds</hi> Birth; in whoſe larger relation ſo
many Blaſphemies are to be met with, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94943:12"/>
and extolling this wicked Miſcreant
above our moſt bleſſed Saviour, that I was
afraid to give them a Tranſcription. But it
need not create our wonder, that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humedan</hi>
Doctors ſhould be thus large in the
Encomiums of their Apoſtle, when as ſtrange
things are atteſted of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> by the
Friars of his Order; and alſo by the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi>
in praiſe of their Founder. But weary
of this palpable traſh, I leave it, to come to
the time of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Birth; which I find
generally fixed by the <hi>Moors,</hi> in the 620 year
of our Salvation. His Father dyed (ſay ſome)
within two years after he was born; and
others affirm, that he was a <hi>Poſthumus,</hi> and
that before he was two years old, he was left
an Orphan: but his Mother, tender of her
Sons welfare, and by the fatal tokens of her
Diſtemper, perceiving a few days would put
her in an utter incapacity of looking after his
Education, ſhe preſently ſent for his Nurſe
<hi>Lala Alima,</hi> to whoſe care ſhe moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
recommended young <hi>Mahumed,</hi> whom
at the ſame time ſhe bequeathed to <hi>Hanza,</hi>
her Husbands Brother, who bore the charge
of his <hi>breeding,</hi> till he was ſixteen years old.
And indeed, the Poverty of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
had left him ſo devoid of ſubſiſtance,
that if his Unkle had not taken him into his
Tuition, he had certainly (as we now ſpeak)
come to the Pariſh. But <hi>Hanza</hi> having
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94943:13"/>
brought him up to ſuch years of diſcernment,
as he was fit to ſhift for himſelf; and being
not able, or unwilling to be at farther charge
with his Nephew, he expoſed him to ſale
in the open Market; where one <hi>Abdael Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talib,</hi>
liking the complexion of the youth,
bought him of his Unkle. By his new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
ſay ſome, he was at firſt employed in
very inferiour Offices; till <hi>Abdael Mutalib</hi>
perceiving in him a more then ordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
and ſharpneſs of Wit, raiſed him to
employments more agreeable to his Temper.
And being a Merchant, ſent him to negotiate
his Affairs abroad, and by the firſt <hi>Caravan</hi>
or <hi>Cafila,</hi> diſpatcht him his Factor; in which
capacity he ſo well acquitted himſelf, that he
no leſs advanced his Maſters Trafique, then
his own Reputation. In this way of buſineſs
he continued till he was 25 years of age; at
which time his Maſter dyed, and <hi>Mahumed</hi>
managed his concerns ſo well, that ſome ſay
he ſucceeded him both in his Trade and Bed.
For through carefulneſs in his Miſtreſſes bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes,
ſay ſome; or through Sorceries, ſay
others, he ſo gain'd upon her affections, as
that at laſt ſhe took him for her Husband.
This Womans Name, ſay the common ſtories
of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> was <hi>Gadiſha,</hi> of the ſame
Tribe with himſelf, and one who was both
very beautiful and wealthy.</p>
            <p>And though what has now been ſpoken
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94943:13"/>
concerning <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Education and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
has paſſed very currant in the <hi>Europae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Accounts of him; yet I find it much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
related out of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Writers of
his Life: of which, take this ſhort report.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Father dyed two Months before
he was Born; and his Mother, when he was
ſix years of age: his Unkle <hi>Abdolmutleb</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him into his tuition upon his Mothers
death, who ſurvived her about two years;
and he dying, <hi>Mahumed</hi> fell into the care of
his Unkle <hi>Abutabeb,</hi> with whom he lived till
he was fit to be diſpoſed of in Marriage:
but both his own, and Unkles fortunes, were
at that time ſo low, that they wanted where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
(according to the ancient cuſtom) to
purchaſe him a Wife. Whereupon, <hi>Abuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb,</hi>
and his Wife <hi>Atechna,</hi> reſolved to ſend
him abroad with the Caravan that went for
<hi>Syria,</hi> and to entruſt him with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a ſmall Adventure; hoping by this
means to lay the beginning of his future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
And they were the more inclined thus
to put their Nephew into the World, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his inclination to Merchandiſe; as alſo
that they ſaw in him ſuch a compoſed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of himſelf, as promiſed him a fair
acceptance with whomſoever he ſhould
happen to converſe. But how <hi>Mahumed</hi>
performed his journey into <hi>Syria,</hi> and what
therein befel him, we ſhall ſum up in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94943:14"/>
next Chapter, and conclude this with two
Miracles that hapned to him when a Child.
When <hi>Mahumed</hi> was with his Nurſe <hi>Alima,</hi>
and about four years old, going with his
Nurſes Sons into the field to fetch home the
Cows (ſaith his famous Legendary <hi>Abunazar</hi>)
the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> came unto him in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Man cloathed with a ſnow-white
Garment; and taking him by the hand, led
him behind a little hill, where with a razor
he opened the Childs breaſt, and took out
his Heart, and let out of it a ſmall quantity
of black water; which, according to the
<hi>Moors,</hi> is the matter by which the Devil
tempts Men. From whoſe temptations <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed</hi>
was for ever delivered, after the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
had taken away this Core. This being
done, <hi>Gabriel</hi> put the Boys Heart into its
place, and the Wound immediately cloſed
and healed up. Another paſſage (which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunazar</hi>
calls a Miracle) was, that of the
Monk <hi>Bohira;</hi> who, as <hi>Mahumed</hi> came to
<hi>Bozra,</hi> went forth to meet him, and ſpoke
openly, <hi>how that ſome great thing</hi> (pointing
at Mahumed) <hi>would be done by that Boy: and
that his fame ſhould ſpread from Eaſt to Weſt.</hi>
And the Monk having ſaid thus, <hi>Mahumed</hi>
(ſaith his Legend) was covered with a Cloud,
to the aſtoniſhment of all that beheld him.
I ſhall not remark any thing upon theſe two
ſtories, but leave it to the judgment of every
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94943:14"/>
Reader. Only give me leave to take notice,
that whether ſuch things really hapned, or
not, it matters not much, while they are
confidently believed by the <hi>Mahumedans,</hi>
and entertained as no frail arguments to
prove the excellency of their Prophet.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of Cadigha's Dream; how Mahumed
became her ſervant. How he was
ſent into Syria by the Caravan; what
hapned to him in his Journey.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving heard how <hi>Mahumed</hi> was under
the Tutorage of his Unkle <hi>Abutaleb,</hi>
and his Aunt <hi>Atechna;</hi> and how they were
unable to prefer him, by reaſon of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs
of their fortunes; as likewiſe of
their intent to furniſh him with an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to go with the <hi>Cafila</hi> into <hi>Syria:</hi> my
Author tells me, that the better to equip him
for that journey, they reſolved to place him
with one <hi>Cadigha,</hi> a Woman of ſingular
probity, and one obſerved to be very ſuccesful
in her Trading into <hi>Syria,</hi> whither ſhe was
ſhortly to diſpatch a Caravan. To this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
<hi>Abutabeb</hi> and <hi>Atechna</hi> addreſſed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94943:15"/>
themſelves in the behalf of their Nephew;
expreſſing a great deſire to have him go as
her Servant into <hi>Syria. Cadigha</hi> accepted
their profer, having thereunto been diſpoſed
by a Viſion, or Dream, which was thus:
<hi>Cadigha</hi> being one night in her bed, in a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſaw the Sun deſcend from Heaven, and
entring into her Houſe; whoſe ſplendor ſo
diffuſed it ſelf, that not a Houſe in <hi>Mecca</hi>
but therewith was enlightned. <hi>Cadigha</hi>
awakening, began to ruminate upon the
Viſion, and being therewith not a little
ſtartled, communicated it to her Unkle
<hi>Varka,</hi> who being a great expounder of
Dreams, gave hers this Interpretation: <hi>viz.
That in the laſt days a Prophet ſhould come,
who was to be her Husband;</hi> concerning
whom, <hi>Cadigha</hi> asked her Unkle of what
City he ſhould be? who anſwered, <hi>Of</hi> Mecca.
Of what Tribe? <hi>Of the</hi> Caraiſhites. Of
what Family? <hi>Of the</hi> Haſchims. What is his
Name? <hi>Mahumed.</hi> Theſe things were much
noiſed abroad; and coming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Abutaleb,</hi> and <hi>Atechna,</hi> did much
heighten their expectation of their Couſin,
in whom all the aboveſaid circumſtances did
concenter. And ſome ſay, that this was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of their deſire to place him with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digha,</hi>
and of her receiving him into her
ſervice. But ſhe ſuppreſſed her deſign to
Marry him, till ſhe might ſee his management
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94943:15"/>
in the <hi>Syrian</hi> journey, whither ſhe reſolved
to ſend him. Yet as an earneſt of her reſpect
and affection, ſhe gave him double wages,
and ſome other teſtimony of her good liking;
which was granted to none of thoſe who
went the ſame journey with more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
truſt. For <hi>Mahumed</hi> is thought to
have had no higher employment in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan,
than to drive the Camels. <hi>Abutaleb,</hi>
not a little elevated with <hi>Cadigha</hi>'s grant to
entertain his Nephew, inſtantly had him to
her houſe, enjoyning him <hi>fidelity, diligence,</hi>
and <hi>obſequiouſneſs</hi> in his ſervice; as the
moſt probable means to advance him in his
Miſtris's favor. When <hi>Mahumed</hi> came to
<hi>Cadigha</hi>'s, he ſate down at the door, and
fell very penſive; the tears flowed from his
eyes; and being in a deep melancholy and
ſadneſs, the Angels therewith were ſo much
affected, that they alſo wept (ſaith the ſtory)
to ſee him ſo dejected. But the Caravan
having their diſpatches, the <hi>Amir-Alkipha,</hi>
or Captain thereof, commanded all that
were to go along with him to appear in their
journeying habits by ſuch a day. <hi>Mahumed,</hi>
according to his inferiour condition, put on
the Habit of a <hi>Camelero,</hi> but not without
great reſentments, wiſhing his Parents were
alive to ſee their Son thus dreſſed up in a
Slaves habit. In his journey to <hi>Syria,</hi> many
ſtrange paſſages are ſaid to have befaln him;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94943:16"/>
but one more remarkable then the reſt, is thus
related: The Caravan coming to the Cottage
of an old Hermit, where they uſed to refreſh,
all the men went into the Hermitage, leaving
<hi>Mahumed</hi> abroad with the Camels. The Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
asked if all the Company were there;
'twas anſwer'd, all except a poor Boy, whom
they had left with their beaſts: whereupon,
the Hermit ſtepping out, brought him in;
and inquiring concerning his Countrey, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,
and Name, and being fully informed
of each particular thereof, the Hermit open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told them, <hi>That he was the Apoſtle of God;</hi>
and then with a loud voice added theſe
words; <hi>There is no God, except God, and</hi>
Mahumed <hi>his Prophet.</hi> Then the Hermit
took the youth, and making bare his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſhewed them the privy Mark of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
imprinted upon him; and concluding
with high enlargements upon his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of the great things in proceſs of
time that ſhould make up his Atchievements.
<hi>Mahumed</hi> ſoon found the good effect of the
Hermits expreſſions, in the carriage of the
<hi>Amir-Alkipha,</hi> which was ſo changed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, that often he became his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
but once more eſpecially, when he
took him with him to a Synagogue of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> to ſee the cuſtom and faſhion of their
Service; where <hi>Mahumed</hi> was no ſooner
entred, but the chains in which their Lamps
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94943:16"/>
and Candleſticks were hung up, upon the
ſudden broke, and fell to the ground. The
<hi>Jews</hi> being greatly affrighted with this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
conſulted their Rabbins what it might
bode: who returned this anſwer; <hi>We have
found</hi> (ſay they) <hi>in the Law, that in the laſt
times, a certain Man ſhall come, called</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed;
<hi>and that when ever he ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at our Feaſts, this thing ſhall happen:
and for ought we know, he may now be here,
and therefore let ſearch be made, to find and
deſtroy him.</hi> This we have recorded by that
moſt egregious Trifler <hi>Abunazar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Mahumed</hi> being acquainted with the
<hi>Jews</hi> deſign againſt him, as he was bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf of an eſcape, two Angels (ſaith the
ſtory) ſuddenly took him upon their wings,
tranſported him to <hi>Mecca,</hi> where having ſpent
ſome few days in the converſation of his
friends, the Legend tells us, he went to his
Patroneſs <hi>Cadigha,</hi> to whom having given
an account of his journey, he demanded his
Wages; telling her withal, that his Unkle
and Aunt had much upbraided him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency
of Mind, <hi>That he had made his
addreſs of Love no ſooner.</hi> Here, forſooth,
he bowed his head, bluſht, and made a ſtop.
But <hi>Cadigha</hi> underſtood his meaning; and
told him, <hi>That as for his wages, it amounted
to ſo little, that it would not do him much
ſervice; but</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>I will look out a Wife
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94943:17"/>
for thee, one who is the moſt Noble, Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and Rich among the</hi> Meckezes, <hi>and
whom the</hi> Arabian <hi>Princes have courted to
Marry. The only blot in her character, is, the
miſerable Death of her firſt Husband; and if
this could be paſt over by him, ſhe was at his
ſervice.</hi> With this large declaration of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digha</hi>'s
reſpect, <hi>Mahumed</hi> was diſmiſt; who
coming to his friends, communicated with
them the whole matter. They tranſported
with the profer, thought of nothing but its
accompliſhment. And to that end, ſent
<hi>Mahumed</hi> back to <hi>Cadigha,</hi> to let her know,
that he was wholly at her diſpoſal and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Marriage was ſoon compleated
betwixt them; which brought <hi>Mahumed</hi> a
<hi>fair Wife,</hi> a <hi>great Eſtate,</hi> and <hi>no little eſteem.</hi>
And now we have the Impoſtor in Wedlock,
being aged twenty four years, five months,
and eight days. His Marriage was celebrated
on the ſame day of the week on which he
was born. By <hi>Cadigha, Cadijah,</hi> or <hi>Gadiſa,</hi> (for
all ſignifie the ſame Woman) he had ſeven
Children; three Sons, namely, <hi>Kalem,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,</hi>
(an uſual Name among the preſent <hi>Moors)
Taher,</hi> and <hi>Mader;</hi> who all dyed when young.
He had alſo four Daughters, to wit, <hi>Phatema,
Zeyneb, Rakia, Omcolthum, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicultum. Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tema</hi>
was married to <hi>Ali, Zeyneb</hi> to <hi>Abalre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah,</hi>
two Brothers; and <hi>Omcolthum</hi> to <hi>Ibu
Affar Ottamaindi,</hi> who upon the death of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94943:17"/>
               <hi>Omcolthum,</hi> married her Siſter <hi>Rakia.</hi> The
three firſt were all married upon the ſame
Friday. But among all his Daughters, <hi>Phate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
was his <hi>darling;</hi> and for her virtues, is ſo
highly eſteemed by the <hi>Mahumedans,</hi> that
they number her among the principal women,
and compare her with the Bleſſed Virgin.
Among Men, many have been famous (ſay
the <hi>Mahumediſts</hi>) but among Women, theſe
four are reckon'd for the chief; namely, <hi>Aſiah</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Pharaoh; Mary,</hi> the Daughter
of <hi>Imram; Cadigha,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailedi;</hi>
and <hi>Phatema,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed,</hi>
whom we find giving her this Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium:
<hi>Praiſes be to God, who hath made
thee like the Lady of the Women of the Sons
of</hi> Iſrael, that is, the Bleſſed Virgin. This
commendation was delivered of her, upon the
occaſion of a ſuppoſed Miracle: of which
an account will be given in the Chapter of
Miracles. <hi>Mahumed</hi> lived with <hi>Cadigha</hi>
twenty two years in Matrimony, and dying
at <hi>Mecca,</hi> ſhe left her Husband great ſtore of
Wealth: for ſhe was exceeding rich, as is
plainly to be collected from the Prayer made
by <hi>Abutaleb,</hi> when he married <hi>Cadigha</hi> to his
Nephew; which for its rarity I have here
inſerted.</p>
            <p>Praiſed be God, who has choſen us out of
the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and made us of the
linage of <hi>Imael,</hi> and hath given us the <hi>Holy
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94943:18"/>
Country,</hi> and the Houſe to which Pilgrims
reſort from every quarter, and hath made
us Judges among men. Furthermore, who
has choſen my Coſin <hi>Mahumed,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Abdollahi,</hi> whom none of the Noble <hi>Korai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhites</hi>
can equal, nor be laid in the ſcales with
him, for goodneſs, worth, underſtanding, glory,
ſharpneſs of wit. And although he be poor,
(for certainly Riches are a ſhadow that paſſeth
away, and a loan that muſt be reſtored) yet
is he in love with <hi>Cadijah</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Chowailidi,</hi> and ſhe with him; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
portion is deſired, I take it upon my ſelf.
<hi>This I find called a Prayer; but I leave the
Ingenious Reader to give it a Name.</hi>

of life; Revelations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to juſtify his looſeneſs.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>MAhumed,</hi> whom his Sectaries are not
aſhamed to declare to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiably
given to Venery, marryed ſeveral
other Wives beſides <hi>Cadigha;</hi> as <hi>Aijſcha</hi> or
<hi>Axa</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Abubecer,</hi> and <hi>Sewda,</hi>
the Daughter of <hi>Zameas,</hi> and <hi>Hafeza</hi> the
Daughter of <hi>Homar.</hi> Theſe are upon record;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94943:18"/>
and it is certain he had ſeveral others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
very many Concubines. And though
he confined his Proſelytes to four Wives, yet
he laid not any ſuch reſtraint upon himſelf;
having received a licenſe from <hi>Gabriel</hi> to
marry as many as he pleaſed, and a power
to Divorce them when he liſted. But it
gave no ſmall ſcandal to the <hi>Moors,</hi> when
he gave it out, that to have as many Wives
as he pleaſed, was an indulgence granted
him in particular, in token of the affection
God bore him above other Men; which
blaſphemous aſſertion, was out of fear tamely
yielded to by his timerous Adherents. So
that when ever <hi>Mahumed</hi> had a mind to a
new bed-fellow, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> brought
him a Revelation for ſo doing. But all this
would not appeaſe the anger his Wives had
conceived againſt the naughtineſs of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
eſpecially in point of his unequal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with them, contrary to Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Contract: which <hi>bone of contention</hi>
was quickly hurled out of doors, by a voice
ſent from Heaven to ratifie what he did;
in which alſo his Wives were enjoyned to
ſurceaſe all murmuring againſt his actions,
and to make a total reſignation of themſelves
to his pleaſure. And what was yet more
ſevere, he pretended a command from God
to prohibit his Wives to marry after it was
his mind to divorce them, and that upon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94943:19"/>
pain of Hell, they ſhould never know any
man but himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now though I am weary of this deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtuff, yet farther to illuſtrate <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
unclean Genius, and the bold miſcreancy of
his ſpirit, we find that he denied himſelf in
no inſtance of lewdneſs, but that he intitled
God to a ſpecial approbation thereof, and
made it a divine teſtimony of the truth of
his Apoſtleſhip. An example of what I now
mention, is to be met with in the ſtory of
<hi>Marina,</hi> a Jewiſh Damſel of about fifteen
years of age, with whom <hi>Mahumed</hi> fell ſo
deeply in love, that he deſiſted not till he
had wearied her into his embraces, by the
moſt ſubtle importunities. But being ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the villany, by the waking jealouſie
of his Wives, <hi>Axa</hi> and <hi>Hafeza,</hi> he received
from them a ſevere reprimend; they telling
him how ill it became a <hi>Married man,</hi> and
a <hi>Prophet,</hi> to be guilty of advoutry. And it
ſeems that <hi>Mahumed</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed with
this reproof, and the conſciouſneſs of his
own irregularity, that he gave his Wives all
poſſible aſſurances of future amendment;
promiſing that if they would not divulge it,
they ſhould find greater pledges of his love
than they had hitherto been acquainted with.
They granted his requeſt, upon condition,
that if ever they found him guilty of the
like fault, they would not only diſcover it,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94943:19"/>
but repudiate his ſociety. But his affections
were ſtill ſo warm toward <hi>Marina,</hi> and the
jealouſie of his Wives ſo diligent, that in a
ſhort time they took him in her company.
Whereupon, they ſtraightway repaired to
their Fathers, with all thoſe tokens about
them of women who had repudiated their
Husbands. This inſtantly took air, and the
matter of <hi>Marina</hi> became Town-diſcourſe;
and a thouſand evil things were now ſpoken
againſt <hi>Mahumed,</hi> whoſe mind was ſeized
hereupon with a ſtrange deſpondency. And
it is thought, that this had utterly forfeited
him the reputation of a Prophet, had not
<hi>Gabriel</hi> (as he pretended) brought him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Verſes from God, to juſtifie what he
had done, and alſo to permit the <hi>Moors</hi> a
liberty to embrace their ſhe-ſlaves with as
much freedome as their Wives (a cuſtom not
yet antiquated among the <hi>Mahumedans;</hi>)
and to obſtruct the future repining of his
Wives, they were by a pretended Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
enjoyned to be quiet and content. This
was a very welcome Inſtitution to the <hi>Moors,</hi>
and very prevailing with them to accept him
for their Prophet, who had ſuch a care to
gratifie their luſts. And as to <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
carriage with <hi>Marina,</hi> it was from Heaven
declared to be no Sin; as likewiſe that his
Wives were very criminal in taking notice of
it, and divulging what he did in ſecret; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94943:20"/>
to reſtrain <hi>Axa</hi>'s and <hi>Hafeza</hi>'s vigilance and
jealouſie for the future, in finding out the
carnality of their Husband, they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
forbid all ſuch deportment toward him,
and commanded preſently to return home,
penitent for what they had done, and to be
content with ſuch a ſhare of his converſation
and benevolence, as he ſhould daigne to
grant them.</p>
            <p>By this ſubtle device, or rather diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
hypocriſie, he re-gained his Wives; and
not only appeaſed the <hi>Moors,</hi> but cloſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated
himſelf into their favour. To whom
nothing was more acceptable, than <hi>to have
the Indulgence of their vile affections to be
made an Article of their Religion, and a
piece of their Worſhip.</hi> And that this may
not be imagined to be a meer calumny, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
by the enemies of <hi>Mahumediſm,</hi> we
find it recorded in the 66 Chapter of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,
where the Wives of</hi> Noah <hi>and</hi> Lot <hi>are
produced as fearful examples of ſuffering pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for not obeying their Husbands; and

            <argument>
               <p>Of Mahumeds retirement, and how he
began his Sect.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN mentioning <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Wives, and his
deportment in Wedlock, we have been
forced to run higher up into his Legend, than
the deſigned Method will permit. Which
cannot now be atoned for, but by confeſſing
the fault, and following the reſt of what
hapned to him during the time he lived in
Matrimony with <hi>Cadigha,</hi> which was from
the 25 till the 38 year of his age. Moſt of
which time he ſpent in a conſtant Trading
from <hi>Mecca</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Perſia;</hi> which he
never deſerted till he was 38 years old: at
which time he enter'd upon an Hermetical and
contemplative life, daily frequenting a place
near <hi>Mecca,</hi> called <hi>Garhera,</hi> or the Cave of
<hi>Hera.</hi> There he continued all day; but
what he did in the interim, is not certainly
known. The <hi>Moors</hi> conjecture he ſpent
the time in Divine Contemplation, and made
it an occaſion to wean himſelf from his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94943:21"/>
having been brought up in the <hi>rites</hi>
of the Idol <hi>Alleze,</hi> which he now began to
abandon; moved thereunto, as is generally
concluded, by ſome occaſional diſcourſe he
had with a <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Chriſtian, called by
ſome <hi>Bohira,</hi> whom he met with at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
This man practiſing <hi>Mahumed</hi> in ſome
points of Religion, found that he was of
the Tribe of the <hi>Koraiſhites,</hi> notorious Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
at <hi>Mecca,</hi> and deeply rooted in their
Idolatrous Ceremonies. And moved with
compaſſion toward him, he began to acquaint
him with the pernicious falſeneſs of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon,
and palpable vanity of Idolatry: and
at the ſame time inſtructed him in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true God; whereupon, he read
unto him ſeveral parcels of the Law and
Pſalms, in confirmation of what he had ſaid;
which wrought ſo much upon <hi>Mahumed,</hi>
that he was no ſooner return'd to <hi>Mecca,</hi>
but he began to declare his abhorrence of
their Religion, ſhewing them (as <hi>Bohira</hi> had
ſhewn him) the manifeſt iniquity of Idol-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
letting them know, that his reſolution
was, never more to ſort with them in their
impious Rites. Hereupon, he began to lead
a ſolitary life, and to betake himſelf to the
Cave; which he continued for the ſpace of
two years; during which time, it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conjectured he laid the villanous deſign
of his <hi>Apoſtleſhip.</hi> But at laſt his ſtrength
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94943:21"/>
and health became greatly impaired by this
abſtinent and auſtere courſe of living. And
his judgment ſympathized with his body;
for through immoderate faſting, he became
ſo hypocondriack, that he began to talk idly,
which terminated in a perfect Lunacy, going
up and down after an odd diſtracted manner.
In memory of whoſe Lunatique carriage, the
<hi>Mahumedans</hi> at this day bear a ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to Idiots and Madmen, accounting
them no leſs than inſpired. But to return to
<hi>Mahumed</hi> in the Cave: and as we find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
aſſerted by his Doctors, he was there
entertained with <hi>Divine revelations,</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
That there was a voice at his elbow
frequently diſcourſing with him, although he
could never perceive any bodily ſhape.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night returning from his <hi>Garhera,</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to <hi>Cadigha</hi> what had hapned the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
day. Who finding him ſtill full of
<hi>Revelations</hi> and <hi>Viſions,</hi> ſhe told him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>That they were nothing but deluſions of the
Devil.</hi> This greatly ruffled his paſſions, and
created in him that diſturbance of mind,
which at laſt caſt him into ſuch a fit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedneſs,
that he thought of nothing but
deſtroying himſelf. To which purpoſe, he
went to the precipice of a rock, deſigning
thence to caſt himſelf headlong; ſaying, <hi>It
was better to dye, then to live under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
of being Mad.</hi> But <hi>Gabriel,</hi> as he was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94943:22"/>
ready to put his reſolution into practice, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
him with this Greeting; <hi>O</hi> Mahumed,
<hi>be of good courage, be not troubled at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of thy Wife; thou art not now to look
upon thy ſelf as thou haſt done, but as on a
perſon highly in favor with God; who has now
appointed thee to be his Prophet and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
And as he ſaid thus, <hi>Gabriel</hi> gave him
a ſcrowl, and bid him read. <hi>Mahumed</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>he was altogether illiterate. Gabriel</hi> ſaid
again, <hi>Read, O</hi> Mahumed, <hi>In the Name of thy
Creator, who made the worm Man; read in
the Name of thy moſt honoured Creator, who
with a Pen ſhews to Man what he never knew
before.</hi> And then he delivered him the firſt
Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and ſo vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>In this apparition, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was
ſeen (ſay they) ſitting on a Golden Throne,
which hung between Earth and Heaven.
They tell us likewiſe, that <hi>Mahumed</hi> now
received a general delineation of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie
and Apoſtleſhip. And this firſt ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Mahumed</hi> beginning with [<hi>In the
Name of thy Creator</hi>] was the ground and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
why the <hi>Moors</hi> at this day begin all
their Letters of Correſpondence, and other
Writings, with <hi>Biſmillah;</hi> that is, <hi>In the Name
of God.</hi> And the praiſe <hi>Gabriel</hi> in this greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gave unto the Pen, cauſed <hi>Ozman</hi> to
give one of the Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> the
Title of the <hi>Pen;</hi> though 'tis true, the word
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94943:22"/>
we render Pen, ſignifies, ſaith <hi>Du Ryer, Ink,</hi>
an <hi>Ink-horn,</hi> and ſometimes the Table on
which the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was writ. And whatever
the <hi>Arabick</hi> word may import, which the
Tranſlations of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> render Pen; we
are aſſured, that the <hi>Mahumedans</hi> have a
Tradition, that a Pen was the firſt thing God
Created. But to return: <hi>Mahumed</hi> having,
as we are told, received this apparition of
the Angel, to that end <hi>Cadigha</hi> might no
longer doubt of the truth of his Viſions, or
perſiſt to cenſure them for diabolical illuſions;
as he returned from the Cave, he had them
confirm'd with a Miracle; the trees ſaluting
him as he paſſed by them, with an <hi>Abſir ya
Mahumed ineq.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rejoyce, O</hi> Mahumed,
<hi>for theou ſhalt be the Apoſtle of God, and moſt
dear unto him.</hi> The Impoſtor being not a
little raiſed with this greeting, he haſtned to
tell it to his Wife, and to unmask that his
deſign was to ſet up for a Prophet, and to
frame a Sect. In whoſe contrivance he ſpent
23 years, beginning at the 40th year of his
age, and continuing till he was aged 63.
During which time, he ſo well managed his
ambition and injuſtice, under the cloak of
Religion, as never any have yet proved his
Equal: the neareſt and moſt exact Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
of this great Impoſtor, was the late

            <argument>
               <p>How Mahumed received from Gabriel
the firſt Chapters of the Alcoran.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOtwithſtanding the great aſſurance
wherewith <hi>Mahumed</hi> aſſerted the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of his Viſions, <hi>Cadigha</hi> ſtill remained
incredulous, and eſteemed them no better
than the Enthuſiaſms of an over-heated fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
or the inſpirations of a bad ſpirit. Which
incredulity of his Wife, created him no
ſmall diſturbance; and finding her ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in her Opinion, ſome ſay, he was ſo far
moved therewith, as now to doubt himſelf,
and to grow ſuſpicious of what had hapned.
Being in theſe dumps, and deeply muſing how
to proceed, his whole body was ſeized with
an uncouth chilneſs, which caſt him upon
his bed, where his ſervants loaded him with
cloaths to recover warmth. But as he was
ruminating upon the froward carriage of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digha,</hi>
and what had befaln in the Cave;
and drooping under the reſentments of his
project, <hi>Gabriel,</hi> ſay his Paraſites, brought
him a Cordial, which was the ſecond Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> (now bearing the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
of the Cow) containing 187 verſes;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94943:23"/>
which <hi>Gabriel</hi> preſented him in theſe words:
<hi>Ariſe,</hi> Mahumed, <hi>thou that art covered with
Praiſe</hi> (alluding to his being covered with
cloaths) <hi>and abandon Idols.</hi> And having
thus ſpoken, he gave him the Chapter.
Hereupon, <hi>Mahumed</hi> inſtantly called for his
Wife, to whom he read it. Who ſcornfully
told him, it was but the old deluſion. She
told him likewiſe, that if <hi>Gabriel</hi> were his
friend, he would not have been abſent ſo
long, ſeeing his preſence would ſo quickly
have reſolved his doubts, and redeemed
him from his anxieties. But <hi>Mahumed</hi> now
finding his Wife to have ſo far reduced her
refractorineſs, as to caſt it into an Objection;
he ſoon foreſaw that the Angels coming more
early the next day, would certainly remove
it. Which hapned accordingly; for the
next morning betimes, <hi>Gabriel</hi> preſented
the Prophet with the Third Chapter of the
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> (entituled <hi>The Linage of</hi> Joachim)
and when he delivered it, he ſaid; <hi>God
ſwears to</hi> Mahumed, <hi>by the dawning which
brings the day, and by the night which brings
darkneſs, that his Creator hath not forgotten
him, neither will forget what he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi>
Theſe words of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> though
they quickly reſtored <hi>Mahumed,</hi> yet they
could not convince his Wife, whoſe infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
grew now ſo obſtinate, that nothing
could refute it, but a perſonal interview with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94943:24"/>
the Angel; from which <hi>Mahumed</hi> ſtrongly
diſſwaded her, urging the impoſſibility of
ſeeing Angels, as being Spirits. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
his arguings had at laſt his deſired effect
upon <hi>Cadigha;</hi> for we hear no more of her,
till we find her in the number of his firſt
Proſelytes. In which the Impoſtor at the
beginning was not very fruitful; and thoſe few
who became his Sectaries, were moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
through meer temporal advantages; ſo
that he may be ſaid to have bought, rather
than converted them. This was evident in
the youth <hi>Zeydin;</hi> who being a Slave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his Proſelyte, to gain his freedom; and
who, 'tis like, would never have hearkened
to the Doctrines of his Maſter, if upon his
believing him to be a Prophet, he had not
had the promiſe of a releaſe. Now <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
finding how powerful this wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Zeydin,</hi> he began to preach preſent free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to all thoſe Captives who would take
him for their Apoſtle. By which means he
now enlarged his train, and increaſed his
credit: for all the Bond-men were ſo taken
with this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Freedom,</hi> that if <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed</hi>
had had power to protect them, they
all would quickly have emptied themſelves
into his muſters. But becauſe there (perhaps)
may be a more convenient place to give an
account of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> firſt Converts, we
will return to his compiling of the <hi>Alcoran;</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94943:24"/>
which, as he pretended, was given him from
God, by the Miniſtery of <hi>Gabriel;</hi> who did
not, as ſome have delivered, bring him it
all at once, but one Chapter after another,
and at ſeveral times. And when <hi>Mahumed</hi>
had any project to carry on, or any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be removed, or any villainous act to be
cloaked, he preſently pretended to receive
from Heaven Revelations to that purpoſe.
Now, becauſe the ſum and ſubſtance of all
his Impoſtures are compriſed in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
we will give a ſhort account thereof in the

            <p>THe <hi>Alcoran</hi> (ſaith <hi>Andraeas Maurus</hi>)
ſignifies a Leſſon, or Collection of
Chapters or Songs; and thoſe who reſpect

and the divers Papers, or Scrowls, wherein
it was written, have given it the Name of
<hi>Alforzan;</hi> that is, A <hi>collection</hi> of <hi>ſcattered
verſes.</hi> The Materials of this Book are very
various; but it treateth eſpecially of ſuch
things as reſpect that Sect, whereof <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94943:25"/>
was Founder. It cannot be denied but
that many excellent Truths are therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
as we ſhall ſee hereafter, when we
lay down the principles of the <hi>Mahumedan</hi>
Impoſture.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Alcoran</hi> was begun at <hi>Mecca,</hi> in the
year of our Lord 630. which was about the
fortieth year of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> age. The firſt
Chapter thereof was that which the Angel
<hi>Gabriel</hi> gave him in the Cave, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Chapter of the <hi>Pen;</hi> and the laſt
Chapter was compoſed at <hi>Medina,</hi> and is
called the Chapter of Fate, or the Conqueſt.
During the time he abode at <hi>Mecca,</hi> the
Chapters writ there were called <hi>Aſoar Mikia,</hi>
or the Songs of <hi>Mecca;</hi> and the reſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
at <hi>Medina,</hi> bare the title of <hi>Sore Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maedina;</hi>
and both theſe being collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one Volume, are now generally known by
the Name of <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahumed,</hi> as was ſaid, being wholly Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
kept a Secretary, who wrote in
Scrowls ſuch Verſes as he pretended were
privately ſent him from God by the Angel
<hi>Gabriel.</hi> And when he had copied them,
they were diſperſed among the <hi>Moors;</hi> who
when they had learned them by heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
them back again to the Secretary,
who put them into the <hi>Menſegina,</hi> or box
of Embaſſie. But <hi>Mahumed</hi> taking a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
againſt his firſt <hi>Scribe,</hi> choſe a new one
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94943:25"/>
called <hi>Abdalla Celen,</hi> a Renegado <hi>Jew.</hi> This
man continued with him ten years. And
being well verſed in the Law of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
(to which he ſtill bore a great reſpect, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
Temporal intereſt had moved
him to renounce it) and finding that <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
did not make good his pretences of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the laſt Accompliſher of the Moſaical
oeconomy, he was ſo curious to obſerve
<hi>Mahumeds</hi> carriage, that at laſt he perceiv'd,
and took notice, that all <hi>Mahumed</hi> dictated
to him were meer Forgeries, and not ſent
from God. Yet leſt <hi>Abdalla</hi> might impoſe
upon himſelf in this particular, he reſolved
upon this trial; namely, that whenſoever he
was commanded to write ſuch and ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
he would turn the end of the verſe to
another meaning, changing the words and
order, but not the Rime nor Conſonance.
So that when he was commanded to end the
Verſe with
<q>—<hi>Alla hazizum haquimum,</hi> 
               </q>that is, God
is gracious and wiſe; he wrote,
<q>—<hi>Alla Cemilum halimum,</hi>
               </q> that is, God
is a <hi>Hearer</hi> and a <hi>Judge.</hi> And when he bid
him write, <hi>God is Almighty and moſt high,</hi>
he ſet down, <hi>God is merciful and gracious.</hi>
And thus <hi>Abdalla</hi> for ſeven years continued
changing the end of the Verſes. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Mahumed</hi> did not perceive the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94943:26"/>
change, he concluded, that if he had receiv'd
them from God, and that if God had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to be the <hi>immutable Rule of life,</hi>
the palpable changes made by him would
have been detected. Whereupon, <hi>Abdalla</hi>
quitted his Office, and reconciled himſelf to
his old Religion. And the fore-mentioned
Author (<hi>Jo. Andraeas Maurus</hi>) tells us, out
of a Book called <hi>Azzifa,</hi> that <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
next Secretary renounced his employment
upon the ſame reaſon. And, as the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
obſerves, <hi>If</hi> Mahumed <hi>had been ſo
great a Prophet as he pretended, and ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſpired of God; he could not but have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
how groſly he was abuſed by the</hi> Jew.
But to proceed.</p>
            <p>In the compoſition of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> many
contrarieties and repugnancies being obſerv'd
by the <hi>Moors,</hi> thereat they took no ſmall
offence. It being uſual with this Impoſtor,
one day to ſet down Verſes commanding
ſome, and forbidding other things; and
another day he would dictate, and cauſe
other Verſes to be written, forbidding what
he had before allowed and permitted them,
making that lawful which he had before for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
And of theſe contrarieties, no leſs
than 150 verſes were obſerved by them. But
to remove this ſcandal, he made a Law to
revoke ſuch verſes as occaſioned it, which he
called <hi>Hacen</hi> and <hi>Mauſoh.</hi> But that which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94943:26"/>
created <hi>Mahumed</hi> the greateſt trouble, was,
the <hi>Moors</hi> forgetfulneſs of thoſe Verſes he
gave them to commit to Memory. For, for no
leſs time than two years, did this courſe of
learning the Verſes by Heart continue among
them; who when they had forgotten the
Verſes, and deſired <hi>Mahumed</hi> to repeat them
again, he could not remember them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
But <hi>Mahumed</hi> excuſed this forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
confidently affirming, that it was from
God. And being told, <hi>That if God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them for his</hi> abiding word, <hi>he would not
ſuffer him to forget them; or if he did, yet
he would inſpire them afreſh:</hi> to reprove
their petulancy (as he ſtyled it) God (as he
ſaid) gave him a Verſe, wherein it was ſaid,
<hi>That God doth not ſuffer any of the former
Verſes to be revoked or forgotten, ſave when
he intends to give another like it, or one bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in its ſtead.</hi> By which cunning he cloaked
his own failures, and kept up his credit with
the <hi>Moors.</hi> And alſo altered and aboliſhed
ſuch Texts (as he had before delivered) to
comply with his affairs, and carry on his
deſigns; giving authority to New Verſes to
revoke the Old, when they would not ſerve
his purpoſe. And what was yet very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable,
<hi>Mahumed</hi> would not ſuffer his Verſes
to be made an <hi>Alcoran,</hi> or be collected into
a Body, and reduced to Books and Chapters,
as now it is; but kept them in ſcrowls and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94943:27"/>
Papers in the <hi>Meſengina,</hi> or <hi>Box of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie:</hi>
ſo that if he had lived to this day, he
would ſtill have altered his Law; and what
we now call the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> would not have
been finiſhed, or reduced to any certain form.
For while he kept it ſecret in the <hi>Shrine,</hi> he
reſerved unto himſelf a power to add, change,
or retrench things as he pleaſed, and as was
moſt agreeable to his concerns.</p>
            <p>As to that Book which now bears the

            <p>The fourth Book contains 175 Chapters,
to each of which he gave a particular Name:
ſo that according to <hi>Hozmans</hi> diviſion of the
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> it contains 211 Chapters. But
little above half this number are found in
<hi>Du Ryers</hi> French Tranſlation. And <hi>J. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draeas
Maurus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Ozmans</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
doth not contain all thoſe Chapters,
which were written by <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and in his life-time uſed by the <hi>Moors.</hi>
And the inſtance of this defalcation, is plac'd
in the Chapter of Additions; which in
<hi>Mahumeds</hi> time, was as big as the Chapter
of the Cow, but is not now half ſo big. The
like I have noted of the Chapter of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
And beſides theſe retrenchments, it is very
probable, that whole ſcrowls of <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
Doctrine were utterly loſt, or become ſo
imperfect, that they were never entered
into <hi>Hozmans</hi> Collection. And this may more
than conjecturally be concluded, from the
condition wherein <hi>Ozman</hi> met with <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meds</hi>
Notes; many whereof were found in
the Houſe of <hi>Axa,</hi> or <hi>Aijſcha,</hi> one of his
Wives; but ſo eaten with mice, and rent,
and worn with ill uſage, that <hi>Ozman</hi> could
gather nothing out of them. Hereupon, he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94943:28"/>
had recourſe to the moſt aged of the <hi>Moors,</hi>
collecting from them what they remembred
of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Verſes. Some told him, <hi>that
they had forgotten many of them:</hi> others
told him, <hi>That in ſuch a Wall he ſhould find
ſuch Verſes in writing.</hi> And ſo amongſt the
old Walls, and the <hi>Moors</hi> weak Memories,
he retrieved much of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Doctrine.
Yet he could never regain the Verſe which
commanded, <hi>That all married perſons taken
in Adultery, ſhould be ſtoned.</hi> From all which,
it may ſafely be inferred, that all thoſe things
taught by <hi>Mahumed</hi> in his life-time, are not
now to be found in <hi>Ozmans Alcoran.</hi>

               <p>Of the Honor given to the Alcoran.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving given this ſhort account how the
Doctrines of <hi>Mahumed</hi> were collected,
and reduced to that form in which they are
now extant, I ſhall fill up this Chapter with
ſetting down the great Titles and reſpect
given the <hi>Alcoran</hi> after <hi>Ozman</hi> had compil'd
it. <hi>And firſt, it is uſual with the</hi> Muſulmin,
<hi>or Proſelytes of</hi> Mahumed, <hi>when they take
the</hi> Alcoran <hi>in their hands, with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
reverence to kiſs it, and ſalute it by the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94943:29"/>
Name of</hi> Alkilib Alhazim (i. e.) <hi>The Glorious
Book; and</hi> Alcoran Alhadin (i. e.) <hi>the Mighty</hi>
Alcoran. <hi>They ſwear by it, and pay it all
the reverence they would do unto God. And
no ſmall diſputes have been raiſed among the
old</hi> Mahumediſts, <hi>about the nature of the</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,
<hi>whether it was the created or increated
word of God. Vathecus</hi> was for the opinion
of thoſe who held the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be <hi>created;</hi>
and he writ to all the Provinces of <hi>Eyypt,
That the</hi> Muſulmin <hi>ſhould be of the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Which Injunction was very diſpleaſing
to the <hi>Mahumedans;</hi> but they were by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
forced to embrace it. <hi>Though not a
few ſuffered Martyrdom for the contrary
opinion; chooſing rather to dye, than to hold the</hi>
Alcoran <hi>was not the</hi> Increate word of God.
Theſe diſputes continued long, and opinions
prevailed according to the humour of the
preſent Caliph that Reigned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The excellent</hi> Erpenius <hi>tells us, in his
Notes upon the Chapter of</hi> Joſeph: It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
what Vertue, Majeſty, and Authority
is granted to the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> yea, what Honour
and Veneration is given it by the <hi>Muſulmin;</hi>
whole Books (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) are extant in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
written in ſo ſwoln and fabulous
a ſtyle, that no diſcerning Reader can peruſe
them without laughter. Firſt, they commend
it above all the Creatures, and place it next to
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he that handles it irreverently, is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94943:29"/>
unworthy of life, and is as wicked as he that
contemns God. They permit not any who is
not of their own Religion, ſo much as to touch
it. If any <hi>Muſulman</hi> chance to ſit upon it,
the ſin is piacular: but if this irreverence be
uſed by a Jew, or Chriſtian, it is puniſhed with
death. No <hi>Mahumedan</hi> is permitted to touch
it with the top of his finger, until he firſt
waſh: <hi>and leſt any ſhould unwarily offend
therein, they write upon the cover of the
Alcoran in great letters, this Sentence;</hi> Let no
Man touch it who is unclean. <hi>They call it,</hi> the
Medicine of the Heart; and hold it to be of
ſuch ſecret Vertue and worth, that the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one letter therein, deſerves a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>I have often doubted whether there be
any true Edition of the Alcoran in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi>
Language, ſince I obſerved how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
it is for any Chriſtian to obtain from
the <hi>Mahumedans</hi> a copy thereof. For they
permit not any of a Religion different from
their own, ſo much as to touch it; nor of old
was it ſuffer'd to be written in any but the
<hi>Arabique</hi> Language. And at this day it is
capital for a <hi>Moor</hi> to ſell an Alcoran to either
Jew or Chriſtian. Nor indeed are any <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corans</hi>
to be met with in private hands, or
expoſed to ſale to the vulgar. In above ſeven
years of converſation among the <hi>Moors,</hi> I
could not obtain the ſight of one: which I
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94943:30"/>
ceaſed to wonder at, when it was told me,
<hi>How the communicating of that Glorious
Book</hi> (as they call it) <hi>might tend to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement,
and prove fatal to any one who
ſhould be ſo free therewith.</hi> The buying of
an Alcoran was once warmly attempted by
<hi>Fr. Barton,</hi> a Country-man of our own, who
had the ſight of one, fair written in the <hi>Perſick</hi>
Tongue in Octavo, and of another in Quarto,
written in <hi>Arabique.</hi> But when he eſſayed
to buy the later of a <hi>Hogia,</hi> who taught
<hi>Arabique</hi> at <hi>Pera,</hi> he refuſed to ſell it at any
rate. At laſt, hearing that ſeveral Alcorans
in <hi>Perſick,</hi> were to be had among the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi>
(a Religious ſort of <hi>Mahumedan</hi> Monks)
Mr. <hi>Barton</hi> endeavoured, but in vain, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
one; and coming to <hi>Gallipolis</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi>
he had news that two or three Alcorans
were there in a Colledge of the <hi>Dervices.</hi>
But trying to buy one, they ask'd, <hi>Why he
being an Infidel, ſhould deſire to have an</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran?
He told them, <hi>That he had heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things concerning their Law, and that he
was very deſirous to be aſcertained of the truth
thereof; and to that end, was willing to buy
an</hi> Alcoran, <hi>and to take a Maſter therein to
inſtruct him.</hi> Upon the hearing of this, a
<hi>Turk</hi> preſently reply'd, <hi>That the Infidel did
diſſemble, and that under pretence of love to
the</hi> Muſulmanick <hi>Faith, he deſigned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
it; and that he ought to be had before the</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:94943:30"/>
Viſier, <hi>for his prophane attempt.</hi> So that our
Country-man was forced to eſcape privily,
for fear of being brought in queſtion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this obſervation with what
<hi>Hottinger</hi> relates of one <hi>Ahmed Ibu Ali,</hi> who
being in ſome great want of Money, pawned
an exemplar of an Alcoran, with other ſmall
Works, both in Verſe and Proſe, to the Duke
of <hi>Sylva;</hi> which the ſaid Duke profer'd to
<hi>Hottinger,</hi> at the price it was pawn'd for.
<hi>Hottinger</hi> (as himſelf relates) was glad of
the occaſion to procure a Book he had ſo
long deſired; who receiving it into his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
freely uſed it in the preſence of the
ſaid <hi>Ahmed Ibu Ali,</hi> without moleſtation or
reproach. But <hi>Ali</hi>'s occaſions drawing him
out of <hi>Afrique,</hi> and <hi>Hottinger</hi>'s into his own
Country; after three years, <hi>Ahmet</hi> came to
<hi>Leida,</hi> and there made his Application to the
learned <hi>Golius,</hi> whom he inceſſantly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
to procure for him the copy of the
Alcoran in <hi>Hottingers</hi> poſſeſſion; and would
not deſiſt till he had obtained from <hi>Golius</hi>
an earneſt Letter to that purpoſe. This Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran
<hi>Hottinger</hi> had illuſtrated with Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Notes, out of the Famous Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Beidavi,</hi> and <hi>pointed</hi> it with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.
So that by the <hi>Mahumedique</hi> Laws,
it was wholly become uſeleſs to the <hi>Moor,</hi>
and unlawful for him to receive it again.
Which thing being urged unto <hi>Ali,</hi> he no
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94943:31"/>
whit deſiſted; but with a doubled importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
deſired to have it reſtored to him, for
no other reaſon, than to have it burned; that
being the only luſtration, whereby he thought
it capable to be purified from the filth it had
contracted by the <hi>Chriſtians Notes</hi> and <hi>uſage.</hi>
In ſhort, the <hi>Moors</hi> reſpect to the Alcoran is
ſo egregious, that they ſo far honour all
written Paper for its ſake, as to take up
every little ſcript where they find it, and
having kiſſed it, they ſtop it up in ſome
chink of a Wall: ſaying, <hi>It is no ſmall ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
that any Papers ſhould be troden under
foot, in which may be written ſome part of
the</hi> Alcoran, <hi>and the Name of God.</hi> That the
Alcoran is writ in Metre, was never queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by any, but the great <hi>Scaliger,</hi> who
conſidering the nature of the <hi>Arabique</hi>
Tongue, concluded it very uncapable of
Ryme and Verſe. But upon ſecond thoughts
he grants, there is to be found in it a kind of
Ryme, but without any <hi>tunable proportion.</hi>
For the word that ſhould make up the Metre,
is either too near, or too diſtant from that
which ſhould make the Harmony. And
thoſe who have purpoſely conſidered this
matter, grant, that the Alcoran is a very
<hi>rude Poem;</hi> and the things therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are ſo looſe and incoherent, that <hi>Moſes
Amyraldus</hi> thought them rather the ragings
of a Man in a Feaver, or the Enthuſiaſms of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94943:31"/>
a Drunkard, than the inſpirations of God,
or the ſentiments of a ſober conſiderare
perſon.</p>

               <p>Of the Sunè, its Name, Contents,

            </argument>
            <p>BEſides the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> the <hi>Mahumediſts</hi>
have another Book in little leſs venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than it, which is known by the Name
of <hi>Zuna,</hi> or <hi>Sunè,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Way</hi> or
<hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>the following of the Sayings, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Counſels of</hi> Mahumed. This was
written after his death, by ſome of his chief
Diſciples. But through manifold <hi>tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,</hi>
it became ſo augmented by ſome, and
abridged by others, and altered and mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by moſt Copies, that little remain'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
of the Impoſtors Words and Actions.
Hereupon aroſe divers Readings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
no ſmall confuſion. But leſt in this
troubled variety of Copies, the true <hi>Sunè</hi>
ſhould be utterly loſt, to the irreparable
damage of the <hi>Mahumedan</hi> Religion; an
<hi>Alkalife,</hi> or King of the <hi>Moors,</hi> called a
general Council of <hi>Alfaquies</hi> or Prieſts,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94943:32"/>
Learned Men, and Doctors; and appointed
<hi>Damaſcus</hi> to be the place of their meeting.
Theſe by publick Proclamation he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bring with them all the Books that
could be found written of the <hi>Sunè,</hi> and of
<hi>Mahumeds Words</hi> and <hi>Works.</hi> The <hi>Alfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies</hi>
and others, according to command,
repaired to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and brought with
them the ſaid Books. The Caliph ſeeing
them in full Synod, communicated unto
them the purpoſe and reaſon of their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
and then commanded, That ſix of the
moſt Learned <hi>Alfaquies,</hi> and beſt read in the
<hi>Sunè,</hi> ſhould be choſen for a ſelect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
out of the two hundred Prieſts that
were there met. The ſix that were choſen,
go under theſe Names, <hi>viz. Muzlir, Boha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,
Buhora yra, Anecery, Atermindi, Doud.</hi>
The Caliph being well pleaſed with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as being Men of reputed Learning and
Integrity, called them to him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, that they ſhould go alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Houſe, and cauſe all the pretended
Books of the <hi>Sunè</hi> to be brought unto them.
And that each of them ſhould by himſelf col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
a Book of all the <hi>Sayings</hi> and <hi>Deeds</hi> of
<hi>Mahumed,</hi> which he ſhould conceive to be
true; and that they ſhould each entitle his
Book with his own Name. The ſix Prieſts
did as they were commanded by the Caliph;
and having finiſhed their task, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94943:32"/>
their Collections to him; which he no
ſooner had received, than he delivered them
to the whole Council, to be viewed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.
And theſe ſix Books, being thus
peruſed and approved, were preſerved, and
all the reſt were ordered to be caſt into <hi>Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gele,</hi>
a River near <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> And the
number of Books thus caſt into the water,
were no fewer than loaded two hundred
Camels. This being done, an Edict went
forth, <hi>That no</hi> Alfaqui, <hi>or Prieſt, ſhould dare
to read or keep any Book, but the ſix afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid;
and that none ſhould mention any Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Deed of</hi> Mahumed, <hi>but ſuch as ſhould
be found written in the ſaid Books; and
that all</hi> Muſſelmen <hi>or Believers of</hi> Mahumed,
<hi>ſhould receive theſe Books for as true and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
as if they were the very</hi> Alcoran <hi>it ſelf;
and that they ſhould receive equal reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Sect was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and the Caliph; who procured this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration,
is to this day celebrated for a
Saint. But it ſeems this was not enough to
prevent future Sects: for by reaſon of ſome
dubious and contrary paſſages found in the
ſaid Books, there aroſe ſeveral interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof, which occaſioned ſeveral opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and thereupon ſeveral Sects. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
theſe four are the more remarkable. Firſt,
the Sect of <hi>Melich,</hi> of which are all the <hi>Moors</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94943:33"/>
of <hi>Medina,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Africk.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Sect follow the opinion of <hi>Aſſafihy;</hi>
of which are the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and the
adjacent Countrey. The third Sect is that
of <hi>Hambeli,</hi> whereof are the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi>
and <hi>Perſia.</hi> The laſt Sect is made up
of thoſe who follow the opinion of <hi>Abuham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa.</hi>
So that by reaſon of the different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
given by theſe four Doctors of
the <hi>Sunè,</hi> theſe ſeveral Sects aroſe among the
<hi>Mahumediſts.</hi> And the differences of theſe
Sects chiefly conſiſt in matters of <hi>Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Marriages,</hi> and <hi>Divorces;</hi> and thoſe
Ceremonies which reſpect their Waſhings,
when they make their <hi>Sala</hi> or <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, ſpeaking of the <hi>Sunè,</hi> as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in ſix Books the <hi>Deeds</hi> and <hi>Sayings</hi> of
<hi>Mahumed,</hi> we find them reduced to four
kinds. Firſt, the <hi>Cahch,</hi> or certain and true,
which contain all the Words and Works of
<hi>Mahumed,</hi> which his Wife <hi>Ayſcha,</hi> and his
<hi>ten Diſciples,</hi> atteſt to have been ſpoken
and done by him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all thoſe Words and Works of
<hi>Mahumed</hi> which are reported by his other
Wives, without the atteſtation of <hi>Ayſcha</hi>
and his chief Diſciples, are called <hi>Dahif,</hi> or
Defective.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thoſe Words and Works of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed,</hi>
which have only the teſtimony of the
Learned and principal Men of his time, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94943:33"/>
never came to the knowledge of his chief
Diſciples, nor of <hi>Ayſcha,</hi> are called <hi>Maucof,</hi>
or Abrupt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, all thoſe Words and Works
which are delivered by his chief Doctors, as
proceeding from <hi>Mahumed</hi> after he was ſick
and infirm, are accounted <hi>weak,</hi> and called by
the <hi>Moors Zaquini.</hi> All theſe differences are to
be met with (ſaith my Author) in the Preface
to the Book of Flowers, which is an Epitome
of the ſix Books of the <hi>Sunè,</hi> and contains
only ſuch Words and Actions of <hi>Mahumed,</hi>
as are accounted <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Certain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet another Book (which ſome
Travellers report they have ſeen in the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique
Court) called <hi>Muſaph;</hi> which is
eſteemed ſo ſacred, that they will not ſuffer
it to be Tranſlated into any Language out
of <hi>Arabique.</hi> Some ſuppoſe that it is to the
Alcoran, as our Service-Book to the Bible:
others ſay, it is an Extract of the Alcoran:
and others conjecture it to be a ſhort Gloſs
or Paraphraſe thereon. This Book is had in ſo
ſingular reverence, that none is permitted to
touch it either with unwaſht or naked hands.
When it is read in the Church, the people
give it a devout attention; and the Reader
may not hold it lower than his girdle. And
having done reading therein, he gives it a
<hi>reverend kiſs;</hi> and then touching it with his
eyes, with great decency lays it up in its
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94943:34"/>
place. And yet the reſpect given this Book,
is not more than the <hi>Moors</hi> ordinarily beſtow
upon all Books of their Religion: which
(indeed) they treat with a Veneration wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the ſubject they are pretended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
For I have ſeen them taking a Book
of Devotion in their hands, preſently to hold
it up toward Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Dillah,</hi> i. e.
<hi>It is from God;</hi> and then holding it to their
<hi>Eyes, Heart,</hi> and kiſſing it, either peruſe, or
lay it aſide.</p>
            <p>Having given this ſhort account of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the firſt Proſelytes of Mahumed,
which he gained during the time he
held a Conventicle in Mecca.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Revelation that <hi>Mahumed</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have received from Heaven, to
ſet all thoſe Slaves at liberty who would
embrace his Doctrine, had not that effect
which he expected. For after ſome years of
Conventicling at his own houſe, we find
but Nine that he perſwaded to receive him
for a Prophet: Namely, <hi>Zeydin, Cadigha,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94943:34"/>
Ali</hi> the Son of <hi>Abitaleb, Otman</hi> the Son of
<hi>Affan, Zeiber Ben-Awani, Abdorrahman</hi> the
Son of <hi>Anfa, Zaad, Abuwakas, Ibeidalla</hi>
the Son of <hi>Algiarani.</hi> Indeed the Law of
releaſing Captives, cauſed many of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to reſort to his Conventicle, and to be
conſtant hearers of his private Preaching:
but <hi>Mahumed</hi> being as yet deſtitute of any
competent power to put the <hi>Pretended Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law</hi> in execution, few Slaves durſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
their <hi>Patrons</hi> to become his <hi>followers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the time of his private inſtructing
at his own houſe, he conſtantly inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch points, as bore the greateſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the opinions held by the Idolaters
of the place. As firſt, that the Idol <hi>Alleza</hi>
was only the work of Mens hands, and the
Worſhip thereof an invention of the Devil.
Secondly, that there was but one true God,
who was the Maker of all things. Thirdly,
that after men were dead, they ſhould riſe
again. Fourthly, that there was to be a
laſt and final Judgment. Fifthly, that there
was a Paradiſe and a Hell; that the joys of
the one, and pains of the other, were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
All which were denyed by the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Mecca.</hi> And concerning all theſe,
<hi>Mahumed</hi> pretended that he taught nothing
but what was commanded by <hi>Gabriel</hi> the
Arch-angel.</p>
            <p>But that which moſt advanced the credit
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94943:35"/>
of his Doctrine, was the converſion of
<hi>Omar Alhatas</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>becer,</hi> Nobles of <hi>Mecca,</hi>
(whoſe Daughters <hi>Mahumed</hi> afterwards Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried)
and very gracious with the <hi>Meckezes.</hi>
Theſe with their Houſhold increaſed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humeds</hi>
Congregation to the number of forty
perſons, all ſpecial zealots for his Religion.
<hi>Mahumed</hi> confident of the quality of <hi>Omar</hi>
and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bechar,</hi> and the place they held among
the people, began to be more open in his
deſign. But ſtill at <hi>Mecca</hi> meeting with
nothing but rejection, he went to <hi>Taiifra,</hi>
hoping to meet with better, but found the
ſame entertainment; which moved him to go
to <hi>Awaz,</hi> and <hi>Maſtag;</hi> where his ſucceſs was
conſiderable, for no fewer than 75 perſons
bound themſelves by Oath to propagate and
maintain his <hi>Law.</hi> Out of theſe ſeventy five
Proſelytes, he choſe twelve, whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned
to diſperſe his Doctrine; who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the warmth uſual to new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
proſecuted the ſame with no ſmall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and induſtry. But <hi>Omar</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bechar</hi>
relying upon their power and intereſt with
the people of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and confident their
example would be very prevailing with the
multitude, they reſolved to publiſh what <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed</hi>
had kept ſecret, and openly to read
ſuch Chapters as, he ſaid, were ſent him from
Heaven. But the other Grandees of <hi>Mecca</hi>
ſo far diſguſted the deportment of theſe two
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94943:35"/>
Nobles, eſpecially their decrying of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the great Idol <hi>Alleze,</hi> which they
and their Fathers adored as their God, that
they reſolved upon their ſpeedy ſuppreſſion,
and utterly to ſtifle the new Doctrine of
<hi>Mahumed.</hi> And holding a conſultation to
this end, it was concluded, that <hi>Mahumed</hi>
ſhould be put to death. The <hi>Coraiſhites</hi> were
chief in this Conſpiracy; who being Men
of Honour, and conſidering that <hi>Mahumed</hi>
was one of their own Tribe, they thought
the clandeſtine death of their Kinſman,
would turn to their irreparable diſgrace.
And looking upon him rather as a Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
than a Prophet, they began to deem
him worthier of their pity than revenge.
'Tis moſt certain, by many expreſſions of
the Alcoran, that <hi>Mahumed</hi> was at firſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as an Idiot, Sorcerer, Lyer, and
Demoniack Rymer. And as he walk'd in
the ſtreets, the people would frequently call
after him, ſaying, in ſcorn and mockery,
<hi>Behold the Prophet! there goes he that will
deſtroy our God!</hi> And this continued during
the time <hi>Mahumed</hi> ſtayed at <hi>Mecca,</hi> which
ſome ſay was ten years after he began his
Sect. But notwithſtanding all this, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor
did not deſiſt from Conventicling;
but every night preached at his own Houſe,
whither reſorted divers of the <hi>Meckezes,</hi>
but rather to droll upon, than reſpect his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94943:36"/>
And of ſuch mean eſteem were the
Chapters he diſperſed, that the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſaid, <hi>That they were nothing but a
few old ſtories put into ſcurvy Ryme.</hi> It has
been uſually delivered upon this ſubject,
That a Chriſtian Monk, and a Jew, were
<hi>Mahumeds</hi> great aſſiſtants in deviſing the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran;
but neither the Gloſſers upon the
Alcoran, nor the moſt authentique Legend
of his Life, take any notice thereof. It is
true indeed, that there is a general agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(in the Hiſtory of <hi>Mahumed</hi>) how he
was aſſiſted with two Chriſtian ſlaves, well
verſed in the Old and New Teſtament; and
that from them he received ſeveral paſſages
of the Bible, which he ſeems to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
mixt in the Alcoran. The <hi>Meckezes</hi>
too, are often found to upbraid the Impoſtor
for his familiarity with ſeveral Jews and
Chriſtians; and how that out of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
informations he pickt up from them of
their Religion, he patcht up his own. But
how ever their conjectures might vary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Authority and frame of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the <hi>Meckezes</hi> reſolved to ſuppreſs it;
which forced him to leave <hi>Mecca;</hi> of which

            <argument>
               <p>How Mahumed was forced to leave
Mecca, and flie to Medina. Of his
diſputes with the Jews there. A
ſhort account of the Hegira.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHile the fame of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> New
Doctrine filled <hi>Mecca</hi> with various
opinions concerning it, and that it received
daily additions of new Proſelytes; the minds
of the chief Citizens were more and more
incenſed againſt him; eſpecially when they
perceived, that under the pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
he deſigned an Empire; and he was
a <hi>Prophet</hi> in ſhow, but a <hi>Tyrant</hi> in project.
This awakened all their Counſels and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
to cruſh his enterprize in the ſhell;
but yet they could not agree of the Method.
Two Accounts I meet with of this affair;
the one is taken out of <hi>Beidavi,</hi> which is
thus: <hi>The</hi> Koraiſhites (ſaith he) <hi>upon an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time, met in the Porch of their own
Temple, to conſult about the ſuppreſſion of</hi>
Mahumed; <hi>where the Devil alſo aſſembled
with them, in the ſhape of an Old Man, and
ſaid, I have heard far from this place, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94943:37"/>
ye are met to deliberate about a matter of
great moment; I have a deſire to be of your
Council. Whom when they had admitted, one</hi>
Abultachthar <hi>opened the buſineſs, and gave
advice to bind</hi> Mahumed <hi>in chains, and to
caſt him into Priſon; and to ſtop all the holes
except one, whereat he might receive victuals.</hi>
But the Devil objected, that the Multitude
would by force ſet him at liberty. Then
ſtood up one <hi>Haſcham Ben Amru,</hi> ſaying, <hi>We
had better baniſh</hi> Mahumed <hi>our Territories,
and enjoyn him never to return again.</hi> But
this Counſel was alſo rejected by the Devil,
alleadging, <hi>That Baniſhment would but give
him a fairer opportunitie to gather and muſter
Proſelytes into an Army, and thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himſelf upon his Baniſhers.</hi> Upon
this, <hi>Abughaliel</hi> adviſed <hi>to put him to death,
as the only expedient againſt all future jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
and dangers. And this advice was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of by the</hi> Old Man, <hi>whom the friends
of</hi> Mahumed <hi>ſay, was the Devil that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that form. But all their Counſels were
infatuated, by ſome ſecret information which</hi>
Mahumed <hi>had thereof:</hi> And ſome bluſh not
to tell us, <hi>That the whole plot was revealed
unto him by the Angel</hi> Gabriel.</p>
            <p>Another account of the <hi>Koraiſhites</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
againſt <hi>Mahumed,</hi> I find taken out of
<hi>Abunazar</hi> the Son of <hi>Abdorrachman;</hi> and it
is to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:94943:37"/>
The Houſe of <hi>Mecca</hi> (that is, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
was the uſual place where the <hi>Mecke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes</hi>
uſed to aſſemble, when they deliberated
about matters of importance. Here they
met to conſult how to ſuppreſs the <hi>Prophet.</hi>
There were chiefly five who were of this
Conſpiracie; to wit, <hi>Othba, Shabbibah, Abu
Ghahel, Abulbachir,</hi> and <hi>Aazi.</hi> Theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into a Room of their Temple, <hi>Ablis</hi>
(or the Devil) in the likeneſs of an Old Man
leaning upon a ſtaff, came in amongſt them;
whom they commanded to retire, becauſe
the buſineſs about which they were met to
conſult, was of great ſecrefie. But <hi>Ablis</hi> told
them, <hi>That he was the old</hi> Negidheris, <hi>who
had ſeen</hi> ages, <hi>and had long experience of
things; that he knew how to diſpatch affairs,
and to unriddle ſecret matters; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
begg'd leave to be at their Counſels.</hi> They
granted his ſuit; and <hi>Othba</hi> told him, <hi>That
they were met to adviſe about the ſuppreſſion
of</hi> Mahumed, <hi>and his Doctrine; and added
alſo, that he was of opinion the Impoſtor
ſhould not be medled with, but to leave him
to the puniſhment of their God</hi> (meaning their
Idol <hi>Alleza</hi>) whom he had Blaſphemed. But
<hi>Ablis</hi> told them, <hi>That if</hi> Mahumed <hi>were let
alone, before he dyed he would fill the World
with his Impoſture, and gather ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Sectaries, as would vanquiſh both them
and their City.</hi> This ſaying of <hi>Ablis</hi> met
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94943:38"/>
with great approbation, and moved <hi>Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blibah</hi>
to preſs for his inſtant confinement.
But <hi>Ablis</hi> anſwered, that that would only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
his friends to arm for his enlargement;
and therefore <hi>Aazi Ben Vail</hi> thought it would
be moſt proper to ſet him upon a Camel, and
ſend him to periſh in the deſart. But this
was alſo diſliked by <hi>Ablis,</hi> becauſe if it ſhould
happen that <hi>Mahumed</hi> ſhould fall into the
company of Men, his comelineſs of Perſon,
and eloquence of Language, would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
move them to pity, and relieve his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
At laſt, <hi>Abu Gahel</hi> thought it the
ſafeſt way to hire ſome deſperate fellows to
fall upon him ſuddainly, and deſtroy him.
And <hi>Ablis</hi> and the reſt unanimouſly approv'd
of it; and ſo they broke up their Council,
in order to put this laſt advice in execution.
But all (ſay his flatterers) was by the Angel
<hi>Gabriel</hi> quickly made known unto <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
whom he adviſed to provide for his
eſcape. So ſaith the Alcoran in the eighth
<hi>Surat—Seeing that Infidels lay ſnares for
thee, the moſt high God commandeth thee to
depart from</hi> Mecca, <hi>and to go to</hi> Medina.</p>
            <p>And having thus briefly ſet down the true
occaſion of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> leaving <hi>Mecca,</hi> the
manner thereof comes next to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Though the plot of the <hi>Meckezes</hi>
was early known unto him, yet before he
could provide for his departure, all the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94943:38"/>
of the Town were beſet with the <hi>Spyes</hi>
and <hi>Guards</hi> of his Enemies; whoſe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<hi>Mahumed</hi> is ſaid to have deceived by
Sorcery, though his Sectaries call it a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.
And it was thus: Mahumed <hi>meeting
his Proſelytes at the place and hour appointed,
and finding all the Paſſages obſtructed by his
adverſaries, he commanded his Converts to
lay duſt upon the heads of their Horſes, and to
caſt ſome handfuls into the air, and then to
lay the reins upon the necks of their horſes, and
to read theſe words of the Alcoran: They took
a veil in their hands and about them, ſo that
they blinded their enemies, that they ſaw
nothing.</hi> And in this poſture they paſſed
thorow the Guards of their Enemies undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and came ſafe to <hi>Medina;</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <hi>Iatrib</hi> or <hi>Tribick,</hi> ten days journey
from <hi>Mecca.</hi> His coming thither was very
ſucceſsful, for he was by ſeveral received for
a Prophet; and during the thirteen years he
tarried there, he finiſhed the Alcoran.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Medina</hi> was very populous, both with
Jews and Pagans; and while many of the
latter became <hi>Mahumeds</hi> eaſie Conqueſt, the
former ſtoutly reſiſted him, ſcoffing at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
paſſages of his Doctrine, and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Authority of his Miſſion. And
when they required him to atteſt the Divine
<hi>Power</hi> of his Apoſtleſhip by ſuch Miracles
as their own <hi>Moſes</hi> and Prophets had done
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94943:39"/>
before him, he returned no other anſwer,
but, <hi>That God was his witneſs, whoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
was ſufficient: That he came not to work
Miracles, but to reduce thoſe that went aſtray,
and to render them ſubject to the Law of God
and</hi> Abraham. He told them likewiſe, <hi>That
divers Prophets had wrought Miracles, and
yet were not believed, but underwent mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
perſecutions.</hi> And then inſtanced in
<hi>Hadin, Zamud, Zaleh;</hi> which were never
read or heard of, but in his own Alcoran.</p>
            <p>Amidſt the various diſputes with the Jews,
<hi>Mahumed</hi> is ſaid to have practiſed a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
artifice in loading the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>
with large Encomiums, ever profeſſing he
had no other deſign, but to compleat it with
his <hi>own.</hi> The like policie he uſed in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
the Jewiſh Prophets, and their holy
Men. But all this had ſmall influence upon
them, whoſe contradicting of his Doctrine
met with no abatement, till he encounter'd
it with an Armed power, which both at the
firſt opening of <hi>Mahumediſm,</hi> and ever
ſince, has been the chief <hi>propagator</hi> of that
curſed Hereſie.</p>
            <p>In his flight from <hi>Mecca, Mahumed</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not the Conſolation of his Companions;
of whom the chief was <hi>Abubecer,</hi> whoſe zeal
for the Doctrine of his Son-in-law, purchaſed
him with thoſe of the ſame Sect the renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Juſt</hi> over the <hi>Religious fugitives</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:94943:39"/>

of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Flight) <hi>Abdalla Ibn Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kat</hi>
was Captain. And it is obſerved, that
not one of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Converts ſtayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, ſave his Son in-law <hi>Ali,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
leave to tarry but three days at <hi>Mecca,</hi>
to diſpoſe of his concerns. At the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which time, he was to haſten after
them. <hi>Mahumed</hi> with this Retinue enter'd
<hi>Medina</hi> about noon, upon a Monday, ſay
ſome; others ſay, upon a Thurſday; which
was the twelfth of the <hi>former Rabiah.</hi> The
news of whoſe coming arrived <hi>Medina</hi> before
his perſon; which cauſed <hi>Chaled Abi Job</hi> to
have Lodgings ready for him, where he tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
till other Houſes were fitted for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.
After <hi>Mahumed</hi> had left <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>

in vindication of his Doctrine; theſe
were <hi>Balal, Zohiah, Chabbab, Ammar, Abu-Haudal,

forced to leave <hi>Mecca</hi> for fear of the <hi>Korai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhites,</hi>
were honoured with the name of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

            <p>As to the <hi>computation</hi> ſo well known by

            <p>THe firſt year of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> new <hi>Aera,</hi>
was ſignalized with the <hi>White Banner</hi>

not of any more till the Battle of <hi>Bader,</hi>
where ſeveral of the chief of the <hi>Koraiſhites</hi>
were cut off. This hapned upon the 17th of
<hi>Ramadan,</hi> being Friday, in the later end of the
ſecond of the <hi>Hegira.</hi> While the more war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Proſelytes thus followed
the field, he himſelf omitted noartifice to
gather Proſelytes at home; and the number
of theſe increaſed according to the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the other. When he found any of
his Converts flag in their zeal, or queſtion
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94943:40"/>
either his <hi>actions</hi> or Doctrine, he actuated
the one, and ſilenced the other, with ſuch
Chapters as he pretended to be ſent him
from Heaven; all which were afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
in the Alcoran, and they bear the
Title of <hi>Chapters made at</hi> Medina. Thus
<hi>Mahumed</hi> feigned Revelations according
to his purpoſe, and had a Verſe from <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi>
always ready to adjuſt his <hi>Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he was zealouſly proſelytizing at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi>
news came that <hi>Abuſophian Ben-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi>

Caravan of the Goods of the <hi>Korai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhites:</hi>
upon tidings whereof, 319 <hi>Muſulmin</hi>
were inſtantly diſpatcht to encounter and
plunder them. And the Infidels (as the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humediſts</hi>

being ſlain upon the place, as many more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

whereof only fourteen were ſlain, or fell <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
(for, for <hi>Martyrs,</hi> all are accounted, who
die in defence of that Religion.) This Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is highly celebrated in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles;
and in the Alcoran is produced as a
ſignal teſtimony of Gods approbation of the
juſtice of <hi>Mahumediſm:</hi> for the <hi>Muſulmin</hi>
are bid to conſider, <hi>That though their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
were far inferiour in number to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94943:41"/>
yet they overcame them, becauſe they
fought in the way of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But no leſs than a Miracle aſſiſted the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmin</hi>
in this Battel; for their Enemies eyes
are ſaid to have ſeen double, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to have thought the <hi>Mahumedans</hi> thrice
as many as they were, and of larger ſtature
than ordinary. From which imagination
they ſuffered more, than from their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.
It is very obſervable, that many of,
if not all, thoſe parcels of the Alcoran <hi>where
the fight of the Infidels is ſpoken of, and how
God fought for the Believers,</hi> are by the
Commentators on the Alcoran generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of this Victory gained over the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan.
But after this, we hear no more of
<hi>Mahumeds</hi> Battels, till the fifth of his <hi>Hegira,</hi>
when no leſs than ten thouſand <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſhites</hi>
ſet upon the <hi>Mahumedans,</hi> who with
an inconſiderable loſs, gave them a total
overthrow. In the ſame year hapned alſo
the Battel with the <hi>Koraidae,</hi> whom <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed</hi>
Beſieged twenty five days; who at
laſt, oppreſſed with want, ſurrendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up to <hi>Saad Ben Maad</hi> (who was yet
ſcarce recovered of the Wounds he received
in the former Battel.) The <hi>Koraidae</hi> being
now wholly at <hi>Saads</hi> diſpoſal, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Men to be put to death, and the
Women and Children to be made Slaves.
Whereupon, between ſix or ſeven hundred
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94943:41"/>
perſons were ſlain; among whom was <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibus,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Ahtab,</hi> who was <hi>General.</hi>
And all the Men being thus deſtroyed, the
Children, Women, and Goods, were divided
among the <hi>Muſulmin.</hi> This Battel is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Praelium Foſſae,</hi> becauſe the ſlain were
caſt into the ditches digg'd in the field of
<hi>Medina</hi> for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth year of the <hi>Hegira, Mahumed</hi>
had ſeveral conflicts with his Enemies; the
chief whereof was the Battel with the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalaki,</hi>
whom he utterly vanquiſht, taking
the Women and Children captive. Among
whom was <hi>Gjuweira,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith,</hi>
whom <hi>Mahumed</hi> afterward Married, and
for her Dowry he releaſed all her Kindred
whom he had taken Priſoners. In the ſame
year likewiſe fell out the Battel of <hi>Haditia,</hi> a
place near <hi>Mecca,</hi> in the way to <hi>Gjudda;</hi>
which proved ſo advantageous to <hi>Mahumed,</hi>
that his Enemies (the <hi>Koraiſhites</hi>) ſought his
friendſhip. A League was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them for ten years, upon theſe Articles.
1. That during that time the <hi>Koraiſhites</hi>
ſhould have free liberty to follow their
Tillages. 2. That any (who had a minde)
of the <hi>Koraiſhites,</hi> might go to <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
party; and likewiſe thoſe of the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans,</hi>
who deſired, had, during the making
of the Truce, leave to join themſelves to the
<hi>Koraiſhites.</hi> 3. That after the Truce was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94943:42"/>
made, if any of the <hi>Koraiſhites</hi> fled to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed,</hi>
without leave of the Governour, he
ſhould be ſent back unto him: but if any
of the <hi>Mahumedans</hi> revolted, he ſhould not
be ſent back. 4. That if <hi>Mahumed</hi> with
his Souldiers ſhould that year return to <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
they were not to enter with more Arms
than was uſual for Travailers, nor to ſtay
there above three days.</p>
            <p>This League, on <hi>Mahumeds</hi> ſide, was
effected by <hi>Sahlus</hi> the Son of <hi>Omar,</hi> and
committed to writing by <hi>Ali</hi> the Son of <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talib.</hi>
The ſame year (ſaith <hi>Elmacinus,</hi> in
<hi>Hiſt. Sarac. p.</hi> 7.) <hi>Mahumed</hi> was <hi>inaugurated</hi>
(what he means by it I know not) under a
Tree, which afterward was ſwept away, as
they report, by a great flux of water.</p>
            <p>On the ſeventh year of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> one
of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Wives having a Son that was
a Carpenter, ſhe moved her Husband that
he ſhould make him a Pulpit. To which he
readily conſented, having before leaned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſtaff while he officiated in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
they had built. This Pulpit was made of
white Tamariſk, and aſcended by two ſteps,
and had in it a convenient ſeat. In which
condition it remain'd until the Reign of
<hi>Muavias</hi> the Son of <hi>Abuſofian,</hi> who raiſed
it ſix ſteps higher; in which ſort it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
until <hi>Oſman</hi> the Son of <hi>Affan</hi> covered it
with Tapeſtry. <hi>Elmacinus Hiſt. Sarac. lib.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:94943:42"/>
In this year hapned the Battel of <hi>Chaibar,</hi>
where <hi>Mahumed</hi> was abſolute Victor; and
purſuing his Conqueſt, took ſeveral <hi>Forts</hi>
and <hi>Caſtles.</hi> His perſonal valour and danger
were here very remarkable. <hi>Watiha</hi> and
<hi>Selalima,</hi> two great Cittadels, coſt him no
ſmall hazard and loſs to ſubdue them. But
having made himſelf Maſter thereof, with
vaſt ſtores of Riches, he ſpared the Beſieged,
upon condition that they ſhould annually
pay him conſiderable Tributes, and that it
ſhould be at his pleaſure to turn them out
of their Countrey when he thought fit. The
Inhabitants of <hi>Badra</hi> were taken into the
ſame League, as alſo many <hi>Jews,</hi> who all
enjoyed the benefit of the Truce until the
Reign of <hi>Omar</hi> the Son of <hi>Alchitab;</hi> who
underſtanding how <hi>Mahumed</hi> had ſaid upon
his death-bed, <hi>Let not two Religions concur in</hi>
Arabia, interpreted the words of the ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe Inhabitants who were not <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humedans.</hi>
But to return: <hi>Mahumed</hi> by
his ſucceſſes in the fore-mentioned Battels
was grown ſo formidable, that his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
deſpaired to prevail againſt him by open
War; whereupon, they had recourſ to
ſtratagem. And here <hi>Elmacinus</hi> tells us, how
one <hi>Zainab,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Alharit</hi> a <hi>Jeweſs,</hi>
attempted to take away <hi>Mahumeds</hi> life, with
a joint of Mutton exquiſitely poyſoned. But
<hi>Mahumed</hi> taſting thereof, inſtantly ſpit it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94943:43"/>
out, ſaying, <hi>This Mutton tells me that it is
poyſoned.</hi> And his deliverance herein is
reckoned among his Miracles, as ſhall be
ſhown in a Chapter of that Subject.</p>
            <p>This year <hi>Mahumed</hi> proved ſo ſuccesful in
Arms, that all the Country about <hi>Mecca</hi> and
<hi>Medina</hi> were ſubject to, or in League with
him. And he had propagated his Victories
(which were now become the chief method
of proſelytizing) the eighth of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> had
not the <hi>Meckezes</hi> diverted him, who all on
the ſuddain violated their Faith with <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
and became Truce-breakers, to their
utter overthrow. For <hi>Mahumed</hi> finding
them to have broken their Articles, came
againſt them with ten thouſand Men, who
were ſuffered to enter <hi>Mecca,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that they ſhould put none to the
Sword: which was granted to all except a
few, whom he choſe rather to kill, than to
ſurvive to the diſturbance of his new King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<hi>Elmacinus</hi> ſaith, that all the people
of <hi>Mecca</hi> at this time turn'd <hi>Muſulmin,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
therein the example of <hi>Abbas</hi> the Son
of <hi>Abdulmutalib,</hi> and <hi>Abuſofian</hi> the Son of
<hi>Harith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his ſucceſs at <hi>Mecca</hi> was greatly cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the overthrow he ſuffered in the vale of
<hi>Honani;</hi> where the Pagan <hi>Arabians</hi> under the
command of <hi>Melick,</hi> Son of <hi>Auſi,</hi> put the
<hi>Muſulmin</hi> to flight, and purſued them to the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94943:43"/>
Gates of <hi>Mecca,</hi> where <hi>Mahumed</hi> with a
Javelin in his hand oppoſed their entrance,
upbraiding them with Cowardice, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them reſtore the Battel, promiſing them
the aſſiſtance of many Myriads of Angels.
Whereupon, returning, and coming unawares
upon the Enemy, who were now careleſs
through ſucceſs, they utterly overcame them:
and taking Captive the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the Men that eſcaped afterward became
<hi>Muſulmin,</hi> upon condition their Wives and
little ones ſhould be reſtored them.</p>
            <p>The laſt Battel that hapned in <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
lifé-time, was that of <hi>Tebuc,</hi> with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Dauma</hi> and <hi>Eila;</hi> whom having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
he received to peace, upon condition
of receiving from them a yearly Tribute.
Here great rewards were beſtowed upon the
Army by <hi>Oſman,</hi> and a numerous company of
Proſelytes came in unto <hi>Mahumed.</hi> This
hapned the ninth of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> in which
year <hi>Mahumed</hi> went to <hi>Mecca,</hi> where having
ſpent ſome time in teaching and inſtructing
the people in his <hi>Law,</hi> he returned to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi>
where he died: of which in the next

            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>MAhumed</hi> loaden with Military ſucceſſes,
and through fear or ignorance the
Jews and <hi>Arabians</hi> having given up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to his Religion; himſelf at laſt was
forced to yield to Mortality. To which he
was prepared at firſt by a light Fever, which
at length increaſed to ſuch violence, that in
a great degree it ſeem'd to bereave him of
his ſenſes. His carriage under this diſtemper
was very remarkable. Some ſay, that he
deſired to change many things which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had delivered; and that to that end
he call'd for Pen and Paper, ſaying, that he
would write them a Book, which after his
death ſhould preſerve them from Error. But
<hi>Omar</hi> hearing theſe words, cryed out, <hi>Alas!
the Diſtemper grows violent upon the Apoſtle
of God: the Book of God</hi> (viz. the Alcoran)
<hi>is ſufficient for us.</hi> But their diſputes grew
warm; and ſome were deſirous that Pen and
Paper might be brought to <hi>Mahumed,</hi> but
<hi>Omar</hi> with many others denied it, confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirming, that <hi>the Prophet knew not what
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94943:44"/>
he ſaid. Mahumed</hi> moved at their ſtrife,
commanded them all to depart, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to diſpute ſuch things <hi>in his preſence.</hi>
So that he writ nothing; which many of
his Followers bewail; as fancying themſelves
thereby to have been defeated of many
things, which might have proved advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
to their Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahumed</hi> finding his ſickneſs to increaſe
upon him, and falling into the apprehenſion
of his approaching Death; <hi>Elmacinus</hi> ſaith,
that he commanded <hi>Abubecer</hi> to pray with
the people; and that they ſaid ſeventeen
Prayers in his behalf. He fell ſick (ſaith the
ſame Author) upon the 28 of <hi>Sofar,</hi> and died
upon Munday the 12th of the <hi>former Rabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
which ſome affirm was his Birth-day,
and the ſame day of the week on which he
fell ſick.</p>
            <p>But the news of his death was very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
entertained; ſome denying it, as utterly
impoſſible, conceiving him to be immortal;
crying out, <hi>How can he be our witneſs with
God, if he be dead!</hi> and thereupon affirm'd,
that he was not dead, but that he was taken
away as <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. This ſtirred up the Multitude to
withſtand his Burial, conſtantly affirming
that he was not dead. <hi>Omar</hi> in this contraſt
took part with the <hi>people,</hi> and threatned to
be the death of him who durſt ſay the Apoſtle
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94943:45"/>
of God was dead; adding, <hi>That he was taken
up into Heaven, and gone away like</hi> Moſes.
While the contention grew violent, <hi>Abubecer</hi>
ſtept in, and ſaid, <hi>Though</hi> Mahumed <hi>be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
dead; yet the God of</hi> Mahumed <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dye, but liveth for ever.</hi> And then he
proved his ſaying out of the Alcoran, which
ſets down, that as others dyed who in their
ſeveral times were Prophets, ſo <hi>Mahumed</hi>
was to dye. And the people all reſted ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with <hi>Abubecers</hi> Speech, and from
thenceforth believed the <hi>Death</hi> of their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>
But no leſs contention hapned about his
Burial; for thoſe <hi>Meckezes</hi> who had been
the <hi>Companions of his Flight,</hi> pleaded that
he ought to be interr'd at <hi>Mecca,</hi> the place
of his Birth; the <hi>Medinezes,</hi> who received
him when he was perſecuted from <hi>Mecca,</hi>
ſaid, that he ſhould rather be intombed at
<hi>Medina,</hi> becauſe it was his <hi>Aſylum</hi> and <hi>refuge</hi>
in the day of his Afflictions. Others ſaid,
it was both moſt convenient and laudable, to
carry to, and bury him at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the
<hi>burying place</hi> of the Prophets. But at laſt
they all agreed that he ſhould be buried at
<hi>Medina,</hi> in the Chamber of his Wife <hi>Ayſcha,</hi>
and under the bed wherein he died. He
died in the 63 year of his age, after he had
Merchanted 38, been two years in the Cave,
lived at <hi>Mecca</hi> 10, and 13 at <hi>Medina. Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tema</hi>
was the only Child that ſurvived him,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94943:45"/>
who lived but forty days after him. He had
ſeven Wives, beſides Concubines. He was
unſatiable in his Luſts, and ſo enormous
therein, that he ſpared no Mans bed. The
filthineſs of whoſe life, was a plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the falſeneſs of his Prophecy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rules of trying falſe Prophets
laid down by <hi>Maimonides [in Moreth, lib.</hi>
2. <hi>cap.</hi> 40.] <hi>In the tryal of Prophet</hi> (ſaith
that Learned Jew) <hi>thou art to animadvert the
perfection of his perſon, to enquire diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into his actions, and to obſerve his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation:
but the chief ſign whereby he is to be
diſcerned, is the abdication and contemning
of bodily pleaſures (which is the token of a
wiſe Man, much more of a Prophet) and
principally the filthineſs of Venery. By this
ſign God hath diſcovered all thoſe who falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
boaſted of the</hi> Spirit of Propheſie, <hi>ſo that
the truth herein might eaſily be found of thoſe
that ſought it, and errour be avoided.</hi> By
which rule of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> if <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
Prophetic Office were duely examined, he
would be found, as indeed he was, a moſt
<hi>Peſtilent Impoſtor;</hi> being ſo far from renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his <hi>luſts,</hi> that he reckoned them among
the chief Priviledges of his Prophetick Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I ſhall cloſe up this Chapter, with
<hi>remarking</hi> the groundleſneſs of that Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which makes <hi>Mahumed</hi> to be put into
an <hi>Iron Cheſt,</hi> that by the force of Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94943:46"/>
hangs in the air. Speaking with one
<hi>Cidi Abſolom</hi> (upon his return from perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Alhage</hi> to <hi>Mecca</hi>) he told me it was
an idle fable exploded by the <hi>Mahumediſts;</hi>
who from this their conceit of the <hi>Hanging
Tomb,</hi> upbraid the Chriſtians with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in their <hi>ſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahumed</hi> being dead, and the <hi>care</hi> of his
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> being devolved upon
<hi>Abubecer,</hi> who for his zeal was ſtiled the
<hi>juſt;</hi> The entrance of his Government was
not a little moleſted with certain Men, who
pretended either to equal, or exceed <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
in his pretentions of a Prophet. Of
theſe <hi>Aſwad</hi> was the firſt, who giving it out
that he was a Prophet, under that cloak drew
many after him, with whoſe aid he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Maſter of <hi>Zanaa, Nazrana,</hi> and <hi>Tayfa.</hi>
And as he began to grow famous, he was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his own Houſe by one <hi>Firus Dailamus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Abubecer</hi> had rid himſelf of <hi>Aſwad,</hi>
one <hi>Taliha</hi> created him a ſecond diſturbance;
who likewiſe preſenting himſelf to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as a fellow-Prophet to <hi>Mahumed,</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not credulous adherents, well fitted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
his proſecutions. But he was quickly
put to flight by <hi>Chalid Ben-Walid:</hi> and upon
the death of <hi>Abubecer,</hi> came in to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
<hi>Omar,</hi> to whom he made an Oath of
Fidelity, and thereupon was permitted to
return to his Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:94943:46"/>
               <hi>Muſeilema</hi> was the third who pretended to
be a companion of <hi>Mahumed</hi> in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetique
Authority: he Married one <hi>Theg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazis,</hi>
who made her ſelf a Propheteſs; but
in a very ſhort time ſhe forſook her Husband,
and returned to her own people. The van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing
of <hi>Muſeilema</hi> coſt much blood; of
his party no fewer than ten thouſand being
ſlain in one Battel; a wound which proved
utterly uncurable to that Sect.</p>
            <p>The fourth great Pretender was one whom
the <hi>Saracen</hi> Hiſtory calls <hi>Almotenabbi,</hi> or
<hi>The Propheſier.</hi> An excellent Poet and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;
he in all things ſtudied to be like <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed.</hi>
He wrote an Alcoran, both in Verſe
and Proſe; and was the moſt conſiderable
that ever rivall'd the Impoſtor: but ſome years
after his death, all his followers were diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
and his Sect crumbled to nothing.</p>

Some hearing of <hi>Mahumediſm,</hi> think
it to be nothing but a bundle of <hi>meer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,</hi>
and a <hi>heap</hi> of <hi>monſtrous</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenious
Fables,</hi> wholly tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment

which mind I was my ſelf, till deſire of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
therein, brought me into a more
ingenuous acquaintance therewith. And that
I may give an unprejudiced account of the
principles of <hi>Mahumediſm,</hi> I have conſulted
with none but ſuch as have <hi>profeſſedly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
upon this Theme. 'Tis true, that <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediſm</hi>
ſtrictly conſidered, is a hodge-podge
of <hi>Judaiſm, Gentiliſm,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianiſm;</hi>
which makes it have ſo many excellent things
contained in it; and the very Alcoran it
ſelf, moſtly conſiſts of expreſs words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
And ſo ſubtle was <hi>Mahumed</hi> in the
compoſure of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that he took it
all out of the Books of the two <hi>Teſtaments,</hi>
and the Traditionals of the <hi>Jews;</hi> adding
little of his <hi>own,</hi> beſides ſome ſorry and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous

all this, ſo browleſs was this <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique,</hi>
that he was not aſham'd to tell the
World, <hi>That all he Preached was ſent him

affords it to every Reader in our own
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94943:47"/>
Language. But becauſe things therein are
ſo diſperſedly laid down, I ſhall here give a
ſummary account of the chief points there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
collected out of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Authors.
And firſt, <hi>Elmacinus</hi> hath reduced <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſm</hi>
to Twelve Articles, namely:
<list>
                  <item>1. To believe in one only God.</item>
                  <item>2. To love and to adore him.</item>

Ramadan, (of whoſe inſtitution I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſpoken in my account of the <hi>Moreſco</hi>-Cuſtoms.)</item>
                  <item>6. To pray, or repeat the <hi>Zala</hi> five times in
the compaſs of a natural day.</item>

that not a few of other Religions were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſo far allured, as to embrace it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

15. That they take not the Name of God in vain.
16. That they judge not haſtily. 17. That they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
not their brethren, neither before their
face, nor behind their backs. 18. That they
upbraid no Man for his deformity. 19. That
they neither divorce, nor caſt off a chaſt
Woman. 20. That they make no mans miſery
or misfortune matter of their ſport or laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
21. That they caſt not off the fear of Gods
puniſhments. 22. That they be no obtrectators, or
given to Calumny and Back-biting. 23. That
they give God thanks for every benefit they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from him. 24. That they be patient in
afflictions. 25. That they deſpair not of Gods
mercy. 26. That they believe that all what
happens to them was not appointed for another,
for then it would have befaln him. 27. That
God, to pleaſe his Creatures, is not angry with
them. 28. That they prefer not this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that to come. 29. That they do not cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly
withhold from their Brother (<hi>that is, a
Muſulman</hi>) what they deſire of them. 30. That
in the things of Religion they obſerve him
who is above them; and in the things of the
World, thoſe who are below them. 31. That
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94943:49"/>

themſelves from thoſe who ſtand in need of

               <p>All things, both good and evil, ſweet and
bitter, are under Gods Providence; the
Lord our God doth govern them all. The
diſpoſal of all things are in his hand, and
their proceſs and originals depend upon his
decree. He knows all things before they
come to paſs, and all things flow by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.
Nothing is done by his Worſhippers,
which he hath not decreed and anteverted
by his preſcience. He knows all that he has
made, making to erre whom he will, by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them in his juſt judgment, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whom he pleaſeth, and of his mercy help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. All things are brought to an eaſie
end according to his fore-knowledge and
<hi>foreſight,</hi> whether it be Calamitous or happy.
And it were no ordinary impiety to imagine
that any thing can be done in his Kingdome
againſt his will; or that any emolument can
happen to any one which he doth not grant:
or that there is any other Creator of any thing
beſides him, who is the Lord of his Creatures,
the Lord of their Works, and the orderer of
their Motions and Counſels.</p>

was greatly approved of by <hi>Vathecus,</hi>
and very highly commended by <hi>Ahmed</hi> the

be compelled to believe that the Alcoran was

this was very diſpleaſing to the <hi>Muſulmin,</hi>

<hi>Ozair,</hi> and the later that <hi>Meſſias</hi> was the
Son of God. And in another Chapter of

Cod doth not pardon him, who makes him
to have a Companion. For thoſe that do
<hi>aſſociate</hi> any thing unto God, erre a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Errour. And <hi>Mahumed</hi> ſaith, that
they are not to be interceded for. And he
brings <hi>Abraham</hi> in for an example, who pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not for his Father, becauſe he was an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,
and therefore an <hi>Aſſociant.</hi> And I
meet with a place cited out of the <hi>Sunè,</hi> or

               <p>In the day of the Reſurrection, it ſhall be

ſaid to the Jews, What have you Worſhipped?

the Son of God: and it ſhall be ſaid unto them,
Ye do erre, for God hath neither Son nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion:
but what is it that you deſire? they
reply, <hi>Something to drink:</hi> it ſhall be ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, Drink, and fall headlong into Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire.
After this it ſhall be ſaid to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

it ſhall be returned, Drink, and go to <hi>Gehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.

               <p>The Doctrine of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> in ſeveral of
the particulars already mention'd, is much
otherwiſe reported by <hi>European</hi> Authors,
than it is done here. But I have kept my
ſelf to the Orientals in this account, and am
induced to believe they are the fitteſt to be

Religion, ſet down by Doctor
<hi>Pocock,</hi> in his Learned Notes upon <hi>Greg.
Abul. Farajius, pag.</hi> 284. &amp;c. which he cites out
of <hi>Algazalius,</hi> a Writer of great reputation
among the <hi>Mahumedans;</hi> and it is called,
<hi>The Interpretation of the Faith of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox;</hi>
which conſiſts in theſe two points.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That there is no God, but the God.</hi> 2. <hi>That</hi>
Mahumed <hi>is his Meſſenger.</hi> This is that
<hi>Duplex Teſtimonium,</hi> which <hi>Elmacinus</hi>
ſaith was the Poeſie or Motto of <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
Seal: though a learned Writer tells us out
of <hi>Alkodaius,</hi> that his <hi>Seal</hi> had no other
Inſcription than <hi>Mahumed Meſſenger of
God;</hi> which being but three words in the

               <p>Of the things conducing to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Mahumed's Hereſie. And
firſt, of his carriage towards the
Chriſtians.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving, in the antecedent Chapters,
given a ſhort account of the <hi>Origine</hi>
and <hi>firſt State of Mahumediſm,</hi> and therein
of the more remarkable paſſages relating to
to the <hi>Birth, Life,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that Hereſie: In purſuance of my
firſt intention, I am now to ſet down the
things which (are conjectured to have)
conduced to the firſt reception of that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Impoſtor; among which, ſome related
to <hi>Mahumed</hi>'s Carriage and Doctrine, and
ſome to the condition wherein he found
Religion at his firſt ſetting up for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
            <p>It has ever been the guiſe of the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders
of miſchievous Enterprizes, to gain,
if poſſible, a popular eſteem of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
In which artifice <hi>Mahumed</hi> was both
ſtudious and ſucceſsful. For his ſeemingly
rigid Zeal for Religion was tempered with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94943:56"/>
ſuch an affability of deportment, that the
very <hi>Koraiſhites,</hi> his ſoreſt Enemies, highly
commended his Demeanour, though they
reſolutely withſtood his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But that which ſome have reckoned for
a main Engine to advance his Religion,
was his not ſuffering it, like <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Rod,</hi> to
turn to a Serpent, and devour all the reſt:
For he granted a <hi>Toleration;</hi> for every
one had free liberty to enjoy his Worſhip,
according to that place of the Alcoran,
where he ſaith: <hi>O Inſidels! I do not adore
what you adore; and you do not adore what
I worſhip; obſerve you your Law, and I will
obſerve mine.</hi> At his firſt appearance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cloak of a <hi>divine Meſſenger,</hi> he
found a great part of the World enlightned
with the Goſpel, and Chriſtianity: though
it was greatly ſhaken with Inteſtine Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
yet there was ſtill that Zeal and Union
of its Profeſſors, and power and activity of
Civil Magiſtrates, as render'd it ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
to <hi>Mahumed,</hi> that he could not hope
to afright them into compliance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
during the firſt and <hi>weak ſtate</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humediſm,</hi>
its Author put on a modeſt
Countenance and <hi>plauſible Aſpect,</hi> eſpecially
toward the Chriſtians, whom he ſo far cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as to draw his own Tenets and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in ſome conformity to theirs; highly
praiſing the Perſon, Actions, and Rules of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94943:56"/>
Chriſt, and uſing a peculiar reſpect to all
bearing his Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elmacinus</hi> (in the firſt book of his <hi>Saracen</hi>
Hiſtory) tells us, how that certain Chriſtians
coming to deſire <hi>Mahumeds</hi> protection, he
freely granted their requeſt, conditioning
onely the payment of a ſmall Tribute. He
alſo commanded <hi>Omar</hi> to tell them, <hi>That
their Lives were as his Life, and their Riches
as this Riches; That whatever befel them, ſhould
befal him alſo.</hi> This was written, ſaith <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macinus,</hi>
by the famous Author of the Book
<hi>Almuhaddeb,</hi> and is cited by <hi>Abunifa.</hi> The
ſame Hiſtory reports likewiſe, that when a
Grandee who was a Chriſtian came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
the Prophet, that he ſtood up to him
in token of reſpect: and being by ſome of
his <hi>followers</hi> rebuked for ſo doing, he told
them, <hi>The Chriſtian was a Magiſtrate among
his people, and honour is due to men of that
Quality. He charged his Captains to be
kinde to the</hi> Cophtites; <hi>and that he would
be an Enemy to that man in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who oppreſſed the Chriſtians.</hi> And to
teſtifie to the world that his deſigne was not
to oppreſs or ruinate their Religion, he is
reported to have made this following Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
for the protection both of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and its Profeſſors.</p>

               <p>A Copy of the League Mahumed made

and (as ſome ſay) was ſent to

            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>MAhumed,</hi> ſent from God to teach Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
and declare the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
in truth, wrote theſe things.</p>
            <p>That the Cauſe of Chriſtian Religion
determined by God, might remain in all
parts of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> as well amongſt
the Inhabitants as Strangers, near and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
known and unknown: To all theſe

is declared, and ſtrict <hi>obſervance enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
Therefore, whoſoever of the <hi>Muſulmin's</hi>
Faith ſhall neglect to perform theſe things,
and violate this <hi>League,</hi> and after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Infidels break it, and tranſgreſs what
I command herein, he breaks the <hi>Compact</hi> of

God, reſiſts his agreement, and contemns his
<hi>Teſtament,</hi> whether he be a King, or any other
of the faithful, (that is, <hi>Mahumedans.</hi>)</p>
            <p>By this Agreement, whereby I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
my ſelf, and which the Chriſtians have
required of me, and in my <hi>Name,</hi> and in
the name of all my <hi>Diſciples,</hi> to enter into
a <hi>Covenant</hi> of God with them, and <hi>League</hi>
and Teſtament of the Prophets, Apoſtles,
Elect, and faithful <hi>Saints,</hi> and bleſſed of
times paſt and to come.</p>
            <p>By this <hi>Covenant,</hi> I ſay, and Teſtament
of mine (which I will have maintained
with as much Religion, as a Prophet Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
or as an Angel next to the <hi>Divine
Majeſty</hi> is ſtrict in his obedience towards
God, and in obſervance to his <hi>Law</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant)
I promiſe to defend their Judges
in my Provinces, with my <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Foot,</hi>
Auxiliaries, and other my faithful Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and to preſerve them from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
whether remote or neer, and ſecure
them both in Peace and War; and protect
their Churches, Temples, Oratories, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries,
and places of Pilgrimage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſcituated, whether in Mountain or
Valley, Cavern or Houſe, a Plain, or upon
the Sand, or in what ſort of edifice ſoever;
alſo preſerve their Religion and their Goods
in whatſoever part they are, whether at
<hi>Land</hi> or <hi>Sea,</hi> Eaſt or Weſt, even as I keep
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94943:58"/>
my <hi>ſelf</hi> and my <hi>Scepter,</hi> and the faithful
believers of my own people.</p>
            <p>By this Covenant, I likewiſe promiſe to
receive them into my protection from all
Harm, Vexation, Offence, and <hi>Hurt.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
to repel thoſe Enemies which are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to <hi>them</hi> and <hi>me,</hi> and ſtoutly to oppoſe
them both in my perſon, by my Servants,
and all others of my People and Nation:
For ſince I am ſet over them, I ought to
preſerve and defend them from all adverſity,
and that no evil touch them before it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
mine, who labour in the ſame work.
I promiſe farther to free them from thoſe
burthens which Confederates ſuffer, either
by Loans of Money, or Impoſitions; ſo
that they ſhall be obliged to pay nothing
but what they pleaſe, and no moleſtation or
injury ſhall be offered them herein.</p>
            <p>A Biſhop ſhall not be removed from his
Dioceſs, or a Chriſtian compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his Faith, or a Monk his Profeſſion,
or a Pilgrim diſturbed in his Pilgrimage, or
a religious man in his <hi>Cell:</hi> Nor ſhall their
Churches be deſtroyed, or converted into
Moſchs; for whoſoever doth ſo break this
Covenant of God, oppoſes the Meſſenger
of God, and fruſtrates the divine Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
No Impoſitions ſhall be laid upon
<hi>Friars</hi> or Biſhops, nor any of them who are
not liable to Taxes, unleſs it be with their
own conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:94943:58"/>
And as to great Merchants, Fiſhers of
Pearls, Miners of precious ſtones, Gold and
Silver, and all other rich and opulent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
they ſhall not pay above twelve ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
yearly; and it ſhall alſo be from thoſe
who are conſtant Inhabitants of the place,
and not from Travellers and men of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
abode; for they ſhall not be ſubject to
Impoſitions or Contributions, unleſs they
are poſſeſſors of Land or Eſtate; for he
which is lawfully ſubject to pay money to
the Emperour, ſhall pay as much as another
and not more, nor more required from
him above his faculty and ſtrength. In like
manner, he that is taxed for his <hi>Land, Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
or Revenue, ſhall not be burthened im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately,
nor oppreſſed with greater
Taxes than any others that pay Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall the Confederates be obliged to
go to <hi>War</hi> with the <hi>Muſulmins</hi> againſt their
Enemies, either to fight or diſcover their
Armies, becauſe it is not of duty to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
to be employed in Military Affairs;
but rather this Compact is made with them,
that they may be the leſs oppreſſed; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Muſulmin</hi> ſhall watch and ward
and defend them. And therefore that they
be not compelled to go forth to fight, or
encounter the Enemy, or finde Horſe or
Arms, unleſs they voluntarily furniſh them:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94943:59"/>
And be who ſhall thus willingly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
ſhall be recompenſed and rewarded.
No <hi>Muſulmin</hi> ſhall infeſt the Chriſtians, nor
contend with them in any thing but in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but treat them with all courteſie, and
abſtain from all oppreſſion or violence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them.</p>
            <p>If any Chriſtian commit a crime or fault,
it ſhall be the part of the <hi>Muſulmin</hi> to aſſiſt
him, intercede, and give caution for him,
and compound for his miſcarriage; liberty
ſhall alſo be given him to redeem his life.
Nor ſhall he be forſaken, nor deſtitute of
help, becauſe of the Divine Covenant which
is with them, That they ſhould enjoy what
the <hi>Muſulmins</hi> enjoy, and ſuffer what they
ſuffer.</p>
            <p>And according to this Covenant, which
is by the Chriſtians juſt requeſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that endeavour which is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for confirmation of its Authority,
you are obliged to protect them from all
calamity, and perform all Offices of good
will toward them, ſo that the <hi>Muſulmin</hi>
may be ſharers with them in proſperity and
adverſity.</p>
            <p>Moreover, all care ought to be had, that
no violence be offered to them, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
relating to Marriage, <hi>viz.</hi> That they
compell not the Parents to match their
Daughters with <hi>Muſulmin:</hi> Nor ſhall they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94943:59"/>
be moleſted for refuſal either to give a
Bridegroom, or a Bride; for this is an act
wholly voluntary, depending on their free
will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But if it happen that a Chriſtian woman
ſhall joyn with a <hi>Muſulmin,</hi> he is obliged
to give her liberty of Conſcience in her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and that ſhe may obey her <hi>Ghoſtly
Father,</hi> and be inſtructed in the <hi>Doctrines</hi>
of her <hi>Faith</hi> without impediment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſhall not diſquiet her, either by
threatning divorce, or by ſollicitations to
forſake her Faith; but if he ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
hereunto, and moleſt her herein, he
deſpiſes the Covenant of God, rebels againſt
the Compact of the Meſſenger of God, and
is entred into the number of liars.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when Chriſtians would repair
their Churches, or Convents, or any thing
elſe appertaining to their Worſhip, and have
need of the liberality and aſſiſtance of the
<hi>Muſulmins</hi> hereunto, they ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
and freely to beſtow according to
their ability; not with intention to receive
it again, but <hi>gratis;</hi> and as a good will
toward their Faith, and to fulfil the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Meſſenger of God, conſidering
the obligation they have to perform the
Covenant of God, and the Compact of the
Meſſenger of God. Nor ſhall they oppreſs
any of them living amongſt the <hi>Muſulmin</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:94943:60"/>
nor hate them, nor compel them to carry
<hi>Letters,</hi> or ſhew the way, or any other
manner force them: For he who exerciſes
any manner of this Tyranny againſt them,
is an oppreſſor, and an adverſary to the
Meſſenger of God, and refractory to his
Precepts.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Covenants agreed between
<hi>Mahumed</hi> the Meſſenger of God, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
But the Conditions on which I
binde theſe Covenants on their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
are theſe:</p>
            <p>That no Chriſtian give any entertainment
to a Souldier Enemy to the <hi>Muſulmin,</hi> or
receive in his Houſe publickly or privately.
That they receive none of the Enemies of
the <hi>Muſulmin</hi> as Sojourners into their
Houſes, Churches, or Religious Convents,
nor underhand furniſh the Camp of their
Enemies with Arms, <hi>Horſe, Men;</hi> or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any correſpondence or intercourſe with
them by contracts or writing; but betaking
themſelves to ſome certain place of abode,
ſhall attend to the preſervation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and to the defence of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>To any <hi>Muſulmin</hi> and his Beaſts they
ſhall give three days entertainment with
variety of meat; and moreover ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94943:60"/>
to defend them from misfortune
and trouble. So that if any <hi>Muſulmin</hi>
ſhall be deſirous or be compelled to
conceal himſelf in any of their houſes
or habitations, they ſhall friendly hide
him, and deliver him from the danger he is
in, and not betray him to the Enemy.</p>
            <p>And in this manner the Chriſtians per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Faith on their ſide, whoſoever vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
any of theſe Conditions, and doth
contrarily, ſhall be deprived of the benefits
contained in the Covenant of God and his
Meſſenger. Nor ſhall he deſerve to enjoy
thoſe Priviledges indulged to Biſhops and
Chriſtian-Monks, and to the believers of the
contents of the Alcoran.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I do <hi>conjure</hi> my people by
God and his Prophet, to maintain theſe
things faithfully, and fulfil them in what part
ſoever of the world they are; and the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
of God ſhall recompence them for the
ſame: The perpetual obſervation whereof he
ſeriouſly recommends to them, until the day
of Judgment and diſſolution of the world.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Conditions which <hi>Mahumed</hi> the
Meſſenger of God hath agreed with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and hath enjoy'd, the witneſſes were,

            <p>This is the Covenant which <hi>Mahumed</hi>
made in favour of the Chriſtians; and
though the Turks deny the truth thereof,
yet it is by very good Authors taken for
real. And if the condition of <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
affairs be conſidered at the time when this
Covenant is ſaid to have been made by
him, there will be the leſs temptation to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
its Authority: For in the fourth of
the <hi>Hegira</hi> he was at war with the <hi>Arabians,</hi>
and his Kingdome in no good poſture; but
like the infancy of all new-erected Empires,
weak and infirm: And to prevent his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

by this politick Compact.</p>

over a Tribe among the <hi>Hagarens,</hi> being
Catechized or inſtructed by the <hi>Orthodox</hi> or

whom <hi>Severus</hi> ſent two Biſhops, on purpoſe
to draw him to his own Hereſie; who telling
him that the two Natures of Chriſt were
confuſed into one, he replyed, that then the
Divinity of Chriſt ſuffer'd with his humane
fleſh: And being willing to convince the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94943:62"/>
two Biſhops of the Abſurdity of ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
he appointed one of his Servants in

in his ear; upon which <hi>Almander</hi>
feigned himſelf exceeding ſad, and began to
look dejected. The Biſhops demanded the
cauſe, and what it was that wrought in his
countenance ſo ſuddain a change. He told
them, that <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel was very
lately dead. The Biſhops told him, the news
was certainly falſe, and that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for an Angel to dye. To whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
If an Angel cannot dye, for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
do ye affirm that the Deity can ſuffer
and dye, being conjoined and mixt with
fleſh, and with it made into one Nature?</p>
            <p>But to return. <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Solemn League
and Covenant with the Chriſtians, may with
good reaſon be numbred among the Artifices
made uſe of by that <hi>Great Politique,</hi> to aſſiſt
his Infant Empire: which as ſoon as he ſaw
grown ſtrong, he wrote the Chapter of the
Sword, and another of the Battel, where all
his promiſes of Toleration and Indulgence to
the Chriſtians in their Religion, was changed
to a harſher ſtyle: And now it was, <hi>Cut

enſlave them until you think ſit to grant them

            <p>And yet notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Gabriel

            <argument>
               <p>That Mahumed's carriage to the Jews
and Arabians might be a help to
nouriſh up his Infant Sect.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>MAhumed</hi>'s pretended Friendſhip to
the Chriſtians was not more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to his <hi>Sect,</hi> than his Enmity againſt
the Jews, whom he looked upon as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
perfidious people, whom God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with <hi>wants</hi> and ſhame; and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſpeaks of them as of Beggars and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds:
and becauſe of their obſtinate
adherence to the <hi>legal Ceremonies,</hi> he by
way of ſcorn calls them, <hi>The people of the
Law.</hi> And we are told out of <hi>Al Baidawi</hi>'s
Commentaries upon the Alcoran, (who
died in the 692 year of the <hi>Hegira;</hi>) That
where-ever <hi>Mahumed</hi> uſeth theſe words,
<hi>The curſe of God be upon the Infidels, it is
to be underſtood of the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This his ſevere deportment towards the
Hebrews, ſome impute to his hatred of their
cruel dealing with the good men God ſent
unto them. And others again imagine it
was, the more cunningly to ingratiate with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94943:64"/>
the Chriſtians. But we need not herein
have recourſe to conjectures, ſeeing we
finde the Jews continually oppoſing his
Doctrine, and labouring to detect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him for a <hi>Cheat.</hi> Once (we read
how) ſome of the Jewiſh <hi>Prieſts</hi> coming to
<hi>Mahumed,</hi> told him, <hi>That there was a debate
hapned betwixt them and the people, and
that they had bound themſelves to ſtand to
his award; and that if he would give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
againſt the people, they would become
his Proſelytes, and by their Example draw
many to his Sect.</hi> But <hi>Mahumed</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their deſigne, ſent them away with
threatnings to be revenged of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
At another time a Jewiſh Damſel
went about to poyſon him, and the Jews
every where diſputed againſt his <hi>Principles;</hi>
which was pretence enought to an imperious
proud Impoſtor, of being ſevere againſt ſuch
an unarmed and unwarlike Generation as
the Jews were at that time.</p>
            <p>As to the Pagan <hi>Arabians,</hi> he treated
them with other Stratagems. He found,
as he often calls them, <hi>Sufeha,</hi> an Ignorant,
Beaſtly, and Idolatrous Nation, viod of all
Learning and ingenuous Education; to
whom <hi>Mahumed</hi> diſcovered the vanity of
their Idolatry, and the inſignificancy of the
Idols they worſhipped: and gave them
likewiſe to underſtand, that they ought to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94943:64"/>
worſhip the Great God of Heaven and
Earth, who was the onely true God, who
made all things; who cauſed Rain to fall
from Heaven, and fruits to proceed from the
Earth; who cauſed men to die, and after
death to riſe again; to reward every man
according to his deſerts with Glory or
Puniſhment: That God had created the
<hi>Paradiſes,</hi> with many excellent things, for
the <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> with numberleſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for the <hi>Damned.</hi> All which were
denied by the Idolatrous <hi>Arabians,</hi> upon
whom he ſo wrought by fearful and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
inculcations of theſe things, that at
laſt numbers of them embraced his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tcrine.
And the more to endear theſe his
new Proſelytes, (meaſuring theirs by his
own libidinous humour) he indulged them
all manner of Carnal and filthy enjoyments;
which, I doubt not, was a winning conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to that rude and blockiſh people, and
a fit Engine to inſinuate his Religion into
their embrutiſht mindes. And we need not
ſuſpect the truth of what is ſpoken, or doubt
that <hi>Mahumed</hi> granted his Diſciples a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
freedom in this life; ſeeing the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

            <argument>
               <p>Of Mahumed's Paradiſes.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>GOd, ſaith the Alcoran, created ſeven
Habitations, each of which is called
a Paradiſe. They are wrought with Gold,
Silver, Pearls, and precious Stones: It hath
divers ſtately Edifices, Gardens, and divers
Fruit-trees, two ſorts of each: There are
ſeveral Fountains and Rivers of cool Waters,
Milk, Honey, and moſt ſweet Wine. In
the midſt of this Paradiſe there is a vaſtly
big Tree, with leaves of Gold and Silver,
the branches whereof cover the walls of
Paradiſe: In every leaf of this Tree the
Name of <hi>Mahumed</hi> is inſcribed together
with the Name of God, in this known A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement
of Mahumediſm, <hi>Le ilehe ille
allah Muhamed razalo allah</hi> (as the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Alfaqui Andreas Maurus</hi> writes it, <hi>lib.
Confuſ. Sect.</hi> Mahumed, <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) <hi>i. e. There
is no other God but the Lord, and</hi> Mahumed
<hi>his Meſſenger.</hi> The ornaments and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of theſe Paradiſes are to be collected
out of ſeveral Chapters of the Alcoran;
wherein is to be ſeen how the Moors are to
have their <hi>Silks,</hi> Purples, <hi>Tapeſtries,</hi> Tiſſues,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94943:65"/>
Brocado's, for Curtains, Vallens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their
Beverage ſhall be a ſort of Water whiter
than Snow, and ſweet as the Honey-comb.
Here the Moors ſhall have delight without
care, and continually be <hi>merry</hi> and <hi>jocund.</hi>
They ſhall have their <hi>Guildemin Mohalledun,</hi>
Pages to wait upon them clothed in Tiſſues,
and ſurpaſſing in beauty; who have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
employment but to be Cup-bearers to
the <hi>Muſulmin.</hi> Here are alſo the <hi>Horhin,</hi>
Virgins ſumptuous in apparel, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as the light. Theſe are not of humane
race, but continually created. Theſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
live recluſe, and are made on purpoſe

ſpeaks ſuch uncouth filthineſs, as may not

            <argument>
               <p>Of Mahumed's Miracles.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THough the things <hi>Mahumed</hi> indulged
his Followers in this life, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them in the next, were certainly very
taking with the ſottiſh and Idolatrous <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi>
and a very proper inſtrument to
ſeduce them to his party: Yet with thoſe
who were of a more awakened Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
he was forced to deal in another
Method. And becauſe he was often urged
to do Wonders, like <hi>Noah, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
and to confirm the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of his
Apoſtleſhip by expreſs Miracles, he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
theſe following to have hapned to
him.</p>
            <p>1. That in his Infancy (as was ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove)
the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> launced his
Stomach, and pulled out his Heart, and
took thence the black Coar, which is the
ſeat of temptations, and inſtantly put up
his heart again. <hi>Mahumed</hi> not ſuffering the
leaſt <hi>diſeaſe</hi> or pain.</p>
            <p>2. That going with the Caravan, and one
day it chancing to be very hot, a Cloud
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94943:66"/>
ſettled over <hi>Mahumed</hi>'s head, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed,
and went along with him, to
ſave him from the violent heat.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Mahumed</hi> (as he may well) reckons it
for a Miracle, that <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſhould come and
ſalute him in the Cave, and begin to deliver
him the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. A fourth Miracle was, that of the
Beaſts, Birds and Stones ſaluting him, as one
evening he came from the <hi>Cave,</hi> and told
him expreſly, that he was the Meſſenger of
God. To which he addes, that in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
there lying the trunk of a tree, and
<hi>Mahumed</hi> being ready to ſtep aſide, the
tree cleft aſunder in the midſt, ſo that he
went thorow it; and aſſoon as he was gone,
the tree grew together again as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>5. Another Miracle was the coming of
the trees to ſhadow him, and after they
had performed that office, at his command
to return to their places. In the <hi>Sunè</hi> this
Miracle (ſaith <hi>Jo. Andr. Maurus</hi>) is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahumed</hi> being one day uncovered in the
fields, he had occaſion to untruſs, during
which the Sun ſhone ſo hot on his head, that
he was all in a ſweat; whereupon he looked
towards certain Trees which were far from
him, and called them to come and ſhadow
him; upon which two Trees tore up the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94943:67"/>
earth with their roots, and came to the
place where <hi>Mahumed</hi> was, and made him
an Arbour; and having done their office,
at <hi>Mahumed</hi>'s command they returned to
their places, and the earth cloſed up their
roots again.</p>
            <p>6. Another Miracle was the weeping of
the trunk of a Palm-tree: which I finde
thus related:</p>
            <p>When <hi>Mahumed</hi> was ready to leave <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and go to <hi>Medina,</hi> he had a dry trunk
of a Palm-tree in his houſe; which on the
night of his <hi>Alhegira,</hi> or <hi>Baniſhment</hi> from
<hi>Mecca,</hi> was very moiſt; whereupon he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Moors,</hi> and deſired them to ſee a
great Miracle. The <hi>Moors</hi> anſwer'd, that
they deſired nothing more than to ſee Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
then he brought them where the trunk
lay, and bad them touch it with their hands,
and ſee how it wept for <hi>Mahumed</hi>'s depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>7. But his greateſt Miracle was the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Moon, as is intimated in a
Chapter of the Alcoran, bearing that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
Upon which a Commentary thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the whole Story: One night an Uncle
of <hi>Mahumed</hi> promiſed that he would turn
<hi>Muſulman,</hi> and believe him for a Prophet,
if he would make the <hi>Moon</hi> come to the
midſt of Heaven, and be in the Full, which
was then but newly Changed, and divide it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94943:67"/>
ſelf into two equal parrs, and come out of
Heaven to the Earth, and the two pieces to
go, the one through the hole of one of
<hi>Mahumed</hi>'s ſleeves, and the other piece
through the hole of the other, and both
pieces to come out at the collar of his Coat,
utttering theſe words, Mahumed <hi>is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of God;</hi> and then to joyn together,
and return to Heaven where it was at firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahumed</hi> (ſaith the Legend) prayed God
to aſſiſt him with his Divine Power to do all
that his Uncle demanded. And the Story
ſaith, that the Moon preſently, at <hi>Mahumed</hi>'s
requeſt, came to the midſt of Heaven, and
divided it ſelf, and deſcended, and did as
is above-mentioned. But all this was
no whit prevailing upon <hi>Mahumed</hi>'s Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
who charged him for a Conjurer,
and imputed to Negromancy, what his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
pretended to be done by the Divine
Power: which occaſioned thoſe words in
the Chapter of the Moon, <hi>The wicked ſay,
it was a manifeſt Forgery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the greateſt of <hi>Mahumed's</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and the moſt authentique among the
<hi>Moors;</hi> though numbers more are related
to have been done by him; of all which, not
one witneſs is produced, nor any reaſon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that might move him to perform them.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>IF we look into the condition of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity

the times immediately antecedent</hi>
Diocletian'<hi>s Perſecution, ſaith,</hi> That through
too much liberty the affairs of the Church
began to degenerate into Softneſs and Sloath;
and Chriſtians fell to perſecute one another
with hatred and contumelies, and mutually
to wound themſelves with petulant Tongues:
the people minded nothing but bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives,
railings, calumnies and reproaches.
The Governors of the Church claſhing with,
and oppugning one another, drew the <hi>Laity</hi>
into ſeditious practiſes. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder a ſhew of
holineſs, the moſt abominable depravities
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94943:69"/>
were committed, and all manner of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was acted under the pretence of Religion.
The Aſſemblies of Chriſtians grew cold, thin,
and ſeldom: And when God ſeemed to have
a deſigne to open their eyes by the perſecution
rais'd againſt the Chriſtian Souldiers that were
under <hi>Veturius,</hi> yet they were not at all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
moved, nor took the leaſt care to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
Gods wrath, or render him propitious;
but as if they thought the Almighty had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
no notice of their ſins, they went on
therein without remorſe, adding new to old.

nothing but haughtineſs and pride, and like
Tyrants to ſuppreſs each other.</p>
            <p>This was the miſerable condition of the
Church at the entrance of the fourth Age:
and to this purpoſe alſo we find <hi>Hermias So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen</hi>
writing [in <hi>Prooem. Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi>]
where he apologizeth for himſelf in taking
notice of the Seditious among Eccleſiaſtick
perſons about Primacy and Prelation; and
with due reſentment recounts the litigious
diſputations which were hotly purſued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretext of Holineſs, and a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of God, to the bitter diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the Church; thoſe things being
then made matter of controverſie, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were never queſtioned. <hi>Sozomen Hiſt.

betwixt <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> about the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Oecumenical Biſhop, which hapned
about the time of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> is too noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to need to be enlarged upon.</p>
            <p>But to come a little nearer; <hi>Arabia,</hi>
where <hi>Mahumed</hi> firſt appeared, was faln
under the peſt of Heretical Doctrines, which
began in <hi>Beryllus</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Boſtri;</hi> who
that he might pervert the Eccleſiaſtick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
fell into various Opinions about the
<hi>Divinity</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Soul. And though by the
pains of <hi>Origen</hi> he was reduced, yet the
ſpawn of his Hereſie was not quite dri'd up in
<hi>Mahumed</hi>'s time. <hi>Euſebius</hi> intimates their
Heterodox opinions, <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi>
36. out of which Hiſtorian St. <hi>Aug.</hi> (in his
Treatiſe of Hereſies) obſerves, that the
<hi>Arabians</hi> generally held, that humane Souls
periſh with their Bodies, and like them
ſhould be raiſed at the laſt. And <hi>Danaeus</hi>
ſaith, in his Commentaries upon that Book,
how <hi>Arabia,</hi> as alſo its Neighbour <hi>Egypt,</hi>
was always fruitful in Hereſies: and as both
Countries have brought forth Serpents ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to mens bodies, ſo likewiſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
dangerous to their ſouls. But, what is
moſt remarkable to our purpoſe, at the very
time when <hi>Arabia</hi> was overſpread with the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94943:70"/>
Hereſies among Chriſtians, <hi>Mahumed</hi> laid
the foundation, and ſow'd the ſeeds of his
damnable Impoſture; as <hi>Danaeus</hi> obſerves,
in his Comment. in <hi>Auguſt. de Haereſ.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Collyridians</hi> (ſo called from <hi>Collyris,</hi>
or the wreathed bread which they offered
to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>) were at the riſe of
<hi>Mahumed</hi> very numerous and prevailing;
who, by giving divine honours to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Lady, brought no little diſrepute to
Chriſtianity, by giving <hi>Mahumed</hi> (and his
Partizans) occaſion to think it guilty of
Idolatry; the great ſin he at firſt ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
preach'd againſt. But it had been
well the <hi>Collyridians</hi> had been the onely
Sect which gave <hi>Mahumed</hi> opportunity to
oppoſe Chriſtianity. For there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, ſuch as the <hi>Jacobites, Neſtorians,
Melchites,</hi> &amp;c. who ſerved to increaſe the
cry, and which made him ſo often upbraid
Chriſtian Religion with the Diviſion of its
Profeſſors; who were ſo ſeparate in their
Opinions, that <hi>Mahumed</hi> thought them to
be no better than a <hi>medley of Fanaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this troubled ſtate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity

            <p>IT would be too bold an intruſion into
the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of Providence, to enquire
why God ſhould ſuffer this monſtrous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor,
from ſo contemptible a beginning,
to grow up to be a ſcourge and diſturber
of the <hi>whole world;</hi> which with moſt ſafety
is to be aſcribed to His Power and Wiſdom,
who makes the worſt of men ſerviceable
to his Providence, in making them the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners
of his anger, which we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
was now fearfully incenſed againſt
<hi>thoſe</hi> who had ſo undutifully prevaricated the
Heavenly Rule of good life, and had no leſs
violated the unity of the Goſpel by Schiſm,
through their want of Charity, than they
had proſtituted the Faith thereof through
Hereſie, for lack of Truth. At the firſt
opening of <hi>Mahumediſm, Arabia Foelix</hi> was
over-run with all ſorts of falſe Religions,
and the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of Chriſtianity were then
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94943:71"/>
very negligent in making Proſelytes; and
ſo far from labouring the converſion of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jew or Pagan to the <hi>moſt holy</hi> Faith,
that not a few of them had in effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<hi>it</hi> themſelves; having not onely
called in queſtion, but flatly denied the
<hi>Divinity of the Son of God:</hi> And thoſe who
were not infected with that damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
were yet tainted with other Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
opinions, which made them ſo factious
and unquiet, that they gave occaſion to the
Infidels to ſcoff at them, when they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be the Subjects of <hi>one</hi> whom they
ſtiled <hi>The Prince of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Heraclius</hi> was grown ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
and negligent in the affairs of both
Religion and Empire. He was become alſo
a mighty favourer of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> having
been ſeduced to that Hereſie by the crafty
inſinuations of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> their Patriarch. He
was likewiſe ſo mightily faln in the eſteem
of the <hi>world,</hi> that when he ſent Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
to make a peace with <hi>Choſroe,</hi> the
haughty Infidel treated them much below
their Character; and at laſt diſmiſs'd them
with this ſcornful anſwer: <hi>That unleſs</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius
<hi>would renounce the cruciſi'd Galilean,
whom he worſhipped as God, and worſhip the
Sun, he would treat no further with him.</hi>
He was moreover wholly given up to the
Hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> which ſpruag
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94943:72"/>
out of the bitter root of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and
was the laſt of that long and wicked train
of Hereſies, which upon the contempt of
the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> exceedingly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
and ruined the Eaſt Church.</p>
            <p>Out of this Hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites</hi>
there were ſprung infinite extravagant bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which greatly deformed the Church,
renting its <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> with manifold Schiſms,
and wounding its <hi>Faith</hi> with as many He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies:
And God knows what would have
followed, if the Lord, whom they had won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
wronged by their wanton and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
conceits of him, had not, to ſtop the
courſe and ſtream of their wickedneſs and
folly, let looſe <hi>Mahumediſm</hi> to overwhelm
thoſe firſt, who firſt had moſt wrong'd the
Saviour of the world; puniſhing by this
violent and wicked <hi>Sect,</hi> the ſinful Diviſions
of Chriſtians: For we ſee that the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi>
Conqueſts at firſt chiefly ſeized on
thoſe <hi>Regions</hi> where Chriſtianity was moſt
peſtered with Hereſies.</p>
            <p>Nor was <hi>Heraclius</hi> more remiſs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Factions in the Church, than Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
in the <hi>State;</hi> but by his Exactions made
all ſorts of his Subjects ready to comply
with any Pretender to free them from their
preſent preſſure. He had made the Jews
his implacable Enemies, by his new cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94943:72"/>
being grown unmercifully ſevere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, after the Magician had warned
him to beware of the <hi>Circumciſed Nation.</hi>
And as to the Chriſtians, their Inteſtine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
were ſo great and many, and the
Emperour a Patron of the worſt, that they
were in the next diſpoſition for a Rebellion.
And in this troubled juncture of affairs
<hi>Mahumed</hi> appeared, promiſing, as ſome ſay,
to reconcile all <hi>differences</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi>
and to remove all oppreſſions in civil <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
pretences not more ſpecious, than
neceſſary to be made good. But his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
was very unprobable, while he left all
to the deciſion of the Sword. And indeed,
the ſucceſs of his Arms was the chief cauſe
of the ſpreading of his Doctrine; it having
ever been the condition of the Conquered,
to follow for the moſt part the Religion of
the Conquerours. And I cannot but here
tell the Reader, that the preſent <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans</hi>
make the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of their Prophets
<hi>Arms,</hi> and <hi>ſpreading</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the chief
proofs and arguments of the truth of his
Miſſion and Revelations. But enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the cauſes of the enlargement of <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediſm,</hi>
to thoſe already-mentioned, we
may adde the Impoſtor's ſtrict prohibition of
all Diſputes concerning his Doctrine, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
any point thereof into queſtion. Next,
the keeping his Proſelytes in ignorance, by a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94943:73"/>
ſuppreſſion of the ſtudy of Philoſophy: for
by putting out this light, he left them deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of all manner of diſcovering the groſneſs
and vanity of his <hi>Poſitions.</hi> And laſtly, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Liberty allow'd by <hi>Mahumed,</hi> may be due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accounted among the main cauſes of the
advancement of his Impoſture: for he did not
grant his Sectaries only in this life a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<hi>filthineſs</hi> and carnality, but he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them the like in Paradiſe, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned: And men (we know) are
more allured and perſwaded with ſenſual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
whereof they have certain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
than with the promiſes of ſpiritual
delights, preſented only to their hopes, and
for which, preſent and ſenſible pleaſures muſt
in the mean time be forſaken. But by what
means ſoever <hi>Mahumediſm</hi> was at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted,
we find a learned perſon upon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
calculation of <hi>Mahumedans</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
making the former exceed the latter
in proportion of <hi>Six</hi> to <hi>Five.</hi>
