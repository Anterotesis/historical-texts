            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Ile tell you a tale: Two spruce hot-spurre fiery gallants meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ith streets, iustled for the wall, drew, would he been fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
there steps mee forth a correcter of soles, an vnderlaid
cobler, and cries out, Hold, hold your hands Gentlemen, are
you so simple to fight for the wall? why the wall's my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords.
Haue you but so much wit as to apply this, you shall
neuer neede fence for the matter. Superioritie is mine, Ale

Wine and Beere are faine to take vp a corner, your ambition
goes no further then a Celler, where the whole house where
I am is mine, goes onely by my name, is cald an Alehouse;
but when is either heard, the Wine-house, or the Beere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house?

Oh impudence, that either of you should talke of houses,

I? why I haue ouerthrowne armies, how easie is it

               <p>Not in my Beard, I speake without mentall reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Ile tell you, and you shall confesse it: the Wise men of
ancient time were called Sages, and to this day it signifies
iudgment, discretion, grauitie; for by what other would
you excite to good manners more aptly, then to shew a young
man to bee sage, that is graue: and with what title can you
better salute him that is graue, or more honour him, then to
call him one of the Sages? Now this appellation neither of
you can challenge, yet euery man giueth mee the attribute;
for who knowes not I am called Sage Ale?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ale.</speaker>
               <p>And thus hauing giuen you sufficient reasons for
your acknowledgment of my principalitie, let your knees
witnesse your obedience to your King, and I will grace you
both by making you Squires of my body, right honorable
Ale-Squires.</p>

               <speaker>Wine.</speaker>

               <p>You Beere, shall bee in most grace with the Citizens, as

pace of their owne, <hi>Bos lassus fortius figit pedem,</hi> The black
Oxe has trod vpon their foot: yet I bound you not with the
Citie, though it bee the common entertainement, you may
bee in credit with Gentlemens Cellars, and carry reputation
before you from March to Christmas—tide I should say; that
Water should forget his Tide.</p>
               <p>You Ale I remit to the Countrie as more fit to liue where
you were bred: your credit shall not be inferiour, for people
of all sorts shall desire youre acquaintance, specially in the
morning, though you may be allowed all the day after: the
Parson shall account you one of his best Parishioners, &amp; the
Church wardens shall pay for your companie, and drawing
their Bills all the yeere long, you shall bee loued and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at the Parish charge till you be old, bee allowed a
