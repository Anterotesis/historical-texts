         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In raysing vp Prophets vnto them in their captiuity, when as otherwise they might haue complained with the Psalmist, <hi>O</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 74. 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>God, wherefore art thou absent from vs so long, and why is thy wrath so kindled against the sheepe of thy pasture? we see not our tokens, there is not one Prophet more, no not one is there among vs that vnderstandeth any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <note n="l" place="margin">Caluin</note> For that he sent not one or two, but many: the number is plurall, comfort <hi>ye,</hi> speake <hi>ye,</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Psalm. 68. 11.</note> the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his word, great was the number of the Preachers.</p>
               <p>3. For that he called not all his Prophets at once, but at sundry times according to the Churches exigence. Wherefore <note n="n" place="margin">Musculus, Caluin.</note> some read not as our translation here, <hi>saith your God</hi> in the present; but in the future, <hi>will your God say:</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Geneuaglosse.</note> Signifying hereby that God will in all ages to come so prouide for his Church, as that it shall neuer be destitute of Prophets; and so we finde in holy Bible that he stirred vp <hi>Daniel, Haggai, Malachi, Zachariah, Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and other (vntill the comming of Christ himselfe the <note n="p" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 54.</note> chiefe shepheard) who did alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort his people <hi>to be of good comfort,</hi> and to <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 4. 18.</note> hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hope, so <hi>Zacharias</hi> in his hymne; Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people, raysing vp the horne of saluation vnto vs, <hi>as he spake by the mouth of all his Prophets which haue beene</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:25369:3"/>
                  <hi>since the world began. So S. Peter</hi> in his Sermon <hi>adpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum,</hi> Acts 3. 24. <hi>All the Prophets from Samuel, and thence forth as many as haue spoken haue likewise foretold of these dayes;</hi> and to Cornelius, Acts 10. 43. <hi>To him all the Prophets giue witnesse, that through his name all that beleeue in him shall receiue remission of sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The <note n="r" place="margin">Hyperius, Musculus.</note> doubling and tripling of this charge to the Prophets (<hi>comfort ye, comfort ye, speake ye comfortably</hi>) expresseth as it were the very bowels of compassion in God, as if he could not endure that his people should suffer any more misery, giuing them also further assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he will euer be their God, euen in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test aduersity, when as they seeme to bee swallowed vp of death and desperation, and that they shall be still his Hierusalem and his people, <hi>your God</hi> will say comfort <hi>my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Prophets office, God in this charge requireth on their part that they <hi>speake comfortably to his Hierusalems heart:</hi> Yet here you must obserue with <note n="s" place="margin">Ecclesiast. 3. 1.</note> Ecclesiastes, that <hi>there is a time for all things;</hi> a time for admonition, a time for reprehension, a time for consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a time <note n="t" place="margin">Esay 58. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>to shew Gods people their transgression, and to the house of Iacob their sinnes;</hi> as well as a time to tell Hierusalem in distresse that <hi>her trauell is ended, and her iniquity pardoned;</hi> a time saith our Prophet <note n="u" place="margin">Esay 5.</note> elsewhere, to denounce <hi>woe to such as iustify the wicked</hi> for a reward; a time to denounce <hi>woe to such as speake good of euill, and euill of good;</hi> a time to denounce <hi>woe to such as follow drunkennesse, and are strong to powre in strong drinke.</hi> And assuredly (beloued) the Prophets haue iust occasion in this age to cry out against such <note n="x" place="margin">Amos 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>as are at ease in Sion,</hi> making (as <note n="y" place="margin">Philip. 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> speakes) <hi>their belly their God,</hi> and their gullet their glory. For swinish, idle, base drunkennesse heretofore scorned as the beggers fault, is now reputed (among moe then a good many) not only the seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans complement, but also the gentlemans grace. God as hauing <note n="z" place="margin">Ezech. 33. 11.</note>

desire to haue the coalcs of his wrath quenched with the teares of our repentance, commandeth his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the dayes of securitie, to sound out the threats of his seuerity, denouncing a woe before woe, that is a woe of instruction, before there come the woe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. For albeit <hi>the</hi>

               <p>The vse of this doctrine is manifold. 1.

               <p>2. This may teach vs humility; for if Angels high and holy serue vs, let vs not thinke it any bad or base dutie to <note n="l" place="margin">Galat. 5. 13.</note> serue one another in loue.</p>

to be done: but when an Astronomer saith of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it shall not be cold, or hot, vpon such a moneth or day, he doth not forbid, but onely foretell a thing that shall not be: so the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are vsed Apocalip. 10. 6. and 22. 5. According to this twofold acception I finde a twofold construction of this clause (<hi>but yee not so</hi>) first, by way of prophecie; secondly, by way of proposition or prohibition: if it be taken Prophetically, then it is a prophecie concerning the disciples estate either in this, or in the world to come. If in this life, the meaning is briefly this, <hi>the kings of the Gentiles doe raigne, and they that are in authoritie are called benefactors; but ye not so:</hi> that is, I doe foreshew vnto you that ye shall not be so; as if he should say, they in their gouernement are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led benefactors, but you exercising authoritie shall be called malefactors: they ruling ill are called good men, ye ruling well shall be reputed euill men: <note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 16. 33.</note> in the world ye shall haue affliction, and ye must of necessitie drinke of my cup, and be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized with, and so Christ is made to speake that in this place which he saith <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 20.</note> elsewhere, <hi>The disciple is not aboue his master, nor the seruant aboue his Lord: if they haue called the master of the house Belzebub, how much more them of his household.</hi> If they haue persecuted me, they will also persecute you: me, who came to minister vnto them, and to giue my life for them; euen so you, which in your authoritie shall intend the good of all, and spend your liues in seruing them all. This sense doubtles is true, for by wofull experience we finde it to be so, when as <note n="p" place="margin">See dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous positions vnder pretence of reformation lib. 2. cap. 5. 7. 8. 10. 11. 12. 13.</note> among vs some for their superioritie, are called Antichrists; other for their authoritie, tyrants; other for restraining the licentiousnesse of certaine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious people, persecutors.</p>
               <p>If we take (<hi>but yee not so</hi>) for a Prophecie touching the life to come, the meaning is, <hi>the kings of the Gentiles haue lordship ouer them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ye not so:</hi> that is, in my kingdome (which you falsely conceiue to bee vpon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:25369:39"/>
earth) I doe foretell vnto you, that it shall not bee so.

All that may be gathered hence then is, that the Kings of the Gentiles assumed flattering titles vnto themselues, being indeed nothing lesse then that which their stiles imported; and it may be a good admonition for all men, especially for Clergie men, to frame their liues answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their names and titles of honour giuen vnto them. An ambitious desire to be called <hi>benefactor</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited here, but the name it selfe is commendable, for Saint <hi>Peter</hi> applieth it vnto Christ, Acts 10. 38. <hi>Iesus of Nazareth went about doing good,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth<note n="h" place="margin">

               <p>As for <hi>ruling,</hi> we say that it is against all sense, that where the titles of rulers are giuen, there ruling should be denyed: nay Christ in the wordes immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (<hi>he that is greatest among you, let him be as the</hi>

The celestiall spirits are not equall, the starres are not equall, the disciples themselues were not in all things equall.

               <p>Well then, if Christ here forebad neither titles of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, nor yet ruling it selfe whether it be ciuill or ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall: it remaines that he prohibited only <hi>so ruling,</hi> that is, such a tyrannicall kind of gouernment as the Gentile Kings vsed, and that ambitious desiring of the same which ruled in them. And indeed Christ often in the Gospell vseth to call backe those that are his from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and corrupt affections by the behauiour of the Gentiles, Mat. 6. 7. <hi>The Gentiles doe thinke that by their much babling they shall be heard, bee not ye therefore like vnto them,</hi> and in the same Chapter verse 31. 32. <hi>Take no thought, saying what shall we eate or what shall wee drinke, or wherewith shall we be clothed (for after all these things seeke the Gentiles) but seeke ye first the kingdome of God,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Thus haue I shewed what is said, let vs see now whom it concernes; it is certaine that Christ spake this vnto his Apostles only, but in them vnto some other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatiuely; the question is then here whether hee spake representatiuely to the whole Church, that is, all Christians; or else representatiuely to the ministers of the Church only. We say with <hi>Aretius, Bucer, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> in their commentaries vpon Mat. 20. That he doth vnderstand all Christians as wel lay men as Clergy men, and this also we proue by these reasons ensuing.</p>
               <p>1. Christ in this Chapter immediatly before, and also presently after, vsing this word <hi>you,</hi> and speaking vnto his Disciples and none but them (as in this place,) spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto them as representing the whole Church and not only the Ministers, as verse 19. <hi>This is my body, which is giuen for you;</hi> and verse 20. <hi>This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you,</hi> by <hi>you,</hi> though
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:25369:42"/>
it be spoken only to the Disciples, is not vnderstood the ministers only, for if Christs body were giuen, and his blood shed only for them, it would follow that none should be saued but Ministers, and that is contrary to the text <note n="m" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15.</note> elsewhere <hi>Christ died for all,</hi> againe verse 29. <hi>I appoint vnto you, as my father hath appointed vnto me, a kingdome.</hi> Where by <hi>you,</hi> he meanes all true Christians of whatsoeuer estate, quality, degree: for as <note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 1. 12.</note> many as receiued him and beleeued in his name, to them he gaue power to be the sonnes of God, and if they be sonnes and children of God, then heires also, Rom. 8. 17. So that if thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> haue any part in Christ and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then thou must also take some part of this text, thou must become as one of vs, and be numbred among these <hi>you,</hi> but ye not so.</p>
               <p>2. The opposition here which is betweene <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> doth euidently proue that it is spoken vnto the whole Church; as for example, <hi>the Kings of the Gentiles doe tyrannize ouer them,</hi> that is ouer the people: among them are Kings tyrannizing, and people tyrannized: <hi>but you not so,</hi> that is, I doe command that among you there should bee neither Kings tyrannizing, nor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tyrannized. It is thus with them, it shall not bee so with you Ministers, is no good opposition; it is thus with the Gentiles, <hi>it shall not be thus with you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> is a full and a fit <hi>antithesis,</hi> the like whereof is found, Mat. 6. 7. 8. 31. 32. Luke 12. 29. 30. 1. Thessal. 4. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>3. This place compared with that of Mat. chap. 23. vers. 8. 9. shewes plainly that it is spoken vnto the whole Church, for Christ in that place speaking of the same matter vseth a like forme of wordes, as for example, <hi>the scribes and the Pharisees are called Rabbi, &amp;c. but be not ye so called.</hi> Now that he deliuered this exhortation as well to the people as to the pastors, is apparent in the very first verse of the Chapter, <hi>then spake Iesus</hi> to the <hi>multitude, and to his Disciples.</hi> I will end this expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               </p>
               <p>Let vs examine therefore wherein we must be like to children, and wherein vnlike. First, We may not be like to children in <note n="e" place="margin">Theophylact.</note> ignorance, so <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor. 14. 20. <hi>In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice be yee children, but in vnderstanding men.</hi> 2. Not like to children in vnconstancie, <note n="f" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>wauering and carried about with euery wind of doctrine.</hi> 3. Not weake in faith as children; which are not able to discerne spirituall things for want of yeares of discretion. 4. Not like to children in <note n="g" place="margin">Heming. post. in festo Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</note> seeking after vntoward things, because their senses are not yet setled, our <note n="h" place="margin">Collos. 3. 2.</note> affections are to be set on things which are aboue, hauing our conuersation in <note n="i" place="margin">Philip. 3. 20.</note> Heauen, and therefore we may not imitate children in eating dirt, &amp; in padling in the mire. The child plaies with the light of the candle till his finger be burnt, and <note n="k" place="margin">Diez. con. 2. in festo Michael.</note> so the reprobate-wicked plaies with Hell fier, reputing it a fable, till at the last he comes to be tormented in that vnquenchable flame. The child doth esteeme an apple more then his fathers inheritance; so the witlesse worldling prefers things temporall in this life, before the things eternall in the kingdome of Heauen. In these childish humors and the like, we may not be like to children.</p>
               <p>But we must be like children, 1. As being <note n="l" place="margin">Clemens strom. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>mundi cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, sancti animo,</hi> chast in bodie, pure in mind. 2. Like to children in <note n="m" place="margin">Heming.</note> obedience, for good children stand not reasoning what manner of thing it is that their father
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:25369:58"/>
commands, but instantly they follow his will and word as their rule to work by. So faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> at Gods commandement was readie to sacrifice his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> he stood not arguing the case, the death of my child can doe no good vnto God, and it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure much euill vnto me, but rather he thought that it is my father in Heauen who commands, and I will obey.</p>
               <lg>

                  <l>But much more loath to breake his fathers will.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>3. Like to children in respect of merit, for as children can not boast of their owne deseruings against their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: euen so the followers of Christ may not brag of their merits before God, but acknowledge themselues to be babes, able to doe nothing without his fatherly fauour.</p>
               <p>4. As little children commit themselues altogether vnto the tuition of their parents and guardians: euen so Christians ought to <note n="o" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7.</note> cast all their care on Christ, as looking for euery good gift at his hand.</p>
               <p>5. Like to children as concerning <note n="p" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20.</note> malice, both <note n="q" place="margin">Culman.</note> 
                  <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentia &amp; ignoscentia:</hi> for as little children being iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red take not any reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, but only make complaint either to their father or mother: euen so, when any wrong vs we may not <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 12. 19.</note> auenge our selues in recompensing euill for euill, or <note n="s" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9.</note> rebuke for rebuke, but only complaine to God our father in Heauen, or to the Church our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on earth. It is written that vengeance belongs vnto God, and therefore we must humbly call vpon him in our persecutions, as the <note n="t" place="margin">Psalm. 35. 1.</note> Prophets did, <hi>O Lord, plead thou my cause with them that striue with me, and fight against them that fight against me.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I haue <note n="y" place="margin">Sir Ric. Barckley tract. of felicitie lib. 5. pag. 451.</note> read of a reuerend and religious Archbishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who (being a long time depraued, and in fine depriued of his dignities and office by two corrupt Cardinals his Iudges, and a false harted Aduocate his familiar friend) out of the bitternesse of his spirit made this appeal from them vnto the Lord of Heauen. <hi>God knoweth (vnto whom all things are naked) that I am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly condemned, yet I will not appeal here from your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for that I know yee shall sooner be beleeued in your lying, then I am in speaking the truth; and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this heauie censure for the rebellions of my youth and other sinnes; Neuerthelesse I appeal from your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Iudge eternall, and only wise, which is Christ Iesus, before whom I summon you. The Cardinals fell into a laughing, and said, That if he would goe before, they would follow. It hapned that the poore Bishop hauing withdrawen himselfe into a Monasterie dyed within a yeare and halfe after, and the Cardinals hearing thereof, in a scoffing manner said one to another, that they must goe seeke the Archbishop. Now within a few dayes after one of them was bloudily slaine, and the other grinding his teeth, eat vp his owne hands and dyed mad. And lastly the Iudas who betrayed him</hi> (I meane his false friend placed in his roome) <hi>was so mortally hated of all men for his sedition and crueltie, that being assaulted in a Monasterie, he was there butchered, and his carcase cast into the towne ditch, where lying three dayes, all sort of people both men and women vsed all maner of despite vpon it.</hi> An example verie remarkable, teaching vs not to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise one of these little ones, because in heauen their angles alway behold the face of our Father which is in Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, we may complaine to the Church our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in this present Chapter at the 17. verse, If thy brother trespassing against thee, will not vouchsafe to heare thy selfe alone, nor yet thy witnesses and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: <hi>Tell it to the Church.</hi> He that commits his cause to

               <p>Lastly like to children (as Christ expounds himselfe) in humblenesse and harmelesnesse. In humblenesse, v. 4. <hi>Whosoeuer humbleth himselfe as this child &amp;c.</hi> In harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse, vers. 6. <hi>Whosoeuer offendeth one of these little ones &amp;c.</hi> So <note n="a" place="margin">Ser. 10.</note> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>

                  <hi>Euthymius</hi> and other as well ancient as moderne writers. As <note n="d" place="margin">Iansen.

I say by grace, for euery good gift is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, descending from the Father of lights, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ here said not (as <note n="e" place="margin">Diez.</note> one notes) <hi>Nisi efficiatis vos sicut par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>All they which are drunken are not drunken with wine saith <note n="o" place="margin">Cap. 29. 9.</note>

               <p>There be three ranks of the Deuils poore.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Couetous.</item>
                  <item>Vaine-glorious.</item>
                  <item>Superstitious.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Couetous, who want euen that they haue, being as they are termed aptly the greatest <hi>Misers</hi> in the world, like the market horse laden with daintie cates, and yet feeds on thistles.</p>
               <p>The vaine-glorious, who to get a name, forget often their estate, as certaine Philosophers in old time (whom I will not name, because they did it for a name) cast all their goods into the Sea, least they should hinder their courses in the studies of philosophie. <hi>Nolebant censu abundare terreno, vt magis sensu abundarent suo,</hi> saith a <note n="o" place="margin">Iansen. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. cap. 39.</note> learned expositor vpon this text.

               <p>The Superstitious, as the popish Monks and Friars, who transported with a blind deuotion, abandoned all worldly possessions, and yet abounded in all riot and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse; <hi>Regulares gulares,</hi> they were more then men at their meat, lesse then women at their worke, saith <note n="p" place="margin">In coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Albertus</hi> duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> was wont to say, that he had three wonders in one Citie, namely three Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, <hi>For the Fryers of the first had children, and yet no wines: The Fryers of the second had a great deal of corne, and yet no land: The Fryers of the third abounded with moneys, and yet had no rent.</hi>

               <p>So then (as you see) the Deuils poore differ verie much one from another: for the Couetous haue the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; but not the free vse: the Superstitious haue the vse, but not the free possession: the Vaine-glorious vpon the point haue neither free vse, nor free possession of such worldly wealth as they desire, being all in their seuerall kinds exceeding poore.</p>
               <p>The third sort of poore are Gods poore, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with inward wants, and want also many times outward aboundance.
