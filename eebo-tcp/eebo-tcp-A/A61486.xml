         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>
                  <hi>Day</hi> sold, and pawn'd, and put off what he might,</l>
               <l>Though it were ne'er so dark <hi>Day</hi> wou'd be light:</l>
               <l>That he away with so much Rent should get,</l>
               <l>Though <hi>Day</hi> were light, 'twas no light matter yet.</l>
               <l>You had one <hi>Day</hi> a Tenant and wou'd fain</l>

No, Landlord, no; you now may truly say,</l>
               <l>And to your Cost too, you have lost a <hi>Day.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>By twy-light, <hi>Day</hi> is neither Day nor Night;</l>
               <l>What then? 'twixt both, he's an <hi>Hermaphrodite.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Day</hi> is departed in a Mist, I fear,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Day</hi> is broke, yet does not Day appear:</l>
               <l>His pale-face now does Day in Owl-light shrowd,</l>
               <l>Truth is, at present <hi>Day</hi>'s under a Cloud.</l>
               <l>If you wou'd meet with <hi>Day</hi> you must be wiser,</l>
               <l>And up betimes, for <hi>Day</hi>'s an early riser.</l>
               <l>Broad Day is early up, but you begin</l>
               <l>To rouze, and then broad Day is shutting in.</l>
               <l>From Sun to Sun, are the set-times of Pay,</l>
               <l>But you should have been up by break of Day:</l>
               <l>Yet, if you had? you had got nothing by't.</l>
               <l>For <hi>Day</hi> was Cunning, and broke over Night,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Day,</hi> like a Candle, is gone out, and where,</l>
               <l>None knows, except to th'other Hemisphear.</l>
               <l>You must go look the <hi>Day</hi> with Candle light,</l>
               <l>This <hi>Day</hi> was sure begotten in the Night.</l>
               <l>The Lanthorn-looker, if he now began:</l>
               <l>Might find the <hi>Day,</hi> but scarce the honest man.</l>
               <l>Well, <hi>Day</hi> farewel, be't spoke to thy small praise,</l>
               <l>There's little honesty found now a Day's.</l>
               <l>In vain you do your self this trouble give,</l>
               <l>You'l never make an even day while you live;</l>
               <l>And yet who trusted him for any Summe,</l>
               <l>Might have their mony, if the <hi>Day</hi> were come.</l>

And, when will that be? when the Devil's blind;</l>
               <l>You will this <hi>Day</hi> at the <hi>Greek</hi> Calends find.</l>
               <l>For, it the Sun does hang <hi>behind</hi> the Change;</l>
               <l>If you can find the <hi>Day before,</hi> 'tis strange.</l>
               <l>Then to the Tavern, Landlord, let's away,</l>
               <l>Cheat up your heart, hang't, 'tis a broken <hi>Day;</hi>
               </l>

               <l>E're long you'l see <hi>Day</hi> at a little hole:</l>

               <l>What, can't you sleep, you do so long for <hi>Day?</hi>

                  <l>Death, as in duty, came and snuff'd the light,</l>

As to the shutting in of Nature's day,</l>
                  <l>His Evening Red was, but his Morning Grey.</l>
                  <l>The Elements disputed Deaths controul,</l>
                  <l>Nature was loath to part with such a Soul.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>As to his quality he doubly owes;</l>
                  <l>But which, to Birth, or Breeding more, who knows?</l>
                  <l>The first has him among the great ones reckon'd,</l>
                  <l>And in the second he to none was second.</l>
                  <l>But some have troubled at his passion been,</l>
                  <l>Why shou'd they so? a Fly will have her spleen.</l>
                  <l>He cou'd be angry; and who lives but can?</l>
                  <l>For cou'd he not, he shou'd be less than Man.</l>
                  <l>True, he was hasty at some cross event,</l>
                  <l>But was again as hasty to repent.</l>
                  <l>And be his choler at the worst believ'd,</l>
                  <l>Whom his right hand deprest, his left reliev'd.</l>
                  <l>His strictness at the Churches Gates did well,</l>
                  <l>No Gates stand always ope, but those of Hell.</l>
                  <l>And since the Lord his Vineyard did restore,</l>
                  <l>'Twas Zeal, not choler to keep out the Bore.</l>

                  <l>What time the Peers did the <hi>Sun</hi>'s rising stay,</l>

                  <l>Me thinks I rather to a Temple go,</l>

Pipe of Canary.</head>
               <l>THis is a wonder, <hi>Drawer,</hi> score it up;</l>
               <l>A <hi>Sparrow</hi> taking of a chirping Cup?</l>

'Tis like the Bird, his fancy somewhat ripe,</l>
               <l>To the Canary flew to tune the Pipe.</l>
               <l>Why? if the Pipe was out of tune? then pray,</l>
               <l>Why should the Sparrow to his Ruine play?</l>
               <l>The curious Bird plaid on the Pipe, perchance</l>
               <l>To see the Rats unto the Sack-Butt dance.</l>
               <l>The Drawers eye, th' unlucky Bird beset,</l>
               <l>Who stead of drawing Wine, did draw his Net,</l>
               <l>Sure says the Drawer, when h'as drunk his fill,</l>
               <l>He means to pay me, for he has a Bill.</l>
               <l>Why should thy eye, and spirit be so narrow?</l>
               <l>Poor Bird, alas! he drinks but like a Sparrow.</l>
               <l>May be, and do you on its ruines look;</l>
               <l>The Sparrow this for a Hedg-Tavern took:</l>
               <l>If any mischief then, you to him do;</l>
               <l>You'l prove your self worse hedg-bird of the two,</l>
               <l>He sips, he sips, the Drawer says, and reels,</l>
               <l>But certainly he'l never take his heels:</l>
               <l>No, nor he need not, had he drunk till night,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Icarus,</hi> he was prepar'd for flight.</l>
               <l>But when the Drawer saw he drank all weathers,</l>
               <l>Not trusting to his heels, but to his feathers,</l>
               <l>In rage says he, and then himself bestird,</l>
               <l>This Sparrow sure, is a Canary bird:</l>
               <l>He caught him fast, and brought him to the Barr,</l>
               <l>VVho had recovered, had he come i'th' Ayr.</l>
               <l>He was a Cup to low; for be it known,</l>
               <l>H'ad ne'er been over-taken, if high-flown.</l>

               <l>These his six Livings are, but he does say,</l>
               <l>Had he but seven, H'ad one for the Lord's Day?</l>
               <l>And yet he has, (as he does things contrive)</l>
               <l>So many Livings that he cannot live.</l>
