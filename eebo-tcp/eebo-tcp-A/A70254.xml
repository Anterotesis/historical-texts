         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Charge laid on me in the last Letter,
dated the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
whatever might Occur worth tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Notice off, occasioned this trouble: I now
give you a Relation that connot but be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
to such as have not yet seen the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Deep, tho it must be confest things
of this Nature do not altogether so much affect
one that has formerly made so long an Aboad
amongst us as you have done, yet this may
serve to revive the memory of those Wonders
you have often seen, and furnish you with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
New to Entertain your Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43555:3"/>
The story I am to tell you, is at the taking
Two prodigious Monsters on the Coasts of
<hi>Mountserrat</hi> where I now am, the first of these
I assisted at the taking, which was after this
manner; About Six in the Morning we discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
something to Wind-ward move like the
Wrack of a great Ship, in which Opinion we
were the more confirm'd through the last Nights
being very Stormy and Tempestuous, some of
our Fishers endeavour'd to get off with their
Boats, but could not, the Sea breaking so on
the shore; about Eight of the Clock he came
so near us as to be perceiv'd to be a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which put us into the greatest conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
imaginable, there being not one of us
that had ever seen any Sea-monster half so
large, (though our New Worlds abounds in
the Production of various kinds) between
Twelve and One of the Clock, the Sea threw
him with that violence on the shore, that he
was unable to get back again, but by beating
the Sand about with his Fins, and making such
an hedeous Noise, that our Women and
Children fled to the Churches for Protection,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43555:3"/>
and other Places of security, But after that he
had wearied himself with his violent beating
and throwing the Sand about, we took Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and assail'd him on every side, and in
less than half an Hour became absolute Masters
of this mighty Creature, whom I shall thus
describe.</p>
            <p>His shape is not much different from that
dreadful Sea-monster so well known by the
Name of the Sea-monster, his length is about
22 Foot long, and of a Proportionable Bigness,
his Back full of Prickles like an <hi>Hedge-Hog,</hi> the
Skin extream hard, rugged and uneven, his
Head flat, and his Mouth extream wide, with
many sharp Teeth, and two of 'em Crocked
like a <hi>Wild-Boars,</hi> it hath Eight Fins, with a
Forked Tail, and above the Eye two long Black
Horns, his flesh is very Soft, but not one of us
being so hardy as to Tast it, I can give you no
Account, that deters us from it; is, because the
Flesh of the Sea-monster is absolute Poyson,
(causing strange Vomitings and Swoonings, and
proves Mortal, if not prevented by a good Dose
of <hi>Mithridate,</hi> or some other <hi>Antidote,</hi>) which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43555:4"/>
this in all things but his Bigness exactly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles;
so that here we conclude him to be an
over-grown Sea-Monster.</p>
            <p>The other Monster I am to describe is a
<hi>Sea-Vnicorn,</hi> that was likewise cast ashore as
he pursued his Prey, of whom I am also an
Occular Witness; He is about Eighteen Foot
long, and in compass as big as a Barrel, having
Eight great Fins like the Ends of <hi>Galley-Oars,</hi>
two of which are placed near the Gills, and the
other six at the sides of his Belly at equal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
they are of a Grenish shining Colour;
All the uper part of the Body is cover'd with
great Scales, of a Red and Blew Colour, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt
with Spangles of Silver, the Scales under
the Belly are Yellow, the Tail Forked, the
Head somewhat Bigger than that of a Horse,
the lower part of his Body cover'd with a dark
hard Skin, he hath a very streight Horn Issuing
out of his Head, about Nine Foot and a half in
length, Taper to the very Point; Towards
the Head it is sixteen Inches about, wreatched
almost to the point, it is naturally pollished of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43555:4"/>
a shining Black, marked with sundry small white
and yellow strokes, and of such solidy, that 'tis
difficult with a sharp File to get a little small
Powder from it, it has no Ears standing up, but
two spacious Gills, as the other Fishes, the Eyes
are about the bigness of an Hens Egg, the Ball
which is of a Skie Colour Enamel'd with yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and beneath it another as clear as Chrys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
The Mouth is wide enough, with several
extream sharp Teeth; the Tongue proporition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
cover'd with a rough Red Skin; The
Meat of him is exceeding good when Boyled,
and differs not much in Tast from Fresh Cod.</p>
            <p>Before this Sea-monster could be Master'd
several of the Assalants received considerable
damages, for he used his Horn with that nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
and dextenty; and made such desper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Thursts, as sufficiently demonstrated him
to be a Creature of great strength and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
when in his own Element.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir have I Related in the best
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43555:5"/>
Method I could, what has so lately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
among us, begging Pardon in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so Tedious in Describing.</p>
