            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>At this time, two things much auayled the prince: the one the excellent temper of his armour, fashioned by the wise <hi>Artemidoro,</hi> the other his vnmatchable sword sent him from Quéene <hi>Iulia:</hi> for no force had force to enter the armour, nor no armour had strength to resist the sword, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially wéelded by so strong an arme.</p>
               <p>Two weary howers were past, when as these worthy Warriers (impatient to sée their fortunes stand on such doubtful termes) with both hands met with their swords aloft, in such furious manner, that the Beholders (thogh some of them were vndoubtedly verie valiant) were so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, that their blood retyred to their affrighted hearts. The Pagan was quicke in the execution of hys blowe, which was the cause that it did little offend his Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, onely it caused his eyes to flash fire like lightening: but the prince setled his blow so furiously vpon the Giant, that if his stéely helme had not béene thrée fingers thicke, it had parted his head, yet it made him fall vpon the necke of his Elephant, and <hi>Trebatioes</hi> Sonne redoubling ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon him, <hi>Fangomadan</hi> had falne out of the saddle, if he had not preuented it by crossing his armes.</p>
               <p>This worthie Prince (descended from <hi>Achilles</hi>) might then haue concluded the Battle, when as the Moore was in this perplexitie, but hee would not, because it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst gentillitie and knighthood. Long it was not that hee paused, for <hi>Fangomadan</hi> comming to himselfe threwe from him that which remained of his shield, and with his sword in both hands went against his Contrarie: who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:13976:4"/>
saued his life, for that the Giaunt could not fasten a full blow on his helme, but it glaunced downe on the Horse head, which being parted in two, beast and Lord fel to the earth: which gréeued <hi>Floralinda,</hi> who with her Hus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and from a high gallerie beheld this mortall contention. Yet went hee not without his paiment, for there was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment could resist <hi>Rosicleers</hi> Sword, nor the Guider of that well tempered weapon: but with vnmatchable force it passed through his gorget to his throate: which the Giant féeling, he gaue backe, otherwise he had presently dyed.</p>
               <p>Although the Sonne of <hi>Trebatio</hi> was a foot, yet did not his valiant heart faile him, but with a gallant demeanor he abode the comming of his enemie: in such sort that the Giant staid to behold him. The Prince séeing him staye, said: What doost thou meane thou diuelish Furie: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>was becommeth a Knight, for in killing my Horse thou art by custome bound to giue me another, or els to alyght from thine.</p>
               <p>No such curtesie (said the Giant) makes me pause: but I thinke one of the Gods are descended in thy shape, but neither his nor anie other force will deliuer thée from my deathfull resolution. And there with he would haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his Elephant: but the Prince stept aside, &amp; as the Giant passed by, he stroke him such a blow, that the sword pared away the armour and part of his arme: so that with great paine he was able to rule his sword. Yet this trecherous Moore returned againe to ouer-run him, and the <hi>Greeke</hi> abode him with al the dexterie that might bée: and at his second passing by, he assayled him as a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doth his pray, laying his strong handes on him wyth such force, that he pulled his furious Aduersarie quite out of his saddle.</p>
               <p>The Giant séeing hee must fall, was subtle and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and clasped in the Prince, as the Yuie twisteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Dake, because that in their falling he should not

take anie aduantage of him, so that they came both to the ground: whereas might haue béene séene the gallantest wrestling in the world. For although the Giant were huge and deformed, our Knight was as well set and as strong as anie in the world, not being a Giant.</p>

                  </gap>ent to the Beholders, to sée what art and pollicie either of them vsed to get aduauntage of hys Contrarie. The Pagan in this wrestling lost very much blood, and wexed weake by reason of the wound in hys throate: which caused him to let loose the Prince, whose flesh and bones were verie much brused. But séeing it was not then time to loose anie opportunitie, they returned to their Battell againe with so great furie and quicknes, as though it had then but new begun, till such time as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wearines did inuite them to leaue of, euen for a little breathing: which was not without néede, for they had sought foure howers together, without taking anie kinde of rest.</p>
               <p>Those that were present did verie much extoll the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the pagan, in that he could so long indure against the Prince: for that they knewe by experience how farre the strength of his armes extended. And the Prince vnto himselfe sought by what meanes he might ouercome hys Enemie without killing him: for that he séemed to be one of the most valiantest that euer he prooued: and still hee thought that he excéeded the dexteritie of the mighty <hi>Gran Campeon,</hi> that was slaine in the Warres of <hi>Greece,</hi> by the hand of the said Prince. Likewise he remembred the manie and great affaires hee had to doo in other Partes: but that which gréeued him most, was that so long time he had not heard of his beloued <hi>Oliuia.</hi> The which thought kindled in him such cholar, that like vnto lightening hee went to the Pagan, first demaunding whether he would yéeld himselfe for ouercome, and leaue the Battell in the state it was?</p>
               <p>But this blasphemous King with a voyce that feared
<pb facs="tcp:13976:5"/>
them all said? Uile creature, is it possible that the Gods will consent being armed in the fielde, so poore a Knight as thou for pure sorrow and gréefe should desire to leaue off the battell, and yet wish me to yéeld as ouercome? I do now perceiue that all your deities are vile, and that your power is but small, that one alone Knight dare attempt to doe this. Come downe you théeues from those celestial houses that you haue stolen and vsurped, and I will giue you to vnderstand that I am <hi>Fangomadan</hi>? And therwith raging like a Tiger, hee assalted that warlike Prince, and gaue him such a violent blow vpon his helme, that he made him stoope and put his handes to the grounde, and doubling the same he stroke him ouerthwart, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended on his left shoulder, which the Prince felt verie gréeuous, &amp; séeing himselfe so intreated, considering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that the force of his aduersarie was increased, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to hammer blowes on him in such sorte, that hee made him séeme all bathed in bloud, puffing and blowing like a bayted bull.</p>
               <p>The Pagan would haue giuen him a down right blow purposing therewith to conclude the battle: But the Prince beeing warned by that which before had passed, made shewe as though hee woulde abide it, yet when it did descend, with all the lightnes in the world he auoided and made him strike vppon the stones so furiouslie, that when the swoorde fell it broke off a great péece.</p>
               <p>This louer of <hi>Oliuia</hi> was not iole on so good occasion, but stroke the Giant such a blow and with such good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on his shoulder, that he did not onely disarme the place but also made therein a great wound, out of which began to flowe a great quantitie of blacke bloud. And this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gréeke withdrew himself when he saw the wound he had giuen him.</p>
               <p>It cannot be imagined what great anger possessed the Giant, for like vnto a wounded Lyon (although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wearie) hee assalted <hi>Rosicleer</hi>: who had no care to

strike him, but to delay him with his lightnes, for that he knew well it would shortly tyre him. And so vsing his wonted dexterity, he onely auoided the blowes of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>Those that were beholders hereof did well perceiue the intention of this baptised knight: but yet he could not still so auoide it, but that the giant seazed on him such a blowe, that he made him somewhat to loose his memorie, and to voide bloud out at his mouth, the which <hi>Rosicleer</hi> tooke to be perilous, and let flie thrée or foure blowes on high to amaze his contrary, and therewith thrust at him with his sword in such sort that hee hit him on the thigh, and the point passed to the bone.</p>
               <p>The Moore did not thinke it to be great, till such time as assaying to follow him, he fell-downe vpon his handes, but he was not so soone downe, as with the quicknesse of his thought he was a foote againe, florishing with his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable sword.</p>
               <p>This valiant brother to the Knight of the sunne could very well haue ouercome him in thus detaining him, but he sodainely conceaued it to bee cowardise, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined to put the state of the battell in one blow, and as the giant was striking at him a mighty stroke, he entered within him, thinking to ouerthrow him, but he found him like a rocke: therefore being together he gaue place to the Moore to benefit himselfe of time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
               <p>But the giant leauing his greate fauchion, seazed on the Prince with his heauie armes, &amp; rescused him in such sort, that it séemed he would breake all his members, so that they must needs returne againe to a perilous wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in so much that with the heate of the battell and with wearinesse, they fell both on the grounde, and inforcing one to get the other vnder, they both lacked breath and the giant bloud, through which faintnesse they both soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the vnhappy giant neuer againe reuiuing. And this
<pb facs="tcp:13976:6"/>
is alwaies to be looked for of those, who liued as hée did, making his owne content a God, and worshipping his onely pleasure.</p>
               <p>All that were aboue woulde haue descended to them, but there was none that could forsake the place where as they were.</p>
               <p>For that incontinent the heauen was couered with a thicke and blacke cloude, with such thundrings and lightnings that it seemed that all the firmament would fall to the earth, in the which was hearde the bleating of beastes and other heauy groanes in the saide courte for the space of one houre, till such time as the storme was past, and the heauens became cleare as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Nowe looking for the warriours they onely sawe the Prince, as one amazed new come to himselfe, and as though his aduersary had béen before him, he gaue assault till such time as he was wholy in his remembrance, and saw not the giant.</p>
               <p>But that which grieued him most was that he lacked his good sword, which he woon with so deare experience, as was said in the first booke. And looking about for the giant, he sawe on the one side of the court, a sumptuous edifice like to a sepulcher, which was sustained with foure deformed Lyons made of alablaster, the Sepulcher it selfe was all of Christall, so cleare, that all might be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well séene which was within, and marking it well, he knewe that it was the bodies of the giants and their mother who laie as though they had beene aliue with their eies open, and euery one a very long scrole or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their handes, which declared the cause of their deathes: but that which made the inuincible Prince <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer</hi> most to maruell was to sée his good sword sent from Quéene <hi>Iulia</hi> smitten quite through one of the foure pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that sustayned the couering of the sepulcher which piller séemed to be of very fine Iaspar stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:7"/>And hauing desire with great ioy to pull it out, hee no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner layd hand on it, but there came foorth so great a flame that it séemed to haue burned him, till such time as he let it goe againe, and then the griefe went away, and he saw hanging at it a parchment wherein was written letters of bloud, which he could not stand to read, for that they did all descend and receiued him, and asked him how hee did féele himselfe? But the excellent and fayre Infant, with a gallant and soueraigne behauiour said.</p>
               <p>If you should haue hoped worthie Prince for my helpe, as you in descending to the battell told me, I feare me the Fight had béen more dangerous: but thanks be to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of heauen, it was concluded by your owne excellent force. Nay rather Madame (said <hi>Rosicleer</hi>) next to the heauens haue your distresse and beauty praise for this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Uictorie: for by them was powerfull abilitie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to my weake strength to defend the one, and reléeue the other.</p>
               <p>Let vs leaue this talke said <hi>Floralinda,</hi> and goe we to see the sepulcher, for I beléeue you haue lost something therein, for that it séemeth the fire doth defend it.</p>
               <p>Then said the Knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> were the losse verie much, I should thinke it paide, hauing finished this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture for the liberty of the Prince your spouse, although it was not little gréefe that my swoord should bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

               <p>They all laughed at that the Infant had said, yet they did gréeue at heart for the losse of the Princes Sword. And so they went with a great desire to sée where it was, and beheld a maruellous Aduenture, for they saw in the Piller fiue pommells of swords, euery one with his scroll hanging thereat, which declared whose it was. The swordes being one aboue the other, on the highest part
<pb facs="tcp:13976:7"/>
was that of the Prince <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> whose scrole was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this maner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was the sword of the Prince of Constantinople, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer, the which he lost at the defended Iland, putting to death with it Fangomadan and his sons, and shall here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine till such time as the braue Tyger with the vntamed Lyones doth ouercome the guarders &amp; keepers of my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell, getting without armes or order of knighthoode the entrie thereof, &amp; for himselfe the two swords neerest, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to reuenge the death of the vnhappy king.</hi>

               </p>

               <p>It could not but grieue the Gréeke Prince in seeing that all those must be accompted with the other enemies: but animating himselfe he said, few armours they haue left

And at his departure hee tolde mee that I should be constrained by the Gréekish vertue to be on that part, against whome hee will procure my reuengement, which he calleth present death: and that I should remain the kéeper of this Castle, for defence of all such as shoulde procure the aduenture of the swordes (for so the Castle is called) and likewise that there shoulde bee heare in fast kéeping, two Ladies the most principalest in all the world till such time as a Maiden childe in equall battle doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow me, and he said that foorthwith I should tell you who it was.

               <p>When he had certaine knowledge of these things, and was assured that <hi>Floralinda</hi> was <hi>Fangomadans</hi> prisoner, he tarried the time of her deliuerie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which chaunced vnto her with great paines and throwes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all turned to her content, when shee saw the fairnes of the Children: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this ioy indured so small a time, that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance therof passed away, for hauing them in her armes,

there entered in two furious Lyons with terrible roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and tooke them from her, leauing the féeble Lady with great griefe as you may imagine, to bee in prison without her children of whom the wise man had as great care, as though they had béene his neuewes.

               <p>He gaue them names conuenient to the content of their parents, for the Prince they named <hi>the hidden Celnido,</hi> and his sister, <hi>Floralisa,</hi> whom others did cal, <hi>the rigorous.</hi> For that til such time as she was wounded with amorous passions, she was very cruell, as you shall heare.</p>
               <p>At the same instant in the figure of diuers beastes hee brought the other infants. The <hi>Assirian</hi> he called <hi>Don Clarisell of Assiria,</hi> who died for the loue of <hi>Floralisa,</hi> as you shall heare.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phoenician</hi> he named <hi>Don Argente of Phoenicia,</hi> &amp; that of the <hi>Sophy,</hi> for that he was the goodliest in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, he named him <hi>the gentle Torisiano.</hi> Hee nourished and brought them vppe with so great care, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too deare for their comfort.</p>

               <p>When they came vnto sixe yeres of age, it was a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thing to sée them by reason of their beauty, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them séemed to be of more yeres.

               <p>They called the wise man father, and so did the other Princes, who increased in like maner in all knowledge: and were brought vp in the exercise of hunting, alwaies respecting them, as to such Princes it was conuenient.

               <p>I doe clearly vnderstand and know (answered the olde man) that from such a heart as yours can procéede no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intents.</p>
               <p>And my seruices shall not be so small, but I will one day deliuer you from death, which is but my duetie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of many things that you must doe for me, and now it is time for you to know somewhat of the world.

               <p>So they went foorth leading in a lease two moste faire Irish Gray-houndes more whiter then the pure Snowe whereas wee will leaue speaking of them, who quickned theyr wonted pace, because that they

heard the roarings of wilde beasts, and taking that way from whence the noyse was heard. And now we wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what hapned with the other thrée Princes, whome the wise man called and said.</p>
               <p>Louing sonnes, séeing you be now of good discretion, I must shew you the secrets of my dwelling, for the many things that you must doe for me. So taking the <hi>Assirian</hi> by the hand, to whom for his gallantnes he was most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, he brought them into the great court of the house, which was foure square, and compassed about with fayre galleries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wrought with diuersities of workes. In the midst of the court there was a christaline fountaine with twelue great spoutes of water, which running out order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a gallant consorted harmony.</p>
               <p>The Princes did behold the strange worke of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine recreating their sights thereon, but more admired when at the farther end they sawe a Nimph, that on her brest did shew fiue pearcing wounds, so cruell, that the entrance of the weapons were not closed, hauing in her hand a writing to this effect.</p>

               <p>The Princes did not vnderstand the obscure writing. Then the gentle <hi>Torisiano</hi> said: of truth louing father we should receaue content if you would declare vnto vs the meaning of this scrole, or els tell vs how we may ease the griefe of this wounded Nymph.</p>
               <p>Wel beloued sonnes saide the wise man, the desire of things honourable, I do very wel beléeue is in your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy brests: but the time and your tender age doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

               <p>This strange saying made them more wonder then all the rest, and asking who he was, the wise man told them al his birth? and concluding with a sigh he said: Were it not for him my reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gement were certain, but this knight without blow of speare or sword shall ouercome him who hath all my hope and by whom I doubted not to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>

               <p>As this gallant and gentle <hi>Assirian</hi> was beholding this warlike Princesse, there increased within him, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thoughts, and that alone sight caused that to succéed which séemed impossible, I meane the subiection of a hart more frée then euer yet was knowne in the <hi>Assirian</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>All the Princes exceedingly reioyced to behold so faire figures, and thought the time long to sée themselues arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Knights to goe foorth into the world to séek out such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Youths, as were there shown, to prooue themselues with them. And so being dinner time, they went into an Arbour, and <hi>Gelasio</hi> commanded their meate to be broght thether in such princely manner, as though they had béen in their Fathers Pallaces.

               <p>NOw am I carried with a swift course to the two gallant Youths, the Brother and the Sister: who after the great roaring they heard, let slippe theyr greyhounds, and with their blades in their handes, they pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These two Princes verie much mused to sée people of that shape, for that they had neuer beheld other, but the Wise-man and their Pages: yet not forgetting the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerositie of their couragious hearts, with their swords in their hands, they went against those diuelish monsters, as though they had béene verie well armed, and long exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to their weapons.</p>
               <p>Now want I excellence of Art to describe the heroike resolution of this yong Princesse. O happie Satyre, that deserueth to receiue blowes of so glorious a Damosell. The swift Chariot Driuer of the Sunne (sometimes the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

It séemed not strange vnto the <hi>Amazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> warrier (equalling in strength the auncient <hi>Bellona</hi>) to sée that great wound, which would haue caused a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand faire Ladies to haue sowned: But shee who was borne to giue it, did second another with such swiftnes, that the <hi>Satyre</hi> was not able to defend it, but she haue him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>With an admirable swiftnes did hee encounter the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mightie Satyre, who with a knotty oake, stroke at him a wonderfull blowe: and this hardy youth without experience abode the same with such gallant semblance that <hi>Mars</hi> in his glorious Orbe had enuie at it, and at the fall of that mightie clubbe, with a light leape on the one side, closing with him, he stroke him with his short swoord on his right wriste, that he cut it cleane a sunder, and the mizerable <hi>Satyres</hi> deformed ryght hande and hys great and mightie Clubbe fell both to the ground together.</p>
               <p>The worthie Gentleman séeing the good successe hee had against the monster, seconded his first blow couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and pared away a péece of the Satyres leg: the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish furie finding himselfe so wounded, would gladlye

               <p>At the same instant, the gallant and heroicke Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse his sister, had brought her aduersarie into like extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: for returning vpon him with an inuincible courage she wounded him so sore in his legges and thighes, that she had easie means by his fainting to cast a deadly thrust at him, which entring the bot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At the fall and crie of the first Satyre, their two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges came vnto them, and séeing the Princes against such dreadfull aduersaries, they fearfully exclaymed, making the most gréeuous mone that might bee, for feare of the danger that might ensue to their most beloued Lord and Ladie.</p>
               <p>No sooner did the last Satyre fall, which the admyred <hi>Floralisa</hi> ouerthrew, but with angrie countenaunce she returned to the heartlesse Pages, and thus reprehended their cowardise.</p>

               <p>The Prince receaued great contentment at the words of the Damsell, and to heare her griefe with euery cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance he returned with her to the pleasant fountain, wherein his iudgement (and in that hee erred not) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued new life. And alighting there they left his horse and her palphrey to graze and féede. And they sate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues downe vpon the fresh and gréene grasse very nigh vnto the Christaline water of the fountaine of forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>There the Prince, tooke off his helme by reason of the great heate, discouering his beauteous face, much bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his new thoughts, which gaue great content vnto the Damsell (who was of her selfe gratious) to sée him so faire and young, wherewith she said, by God S. knight with a better good will I committe vnto you my whole power for the battaile, for that I likewise am shée that must loose if any doe thereby, for I am assured that in him whom the heauens hath indewed with so great beauty, cannot chuse but be equall force and strength.</p>
               <p>At other times those commendations of his beauty were pleasant to him, when hee felt the wrongs of loue: but now he only procured to fauour and helpe those that were in necessity of his strength, and regarded neither his owne face nor the brauery of Ladies.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he said, Yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Damsell answered? I doe beléeue faire knight, that nothing can proceede from those hands that will not bring content vnto them for whom they shall vndertake combate: and I know your paines shall not be vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, although those which are like vnto you doe expect no reward, but of their owne bounty, are Champions for the distressed.</p>
               <p>Therefore gentle knight you shall vnderstand that at such time as our Prince was brought vppe with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Emperour the mighty <hi>Alphebo</hi> of <hi>Trabysond</hi> in the ancient and well fortified City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with that stout <hi>Brandizell</hi> Prince of <hi>Persia.</hi> The king our soueraigne liued in the greatest griefe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might be imagined, for that he could not know nor vnderstand where his childe <hi>Clauerindo</hi> was.</p>
               <p>For the Quéene his mother in that she had no other, and he also her first borne it is not to be doubted but that she loued him as her selfe, and that his absence did grieue her very soule.</p>
               <p>They passed with this griefe till such time as the high giuer of comforte, did bestowe on them a daughter so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in fairenes and beauty, that she was holden for more then humane.</p>
               <p>This was an occasion to lighten their age, and to ease their griefe whereby they might the better suffer the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Prince her brother. They made great reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings at her birth, and there came thither (as was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) all the friends &amp; vassals of <hi>Oristeo</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> (for so he was called) to celebrate that happy day, &amp; giue great honour to the Quéene <hi>Olinda.</hi>

               <p>The Parents receaued as I say some comfort in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing such a daughter, for the losse of the Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:24"/>And faire <hi>Grisalinda</hi> (for so is she named) as she increased in yeres, she grew so excellent in beautie, that she is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Within a while they entred into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> whereas they sustained a long and dangerous Iustes: in the which our Prince slew a strong and mighty giant, which done, they made themselues knowne. At whose discouery (faire knight) I leaue it to your discréet conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if the Prince were receiued with ioy or no, for whose absence there was such discontentment. Foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they went to sée their friend of <hi>Grecia,</hi> whereas <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerindo</hi> was maried with the sister of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said knight, who was called the faire <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> and she was deliuered of two sonnes at one birth of so excellent beauty being chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as was the Prince their father. Who to giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment vnto his auncient parents, sent to our king one of the children, with whose presence, the grandfather and grandmother were almost ouerioyed, and rested not in giuing thankes vnto God, by whose meanes there came vnto them that great benefitte: hee was nourished and brought vppe in the court as the sonne of so worthy a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was most curteously vsed of this faire and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Aunt.</p>
               <p>Now at this time fortune waxing weary of so long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during ioy, began to returne to her accustomable change, and would now in the end of our Kings daies, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vexe him with the greatest disgrace in al the world. And thus it grew.</p>
               <p>By reason of the comming of the Kings young neuew, there assembled together much people, amongst whome
<pb facs="tcp:13976:24"/>
were certaine of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; who with more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eies did behold the beauty of <hi>Grisalnida</hi> our Princesse, and did publish the same vnto their Prince: who being a young man, and one that knewe what belongdd to faire Ladies, demaunded of them in more particuler, and their description was such a bait, that it wholy concluded to subiect this passionated yong Prince, who onely by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring did aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Till such time as his passion increasing and his sences fayling, he was brought very lowe, insomuch that for his comfort they caused a painter (an excellent workman) to offer himselfe that he would draw her counterfeit, who gaue him great thankes, and estéemed it as was reason.</p>
               <p>Into <hi>France</hi> came the iudiciall workeman, no whit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to <hi>Apelles,</hi> and tooke the counterfeit of the Lady, with such art and curiosity, as it seemed the heauens had communicated their life giuing power vnto his working hand. And forthwith he returned vnto his Lord, who iudged the smal moment of his tarying to be many yeres, till such time as he did sée the faire face of the Princesse, which was a newe inticement to his prepared heart: in such sort, that what he thought would be a lightning or ease vnto him, fell out to be the increasing of his griefe: and in such sort the amorous passion did lay hold on him, that he left <hi>Alexandria</hi> pretending to go sée an vncle of his. With whose counsell and determination they departed in the habite of merchants, and came into <hi>Paris</hi> to the feastes that were made for the entertainement of the prince. The iewels they brought was the occasion that the Princesse and her Damsels sent for him to buy them, and made the price at their pleasures, without contradiction of this merchant who without séeing her, at the first report did yeeld her his hart: &amp; therfore he regarded not his precious iems. It was a thing worthy to be noted, to sée what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about the buying of his iewels, and I as an eie witnes can scarce beleeue it, although I saw it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:25"/>To conclude, he with the price of his iewels did sée at his pleasure the owner of his frée will, remaining there with great content, glad that he employed his thought in such a place, counting it a rewarde sufficient for all his wealth.</p>
               <p>In briefe he departed from thence very heauily, and to remedy his griefe, he had the courage to put in practise such a thing, which to thinke vpon I am af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this it was, he hauing a confidence in his beauty, wherwith indéede he was much indewed, put himselfe in womans apparel, and séemed therein as beauteous &amp; gallant as our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. Oh how many times worthy knight did I confer and was conuersant with him in that fained habite, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such content when he entertained vs, with his sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and playing, as was sufficient to bring him to be the most priuate Damsell that attended our Princesse ouer all those that waighted in the court, he neuer shewing any suspition, that should offend the honour of <hi>Grisalin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being in this content, it fortuned there came to the court the fearefull <hi>Partomio</hi> King of little <hi>Brittaine,</hi> a young knight, and the most valiant that is to be found in all these parts, who when he came made shewe of his great valour. The King who knew how to entertaine and honour such, did lodge him in the pallace which was the occasion he often frequented to my Lady and mistresse and conferred with her publikely, but neuer could haue opportunity in secret. To be short he grewe amorous of her, with such feruency, that he yéelded himselfe to serue her although the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You may imagine sir Knight (if you haue euer loued) in what estate this amorous young Prince was: and so weake he grew, that he kept his chamber, and (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) was in curtesie visited of our most gentle princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At whose entraunce, blood retyring into his pale chéekes from his reuiuing heart, he tooke her aside vnto a window &amp; besought her to sit downe, and by her sight to giue ease vnto his sorrow. The modest Ladie with bashfulnesse graunted his request, and desired him to be briefe. Who preparing the passage for few woords with a million of broken sighes, confusedly deliuered his affections, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly desired her fauour: begging with a piteous looke a kinde reply.</p>
               <p>To this vnlookt for request the princesse graciously an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, (because she would not adde sorrow to his gréefe) willing him that he should not despaire, though yet shee were able to giue him no signe of hope: her minde being subiect to no passion, but v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the princesse hating his importunitie, determined (while he remained in the Court) no more to come pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely abroad, but kept her chamber: and when <hi>Parto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio</hi> offered to sée her, she would in no case be visited. For which he conceaued such hate against the Princesse, that without any respect of knighthood, or his ancient royal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, trusting in his owne force and strength, he came to accuse our Princesse of treason and and disloyalty, and that she had little respect to her honesty and honour wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto she was bound.</p>
               <p>

When we vnderstood the manner thereof, it is not bee beléeued what great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation we all made: for that it is a law in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France,</hi> that if the Woman accused of vnchastitie within thirtie dayes bringeth not one or moe which will defend her honour, shee shall at that time bee consumed in fire.</p>
               <p>I will not (for auoyding my owne gréefe) detaine my selfe in telling you how her Parents did take it: but it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that all the Pallace was on fire, by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great lamentation which was made, for that fiftéene daies were past, and there was none so hardie as to appeare for her, they so much feared that vnreasonable Knight. Till such time as the masked <hi>Alexandrian</hi> did talke with his Lady, before he went about to accomplish the same.</p>
               <p>I, who knew the tract of them, for that my Mistresse had made me acquainted with his secret loue for to her he had discouered himselfe, heard her answere, which was to disswade him from that danger: but no request could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to leaue off that difficult aduenture, replying vnto her.</p>
               <p>Now Ladie and Mistres, shall you liue in securitie of my honourable and vnspotted affection: for that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth me boldly to aduenture my life for your vnstay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned honour.</p>
               <p>Then said the Princesse, if in yéelding mine agayne were a satisfaction, assure ye Prince <hi>Arlando,</hi> I would doo it. But if you loue me, you would not haue anie liking, that with the price of my fame I should pay so great debt. Touching the battel, which you intend to attempt for my honours defence, I appeale to your owne selfe, that haue tried my vnspotted chastitie. Yet I vrge not this in my owne behalfe, but it is anie Knights dutie whatsoeuer to helpe a wronged Ladie that standeth in necessitie with his sword.</p>

               <p>Shee then well vnderstood that the Pagan would goe thorough with his businesse, that so soone had cléered &amp; frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe of the Prince, in whose death she would haue béen a companion: not for that she loued him, but to ende her trouble and gréefe.</p>
               <p>Now I would you should consider what the sorrowfull Princesse suffered, who liuing in hope from the 18. daye, (on which wee sent out a Damsell to séeke her worthie Brother) till this, which is the 24. and yet she is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.

And hauing so great equitie on our behalfe, there is no doubt it wil little auaile the vniust and proud accuser, though his huge proportion &amp; strength were doubled.</p>

               <p>Here the heauie Damsel stayed, ending her talke with a thousand sighes, accompanied with pearly teares that distilled downe her chéekes: which caused great compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the frée breast of the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince, who answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Of a truth faire Damsell, you haue reason to séeke pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for so great an euil as this is: for there is no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to be giuen to so vnreasonable a Knight as that false Pagan, especially against the Daughter of so great a King.

But for the principal matter, though I loose my life in séeking to defend your Ladie, I doo accomplish no more than that which I am bound vnto: and now séeing it is more than time that we were on our way, let vs tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell forward, for I hope to giue comfort vnto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In truth sir Knight, if your Mistres bee the occasion that you beare this sad Deuice, she is without reason, in
<pb facs="tcp:13976:27"/>
that she hath not attained to know the much loue, which the proportion of your person deserueth. Herein iudge I that she is in fault, because it séemeth vnto mee that you lacke nothing to make you a perfect Louer, but some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to make you shew the strength that Loue requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and follow the fashion, which courtly Ladies in that case expect.</p>
               <p>At another time could this gallant Youth haue answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with more passion than now, when as his liberty was in the handes of them that made a iest of it: but finding himselfe more at ease, he answered.</p>
               <p>Of truth faire Damsell, you had reason to say, that it is more néedfull to haue strength than anie other thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this furious frenzie of Loue: for that I had a frend who while he thought to haue cure in loue, found first the ouerthrow of reason, inforcing his sense contrarie to that which he willed, rather than vnto the good which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined: although I now can boldly say both for him &amp; my selfe, we know not to what part of loues rules to incline our selues.</p>
               <p>Then it appeareth that you are not amorous sayd the Damsell.</p>
               <p>No verily (answered the Prince) for that I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer know what it was to bee beloued: therefore as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For each man should indeuour to lessen his gréefe, and chéere vp his fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting spirites, scorning to hope for or couet that desired gold which onely couereth the bitter pilles, that by their hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full operation purge the sense of all reason and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>The Damsell spéedily to this thus replyed. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Schoole haue you learned this erronious doctrine, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13976:28"/>
not in Loues Uniuersitie at <hi>Paris,</hi> which through all the world is so much estéemed. I am sorrie that I carry with me a Knight, which estéemeth not a Louer to be most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créete. What creature haue you in the world that liueth without loue? What picture doth giue contentment to the eye, if (by the beautie) the beholder presume not that the painter was enamoured of his worke, vsing affection as his pensill. It is well séene that where loue dwelleth, gentlenes and valor haue their habitation. What hath béen the occasion that the Gréeke Princes haue filled the world with their worthie actes, but that they haue been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous?</p>
               <p>Against these faire Damsels (answered the frée <hi>Daci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) my iudgement reasons not, for that loue did giue them alwaies abundance of assured hopes, easing therein and lightning the excessiue paine which the disdained Louer doth receiue. But the accustomable conceipt raigning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong beloued ladies, is self opinion of their own worth, a souereigne desire to be faithfully serued, a glorie and pride in their Knights valor: but when the full payment of his deserts (as a true fée for Knights seruice) is requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then is the Ladies beautie muffled with clowdy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. If she speake, she checkes his audaciousnes: if she looke, she darts vengeance from her eyes: and all the reward the Louer hath is this, that others pittie him, and are eye-witnesses of his true seruice: which she wil scarce vouchsafe to acknowledge.</p>
               <p>This gréeueth mee more than the rest (sayd the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous French Ladie) to sée how you are vtterly falne out with loue, in that you cannot obtaine to be the onely chéefe in account for the seruice of Ladies. Tell mee (I praye you) is it not a high reward for a Louer, to haue one gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious looke from his beloued Ladie? nay, is it not a salue for manie sustained sorrowes, if hee but once attaine her desired sight?</p>
               <p>Yes, it were well (aunswered the Prince) and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb facs="tcp:13976:28"/>
for a Louers contentment, to passe the heate of the day priuately in such contemplation, where the Gallant may (without let) salute his Mistres: but when such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious entrie is made without the ladies special license, I doo iudge it to be one of the most errours which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the ordinarie erring Schoole of Loue. But let vs reckon the best méede the Louer hath for all his mone. Doth shee bestow a smile? Oh then hee is a happie man: that one false sunshine is a sufficient comfort against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie bitter showers: but if shee vouchsafe a kinde word, a gentle touch, or some little idle conference, our kind yong louer is transported beyond all compasse, hee writes pure <hi>Castalian,</hi> walkes no where but in <hi>Tempe,</hi> dwells with the Muses, sings with <hi>Apollo Io Paeans</hi> in Loues praise. Anone (in the midst of all this iollitie) on goes his Ladies frowning kercher, and then his Eulogies are turnde to Elegies, his mirthes to moane: an vncouth caue couers his disgraced head, a darke and queachie groue his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant garden, the aire his counsellour, Eccho his scoffer, teares his drinke, care his food: and such a deale of foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:35"/>It is not possible to expresse with what violence the Giants, the big knight, with other sixe and twentie that remained (séeing what had passed) began to assayle and incompasse this yong Prince, in such sort, that it séemed by their furie they had bin able to haue broken in péeces a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie strong rocke they were so valiant: but this worthie &amp; valorous <hi>Torismundo</hi> did sustaine himselfe in such sort, that (by the force of his arme) they receiued a bloodie pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>At that time his new well tempered armour and horse did stand him in good steed, who was so light and nimble on the one side and on the other, as thought could bee no swifter, which was the occasion that the battell continued in a most honourable sort: yet notwithstanding it could not be but that he had néed of succour in a Fight so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, for the warriers with whom he delt were verie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant.</p>
               <p>Such was his fortune, that then the frée <hi>Dacian</hi> did set spurres to his horse, and came at that instant, when as he was executing such furie as the inraged <hi>Pirrhus</hi> did vpon the <hi>Phrigian</hi> people.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dacian</hi> greatly wondred at this inclosed Knight, being verie much affected to his valiantnes, for that hee made no reckoning of the other knights, although they were strong and stout, but still assayled the Giants &amp; that big knight, in such sort, that he made them feare his great and mightie blowes, hauing ouerthrowne twelue other knights.</p>
               <p>Then could not <hi>Eleno</hi> staye, but pricked forward hys good horse, and with his happie launce in hys hand thrust himselfe among the knights, and ioyning nigh vnto the valiant Spaniard, he sayd: Uppon them good knight, for they are but a few, although they séeme to be braue and stout, for our iustice and their pride will giue them into our hands.</p>
               <p>This saying was scarce ended, neither had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniard

               <p>At which strange incounter, <hi>Torismundo</hi> greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myred, and was verie glad of that gentle succour in time of so great necessitie. And for to giue his vnknowen frend knowledge of what valour hee was, hee threw hys shield on his shoulder, and went against the great Knight, (who troubled him most) and strooke him such a mightie blow vpon the helme, that he made him fal vpon his horse necke, voyding great quantitie of blood at his trayterous mouth.</p>
               <p>At hand was the worthie <hi>Eleno,</hi> and beholding it hee meruailed at taat blow: and séeing that great knight so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This blow was not so soone giuen, but <hi>Torismundo</hi> (who the while was busie with the Giants knights, and had not noted what the <hi>Dacian</hi> had done) willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that which was begun, stroke the dead bodie which lay headlesse on the horse so furiously on the backe, so that passing thorough it, it passed to the horse neck, and cutting it asunder, all fell together to the earth: wherewith one of the Ladies that were in the chariot gaue a great shréek saying.</p>
               <p>O glorious God, what great force is in this knight, that is not onely able at one blow to cut in sunder the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but the horse also?</p>
               <p>The valiant Spaniard turned his head towardes the Chariot, imagining that some knight would haue done iniurie vnto the Ladies, and in the chariot discouered one
<pb facs="tcp:13976:36"/>
of the fairest Ladies in the world, iudging her great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie excéedingly to exceed that little, which he saw before in <hi>Floriana:</hi> wherew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Here he that had sworne firmnesse to his Ladie, dooth now striue to dispence with vowes: he calleth the heauen vniust, in shewing him first but part of beautie, his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour wexed weake, and his powers for awhile failed, and faine he would haue spoken to her, that so throughly had subiected him, giuing her in change of her first sight, hys loue-sicke wounded so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>With this new desire and amorous passion, hee thrust himselfe amongst those few that remained, and saw the Giant in sharpe battell with the <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight: but hee accounting the affaires belonging to that Ladie, proper to himselfe, and conceiuing her to be the agréeued and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Mistres of the rest, he began a fresh to dispatch more of the Giants Knights, to carrie newes into hell of hys new change.</p>
               <p>In this time was not the magnanimous <hi>Dacian</hi> idle, for that he was in battell with one of the most brauest Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of all his Nation: but hauing a meruailous good horse he entred in and out at his pleasure, till such time as he saw the stout Spanish Warrier how worthilye hée behaued himselfe against the other Knights, wherewith a kinde of honourable enuie so pressed him, that like a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lion he encountred the Giant, who came towards him, striking one the other such heauie &amp; furious blowes, that it caused the worthie Spaniard to stay his battell, for to looke on them: but he saw that the Giant had the worst, for that he faintly trauersed the field, stretching himselfe with the pangs of death: and being ashamed to sée so few Knights so long to indure, in the time that the couragious <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince came vnto himselfe (for that he was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what astonished) he behaued himselfe in such sort, that hée
<pb facs="tcp:13976:37"/>
left not one aliue, but onely two, which he receiued to mercie, for to be informed who they were, that attempted this outrage.</p>
               <p>A good while before this battell was ended, came the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Page of the Dacian with his French Damsell, who receiued great contentment in beholding the valour of her Knight, and reioyced that shee carried in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie so good a warrant in the right of her Mistres <hi>Grisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The new and valiant Louer <hi>Torismundo</hi> being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, came vnto the Chariot, whereas their Pages had fréeed all that were therein of their vngentle bands, and pulling off his helme (his face being by reason of the heat somewhat inflamed) hee showed himselfe to be one of the fairest knights that was to be found, and verie yong: for (as before it was said) his beard did not yet appeare. Comming to the Chariot, hee knéeled downe before the Ladie, saying.</p>
               <p>Pardon (faire Ladie) my delay in gréeting you, for I could do no more than was in my power, the offence arises not from want of good will: vouchsafe therefore to receiue this small seruice of him, that is readie to put his life in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie aduenture that redoundeth to your content, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it as his owne.</p>
               <p>The Ladie did well vnderstand the affection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he spoke it, but (being restrained by the vnseperable yoake of marriage with the Prince of <hi>Geneua,</hi> who was present) she answered: The heauens reward you worthy knight, one of the most valiant you are that euer I haue séene: what you haue done for my husband and mee, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen will requite. It is sufficient ioy to vs, that you haue shewed your selfe so valiant, that we may thankfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the reward only to your worthines, as a thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable vnto vs.</p>
               <p>It cannot be imagined what gréef this passioned youth receiued, in séeing his remedie impossible, whereby hee
<pb facs="tcp:13976:37"/>
perfectly vnderstood the true sayings of the wise man, that he should sée himself in excessiue troubles, accounting this (at this present) to be one of the greatest aduersities, that might chance him: yet notwithstanding, because he would not giue them knowledge thereof, he dissembled his griefe and answered.</p>
               <p>It were vnequall glory vnto me gallant Lady, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto my Arme, that which with so great reason is dewe to this stout warrior, vnto whome with greater right you ought to giue the thankes for your ayde and succour, as vnto one of the mightiest Knightes that euer bore armor.</p>
               <p>And at this instant the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince was with them, but with his helme on, because they should not know him. for that it séemed vnto him, he had before séene the Prince, spouse to the faire Dutches of <hi>Sauoy</hi> called <hi>Orosia,</hi> and greatly maruelled at the beauty and worthinesse of the Prince of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So after there had passed many reasons with those La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they did importune him much for to discouer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: which he refused to doe, for that he said he had giuen his word vnto the Damsell, not for to disarme himselfe, neither to enter into any publique enterveiw with any till such time as he had finished an aduenture whereon he then went. Without impeach of this promise Sir knight said the faire Dutches, I hope it will not bee out of your way to beare vs company vnto the citty of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then aunswered <hi>Don Heleno,</hi> I doe sweare vnto your beautie, worthy Ladie, that it is not in my power, for I haue put my libertie into the handes of this Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell that commeth with me.</p>
               <p>Wel, séeing it is so answered the Prince of <hi>Geneua,</hi> wee shall receiue great content if that at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Paris</hi> wee may chaunce to sée you, that in some parte wea may gratifie the greate good which you haue done for vs, which will be ioyfull vnto vs all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:38"/>The like was promised by the worthie <hi>Torismundo,</hi> who was greatly affectioned to the gentle disposition of the <hi>Dacian</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would haue remained with him to haue knowen who he was.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, inquiring of one of the Prisoners, who his Lord should bée? He said, that it was the furious <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Sonne vnto the mightie <hi>Brandafuriel,</hi> whome <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerindo</hi> the Prince of <hi>France</hi> slew, and left this but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie yong Youth: but when hee grew great and bigge in yeares, he receaued the order of knighthood, and became the most hardiest knight in all that Countrey, liuing in such valiant sort, that he was estéemed for a more worthy man than his father. Which <hi>Tilmon</hi> (purposing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged for his Fathers death) came from the Towred I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whereof he was Lord, and brought those Giants in his companie, the better at his ease to séeke reuengement. And after we had disimbarked our selues on shoare, wee went through the Countrey in secret, till yesterdaye wee met with this Chariot, which was going towards <hi>Paris</hi>: and vnderstanding the gréefe that the king would receiue for the imprisonment of his Nephewes (as both the prince of <hi>Geneua</hi> and his Wife were) hee did apprehend them, to procure some occasion (through sorrow) to kil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French king.</p>
               <p>I giue great thankes vnto God and vnto these worthie knights (said the faire <hi>Orosia</hi>) that your euill pretence took no effect. So for that it waxed late, they tooke their leaue of the knights, and iournied towards <hi>Paris,</hi> where they arriued the next day, and were receiued with great ioye and content by the king, vnto whom they declared what had happened vnto them by the way, and how they were set at libertie by two alone knightes: whereat the king greatly meruailed, and could not imagine who they shuld be of so great power and strength, that alone durst giue battell vnto so manie together, and against such deformed Giants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:38"/>He was somwhat comforted to sée his welbeloued Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uewes: yet not in such sort, but that he felt in his soule the griefe concerning his daughter, which in conclusion he was constrayned to make the Dukes pertakers thereof: who although it were a griefe vnto them (as it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) yet they studyed to dissemble it, and to comforte their Unkle in all that was possible, and determined that the Prince of <hi>Geneua</hi> should goe disguised and séeke those va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Knights, and to giue them vnderstanding of all that passed, that they might frustrate that greate euill which was raysed against the Infant <hi>Grisalinda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which Knightes, after they were departed from the Chariot, entred into the thicke grouie Countrey, till they came vnto a fayre Fountaine, whereas they lighted: and the Spaniard cast his armes vpon the Prince, &amp; said: Sir Knight, showe not me so much iniurye as you did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that precious Lady, in not declaring to me your name: for in doing so, I shall remaine without gratifying of the ayde and succour you did vnto me.</p>
               <p>Worthye Knight (aunswered the discréete <hi>Dacian</hi>) I should be very ill aduised, if I should not acknowledge the great good which is gotten, in making him pertaker of my thoughts, that is of such desert and so desirous: and if I did vse my strength, it was not for that you were in necessitie therof, but the affection which I receiued did constrain me to ioyne with the breuitie of the time, that I might (if it were not a griefe vnto you) demaund what you were, and likwise aduertise you of the most secret things of my hart.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight (said <hi>Terismondo</hi>) I giue you great thanks for that you haue said: as for the rest, it is very apparant my necessity néeded your strength, and to both we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the raunsome of those Ladies: for my name, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer you as you do me: it is not iustice to denie a thing to him that hath so much desire to make me pertaker who hee is.</p>
               <p>Know then that I am <hi>Torosmondo</hi> Prince of <hi>Spayne,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:39"/>
whome fortune (that neuer ceaseth to be mutable) hath brought as vanished into this country, being tormented with amorous fyre: and there he declared vnto him all his life and amorous dealings: wherewith the <hi>Dacian</hi> was bound to declare vnto him of his loues, and the great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that he receiued.</p>
               <p>At the which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> remained greatly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and they were maruelous affectioned the one vnto the other, and the friendship that was betwéene them, did so farre extend, that it indured to the death, which was the alonely meane able to seperate their loue, and not the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous battels which they performed (as shall bee tolde you) were not sufficient, but that they were the greatest friendes in all the world, for that in one age, and in one Countrie, and at one selfe time: fortune had giuen them remedy of their griefe.</p>
               <p>With this the Dacian told him the lamentable occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherefore he went to <hi>Paris</hi>: at the which the Spanish Prince reioyced at the heart, for that he should once again sée the gallant Dutchesse: who was no lesse delighted with his great beautie, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n hee was rauished and enamoured with hers.</p>
               <p>They passed all that night one declaring to the other their former Loues, till such time as the Spaniard did tell him of the great affection he had to the Dutchesse: but the Dacian séeing that it was not good for him, (shee béeing a married Ladie) did cause him to leaue it off. Which was no small matter: for that a new passion (if once it be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to the heart) will sooner make an ende of one, than leaue him: but for that the remedie was at hand, it was easie to be forgotten, At which conceipt they did not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle laugh, both of them knowing the wonderfull effect of the fountaine.</p>
               <p>The Damsell that vnderheard some of their amorous discourses, said vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:39"/>Of truth faire knights, it was no small gréefe which the wise man did to disdainefull Ladies, which found so good a remedie against their strangenes. Of my selfe I say, that if I were beloued, I would not vse (as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is séene now among Ladies) to dissemble so much, that it causeth wings to be added vnto knights thoughtes, to séeke out so vnsauerie a Fountaine: for that it feemeth to me by the knowen vertue of this place, it will fall out that she shall remaine forsaken by her dissembling, and her gallant knight shal liue content to see her iust paine &amp; gréefe: a worthie reward for proud statelines. For if a Ladie loue, wherefore doth she dissemble? and if she hate, wherefore doth shee not make it knowne? But wee wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are so strange of condition, that we thinke that it is sufficient to be women, that all the world may serue vs. This is a thing too vsuall, which ought not to bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongst discréet people, although it may séeme that she onely is discréet, who often doth vse this false dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: Considering that hee who loueth, and is not dissembled with, doth not deserue the name of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
               <p>This hath place with them that are strange and giue not part of ioy to mitigate the griefe of the heart which lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, and I hold that Knight careles, who may bee remedied if hee will vrge it, and yet simply bearing wrong, reioyceth in his griefe, beeing content to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled with.</p>
               <p>Oh faire Ladie answered the tender Spaniard, how sweete should a Louers life bée, if all were of your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? and how manie gréefes might they daily auoyd? for that Ladies doo dissemble the affection which they beare their Louers, and vniustly intreate them to whome they haue giuen their hearts.</p>
               <p>Hencefoorth let all Ladies deale with me so, sayd the Dacian.</p>
               <p>Peace Cynicke said the Spaniard, let me goe forward.</p>

               <p>You haue great reason on your side, answered the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Damsell, but these so costly hopes I like not of, that when they come, they are with pure hope loathed: for to my iudgement (and I beléeue all those that try shall find) that the best of all hope in loue, is bought for more then it is worth.

               <p>In this sort at tenne of the clocke in the morning they came vnto the great Citty of <hi>Paris,</hi> at such time as all the place was full of people, abyding the comming foorth of the mightie <hi>Partomio,</hi> for that according to the lawes of the realme, the Princesse not finding within the terme set, any to come and conquer the accuser, the King was to pronounce the sentence. All the windowes and galeries of the Pallace were hanged with black, and a heauie and sad rumor was heard amongst the people, at which time the two valiant Friends entred the place: whome the eies of those that were present did much behold, wondring to sée their armor and horse.</p>
               <p>They were straight waies known by them that were at the bridge, and they began to say, there commeth the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant warrier, that at one encounter, made the Louer that kept the bridge sée starres vpon the ground.</p>
               <p>The Damsell went verie gallantly betwéene them that were the flowers of Knighthood, with her face coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in such sort that it made the people to suspect her to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The worthie Spaniard did take the Damsell in his armes from her horse, and so with them she went vp into the great Hall, at such time as the King was going forth all in mourning apparell, so sad and heauie, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to sée him had great compassion.

but especially the King very wel satisfied with his words and gallant disposition.</p>
               <p>In returne of answere the King said, Sir Knight I do estéeme as it is reason, the trauaile which you haue taken for my cause, and the battaile which you will vndertake for my daughter: and beléeue mee gentle Knight, I doe liue deuoide of care, for that I know truth or falshood wil haue successe answerable to their deserts: but for that hee who doth accuse her is a King, and a person that in all thinges is to be creditted, and on the other side my lawe hath admitted it to battaile, I hoped alwaies that some would be found which would combate for her, and in signe of the confidence I haue in her right and your valor, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all into your hand, being perswaded your desert to bée much more.</p>
               <p>I doe kisse your Royall handes, answered the <hi>Dacian</hi> for the confidence you haue in me, but whether it be much or little all is at your seruice.</p>
               <p>There was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince of <hi>Geneua</hi> and his Dutches, who came in with the Princesse, whan they vnderstood there was a knight that tooke vpon him her battaile, he came and saluted the Prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> knowing him by his blacke armor, and offered vnto him his lodging for the ayde and succour which he had done vnto them.</p>

               <p>The wrathfull <hi>Dacian</hi> did put himselfe before him,

saying in this manner to his furious and prowd aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Truly valorous king, hauing such confidence in your strength, you had no néed to raise anie slaunder against so excellent a Ladie.</p>
               <p>Thou art verie bold answered the pagan, the cause of it is, in that thou séest me without armour: &amp; to be plain, I put not on my armes, for that I iudged how that onelye in beholding me, thou wouldst gladly leaue off thy enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</p>
               <p>Thy pride is not small aunswered the Dacian in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to doo that without armour, which is impossible for thée to perfourme, beeing armed and at thy best aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>Thou maist well talke here said the pagan, vntill the hower of thy death approach. I wish of all my Gods that you were more, that I might giue ye your payments toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The cholerick Spaniard could not indure anie longer, but as one wholly and iustly incensed with wrath, he thus said.</p>
               <p>Those who haue little faith (as thou hast) doo inuade knights with aduantage, and not they which doo gouerne themselues with reason: and because thou art vniust and reasonlesse, thou doost imagine my companion will suffer mée to helpe him. But thus much (on his part) I let thée vnderstand, that before thou partest with him, thou wilt rather wish for help, than desire to haue anie more aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</p>
               <p>Nigh vnto <hi>Partomio</hi> was the bold and stout <hi>Alsino,</hi> who with a deuelish furie would haue laide hand on his sword saying.</p>
               <p>By high <hi>Iupiter</hi> I sweare to thee thou babling knight, if I did not assure my selfe that the king my Unkle is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thée and this cowardly knight, I would neuer put on armor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:43"/>Thou maist well goe and put it on, thou vnmannerly knight, vnworthie of a knights name (said the Spaniar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>) and hereupon I defie thée forthwith, that thou maist help thy Unckle, in whom thou puttest too great trust: &amp; with a gallant and souereigne iesture, he presently shut down his visor.</p>
               <p>Then the diuelish <hi>Alsino</hi> tooke hold of the Princes skirt of mayle, and pulled so strongly that he drew the Prince after him, saying: It is honor enough that Fortune hath permitted thée to defie and challenge him, that will not refuse to combat with <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dacian was nigh vnto them, who séeing his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curtesie, would not remit his paiment till the battell, but lifting vp his fist, he stroke him such a blow vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that he ouerthrew him at the Kings féete, saying: Uncourteous knight, before the King doost thou vse thys boldnes. Did not I foorthwith stay for the battell, I wold giue thée the paiment that thy folly doth deserue.</p>
               <p>The wrathfull king when he saw his welbeloued Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew lye along the ground, like a furie went against the Dacian with his sword in his hand.</p>
               <p>The Spanish Prince was nothing dismayed at his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish rage: but with two light leapes he put himselfe by his well affectioned and new frend, leauing all that were present greatly amazed at his dexteritie.</p>
               <p>Then the King of <hi>France</hi> came betwéene them: which was the cause that this furious Giant did not there ende his life: and king <hi>Oristeo</hi> commaunded <hi>Partomio</hi> foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to bee armed, and his Nephew also, who was then come to himselfe, and séeing himselfe in that case, there was no Hircane Tigers furie to bee compared vnto hys: but that foorthwith reuengement should be made (as hee thought) he went with his vnckle.</p>
               <p>Then the King commaunded the Princesse to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them for to giue the knights thanks, and accept them for her Champions: wherewith the poore Ladie apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:13976:43"/>
all in blacke appeared: yet was not she able with her sad lookes to couer and hide some part of her great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which was such, that the couragious Spaniard had not power to resist the entrie thereof into the secret part of his heart: and it was of such effect, that he accused hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and said it was lost time that he spent without louing of his <hi>Grisalinda,</hi> whom he worships, and acknowledgeth her for his liues owner. This was such a wound, that neither water nor the wisedome of <hi>Merlin</hi> was sufficient to heale.</p>
               <p>The gracious Princesse in few words (yet excellently couched) gaue power to these knights to become her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, against the false accusing king and his fierce Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin. The Princes humbled themselues with such grace, somewhat inclining, so that easily might bee séene theyr gallant disposition and demeanor: but especially y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard: who was the gallantest knight in the world. Long communication they would not abide, till such time as for the victorie they had done their best: therefore they descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the court, whereas they viewed their armour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no ouersight should appeare in them. When thys was done, (without putting their foote in stirrop) they lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on their well prepared horses, making them gyue a thousand coruettoes, with so gallant a grace, that all sayd they were knights of great worth: and the eyes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wer set vpon them with great content, but the incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with so valiant Enemies, they that had best hope, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubted.</p>
               <p>The worthie Spaniard did first enter into the Lystes, and séeing that their Contraries were not come, hee wyth a lowd voyce sayd. What, doo they not come that wished we were more? it séemeth to mee that their workes are not agréeable to their proud words, and I beléeue they wil not doo what they speake: and if they durst, I hardly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine their furie being so great, they would thus slack their presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:44"/>Thereby was a Knight, no lesse huge of bodie than <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sino,</hi> and something a kin to him, but at least his especiall great frend, with whom he did communicate of his loues, or (better to terme it) his foolish desires, who sayd: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not so forward, thou ill aduised Knight, for that short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou shalt thinke this place too little for thée, when as thy hands must be thy defence, and not thy tung. Well, for that thou shalt vnderstand my little feare (aunswered the valiant Spaniard) goe and take thy armour, for I do giue thée license to help thy cousin the prince of pride, and then thou shalt sée who shall think the place too little: and therewith he cast his gauntlet in token of defiance. But all that were in the place thought it folly, knowing with whom they should haue to doo, and yet so boldly giue them a companion. The Dacian was nothing agréeued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, for that he knew the new passion of his frend, and did intend to helpe him to the death.</p>
               <p>During the time that they staied for this so much doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Moore, this new Louer could not finde anie better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, than contemplation on his Goddesse, fixing the end of his speare vpon the ground, and his eyes whereas his heart was. The Dutches of <hi>Sauoy</hi> stood in a round tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er all couered with blacke, &amp; with her the Princesse, who séemed no lesse faire, than heauie and sad. And while the prince was beholding them, ther issued the deformed kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, richly armed: the Kings armour was Lion colour, with suns of gold, on his shield Reuenge with this posie.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Reuenge gainst one is insufficient,</l>
                  <l>One death cannot my rage content.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Hee was mounted on a furious horse, coloured dapple gray, and all his trappings sutable: hee had vnder his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour a shirt of mayle, and was appointed in such sort, that it caused a cold feare in all the beholders, to sée with what brauerie the Pagan did put himselfe into his station.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:44"/>There came after him that valiant and prowd <hi>Alsino,</hi> all armed in yeolow armour, full of precious stones and flower de luces amongst them. In the middest of hys shield there was a Ladie painted, with this posie.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Did I but grace his valor, Mars should fall:</l>
                  <l>But he will win, despite of mee, and all.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The choler was so great that entred into our Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard when he saw that louing Posie, vnderstanding vnto what ende it was written, together with the wrong that was done to the faire <hi>Grisalinda,</hi> without anie feare hee went to him and said. Now is the time (vncurteous knight) that shalbe séene whether I haue hands heere as I had a tongue in the pallace to defend mee: and I will make thée vnsay the falshood which thou intendest in thys deuice thou bearest. When hee was touched with that, the amorous Moore could abide no more reasons, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his horse about, he put himselfe against his Enemie.</p>
               <p>Now would I that I were inspired with some diuine fauour, to declare the most furious Battell, that euer was seene in the pallace of ancient <hi>Paris:</hi> the weaknes of my Muse hath no power to expresse the worthines thereof. If some excellent spirit now assisted me, with what content should I prosecute the most heauie and amorous battel of these furious Warriours? Who at the sounding of the trumpets, parted with so great a noyse, as though the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der earth had trembled, being oppressed with the furie of their couragious horses, on whom they made their incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the middest of their course, with no lesse violence, than if two rockes (remooued with the sea) had rushed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>The speare of the mightie <hi>Partomio</hi> tooke no holde on the Magicall shield, but it was giuen with so great force &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13976:45"/>
strength, that it made the Dacian double with his bodie, and to loose one of his stirrops, and the reynes of his horse out of his hand, but not his memorie: which in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie did much helpe him, so that at the staying of hys horse he had recouered al, and returning with great swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he drew out his sword, and went against his Enemy: with whom he had encountred so strongly, (although hee could not seaze on him a full blow in the middest of hys shield, for that it was of magicall mixture) that he stroke him such a violent blow vpon the brest, which tooke away part of his breath by bending and brusing of his harnesse: and his speare (running forwards) shiuered in péeces, a splinter wounding him in the throate in such sort, that if it had had a little more force, it had cut his throate asunder: yet notwithstanding he wounded him, whereof hys issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood gaue testimonie, and made him to embrace the necke of his great horse.</p>
               <p>The wonder was great that they all receiued, to sée so furious a blow, and from that time forwards they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Battell with more attention, perceiuing by that beginning, the Moore (for all his brags) wold surely haue the worst.</p>
               <p>The gentle Spaniard and his Enemie made their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in the middest of the carréere, with so great force, that it séemed by the rumour of this course, some great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difice had falne. The incounter of our baptised Knight was somewhat low, for that hee would not erre: yet for all this, his aduersaries shield and harnesse fayled him, &amp; he gaue him a little wound, which troubled him: &amp; they rushed together with their shields and helmes, and with their horses so furiously, that the Moore fell (out of all sense) with his horse dead betwéene his legges vnto the ground. Likewise the Christian (being brused with that incounter) was forced to doo the like, but his horse escaped, neuerthelesse he thought with the fall hee had broken hys bodie in péeces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:45"/>Yet for all this he began to bussell and make himselfe ready to goe against his enemy with an admirable quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, saying: it stood him in hand, being before his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, and in defence of so faire beautie. All that were in the place did verie much reioyce at the good successe of him with the blacke armor: but by and by he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in that he sawe the third defied Knight come swiftly with his speare in his reste against the Louer. This wrathfull youth did not feare him, but before the Moore woulde passe, séeing the Prince make shewe as though he would abide him, he somwhat stayed his horse, because he would not misse, and comming néere him, he bare his speare lowe, intending to carrie him away at that thrust. But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> commending himselfe to God, at such time as he deliuered his Speare, put himselfe on the one side, laying holde thereon with so great quicknes and strength, that he forced him to let it loose, because els hee should haue fallen, and so the <hi>Moore</hi> passed forwards: ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the furie of his horse.</p>
               <p>This newe Louer, hauing gotten his Speare in his hand, and won it in such order, would shewe some of the antiquitie and bloud whereof he came. Therefore he did tosse and shake it before his faire Ladie, that behelde him fixing her eye on the place where hee was, and hee perceiuing that she did looke vpon him, as indéed all the people did, noting with what brauerie he did it: euen as if he had béen vpon his good horse, he went after him that then was returned &amp; comming to ouerrun him with his horse, which caused great laughter and noyse in the place, till such time as they were aduertised what was done. Then they saw that the Spaniard firmed his féete on the ground, and threwe the Speare with so great strength that he stroke him in the middest of his shield, and made him fall ouer the crouper of his horse, whereas against the ground his head receiued a greate and gréenous fall, and besides he caried a tronchon of the speare in his brest,
<pb facs="tcp:13976:46"/>
whereout began to run much blood. Presently amongst the people there arose a great noise saying, Hee with the black armor doth begin to quaile the pride of the kinsmen. The furie of this famous Prince of Spaine did not héere rest, for when he saw him with the Lance ouerthrowen, and that the other could not cléere himselfe from vnder his horse, he went vnto the last, and tooke him by the legges, drawing him vnto the place whereas the proude <hi>Alsino</hi> lay blaspheming his Gods that had giuen such force to one Knight, at two blowes to bring them into that estate. And when he came to <hi>Alsino</hi> hee said: Nowe beast thou maist sée that it is better to put more hands to the battaile than so much pride, I will not helpe thée from vnder thy horse, till such time as this champion doth come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that shall beare thée companie in death: so he layde him by him, and left them in that sorte, causing greate laughter among them all, and pleasing the innocent Princesse, who then began to féele some new alterations, iudging with some passion, that which all men publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spake of the valiantnes of the Spaniard: who as though he had done nothing, threw himselfe ouer the Pomell of his swoord, and so backt his horse that came vnto him, which was estéemed of all for high noblenes. After he had a while beheld the place where his Goddesse was, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand imaginations working vpon the newe forge of his thought, hee returned to sée his companion: who at this time with his swoorde in his hand (very ioyous to sée the gallantnes of the new louer) went against the redoubted Moore, who vnsheathing his great fauchion and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his Gods, they settled such blowes on their inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted helmets, that all the compasse did sound thereof. They were some what amazed, but the Moore had the worst, by reason that the inchantment of the Dacians good swoord, was of more antiquitie &amp; better than that of the Pagan, so that the magical temperature of his helmet doing him little good, his sword must néeds enter in therat more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>

That thou shouldest sée thy selfe in that extremit, ythat thou shouldest haue néed of helpe.</p>
               <p>At this time approched his couragious Friend, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most enuious at that the new louer had done, intending to requite him with the like, he assailed <hi>Alsino</hi> that was on the one side, and lifting vp his swoorde with both his handes, hee stroke him such a side blowe vppon his helme, that he little enioyed his standing, but hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threwe him side-longs with a great fall, so that all that were in the place began to say: long liue so good friends that know how to reuenge the dishonor of our Princesse. The King did verie well heare it, and although hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to holde their peace, it did little profit. Therefore turning to the Prince of <hi>Sauoy</hi> hee said: Of truth if these two be not the Gréeke Princes I cannot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine who they should be that haue so great force. Let not your highnes maruell (answered the Prince) for as I tolde you, I sawe them against the Giants deale such blowes, that if I had not beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then it came to the Kings imagination that it should be the Prince of Spaine: but that thought left him, for that he did sée him ouercome at one blowe in the same place.</p>
               <p>And turning to beholde the battaile, they sawe the blacke Knight come vppon the Pagans cosin, and strike him such a sound blow that he made him to stacker back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, three or foure réeling paces, and following the
<pb facs="tcp:13976:47"/>

This louing Ladie could not dissemble, but turning to the faire <hi>Orosia</hi> of <hi>Sauoy</hi> she said. It seemeth vnto me gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cosin, that your comming hether, hath begun all my good fortune by the force of that Knight, which as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue doth all this in your seruice.</p>
               <p>It is not to be doubted (answered the Lady) being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of your beautie, that he doth this for you: hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie done as much for mee to set me at libertie. Happie Dutches of <hi>Sauoy</hi> (answered the Princesse) that you obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned such a Knight for your defence, and much more happy may the Princesse of Fraunce be, to obtaine such knights to defend her honor being indued with such excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
               <p>And as they thus conferred, being young and kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, their new change appeared, and it was no griefe vnto them to fauour the knight with the blacke armor, in in that they were bound vnto it: so looking into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate place, by reason of a great noise that was amongst the people which said. From the Heauens descend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of such a knight that so doth honor the French court. They perceiued that the valiant Dacian at one irefull blowe, had ouerthrowen the King vpon the earth and cut
<pb facs="tcp:13976:48"/>
off his head, at that time that the cholorick Spaniard had done the like to <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard went vnto the Dacian, who vpon his knées gaue him thankes, that with so great honour had holpen him. The gentle Spaniard did the like, and cast his armes vpon his necke, saying: Pardon me (my entyre frend) in that you haue séene my follies. Whereto the Dacian aunswered: Whatsoeuer errour hath béene committed, it bringeth a pardon with it selfe: and whatsoeuer you haue done, hath béen to mée great content, for that I perceiue your Ladie doth receiue the like pleasure. And from this time forth, let vs intreate of your matters with such wisedome, as is required in such a case as this is: and if it bee requisite to carrie her out of <hi>France,</hi> I profer my selfe in your seruice. <hi>Torismundo</hi> did much esteeme this ayd promised, binding himselfe to more than to venter his life for him. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto the Damsell they said: For that she had done them so great frendship, and kept them so good companie, that whatsoeuer she would willingly should be done, shee should expresse it. The French Damsell being somwhat abashed, sayd. I am sorrie sir Knights, that you doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in me that, whereunto I am so much bound: but the dutie that hath wanted in mée, my Mistres will performe in such measure as is reason. Faire Damsell (sayd the Spaniard) this alone is sufficient to leaue me in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting bondage to you, if you procure your Ladie (finding my heart true) to be intreated to yéeld such pittie, as true loue requireth: and when ye would speake with vs, you may alwaies come vnto the Forrest, whereas wee dined to day. She said, she would doo so. At that they could not talke anie more, for that the King came in companie with all those mightie Princes and Knights, that were wyth him. And when he approached, as these two frends were knéeling down to kisse his hands, he raised them, &amp; imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, saying. I will not sir knights, that you suppose
<pb facs="tcp:13976:48"/>
my comming is to reward that which you haue done: for I cannot pay so great a debt: my onely desire is, that yee would commaund my person and estate, in anie thing yée please, and I will procure it, as if it were for <hi>Clauerindo</hi> my déere Sonne. Wee doo well know couragious prince (said the Spaniard) that whom God hath indued with so much vertue he wil not leaue him without so much grace but that all the world shal desire to serue him: our reward is sufficient, in that ye haue admitted vs for your knights in this cause, wherefore in all other things I and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion are at your commaundement. And now séeing there is no more to be done, giue vs leaue (wee pray you) to depart. You will not deale so vncurteously with me sir knights (said the king) to take from vs the bond wherein wee are so much bound, as to goe away, and not to take your rest, and ease your selues in this our pallace. I doo assure you worthie king (answered the Dacian) that wee cannot tell you who we are, neither can we tarrie with ye without breach of our honour: and this we hope you will not permit, only for the desire we haue to imploy our liues in your seruice. For my part (said the king) you shal not be importuned, onely my desire is, that you pull off your helmes and speake vnto the princesse, for it is shee who is most bound for this déed, The Spaniard answered, (fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his voyce, for that he wold not be knowen). We may as ill yéeld to this, as to the other, by the order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood which we haue receiued, and verie much shall we be blamed, if we make so long tariance, as to speake wyth the princesse: but hauing opportunitie, wee will returne and serue you in all that you will command vs. The king answered: With this I remaine content, although I shal not forget the wrong, till such time as you performe that which you haue last promised: and taking them by the hands, he lead them thether whereas the princesse was, &amp; her welbeloued Mother, who could not satisfie her selfe in imbracing her, as if shee had béene new risen from death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:49"/>And when they came thether the King said, Daughter I cannot intreate these Knights to remain in our Court, that they might receiue the graces and thankes for that which they haue done for you. I would faine sée if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Damsels were of more effect than that of Kings. It is not possible, welbeloued Father (answered the vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Lady) that they will loose the debt wherein they haue bound vs, in going away without telling vs who they are.</p>
               <p>Most faire Princesse (answered the Dacian for that the Spaniard was not able to mooue himselfe): The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens doe know what griefe my selfe and my companion doe féele, in that we cannot receiue the curtesie of so high a Princesse, in remaining in this Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it would bee an occasion for vs to falsify our promise, if wee delay any longer time. Touching our names, we are of far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, and of so little fame, that if we should tell you, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it would be cause for vs to loose somwhat of that which we haue gotten. Touching your father and Court wee haue not deserued any thing, but occasion being offered, heere we giue you our faithes to returne and serue you. I wilbe surety for this your promise, said the faire Dutches. I am content therwith (answered he in the black armor) making strength of weaknes, and sée wel that our faith receiues no wrong, although we goe secure that you will haue compassion theron. So making their obeisance vnto the Ladies, they tooke their leaue and descended, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wil of the Spaniard. And mounting vpon their horse, they tooke their leaue of the Damsel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who made her selfe to be known vnto the King and the Princesse, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they receiued high and great content, &amp; asked her who they were, but she tolde them what they had concluded, but neuer would say what they were: where as wee will leaue them in their suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for to speake of the thrée prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whom we left in the way toward Gréece.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13976:50"/>
could not imagine who they should bee, for that eyther of them had russet couerings vpon their armour, and couers likewise for the deuises on their shields. The Princes were verie ioyfull, when they saw that wel proportioned knight, who entred vnder hatches and came foorth again with his helme on his head, and on his arme a shield of the same color of his armor verie gallant, in whose fielde was portraied a Lady with a sword in her hand, &amp; at her féete a knight with the same armor that he wore, who was knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on his knées with this posie.</p>

               <p>The Princes receiued great pleasure at the deuice of the stout Knight. The Troyan did request the other two Princes (for that al the Country was fildwith their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, that they would suffer him to answere whatsoeuer that Knight should demaund. The princes with very good will did grant it vnto him: and in ioyning their boate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his, there came foorth from behinde, a wéeping Lady, that caused great compassion: who séeing that the knights did cause them that gouerned their inchaunted boate to ioyne with them, &amp; being nigh she said. Worthy knights, as you would fortune to giue you rest in your desires, tell me some newes of the Gréeke Princes, or of some of their friendes, for that I doe come in their demaund from a far countrie, because I was giuen to vnderstand, that they alone doo protect and defend those that cannot help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of which number I am one, and shee that sent mee to séeke them, another.</p>
               <p>Comming from the mightie Citty of <hi>Lira</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> and going to Sea I met with this gentle Knight, who demaunded of me wherefore I came. And giuing him to vnderstand my necessitie, he made me answere, Well séeing that those whome I came to séeke
<pb facs="tcp:13976:50"/>
were so mighty as al the world doth know, that although he went to receiue the order of Knighthood by the handes of the mightie King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who is the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Pagan that is now knowne, yet he ioyed to change his pretence, and caused me to enter into his boate, saying, that he likewise would séeke them, and demaund of them the order of Knighthood, that of their great valors some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what might come vnto him. So it is answered this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle youth, as the Damsell hath said, and it shall be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our content to tell vs that we demaund.</p>
               <p>The knightes greatly reioyced with the demaund of the Knight, and the Troyan answered him, Of truth gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Knight, you could not haue met anye, that so perfect newes could giue you of these Princes as I, for it is not long since my companions and I did departe from one of them, although I beléeue it will be difficult to finde them now, for that they goe in secret on a certaine aduenture. For the rest I beléeue that there is none more friends to them the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we thrée, for that their bounty is as an adamant to the will of him that will imitate them in their procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p>The Knight with the white armour answered, Sir Knight I giue you great thankes for the newes you giue me of them, and for that the finding of them is difficult it is sufficient for me to haue met some of their friendes for to giue mee the order of Knighthood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doe request you Sir Knight, to giue it mee foorthwith, although I haue not done you any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, for I haue somuch to doe, that the little time I am detained, will be the occasion of my eternall lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Therefore doe it foorthwith, and I shall receiue great content therein, for that you are the first Knight, that I haue met of the Christian sect, and he of whome I haue demaunded first this thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:51"/>Then the Troyan said, I would gentle Knight as I am their friend, that one of these Princes of Gréece were here for to make more certaine your honor, as to receiue the order of knighthood at their handes: yet seeing it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwise, but I must be hee that must receiue the curtesie to giue you that which you demaund, with license of my companions (although it were better to be done by them) I doe giue you leaue for to shewe your power, in defending all such as are in necessitie of your person: And therewith he kissed him on the chéeke, and hee remained armed the best knight of all the Pagans, although with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the feastes requisite for so high a Prince, yet for all this the Sea did celebrate the day, with bearing the name from that time forwards of <hi>Happy,</hi> which indured a great time vntill it was stained with bloud, as shall be told you in the fourth part of this historie.</p>
               <p>This furious Moore was ioyfull and content that hee was an armed Knight, and rendring thankes to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Troyan he said Gentle Knight, <hi>Iupiter</hi> rewarde you the honor which you haue done me, in performing that which my soule so much des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it is better to performe my word though my hart dye: than not performing it, to liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out honor in perpetuall infamie and disgrace of my Lady, which I estéeme worse then rigorous death. So setting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part whatsoeuer perrill, and the duetie I owe you, I say from this time foorth I defie in mortall battaile, hee that will deny that the faire and soueraigne Princesse <hi>Flora</hi> of <hi>Argentaria</hi> doth not excéede all that liue and haue liued in fairenes and beautie, and this I will defend, against the princes of Gréece so estéemed in the world.</p>
               <p>The cholar was great that entred into the Knight of
<pb facs="tcp:13976:51"/>
                  <hi>Cupid,</hi> and a thousand times he was about to answer him but that he remembred he should wrong the Troyan, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom was leaue giuen to answere all. But the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian néeded not to meddle: for the Nephew of <hi>Priamus</hi> with great mildnesse, (that better shewed his valour) did answere: Of truth sir knight, you loue your Ladie verie much, and it séemeth to mée, that she ill rewardeth so great affection, to put you in a demaund so perillous: for the Gréeke Princes and their Frends will defend the same, although they had no Ladies. And séeing it is her will, it were better that she did come with you, that in séeing her beautie, without anie strife may be graunted that which you doo publish of her. For I doo know two (and the chéefe Ladies of the Grecian Empire) that will not consent to anie such thing, neither wil their princes: in whose name (I say) that I am readie for the battell. This amorous Moore aunswered not, for that (with the swiftnesse of an Eagle imbracing his shield) he lept into the Barke of the Troyan: who at his entrie with his Sword in both his hands gaue him such a blowe, that by reason hee was but young to receiue such buffets, it made his téeth chatter, one against another, till such time, as he firmed himselfe well, and made him readie (without drawing his sword) for the battell? The Troyan was not a Knight for to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault anie vpon aduantage: but séeing that hee drew not out his sword, he said. What sir Knight, wil you conclude the battell without sword? if you had the weapon of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Achilles,</hi> it would be somewhat difficult, much more without it, and you also being without experience. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Knight answered the curteous Pagan, I doo wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it to be as you say: but this is the meanes which I was commaunded to vse: so that there rests no more for you but that you attempt to doo your best, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my selfe.</p>
               <p>The boldnes and courage of the Youth, caused admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the princes, that he would make battell without
<pb facs="tcp:13976:52"/>
sword with the Troyan: who said vnto him. Sir knight, either let vs leaue off the battell, or séeke somewhat to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thée, for that the Frends of the Grecian Princes doo not accustome to fight with anie, except it bee with great equalitie.</p>
               <p>It is not in my power (answered the Moore) therefore thou néedest not obserue with mée these respects. I knowe they are good: but for this battell, it is enough for me to go thorough with it, so as I may perfourme the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Mistres.</p>
               <p>The Troyan was kindled like fire, and said: Well, looke to thy selfe yong Knight, since it must be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out swords.</p>
               <p>O Muses, might I now wet my tongue in your sacred Fountain, then should I artificially declare the rigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this battell. For as though they had had swords in their hands, or their hands had bin swords, they began to strike in such sort, that quickly both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were assured of their aduersaries strength. But at the assault, for that the Moore was of bigger bodie than the Troyan, he might at his ease strike him vpon his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall helmet, beating out so manie sparkles, as though it had béen with his sword, and made him to decline on both his knées: but the Troyan rose vp verie furiously, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh, he grapled with him, and in entring, he stroke him vpon the breast of the harnesse such a blow with hys fist, that by reason the place is there most perillous for his breath, it lacked but little that he had not stroken out hys life: and found time (by reason of his amazednes) to lay his strong hands on him with so great force, that if he had wrested a little more to the left side, he had ouerthrowne him. With this, the couragious Pagan came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and returned more furious than the lion on his pray, and caught his Contrarie by the middle, so that he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him thrée or foure paces, without putting his foote on the ground, leauing him brused, and the Princes satisfied
<pb facs="tcp:13976:52"/>
of his strength. Then they returned vnto their contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous battell, with so great a noyse, that it seemed to bee an hundred Knights. It was a thing worthie to note the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie with discréet retyring and bold entring in of these rare Warriers: strange it was, and more brused theyr bodies, than if it had béen with swords. At this time the Moore stroke his Contrarie such a blow with his fist vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his arme nigh to his elbow with so great force, that he had thought he had broken it: and the gréefe was so great that he could not returne his payment. The Pagan did not let passe the occasion, séeing that it did behooue him, but doubled another blow vpon his shoulder, as if a rocke had falne vpon him.</p>
               <p>They were wonderfully amazed to sée the furie of the pagan, saying within themselues: that he was one of the most valiantest in all the world, and that if he shuld come to haue the experience and vse of armes, he would prooue therein most excellent.</p>
               <p>It was great reason they should so thinke, for of thys pagan <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> speaketh manie things: making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times mention of him in this great Historie, &amp; of his déedes that were diuers for the loue of his <hi>Flora.</hi> And sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this battell was for her, and the first that hee fought for the reward so much expected, it was without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to remember the courage wherewith he executed it: which made the victorie to be doubtfull, and the Troyan amazed to sée how well his Contrarie defended himselfe, and offended him.</p>
               <p>Being therefore ashamed that one alone Pagan should hold him so, he set vpon him, and strooke him so straunge a blow vpon the forhead, that he made him to loose the sight of his eyes, wherewith he clasped him in his armes: but thereby the Troyan could get nothing, for that the Moore was bigger of bodie, and yonger, so that what the one did by dextertie and experience, the other did with youthfull courage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:53"/>In this manner they came sometimes aboue and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vnder in the Boate, procuring on both parts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Battell: and it had béen ended with both their deaths, if the Scythian Prince had not put himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene, and parted them to heare him speake, knowing with himselfe that his Frend should doo much better with his sword. He then said: Sorrie I am sir Knights, that in this sort you giue the world to vnderstand your valour, and not as they that intend to ende their battell with an honorable conclusion: I speake not this to haue it quyte left, but request you that you would not now ende it, tyll such time as this knight may doo it with the sword. They being both as well indued with curtesie as with force and strength, at one instaunt parted, and the Troyan sayd: Most valiant knight, I am content to leaue it off with the condition you haue named, for to giue you content, if my competitor be so agréed. The worthie Pagan answered: I would be verie glad to doo that which you demaund, but the one is contrarie to the other, for if I doo not conclude this way, I cannot lay hand on my sword: so that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwise, and therefore pardon mee, who till now neuer denied anie thing that was requested of me. The prince answered: I will giue a remedie for the same, if it be offence to none, and take your hazard vpon my selfe. I am content said the Moore, because you shall perceiue that I will not refuse to giue you contentment: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it bée (beeing from hence) I will hold you for my frend, for that it séemeth to mée your worthines and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie doth deserue it. Let it be so answered <hi>Meridian,</hi> (being much pleased with the gentle answere of the Moore) and let vs goe thether where your Ladie is, although it hinder vs of our iourney, and there we will condition with her, how this battell shalbe concluded. This giueth me grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter content said the Moore, for that the Goddesse of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie shall fully satisfie you with what great reason I doo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her excellence. Well séeing it is so said the prince, I
<pb facs="tcp:13976:53"/>
will imbrace you for a frend, holding now in mine armes one of the best knights in the world. It is I that doth profit thereby (said the Pagan) to sée mee in the conuersation of such companions.</p>
               <p>There they all imbrased the one the other, and <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> tooke off his helme, and discouered that deuine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, which was such, that the Moore said: without all doubt, this knight is one of the Princes of Gréece, or els <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe, for such proportion and shewe of valour I know not who hath attained except it be those, whose fame in all the world is in equall degrée both for fairenes and valor. In me Sir knight (the prince answered) is not that which you speake of, yet at least I haue good will (though I lacke force) to imploy it in your seruice: and I am verie glad that this battaile remaineth to bee yet deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that we may reioyce our selues in your companie, all the time that we shall spend till wee come thether. And I beléeue in this our boate we shall goe more at our content, and to me and my companions a farther reioycing (setting all anger apart) if it will please you to serue your selfe of that we haue.</p>
               <p>I giue you great thankes gentle knight (answered the Pagan) for the company you doo offer mee: for although there is not in me any good part to deserue it, yet there shall not lacke gratitude for to acknowledge it in such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as it is reason. And therewith hee caused his Page and People for to passe all into their ship: but the Damse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> seeing that it would somewhat disturbe her going into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentaria</hi> in time of so great necessitie, said that shée would depart and take her iorney towards <hi>Greece,</hi> for that if she should tarry so long, she should fal into rebuke. The which she would haue done, if the Troyan <hi>Oristides</hi> had not stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and told her in secret that there was <hi>Rosicleer</hi> the Prince of <hi>Greece</hi> (wherof she was verie glad, that she had so good successe) and aduised her to hold her peace and bee still till he told her more: so therewith shee was quieted
<pb facs="tcp:13976:54"/>
and put a fardle which she brought with her into the beat, the which (with the swiftnes accustomed) began to naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the right way to <hi>Argentaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this sort went these foure stout warriers in the boat debating of diuers things: and finding fit opportunitie for the same, the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> (in the name of the rest) did request the Moore that hee would certifie them who hee was. The curteous Moore answered, I cannot but in all giue ye content, séeing such Knights doth demaund me.</p>
               <p>You shall vnderstand, gentle and well disposed knights, that I am the Prince of <hi>Tharsis,</hi> the onely Heire of the kingdome after the death of my father, and being a child, I was tolde by wise men that in the beginning of my knighthood, I should passe many perrils for loue: and it séemeth to mee that it goeth forward accordingly, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first which this Knight hath put me in. I being in the Court of my Father, the King of <hi>Argentaria</hi> passed by one part that lyeth vpon our Kingdome, and brought with him his daughter, of few yéeres, but the fairest that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nature framed, the which Lady I being a child, not knowing then what I did (but now I should kill my selfe if I performed it not) without any more consideration but with the content I receiued, I made her a mansion in my brest: where so long shée indured, that in good earnest shée hath wholy possessed my soule. Our Fathers were great friendes together at such time as they were aduenturous Knightes, which was the occasion that hee detained them in <hi>Tharsis</hi> a long time, but yet verie short for poore <hi>Lisarte</hi> (for so I am called). I am perswaded gentle knights, that she did not gréeue to sée with what truth I did loue her, she would neuer make any shewe thereof vnto me. I might haue demaunded her of her Father, and an easie thing it had béen to haue attained her for the release of my griefe, considering the great frendship that was betwéene them, but I did it not, neither will I, for that therby I should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the affection I haue to her, to procure loue by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:13976:54"/>
meanes, than the right passions of a louer. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, my fortune was such, that her Father carried her to his kingdome.</p>
               <p>I will not declare vnto you what griefe we two felt at our departure, it were but to fill you with amazmentes, but they shalt well feele it that haue knowen what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or losse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to be alienated, or accompanied with the beloued. I iudge as the one is a life, the other is a death, for the life I haue passed in her absence bringeth no content, for that I was cléere without her sight: and I beleeue it is an ordinary thing with Louers.</p>
               <p>Now about a month past there came messengers from <hi>Argentaria</hi> to my Father, demaunding succour, for that a furious and fierce Giant, being affectioned to the faire <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> doth demaund her in mariage (and I doe beleeue that the heauens hath created vs for one). To which she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that first she wold teare her self in péeces rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marry to him. At which answere he was so angry, that at the instant hee ioyned together more then thirtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, and fierce giants, with whom he hath begun to spoile the Country.</p>
               <p>My father for that he was bound, went in person with much people, and came thether in good time, in such sort that they kept the Giant busie.</p>
               <p>Amongst other things there came a letter vnto me from the faire Princesse, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which doth ease her absence when as it troubleth me. And for that I know you wil receiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therby, I wil read it, &amp; then you shall sée the reason I haue to loue her: they al said that they should receiue great pleasure to heare it, and therwith he read it as followeth.</p>

Forthwith they disimbarked their horses, and a palfry for the Damsell, who was very ioyfull to goe in companie with such knights. She went with her face couered, and the knightes with their visors open vppon their mightie horses, they being so gallant and the Sunne shining on their rich armour, it was a heauenly thing to behold them, and the sight thereof did dasell the eyes of the Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They commanded them that had the gouernment of their barke to stay for them: so they began to trauell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing great content to sée the freshnes of the Countrie. The furious Pagan if any occasion should bee offered of assalt for himselfe, broke downe halfe an oake, and laying it vpon his shoulder hee beganne to trauell with it, that it greatly delighted them to behold him: &amp; as they rid, they passed away the time with him with swéete and amorous conuersation, for that he was so good a seruant to <hi>Cupide,</hi> till such time as they came into a great plaine, where as they saw more then fortie knightes in a troope trauelling by the way, and in the middest amongst them, was some on horse-backe without armour, which gaue them great desire to knowe what they were. And when they came more nigher, they saw that they were two knightes, the one of middle age, the other somewhat entred in yéeres, which had their hands bound behinde them, which caused in the Pagan great compassion, for that he was by nature vertuous, who with his oake came vnto one that went somewhat behinde, and said.

               <p>Oh infernall furies, I beléeue the rage is little among you to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with that which entred into the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned youth: for that without any more speaking, he lift vp his fyst, and stroke him such a blowe that hee made both braines and eyes to flye out of his head, and spurred his horse with so great spéed as might be deuised. And ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the middest of that plaine (the syth doth not so swiftly enter into the tender grasse) as this diuelish youth entred with his knottie oake, ouerthrowing both horse and knights, with such quicknes that it was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to behold him, whose beautie caused great affection in the princes. Then the noble troyan, the more to satisfie the Moore of his worthynes, pressed foorth his furious horse, and entred among them in such sort that they séemed wolues amongst shéep. In the meane time that these two were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied for to dispatch this bloudy war, their Pages did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye the hands of the prisoners, who were astonied to see

The prisoners did yéeld them great thankes for the succour they gaue them. Then the Troyan asked how farre it was to the Campe? The prisoners sayde that it was litle more than a mile: then they entred in among the trées, and lighted, but pulled not off their helmes, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing no more spéech but that they were wandring knights who hearing of the vnreasonablenes of the <hi>Cilician,</hi> came to helpe the Lord of the Country.</p>
               <p>The knight that was prisoner did much estéeme it, and gaue them great thankes in the name of his brother the King.</p>
               <p>There they consorsed that foorthwith, through the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of that mountaine, the two Knights with all their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and the Damsell should enter into the Cittie, for that they foure would first sée the scituation of their enemies Campe.

               <p>With this agréement they went vnto the great tent (and for that the Moone did show her selfe more fairer then she did to her beloued <hi>Endimion</hi>) they might goe straight the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without speaking to any, for that the watch thought they were of the Royall guard.</p>

               <p>The valorous Louer of <hi>Oliuia,</hi> was not idle, for that at the doore (like a good and faithfull Porter) he let none en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that he left his life in recompence: till such tyme that at the noyse there came vppon them so much people, that the Troyan was constrained to giue out the signe, &amp; to goe foorth at the doore, whereas with the Giaunts they were in great trouble for mounting their horses: but with the helpe of the Gréeke they at last got vp. <hi>Lisarte</hi> carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in triumph a heauie Mace of the kings, which when he fell from his seate hee tooke from him: with the which it was a maruellous thing to behold the hard and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowes that he stroke vpon those euill armed people.

In this sort they crossed the Campe, leauing dead and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill wounded, more than thrée hundred men, besides the principalls of the Councell of warre. Those were they, which the pagan King gréeued most to loose. And when he came vnto himselfe (as a man out of his wits) hee began to make a noyse, reuiling and forsaking his false Gods, and entring into the roome whereas they were, hee sayd: Now you euill Gods, may you séeke those knights that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour you, in whom you haue put so much power, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with a club to beate his poore Gods, paying them that which he deserued. At last hee vowed that hee would not vnarme himselfe, nor suffer any to enter to sée him, till he had béen reuenged on those rebellious Knightes, that so much at their ease wer departed. Who leauing the whole Campe afraid, they came vnto the bridge of the Cittie, whereas they found to the number of ten thousand men, readie to come foorth, if néed had so required, and for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of them a worthie Tharsian, somewhat a kin to the fierce <hi>Lisarte,</hi> who was so angrie, that hee would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with those people vppon the Campe. Which had béen no smal aduantage: but yet his frends did stay him, saying: that the next day he should not lacke occasion for the same. With this the cholericke Youth was pacified and entertained the Captaine of the people verie curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and he them likewise, &amp; guided them vnto the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, whereas the Kings did tarrie for them, and the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>Flora.</hi> The heroycal Tharsian was imagining what to doo, &amp; doubted he had done litle in her seruice that night in that he had left him aliue, that iudged himselfe worthie to deserue her: yet for al this he encouraged himselfe, and purposed not to be knowne, till hee had ouercome that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Giant, and presented his head to his Ladie. The King receiued them with great thankes, for that in al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects he was a good Knight, and frendly to honor such as
<pb facs="tcp:13976:58"/>
came vnto him, and verie thankfully gratulated the succor they offered &amp; had made to him and vnto his daughter: yet would not they suffer themselues to be knowen, although the Princesse did desire them verie much. There was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them a lodging where they should take theyr rest: where they were serued with manie dainties, which the Princesse sent them, who imagined that her Prince was amongst them.</p>
               <p>These foure Companions supped with great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for to please the Moore, all the supper time they talked of <hi>Flora,</hi> declaring the reason he had to loue her, for that she was so faire.

               <p>When they had done, they went to rest, but sent that night order vnto the Kings, that early in the morning all his people should be armed.

Whereas foorthwith (because they would loose no time, they agreed, that the Grecian &amp; Prince of <hi>Tharsus,</hi> should goe foorth into the Campe, and that the rest should be aloofe off, to yéeld their helpe when néed required.</p>
               <p>They all reioyced at the agréement: wherewith the common people began to place themselues vpon the wals of the Cittie, the better for to sée what these knightes did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The like did the princesse &amp; her damosells, from that part of the pallace that looked towards the Campe: there they tarried the comming of the two Frends, her heart work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with excéeding ioy and desire to behold the battell, as one that had no small interest in the action.</p>
               <p>These two passed through the stréetes so pleasantlye, that which way soeuer they went, the Ladies gaue them a thousand blessings, and the people with high voices gaue testimonie of that they desired. The Tharsian was mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his mightie horse, and at the pommell of his saddle did hang that bloodie Mace that he won the night before, with a speare that séemed to be a beame of an oake trée, &amp; a gallant horne at his necke that became him well. They all meruailed at the furious countenance they both shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for although the Grecian was not so great, beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thrée fingers lesse than the prince of <hi>Tharsus,</hi> yet he was altogether as well set, and rid in such sort, that all did estéeme him for a stout knight, when they saw his gallant disposition.</p>
               <p>Foorthwith they went foorth into the Campe, &amp; when they had passed the bridge a bow shot, the Tharsian lift vp his visor, and began to blow his horne with so great force, that he made it to be heard throughout all the Camp, and said.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:59"/>O furious and fierce Pagan, is it possible that hee who would haue the faire <hi>Flora</hi> for wife should be so carelesse, his enemy being in the field? Come, if thou wilt haue the weapon that thou didst loose yesternight, and bee reueng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for héere I doe tarry for thée. The Princesse did verie well from the place whereas shee was, heare what the Knight said, being very ioyous that so good help was come vnto her.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tharsian</hi> séeing that he came not, blewe his horne againe and said. O vile Moore, wherefore dost thou stay and not come foorth into the field, thy Lady being there? Come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come for it is now time for to make shew that thou dost loue, and the effect of all thy force.</p>
               <p>The Pagan tarried not long, but put himselfe at the doore of his Tent, mounted on a proud and mightie horse, armed in blacke armour, full of red knots, which caused feare to them that did behold them. There were two Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants that would not agrée that he should goe forth, and for that they were armed, and mounted vpon great beastes, they sayd to him: stay mighty <hi>Arlante,</hi> for wée will goe and bring vnto thée those vncurteous knights, disturbers of our quietnes, for it is no right to giue them so honorable a death as to die by your hands.</p>
               <p>So pulling downe their visors they went without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany from the bridge, whereas they caused more to bee in a readines, when it was néedful. It did not gréeue these two frends to sée them come in that sorte, being so big that they séemed great Pine trées.</p>
               <p>At their comming the biggest of them who was called <hi>Fermonte</hi> said: what is it that you would haue Knights, that so early haue risen for to disquiet the King <hi>Arlante</hi> our Lord? if you come to séeke your death for the offence which you committed yesternight, hee doth not come to giue it you, for that he will not giue you so much honor.</p>
               <p>The Tharsian tooke in hand to answere him, and said,
<pb facs="tcp:13976:60"/>
thou vncurteous beast, if the tyrant haue anie anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, and so much delighteth to make warre wyth them that neuer did him wrong, it were better for him to take reuenge himselfe, or else peraduenture he meaneth to take vengeance of his wrath and your deaths together. So without anie more words they turned their horses, &amp; made their incounter in the middest of their carréere with such a noyse, that it séemed foure furious rockes had met together, their incounters were such.</p>
               <p>The valiant Tharsian séeing that it was the first lance that he ran with in all his life, and beeing also before hys faire Mistres, hee commended himselfe to <hi>Mahomet</hi> for helpe, and incountred the fierce Giant with such a blow, that with a truncheon of the launce in his breast, he made him fall to the ground, so that hee mooued neither hand or foote, with so great wonder vnto them that were present, that they forgot the wondrous blowe that was giuen by the warlike Grecian: who (as though the faire <hi>Oliuia</hi> had béen present) encountred the Giant so strongly, that hee made him to fall ouer the horse crupper, pearced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and thorough: and he was incountred in such sort, that it made him stagger in the saddle, and the Tharsian failed his stirrops with his strong incounter: but in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering himselfe, hee stayed to behold with what gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the Grecian returned, more estéeming him then than he did before.</p>
               <p>From the Cittie there was heard a great noyse of mirth, the people saying, We haue one diuell lesse.</p>
               <p>The two good Frends of these stout Warriers came foorth of the Citie, for that they saw the other two Giants did make themselues readie for to incounter them, &amp; that out of the Court of Guard came foorth the fierce <hi>Arlante,</hi> mounted on a mightie Elephant, and at his saddle bowe another mightie mace of stéele hanging, whereby it did appeare, he was verie cunning in vsing of that kinde of weapon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:60"/>The two Giants séeing their companions on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground at one blow, without kéeping the law of Knighthood, came with their speares to incounter the two good Frends, who did abide them without anie feare, the one with his new sword, and the other with his mace. When they came to make their incounter, it was a sight worthie to be séene: for euen as thogh they should strike vpon a rocke, in such sort the Giants mooued the Knights, passing the one by the other without anie staggering. Foorthwith they returned with their mightie fawchions in their hands: and all of them at one time smit such blowes, that it was meruaile they fell not all to the ground.</p>
               <p>Somwhat more did the Princes show themselues, for that the Tharsian (with his heauie mace) reached on the helme of his Enemie such a blow, that hee made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his head to the saddle bow, and comming with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he had hit him full on the head, he had ouerthrown him: yet (for all that) he gaue him such a blow vppon the shoulder, that (with verie gréefe) he could no more mooue his shield arme. But the Giaunt (roaring like a Bull) strooke such a blow, that (lighting vppon the Tharsians helme) it made him fall vpon his horse necke without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie sense, and it séemed that he was dead, for that his horse carried him about the field, till hee came vnto the place whereas the first fierce Giant lay astonied wyth hys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.</p>
               <p>The Giant being now come to himselfe, arose vp, and séeing his mortall Enemie in that sort, hee assayed for to take him in his armes: and he had done it, if at that time the Louer of <hi>Floralinda</hi> had not come, who seeing the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteous dealing of the Giaunts, (hauing a good horse) came at such time as this wretch was laying hold of the Prince, and gaue him such a thrust with the breast of his horse, that the vnwéeldie Monster fell downe vppon the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:61"/>Now was the couragious Youth come vnto himselfe, and acknowledging his estate, he humbled himselfe to the Prince for his ayd and succour, and therewith hee lift vp his mace, and went to the other Giant, who came and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him with his fauchion aloft: but this beloued youth did execute his blow in such sort, that he made his braines flye out of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when he saw that the Scythian prince would a light from his horse, he came to him and said: Worthie knight, let this reuengement be mine, for that it toucheth me, and I will procure to execute it, and therwith he leapt as swift as an Eagle vpon her pray: which caused all that were in the Cittie to maruell, and likewise his Ladie, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her <hi>Lisarte,</hi> and prayed God that he were one of those Knights.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke prince vsed his aduersarie in such sort, that he could not rule his sword: which being perceiued of the prince, he closed with him, and caught hold on his healme with so great quicknes and strength, that he pulled it off, and strooke him withall such a blow, that hee ouerthrew him at his horse féete. By which time, the Tharsian had cut off the head of his Enemie, with great content vnto them al, and praised the Moore when they saw him mount on his horse without putting his foot into the stir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The worthie prince of <hi>Tharsus</hi> put himselfe first for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and said: Stay proud king, thou shalt perceaue that thou dealest not with knights which doo vse to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with anie such aduantage: for euerie one of himselfe is sufficient (by the helpe of the immortall Gods) to make a more misshapen wight than thou sweat drops of bloud.</p>

But the gentle <hi>Lisarte</hi> sayd, stay King, for first I will giue them to vnderstand, to whome my heart is bound of this battaile that I summond, for if I had the libertie as thou hast, I would make an end of it foorthwith, but thou must giue mee sureties for thy word, and sweare before some that thou wilt accomplish it, and I will doe the like.</p>
               <p>Thou makest many excuses said thee Pagan, and I beléeue thou dost it because thou wilt not performe it.</p>
               <p>The gallant Louer was much vexed thereat, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requested the Troyan to goe and make the Kings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted of this agréement: but they would not consent thereunto, for that it seemed they were some what wearied of their daies worke, whereat the two Knights receiued gréefe.</p>
               <p>But seeing it could not be otherwise, the Giant retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Campe blaspheming his Gods: and our knight with his companions, went into the Citty, whereas the Kings came foorth to méete and receiue them, wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At one time they returned with their heauy Maces, settling such blowes that both of them gaue shewe of their valors, and fell both vpon the pommels of their Saddles as dead men, and their horses carried them about the field, til such time as the <hi>Tharsian</hi> came vnto himselfe, and like a Lion he went against his enemy, with his vttermost strength, and before that hee recouered himselfe from that trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some blowe, he gaue him another vpon his shield so great that it sounded as though he had stroke vpon a bell, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it all to péeces in his hand. Who séeing that it was not for defence he let it fall, and assalted the <hi>Tharsian</hi> with force, and with both his hands settled such a blow vpon his shield, that he made it to recoyle on his breast, that almost with the great paine hee was without sense, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall

staggred in his saddle, but recouered it, it was the occasion that he was wholy kindled in quicke choler, and stroke so thicke vpon the cruell Pagan that hee seemed to grinde and bruse both bones and flesh, entring and going backe with such dexterity, that all who did behold the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile greatly maruelled, that they so long endured in equal degrée, without acknowledging any bettering betwéene them.</p>
               <p>But shée who receiued most blowes was the faire <hi>Flora,</hi> who séeing her Knight before such an enemy, and thinking him to be the same he was, her colour went and came in her face diuers times, shewing sadnes at euerie blow which her knight receiued: which were such and so many, that if she had not béene the reward of the battaile, he could not haue sustained them: but reinforcing his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, hee gaue such a blowe on the left side of his enemies helme, that it lacked little to haue ouerthrowne him from his horse, and made him to giue a fearefull shrieke with the griefe thereof.</p>
               <p>The furious Giant did returne him an answere in such sort, that it séemed to disquiet him, it was so cruell: there anew began their furious combate, so that it séemed all the seruants of <hi>Cyclopian Vulcan</hi> were there ioyned together. The braue Pagan did lift vp his Mace and went to the gentle Louer, who withstood him, and put himself so much forwards at the receiuing of the blowe, that hee could not reach him but with his armes, and let fall that heauy weapon with the strength of the blowe, leauing the poore Knight that he séemed as though he had been stonned, and being so nigh, the King sawe hee could not hurt him with weapon, he layd hands on him, and griped him in such sort that hee made him to doe the like, whereas was séene a gallant wrastling, and by reason they were both of great force, the one could not recouer of the other any aduantage but were forcing each other with the contention of their wrastling, that they made their horses to stoope on their

knées. They were but mortall, and to shewe they were such it was not much after foure houres battaile, so well fought (that <hi>Mars</hi> would haue bin weary) that they loosed one from the other, and breathed a while: then taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine their Maces, they began to lay on without any pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, procuring the spéediest way they could ouercome: it chaunced that the Tharsian did looke vp to the windowe where as his Lady was, and seeing that shée stirred not, leaning with her chéeke on her hand, hee thought it was because she sawe in him some weaknes: wherewith hee pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Euerie one thought he had béen dead for that they saw his horse carry him about the field: but within a while he came to himself, without comparison much more malitious then the angry Uiper in the sandy <hi>Libia,</hi> and with both his handes he gaue an answere to his contrary so rigorously, that hanging down his armes and voyding bloud, it made him in that state that his horse carried him towards the window wheras the Princesse was, who sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Louer in that case, her heart would not suffer her to sée so heauy a sight, but she turned her back, at such time as the gréeued youth came vnto himselfe, and séeing the backe of his <hi>Flora,</hi> considering from whence it did procéed, he pricked foorth his great horse, and assalted the Pagan, and raysing himselfe in his stirrops, with both his hands he gaue him such a blowe vpon the crest of his helme, that he buckled it vnto his head, wherewith he had a great fal to the ground with so great griefe vnto his people, that it forced them against reason, and without considering what their Lord had commaunded, trusting in their great multitude, to giue an assalt, saying: Strike downe and make dye that euill knight that hath slaine our Lord: but that incouraging was to their hurt and damage, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the valiant louer séeing them to be a vile kind of people, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them so rigorously, that quickly hee made a broad

way whereas he went. Those of the Cittie were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful, nor the valiant Princes, for in a moment they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the gates of the Citty, whereout came all the knights, and before them the thrée pillers of Knighthood, and set vpon their enemies (who were without Captaine) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great slaughter, wounding and killing with such force, that quickly the field was witnes of their crueltie, all to besprinckled with Cilician bloud, and in such sorte they did presse them, that at the euening they had almost none to fight with, &amp; followed the chace vnto the seaside: there it was that the Argentarians, did most at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent make reuengement, and remained rich with the spoiles for many yéeres: and being honored foreuer, they returned to their Citty with little losse: yet they slew that day more then thirty thousand men, besides a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of captiues. They were all amazed to sée the Knightly déeds of <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> whome they estéemed in equall degrée with <hi>Mars.</hi> The Kings receiued them all with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as they were wont to receiue such as were victors, increasing more their ioy with the hope they had to know what they were, who said that it should be done in the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. Then the gentle <hi>Lisarte</hi> caused to cut off the Pagans head, and made his Page to keep it til he came at the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, whither they went. And being all set down, the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Tharsian rose vp, &amp; with the head in his hand, went &amp; knéeled down before his Lady, who was the ioyfullest wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world, saying Sir Knight, <hi>Iupiter</hi> reward you for that you haue done this day for me; for me to reward you I will not binde my selfe thereunto, neither doe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that if I should venter my life for you it would bee a iust reward, considering what for me &amp; my father this day hath bin done by you &amp; your valorous frends, whome and you in the behalfe of these kings, I desire to pull off your helmes, and tell vs who you are, which shall be in regard of no duety, for that which is done is sufficient, but to leaue vs a memorie of your vertue and noblenes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:65"/>I am therewith content faire Princesse, said <hi>Lisarte</hi> more than this doth the time that you spent, when we were nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished together, bind mée vnto I am <hi>Lisarte</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tharsis,</hi> and haue not made my selfe known till such time as I had concluded this little seruice, which hath béene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto my strength, but not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. And therewith he pulled off his helme, which caused great consentment to all that were present, and his father had no end of ioy, in that he knew his sonne to bee so vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.</p>
               <p>The King (Father vnto the Princesse) séeing that the Prince of <hi>Tharsis</hi> was a mean to raise the siedge from his Cittie, and to obtaine so glorious a victory, hee went vnto the Princesse and taking her by the hand, he gaue her for spouse vnto the valiant Tharsian, whereof hee was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ioyous, and she no lesse delighted, which ioy I leaue to the consideration of true Louers.</p>
               <p>This gallant <hi>Lisarte</hi> when hee sawe his fortune sure, turned to his new and welbeloued spouse, and said for that worthy Princesse you shall bee more certified of my firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and with what truth you are estéemed: I haue tarried vnto this time, for to haue you girt me with my swoord, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Knight (pointing to the Troyan) gaue me the order of Knighthood: hee would not, neither I my selfe would suffer it, but at your hand: yet foorthwith I defied him to mortall battaile. Then he told them the occasion of the battaile, &amp; the agréement, whereat they all maruelled. But the faire Princesse because she would not be ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for that which the thrée knighets had done for her, said with a soueraigne grace. Welbeloued Lord I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, you knowe that if I loued you, I doe loue you should make it manifest to all the Knightes in the world. But yet I doe conclude this battaile, in that I sée you haue better occasion to make long frendship, then bréede any rigorous enemitie, in séeing what this knight &amp; his frends hath done for you, it is no iustice y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you so euil reward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:

In such sort it troubled this tender Ladie, that the conuersation of the Ladies was nothing pleasant vnto her, all her content is now to conferre with her cousin the Duchesse, and <hi>Alcisa</hi> (for so was the Damsell called) about her vnknown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. <hi>Alcisa</hi> comforted her with manie examples of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who merely hid their amorous gréefe, and obtained a quiet and honourable end, as the faire <hi>Oliuia,</hi> &amp; the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <hi>Claridiana:</hi> for saith she, in the sea of Loue they alone can tell how to saile in faire weather, that patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the tempests, knowing that in the end they shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the desired port.

know by experience they are beloued, before they make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie show of thankfulnes. This (said the Damsell) is the greatest errour that is made in Loues warre: for some in setting before them the simple poynt of honour, haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted their ioy into lamenting, and dyed solitarie, for that they would not liue companie. How much more doth the royall priuiledge of loue stretch farther than this? not iudging it dishonour to put backe a little honorable fame, for the content which loue bringeth.

               <p>Then flourished Knighthood in that Court more than in anie in all the world: the occasion was, that the King did intreate Strangers verie well, in giuing honour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those that deserued, lodging them within his Pallace: insomuch that all the Court was full of Knightes, who came at the fame and report of those Triumphs, and to behold the faire <hi>Grisalinda.</hi>

To this great Court did the prince of <hi>Phrigia</hi> come, being a yong knight &amp; of great strength: who trauelling to séeke aduentures, heard of triumphs, and purposed to shew his Knighthood.

               <p>The Challengers were the Dukes of <hi>Soma</hi> and <hi>Pera,</hi> and great prizes were ordained by the King, to be giuen to the best Deseruer.

               <p>When the appointed time was come, it séemed that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was a celestiall Cittie, so much and so excelent musike was heard therein.

When they came to their stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, manie Knights as wel Naturals as Strangers (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of honour) came foorth vnto the Iusts. The Duke of <hi>Soma</hi> was the first that began, against whom came a French Knight called <hi>Raymiro,</hi> on whom all people fixed their eyes. They each assaulted other with the force of their armes and swiftnes of their horse, till in the middest of the great place they made their incounter so mightely, that the Duke failed one stirrop, yet passed by, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Frenchman with a great fall vnto the ground. Then they greatly estéemed the Duke of <hi>Soma,</hi> for that the French Knight was knowen to be valiant. Then came foorth a Spanish Knight, called the stout <hi>Salandrio,</hi> who clasping well his legs, went against his Contrarie, where they made terrible encounters: the Spaniard lost his reynes, which was the occasion for them that knew him, the more to estéeme the Duke of <hi>Soma.</hi> They reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered each of them again a great speare, and with double courage assaulted one the other, that the people were all in doubt, till that in the midst of their course they incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in such sort, that the strong Spaniard lost his saddle, and the French-man his stirrops: yet in recouering, hée leapt vp on his horse againe verie lightly, giuing great content vnto his Ladie, who was ioyfull of that which her gallant Knight had done.

of his Ladie, his blowes were mortal, so that in ten courses hee ouerthrew eight Knights dead to the ground: till such time as on the one side of the place, came in that stout Pagan <hi>Pontenio</hi> King of <hi>Carthage,</hi> all in blew ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with white bends, and mounted vppon a mightie Roan horse.</p>
               <p>Of this Moore speaketh <hi>Artemidoro,</hi> who made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise vnto his Ladie, to trauell in the world two yeres in praise of her beautie, and to carie to <hi>Carthage</hi> al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> names of them he should ouercome, where she remained all the time that he trauelled in performing that rigorous &amp; hard promise. And for that he was absent, hee wore his armor of that colour, and on his shield the picture of Faith pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the heauens, with this posie.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>More than humane is thy hope,</l>

                  <l>Thine am I, and thou art mine.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This Kingly Moore caused much expectation of vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antnes at sight of his person: who entring the Lyst tooke a great speare, and spurring his fierce horse, they came &amp; made their encounter in the midst of their course, with so mightie blowes, that the Moore passed forwards vpright, without anie staggering, which made them all glad: but he of <hi>Pera</hi> made a little moouing in his saddle. Foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they tooke other speares, and with double courage they made their encounter, in such sort that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke came to the ground, the gyrths broken, and the saddle betwéen his legs, whereunto was attributed his fall. The Moore crossed to the counter lyst, his horse doubling vnder hym, but he recouered him verie lightly. The Duke put the fault in the gyrths, and would haue returned to the iust a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whereuppon they had like to haue come together, till such time as the Iudges did determine that it was an

ouerthrow. Then did they sound an infinite number of instruments, and (being a foote) the Moore mounted on his horse without putting anie foote in stirrop.</p>
               <p>There hee did tarrie the comming foorth of the other Maintainer of the Lysts: who came foorth with so much cholar, that all stood still to behold him: and not without some doubt to the faire <hi>Liciana,</hi> fearing to sée him in some perill.</p>
               <p>They encountred with the swiftnes of their horses, &amp; ioyned shiuering their speares into small splinters, &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by well setled. Other speares they tooke, and dyd the like, till such time as the Moore being angrie at so much delay, chose a great speare, and incountered the couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duke so strongly, that it did not profite him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued or amorous, but he must come to the ground: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went the Pagan frée, but receiued one of the greatest encounters that euer he sustained in all his life, so that if he had not embraced his horses necke, he had falne aswell as the Duke did. But in setling himselfe, he began to doo manie gallant trickes in the field, at the sounding of the instruments.</p>
               <p>In such sort he behaued himselfe, that before euening he ouerthrew to the ground more than thirtie well approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Knights, whereby hee was estéemed to bee one of the most valiantest Knights in all the world. And for that it was verie late, there was not anie Prince of worthines or estimation, that would make proofe of his valor till the next day.</p>
               <p>With great care was the discréet <hi>Alcisa</hi> all that daye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which she had promised vnto the Princesse <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salinda,</hi> and for to put it in effect, she intended the next day to goe foorth vnto the place appointed betwéen her and the frendly Knights.

                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:69"/>The night being well spent, they returned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and lighted at a house, whereas they left theyr horses in good order: so they pulled off their helmes, and wyth their strong habergins which they wore and their swords they went foorth to walk: and for that there was so much people, they were not looked at, neither their entring into the Pallace marked, whereas the braue Spaniard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himselfe with the sight of his Ladie and Mistres, and vnderstood the successe of the Iustes, with purpose to returne thether within two dayes. At their comming in the tables were taken vp, which was the occasion, that they might at ease content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in the sight of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for that the king did admit Dauncing that Night.

The Spaniard was gentle by nature, but being in high and louely imaginations, he answered: And thou knight, indued more with pride than good manners, doost not thou sée vs that are héere, and aske license for to come in. The Moore would not indure that answere euen of <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe: and therwith layed hand on his sword, as also did thrée or foure of his knights that came with him. But when the Dacian did sée that all the mirth was turned vpside downe, he quickly made a large way, for that at two blowes he ouerthrew two dead to the ground, and recouered the doore, because they should not be compassed about. The Spaniard who was verie desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the Carthaginian, reached him a little blow on the head, which was the occasion that all the kings Guard were in an vproare. The which these two Frends séeing with a trice they were in the Court yard: and making so good shift as they could, they left sixe dead, and so went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their lodging, til such time as the people in the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace were in quiet.</p>

               <p>The Spanish and Dacian Knights as they were yong men, and that their bloud wrought more in them tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sléep, would not goe to rest, till they had gone round about the Pallace, and for that it butted vpon so gallant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull gardens, they might there passe away the time, till the night were farther spent, and drew nigh to that quarter whereas the Ladies were, which butted towards the gardens.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Spaine</hi> knew it, for that hee was there before: and comming more nigher, they heard a deuine voyce, which at the recording of a Base, did sound verie swéetly, which gaue great comfort vnto the Princes: they were verie light, and giuing the one the other their hands they leapt into the Garden: being within they went by little and little till they came so nigh the windows, that they might discerne who played, which were thrée Ladies that stoode at an Iron grate window in the Moone-light: the one of them had a Lute, and beginning a new to sing, they came so nigh, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not onely they heard the musicke, but also what they did talke: and they heard one of them say.

The Princesse answered: Ah <hi>Orosia</hi> I am so fortuneles that I beléeue none is able to certifie what my soule requireth, or what my heart doth suffer, for as yet I know not whome to loue: it may be the Empresse of <hi>Trapisonde,</hi> or the péerelesse Quéene of <hi>Lira,</hi> who hath taken that armour, and pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>If this werr so, answered the Infant, that I knewe where to séeke reamedy, my griefe should not hurt me.

               <p>Ah my <hi>Acilsa</hi> said the Princesse, if you doe so you may reuiue soule: for now liuing I dye, hauing surrendred my wil haue no power, but to loue, &amp; there is no end set for this tempesttuous trauaile of my thought, I doe beléeue said <hi>Alcisa,</hi> that at these new triumphes, they being Knights and desirous of honor, first they will shewe their valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the Court before they will depart out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, whereas I know they haue found some remedie for the griefe they brought.</p>
               <p>Then they are amorrous answered the ielous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. No said the Damsell, but I heard them praise a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die much, and said they should neuer forget her, if memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie did not faile them, to remember the good which by her they had receiued. But séeing it groweth somewhat late, it shall be good that we depart, whereby the Ladies do not conceiue any thing of our long being heere, for it will be no small occasion of suspition.</p>
               <p>So they departed, leauing the two frends in obscure darkenes, séeing her absent that with her presence did ease those inward desires which the Spaniard suffered, although he was greatly content to haue séene by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the loue which the Princesse did beare him, that without knowing who he was, or any farther considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion she was so wholy surrendred to him, and feared hee would not omit her faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:71"/>Then the worthy Dacian said, Lord <hi>Torismunde,</hi> we may now goe with great securitie, &amp; worke some meanes to comfort your Lady, and it shall bee some ease to your griefe, in reuiuing her: to morrow we will be at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine against the Damsell come, and of her wee shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the order that wee must vse in this our busines, for by her helpe wee shall make the way easie to take her from <hi>France,</hi> carrying her for <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; considering with whome she is, her father will easily pardon her: and if it doe not chance to your content, they shal cut in péeces the Dacian Prince before they shal haue her from our power. With this they turned out of the garden, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their lodging, where as their Pages tarried for them, with great griefe for their long absence: but when they saw them they were glad, and slept quietly the rest of the night that remained: but at the breake of the day couering their armor because they would not be known, they went into the Forrest where as the Damsell should come, to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge what had passed in the court: Who in the morning being masked went foorth vpon her Palfrey, right vnto the place appointed, but missing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the way in wandring amongst the trées, foure knights met with her, who séeing her beautie and disposition, they would haue vnhorsed her, but she vsing the vsual weapon of women, cryed out, and the Princes did heare her, who were hard by.</p>
               <p>The braue Spaniard finding himselfe fullest armed, a foote as he was went vnto them: they were all aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the poore Damsell, who cryed out for succour. And when he came thether hee knew her not, but being choloricke, he put himselfe amongst them with his sword in his hand, saying: Away vile Knights, and laye no handes on the Damsell, if you doe you shall dye for it, and reaching the first vpon the head, in reward of his folly he cut it downe to the shoulders.</p>
               <p>The thrée which remained, séeing the death of their
<pb facs="tcp:13976:72"/>
companions, and that he was but one onely, drew their swoords and went to him.</p>
               <p>But this warlike youth so behaued himselfe amongst them, that he stroke the second such a blow vpon the arme that arms and swoord fell both to the ground, who séeing himselfe lamed, he beganne to cry out and runne into the forrest, whereas within a while after he yéelded vp the ghost: the other two purposing to be reuenged, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salted him. He séeing their ouermuch contempt, payed them in such sort, that at two blowes he made them beare the first company, with great content to the Damsell, for that she saw it was her knight. And taking off her maske she went vnto the Knight with her armes open, saying: I did well know Sir knight, that if any succour did come vnto me, it should be from this mightie arme. Happy <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> that hath come to knowe the best amonst knightes in her behalfe.</p>
               <p>This amorous <hi>Torismunde</hi> reioyced in his soule when hee sawe the Damsell and knewe her, and said vnto her with great content, those false Knights faire Damsell did not so much estéeme you as I doe, that so against your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and my content would haue displeased you. Thankes be to God Sir Knight, and your strength said shée, which gaue them their payment as they deserued, and according to my will, which shall bee alwaies ready in whatsoeuer for your content. At this time came the worthy Dacian with his swoord in his hand, whereat they did not a little laugh: and the Damsell said vnto him. It well appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth sir knight, who hath most care to doe mee frendship, for if I should haue tarried for you, I beléeue mine honor had bin lost, &amp; now I say that the lacke of care in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Ladies is verie euill, for at such time as it may bee lacked, that after it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be remedied with life, the which I would haue dispatched if these false knights had gon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with their rigorous intent: but séeing that betwéen you two there is so great frendship, it seemeth that being
<pb facs="tcp:13976:72"/>
remedied by your companion, I am bound to serue you both, which I wil do to my power. And therwith she decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red why she came to seeke them, and gaue them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of all that passed in the Court, and what the Prince of <hi>Phrigia</hi> purposed in loue towards <hi>Grisalinda.</hi> At which the Spaniard was so angry that he said, I vow that I wil no more put on armour if this go forwards, and foorthwith I will go paie him the reward of his boldnes. The Daci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an when hee saw him so determined, said, that hee should quiet himselfe, for that in these matters hast is not profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This knight is in <hi>France,</hi> and he cannot be so strong to resist vs: and séeing you haue not gone forth to the Iuste you may goe thether and deale with him. This Irefull Youth was somewhat appeased, but not in such sort, but that the Damsell plainly saw the good will which he had vnto the Princesse, and séeing it would not be taken in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill part she said. What is it to you gentle knight that the prince doth imploie his thoughts vpon <hi>Grisalinda</hi>? The Prince answered, to sée the euill he doth to an other in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to loue where he deserueth not. And how are you certaine (answered the Damsell) of this euill which he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? My poore armes giueth testimonie thereof (answered the Spaniard). Then sir knight you are he that excéedeth the prince of <hi>Phrigia</hi> in loue. Not him alone answered the youthful prince, but all the world: and vpon this I wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the field with all the world.

I should doe verie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill worthy knights (said the Damsell) if I knew not my duty therin, &amp; I wil put my life in hazard for your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents and for that you shalbe certified of al, know that your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is beloued, my Mistres affecteth him without know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing who he is: there is no need to kéep in secret who ye are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:73"/>And there with shee declared vnto them all that passed the night before, and all was to know who they were: but the Prince desired her on his part, to doe his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation vnto the gentle Dutches of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to certifie her what he pretended to doe in her seruice. Then they agréed that the Damsel should returne, and certifie them that they would bee at the iustes. So putting themselues in a secret place of the forrest to repaire their armour, they saw come foorth of the fame, a Damsell mounted on a great horse, and before her a fardell, and when she came vnto them she said vnto the Dacian. Worthy <hi>Heleno,</hi> the wise man my Lord and thy faithfull fréend doth send thée this armour, for that thou shouldst this day in the French Court, shew the royall bloud from whence thou didst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed. And to you Prince of <hi>Spaine</hi> for that he vnderstands you shall giue him great ayde and succour, he sendeth you another where with you shall make the beginning of your ease: and all other matters he wisheth you to leaue to his power, for that he will doe therein as for myselfe. So without tarrying any answere shee returned like the winde, and they lost the sight of her quickly: with great ioy the knights tooke the armour, and left theirs hidden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the bushes, and with the help of the Damsell they were armed, that shee might know them and giue aduise vnto the Princesse when they came thether: so with this agréement they tooke their leaue of her, and returned to rest themselues a little, and eate of that which their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had brought, ere they went to the Iustes, the which at that time was begun so strongly that it gaue content to al the beholders: for the mightie King of <hi>Carthage</hi> was one of the strongest in all the country of Moores, This gallant Moore changed his armor, and put on one of a russet colour striped with gréen, bordred with blew vpon his shield was there a Phenix hard by his Lady, with this Posie.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:73"/>This gallant <hi>Carthaginian</hi> entred to be looked on: and after hee had compassed the Court, with a fierce counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce he put himselfe at the Lyst end to abide the Iusts. There wanted no Knights to be in readines, and the first that would prooue himselfe was the famous Lord of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramonte,</hi> armed with strong armor, mounted on a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie horse: who taking a speare, came and encountred his Contrarie so strongly, that they both staggered in theyr saddles, and the French Knight lost one stirrop. But for that he was valiant, they iusted againe: but it happened otherwise than he thought, for he fell on the ground wyth shame. Straight there entred in his place a gentle knight of <hi>Almaine</hi> called <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> who had thrée courses wyth the King, but in the end he left his saddle. Then entered the mightie <hi>Baldomes,</hi> armed in carnation armour, and his deuice in his shield was a bloodie sword. Hee beeing knowen of all, they said that there would be the best iusts of all that day.

And from that time he began to doo such wonders, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> before it was one a clocke in the afternoone, hee had ouerthrowen sixtéene knights. Then changed he his horse, and tarrying the Iust with a great speare, he saw enter on the one side of the place two knights, the gallantest proportioned that he had séene, &amp; mounted vpon mightie horses. He on the right hand séem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee most corpolent, and was armed with a shining armour of an euill coloured yeolow, but in riches verye strange. All the buttons and workes were of white and red, which in the Sunne showed gallantly, and could not be well discerned for the rich stones it had. There was a Groue painted on his shield, out of the which came foorth a Ladie with a sword in her hand, as thogh she wold wound

               </q>
               <p>His Companion (who shewed no lesse grace and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantnes than the first) was armed in armour quartered like a chesse with blue and gold: there was set about the quarters diuers kinds of precious stones, and all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioints were lion tawney, and on his shield a shining heauen, &amp; in the middest a Pellican, cherishing her birds with her owne blood, hauing this Motto.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Open thy breast, thou gentle Pellican,</l>
                  <l>And change we harts: els dyes a fainting man.</l>
               </q>
               <p>These gallant Knights at their entrie gaue great hope: who crossing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place with their speares tipped with sharp and bright stéele, rid till they came to the galleries, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Princesse was, who was féeding her sight wyth that ioyfull obiect. Unto whom, the two Knights (when they passed by) did their obeysance with a souereigne gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantnes: whereat the Ladies did somewhat raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from their seates. The discréet <hi>Alcisa</hi> did very wel know them, for that she saw them armed in the Forrest: and now hauing occasion to speake for her Knightes, for that the passionated Princesse did aske her if shee knewe them? she answered: Madam, I doo know them: for he with the Pellican is that happie Knight of the blacke ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to whom are due all good aduentures in the world, and whom of right I am bound to serue, for that he did not onely deliuer me yesterday from death, but did also defend my honour from foure rude knights that were desirous to spoyle it: and in payment of their boldnes he slew them, giuing me afterwards plainly to vnderstand, that he doth
<pb facs="tcp:13976:74"/>
liue amorous, and wil haue no other content, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which commeth of loue, accounting you for his naturall owner, not desiring other reward, more than the glorie of your thought. I did well beléeue my <hi>Alcisa</hi> (answered the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ladie) that in yéelding my affaires to your charge, there could nothing redownd vnto mée, but that which should be comfortable: and there is small néede to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade mee to that which I estéeme as my life. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue said the faire Duches, that <hi>Alcisa</hi> will show her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto the Knight of the Blacke armour, séeing shee did not onely learne of him that hee loued, but also I beléeue she told him that he was beloued. <hi>Alcisa</hi> answered, I wil stand for my knight, and deale in his affaires as for mine owne, and more earnestly, hauing occasion. But thys I would that you would consider of, for I told him that hee might come this night and talke with vs by the Garden, whereas yesternight we were singing. Ah speak no such thing answered <hi>Grisalinda,</hi> for to imagine it is a gréeuous offence to my reputation. There can be no offence nor danger said the Damsell, séeing you loue and they knowe the place. For you shal vnderstand, that yesternight they heard all your singing and conference. Therefore séeing your affection is to him manifest, let me perswade you to méete and conferre, whereby you may know who hee is, and if there be no disparagement in his birth, I know not wherefore you should refuse to receiue him for the knight of your seruice. And now let vs looke what they doo, for I am certainly assured that these Iustes will be lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to some.</p>
               <p>So all thrée (the better to talke of their loue) did put themselues together, and beheld the knights, at such time as the mightie knight of the Groue (for so wee will call the Dacian) came and talked with the knight of the Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, (which was the Spanish Prince): and his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was to this effect, that he wold let him haue the first Iustes, in the mean time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he contemplated on his Lady,
<pb facs="tcp:13976:75"/>
who apparelled all in russet tinsell with manie and costly stones, was leaning on her breast at the window, and a garland vpon her haire, which séemed like <hi>Ariadnes</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet that beautifies the heauen. The bodies of her gown were somewhat open, and part of her snowie breast ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to her knight, who had pitched the great end of his speare on the ground to behold that swéete prospect, wyth so great negligence, that it caused all the people to say, he séemed as good a Louer as a Warrier.</p>
               <p>With this the worthie Dacian came to the victorious Pagan, and said: Gentle knight, seeing this is the office of Gallants in seruice of Ladies, I would know if the Iusts be frée for all perils? So that you would agrée (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Moore) that it might be from the Tilt, I am content. You vnderstand me right said the Dacian, let it be at your pleasure: and therewith they went into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great Court, taking big speares with bright stéelie heads: so that all had great regard vnto their incounters, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the knights were of great force.</p>
               <p>Being in the great Court, they came to méete with so mightie incounters, that it séemed vnto all and vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues especially, that their armour had broken to péeces. The Moore made his incounter in the midst of the Daci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans shield, with so worthie a blow, that he made hym fall backwards on the buttockes of his inchaunted horse, and if the speare had taken a little more hold, hee had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen him: but he incountred the strong Moore in such sort, that (piercing his breast-plate with a little wound) he ouerthrew him to the ground. He was no sooner falne, but he rose vp againe with all lightnes possible with hys sword in his hand, abiding his Contrarie, who with an easie pace on his horse came gretly amazed at that strong incounter: and at his comming the Moore said vnto him. Knight, thou art bound to perform the battel with swords, séeing it was at all perills. I doo not now receiue anie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therein (answered the Dacian) for that we will not
<pb facs="tcp:13976:75"/>
trouble other Knights that would iust: for they that doo demaund battell in generall Iustes, make show as if they before had some perticular defiance, which hath not béen betwéene you and me, but for that the Tilt was somwhat troublesome, I desired the open place, onely at more ease to prooue my launce. This Knight hath reason in all hys spéech said the Iudges, and is not bound to admit the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, not hauing anie will thereunto. Then you doo mee wrong, answered the Moore. Let it not greeue you sayd the Dacian Prince, for if you thinke to receiue such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by triall of a battell. I will abide your comming ten dayes hence within the woodes of <hi>Ardenia,</hi> where if you doo not ease your stomacke, it shall be your owne fault, &amp; none in mée for the performing of my word. Let it be as thou wilt answered the Moore, although I should receiue greater pleasure if it might bee now. Well, since thou wilt néedes said the Prince, mount vpon thy horse, and he that first looseth his saddle or anie part thereof, let hym be ouercome, and remaine at the will of the other. This is great curtesie said the Moore, and so with a trice he mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his horse, and put hand to his sword, and imbracing his shield he went against the Dacian: who met him, and together they strooke such blowes, that they humbled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to their saddle bowes. All that were in the great pallace stood still to behold that cruell battell, sauing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the amorous Spaniard, whose powers of his body wer all in suspence, remaining onely glad by sight to get ease for his soule. Whereat the gracious princesse receiued no small content, to sée him so busied onely in beholding her beautie. The worthie <hi>Heleno</hi> raised vp himselfe very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly for the great blow hee had receiued, and séeing that in giuing and receiuing of blowes was onely a delaye of the battell, and a cause not to giue place to his Frend for to doo that which was reason, he determined to aduenture it vpon one alone blow, trusting in the strength and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of his inchaunted horse, and therewith séeing that
<pb facs="tcp:13976:76"/>
the Moore retourned more furious than a lyon, hee made show as though he would stand and abide him, and at the time he should receiue the blow, hee spurred forward hys light horse, and made him at a spring to enter so nigh, that the Moore could not strike him, but with the hilt and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell of his sword: and although it was such a blow as the Dacian felt, yet it was more troublesome for the Moore, for that hee felt his wrist thereby greatly pained. Thys skilfull Youth desired no other thing, but at that instaunt stretching foorth his left arme, he let fall his shield, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing time, he laid his strong hands on the Moore, and held him so fast, and so quickly spurd forward his furious horse, that ere he returned to himselfe, the Prince carried hym by the armes out of the saddle, with a great shout of them that were in the Court, publishing his valour. In this sort he carried him vnto the place whereas the Iudges were, demaunding of them if hee were bound to doo anie more? No of truth sir Knight said they, for yours is the honor of the battell in the face of all the world. The Pagan made no reply, but desired to returne and prooue himselfe again with the Knight, and defied him to mortall battell, which the Iudges would not suffer. The Prince with quiet pace put himselfe into the Court, choosing no iusting speares, but speares of fine and pure stéele. There lacked not some Knights, which were come thether desirous to get honor, who prooued their aduentures with the prince, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son all went on his side, some he left without life by his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous incounters, and others without anie desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and prooue him againe: till such time as they saw thrée Knights, euerie one in a sundrie part to enter into the Court. Hee that came first was the prowd <hi>Tribano</hi> King of <hi>Argier,</hi> although after he humbled himselfe to the amorous yoake of <hi>Cupide,</hi> and thereby lost a great part of his pride: and so now he went séeking at whose hands he should loose it altogether, and by chance his good Fortune brought him to the Dacian Youth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:76"/>He came armed in purple armour full of gréene A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes, and of great price. There was painted vpon hys shield the God <hi>Cupid,</hi> with that rigorousnes as in aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time he was painted, with his bow &amp; golden arrowes, his face somwhat discouered, and he compassed about with foure most furious lions, whom he séemed to lead bound in a slender thrid, with this posie.</p>

               </q>
               <p>All remained greatly delighted with the Deuice on his shield, as wel as at his gallant disposition: for in showing it he put himselfe to encounter with the Dacian, parting the one from the other with the lightnes of their horses, &amp; méeting in the middest of their course, they gaue heauie blowes, but they passed with great swiftnes without anie moouing: the like hapned at the second and third courses. Then taking new launces, they encountred so stronglye, that their speares with a thousand shiuers flew into the ayre, and they méeting together with their horses, it séem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as though a great house had fallen downe. And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength of the princes horse was so great, there was no resistance found in his contrarie, but that hee and his Owner came to the ground, and the prince staggered so on the one side, that hee could not stay himselfe: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not be noted, hée tooke it for the best reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to leape from his horse, the people giuing a ioyfull cry, for they all affected him verie much. By this time the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Spaniard had left his loue-trance, &amp; seeing his frend afoote, spurred his horse with such grace, that the sight of the ladies followed him. When hée came to <hi>Heleno,</hi> hee intreated him to giue place, that he might as well mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his strength, as he had showen his loue.

                  </gap>ts, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to get more honour of that new Knight, than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel that was past. The first which entred was the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who did meruailously affect the faire <hi>Orosia.</hi> This Moore came in red armour, full of golden Sunnes, their beames stretching foorth with diuers cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which beautefied the show: and on his shield there was a nosegay of flowers, which a faire hand séemed to giue vnto a knight that stood before it, with this posie.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>From this hand there commeth flowers,</l>
                  <l>That comfort all my vitall powers.</l>
               </q>
               <p>They came the one against the other so fast as their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses could runne, and encountred with so great force, that it séemed to the Spaniard hee was run cleane thorough: but the valiant Moore descended to séek flowers in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field, hauing it destined, for that the encounter séemed to come from the hands of death: and rising vp with shame, foorth he went, purposing to giue as much occasion of wéepyng as there was then of laughter.</p>
               <p>There is no question but the princesse reioyced at this, to whom <hi>Orosia</hi> sayd: It séemeth vnto me (fair princesse) your knight hath handled his affaires to day with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reinforcing his courage by your beautie in the tyme he spent in beholding you, whilest his Frend did kéep the place of Iusts. At least answered the amorous Ladie, if the content which he receiued in the beholding it, should
be the occasion of courages increasing, I doo assuredlye beléeue, that he alone will ouerthrow all the knights pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p>Foorthwith appeared another gallant knight, being a valiant Tartarian, cousin vnto the vnhappie <hi>Zoylo,</hi> that was slaine in the woods of <hi>Grecia</hi> by the hands of <hi>Brufal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro,</hi> about the armour of <hi>Bramarant.</hi> He came in quest of his kinsman, and vnderstanding of his death, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Tartarie,</hi> for that he did inherit the kingdome,

                  <hi>Zoylo</hi> being dead, and remained no lesse affectioned vnto the Gréeks then his cosin, and did shew it at due time, that to him they did owe the restoring of Gréece. He was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the curteous <hi>Andronio,</hi> who came vnto the Spaniard and said, gentle Knight, I shal receiue great curtesie that before we do Iuste, you tel mee, if you bee any of the Gréeke Princes: for that my Launce shall bee more to serue them, then offend them.</p>
               <p>Of truth Sir knight (answered the generous Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard) I would bee one of them if it were but to inioy your frendship, I am none of them, although I hold my selfe for one of their frends.</p>
               <p>Then I request you gentle Knight, that our Iuste may be with speares of Iuste, for that I haue sworne by the faith of knighthood, neuer to them nor to any of their frends to be contrarie for the frendship which they kept and doe kéepe with the mightie <hi>Tartarian Zoylo,</hi> whose body they haue in their Country. I am content Sir Knight to doe it in this, and in all what you please shall be granted: so they went to take each of them a Lance, he pendring in his mind of the force of vertue, that bringeth with it peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of so farre and remote Countries. And taking their Speares they returned the one against the other, with the swiftnes of their horses, and broke their speares, as though they had runne against a Rocke, without any harme dooing, and the like vnto the third, then they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred on their shields so strongly, that they came vnto the ground, although the Spaniard with the reines in his hand, went to helpe the Tartare, whose horse was slaine with the blowe, and had one of his legges vnder him. And pulling it out, he gaue him the preheminence of the battaile, requesting him for to remaine in his place. The which although he did estéeme it, yet he wold not do it: he was foorthwith serued of another horse in the behalf of the King, for that the Spaniard would not mount on his, til such time as it was brought to him, for he esteemed
<pb facs="tcp:13976:78"/>
him much, neither would the Moore goe foorth of the place for the content he had of the knight, but foorthwith tooke of a sandal that was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his shield, &amp; discouered the fairest figure that might bee imagined. Which was the face of a woman, the most bright and shining in the world, insomuch that there were few in the place that might behold it, the brightnes was such, and taking it in his handes, he went vnto the Spanish knight, and gaue it him, saying: Gentle knight, now is accomplished that which a wise man of my Countrie told me, that I should loose my liberty with my shield, which I should giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the first knight that should ouerthrow mee, and now it seemeth that it is performed. I would it were better for you: for whereas it was giuen mee, it was in some esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Because I will not doe any thing to gainsay your will gentle knight (said the Spaniard) I take it, and I giue you mine to vse in exchange, and I would faine win an owner that would sustaine it with the honor as hee which doth giue it hath done, and so gaue him his, and took that of the Tartare, and neuer King receiued a better gift.</p>
               <p>The faire Spaniard reioyced at the heart, when hee sawe howe well it became him for his doubtfull Loue: there was neuer Louer that had the like, and noting the faire face that was vpon the shield, it séemed it was the face of <hi>Grisalinda.</hi> And in reading the Posie that was in it, he vnderstood that it was agréeable to his imagination, and this it was.</p>

               <p>The Duke entred with the same colour, mounted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mightie, Fleabitten horse, the best that was in al that place (besides those of the two frends) with many plumes vpon his head and helme.

               <p>In this sort he passed by the Ladies, whereas was his faire wife, who knew not were she was with ioy to sée her gentle and welbeloued Lord, so well proportioned. The Irefull Spaniard did know him by his deuise, which was a Sea, and in the middest of it a beauteous gally, and on the one side of it a Lady who gaue her hand to a knight that was in the Sea, with this Embleme.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:79"/>The Spaniard answered: My Launce (worthy Duke) is not accustomed, to seaze on that which his maister lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, I desire not your hurt, but doe offer in what I may to doe you seruice.</p>
               <p>Euery one did much praise the knight, imagining cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely who it should be: but the Dutchesse when she saw the curtesie that hee vsed with the Duke, said vnto the Princesse, from this day forwards faire <hi>Grisalinda,</hi> if yée were importuned to fauour the knight of the faire portra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (for so wee wil cal him) do not let this kindnes to the Prince my husband be vnrequited: for hence foorth for his valor and curtesie I wil euer study to giue him his desert. For this Lady (said the Damsell <hi>Alcisa</hi>) wherefore doe you leaue mee out in so iust a demaund: who doth owe more vnto the Knight of the faire Portrature than I? if he deliuered you from prison, he deliuered me from death and dishonor: so that on this wee must contend. And I will call in my ayde the Knight of the groue, for although we are in one opinion, touching loue towards him, I know not from whence is taught this heresie in the law of loue, there must onely be one beloued. With such helpers answered the yéelded Lady, it is not vnlike but that the Knight shall obtaine his méeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for here is nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured but for his content: yet let some looke to the fame of <hi>Grisalinda,</hi> since nowe the Princesse of <hi>France</hi> is in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
               <p>Their swéet conuersation was cut-off, for that the Sun was about to bathe her selfe in the West Ocean, and then there entred on the one side of the great Court, to the number of thirtie Knights, al with vpper signes of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

So that he came to defie them to mortall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</p>
               <p>In passing thorough the place, hee went directly vnto the Knight of the faire portrature and said to him. I wold know Sir knight the reward that shall bee giuen to him that shall conclude these feastes. The honor of a victor (said the Prince) and he to remain as most valiant, which is enough. This is for them that séeke honor (answered the iealous Moore) and not for him that hath attained to the top of honor, so that it séemeth vnto me all your glorie is but little, for that I wyll depriue ye of it in this place.</p>
               <p>Thou commest with more confidence than is reason (answered <hi>Torismundo</hi>) and séeing thou wilt challenge me, let our prize be the head each of the other. Thou art conformable vnto my desire (said the Pagan) and turning about his horse, he went against the Youth, who taking a great Lance, burnished the head in the sight of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, &amp; knowing that that Moore was he that desired to be her louer, he made his encounter with so famous a blow, that both Moore and horse fell both to the ground, hauing his louing brest pearced thorough with the speare, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at all began to make a still murmuring, to sée the horse of the <hi>Phrigian</hi> Prince ouer throwne at one blow: those that came with him, who vnder their sad deuise were all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, trusting in that they were so many, assalted the Prince with a heauie lamentation, saying: make dye that euill knight, in recompence of the death hee hath giuen to our welbeloued Lord.</p>
               <p>Some encountred with him, and some threwe their
<pb facs="tcp:13976:80"/>
speares at him so strongly, that they almost heaued him out of his saddle, but being settled he pulled out his sword, and went against them, striking the first such a blowe, that he made him beare his master companie, cleauing his head downe to the necke, and from that time hee so dealt, that heauie it was for him who durst abide him, for that eyther without death or a lamentable life in being lame he went not from him.</p>
               <p>The gentle Dacian and the mightie Tartare, séeing the villanie of those knights, went to ayde him, but there had béen no néed, if the king had not sent his guard to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them: knowing certainely that it was the prince of <hi>Phrigia</hi> that was slain, vnto whom he did not beare so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil will, but that he thought to haue bestowed his daughter on him: but the thrée valiant warriers bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so to vse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that verie few or none of the Phrigians remained: but by reason that the number of Courtiers were great, they were driuen to helpe themselues by the lightnes of their horse. The Dacian was behinde and the other two before, returning at fit times with such furie, that still they ouerthrew two or thrée to the ground, till such time as they got foorth into the plaine, where pricking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes with their horses, they were quickly a good way from them of the Citty, leauing them matter to talke of for many daies. So they put themselues in the thickest of the mountaine, whereas they stayed to sée if they could discerne any body: and finding themselues in securitie, they alighted, and the two Frends went and embraced the Tartarian <hi>Andronio,</hi> to whome the Spaniard said. I would sir knight that this fauor, which fortune hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs, in giuing vs your ayde, might so continue that absence might not take it from vs. It is I that do gaine answered the curteous Tartare, to inioy so good copanie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will not say frendship, for that in me there is no deserte. I is so great answered the Dacian, that it is a vantage for vs to shut vp the perfect number of frends with so great
<pb facs="tcp:13976:80"/>
and curteous a knight: &amp; then they began to giue each other to vnderstand of their doings, vniting betwéene them so great frendship, that indured for euer.</p>
               <p>Therewith their Pages tooke out victuals to eate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the gréene grasse, such dainties as the discréet <hi>Alcisa</hi> had brought them, and so passed away the little part of the euening that remained, in swéete conuersation, which is neuer more excellent that among vertuous Frendes. So that some auncient writers put humane felicitie in hauing frends. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great gaue great shewe of this content, when it was demaunded of him, whether he most reioyced, in that he was Lord ouer all the world, or to haue many frends? He answered, to haue frends, for that with them hee had gotten the name to bee called great. A saying worthy of such a Prince.</p>
               <p>Now returning to the thée that remained in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, hauing no other desire amongst them, but the one to giue content vnto the other.</p>
               <p>The Dacian said vnto the Tartare: Tell vs gentle knight are you in loue for? those that bee subiecte vnto the lawes of loue, cannot possibly passe the night but in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging where their heart is: and if it bee in this Countrie, you haue no better occasion to speake than now.</p>
               <p>I am a stranger in this Countrie worthy Prince (answered the Tartare) and as yet I haue had no time to beholde the beautie which hath béene tolde mée is therein, so that I thanke you there is no néede of this trouble.</p>
               <p>If it be so (answered the Spaniard) it would bee a griefe to request you to goe with vs to the Citty, to help a louer. It shall not be gréeuous (answered the curteous <hi>Andronio</hi>) but rather a ioy, to imploy my person in your content.</p>
               <p>Well then (said the Dacian) wee may not stay: and
<pb facs="tcp:13976:81"/>
therewith they left their helmes, and onely with their corselets couered with their Pages cloakes and their swoords, they went vnto the Citie: the which they found all in a vprore for the death of the Prince of <hi>Phrigia</hi> and his knightes, and none could euer imagine who they were that should doe it: so putting themselues amongst others they went into the Pallace, where as they saw the king, who commaunded, that they should with great diligence séeke out the thrée knights, that he might know who they were.</p>
               <p>There they vnderstood how that the king, to take some refreshing, would the next daye with the Princesse goe foorth to a house of pleasure which was in the Forrest, which gaue great content vnto the Princes, thereby thinking to haue better opportunitie. Thus they passed a great part of the night, till it was time to goe toward the garden, and when they were all thrée come thether, the Prince of <hi>Dacia</hi> leapt vpon a wall, and gaue his hand to the rest, so they entred with great content vnto the Tartare, that they would admit him in a busines of such import. The two knights went softly towards the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, where they heard a noise, by which they thought that <hi>Alcisa</hi> was tarrying for them, and the Princes: but it was nothing so, for it was the Quéene of <hi>Holand,</hi> and her daughter the faire <hi>Grisanea,</hi> cosin vnto <hi>Grisalinda</hi> (for that their mothers were sisters) who were in swéet conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the windows: and to heare what they said, they all drew nigh vnto a bush of Roses, wheras they might heare what the French Lady said. It had bin great glory for this Court faire cosin <hi>Grisalinda,</hi> if this day you had béen héere to honor it with your beauty, although the knights should haue receiued griefe at your sight. Whereas your beautie was gentle princesse (answered the frée Lady) mine wold haue made small shew but onely increase yours the more.</p>
               <p>This is good faire <hi>Grisanea,</hi> said <hi>Orosia</hi> to sée howe you liue deceiued, in the great quantitie, which nature hath

bestowed on you, in making you the best and most estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and now you come to compare with vs that haue the least. My Cousin and these Ladies of <hi>France</hi> are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for your long stay, for that your absence gaue place to them to be looked at, yea and estéemed, in drawing after them the eyes of those braue Aduenturers, as well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned for loue, as to ayd and succour Ladies.

If with the like passion that you praise him (faire Damsell) he regard your beauty said <hi>Grisanea,</hi> without all doubt he hath born away for reward the freedome of your will. There is no néed to giue hym that said <hi>Alcisa,</hi> that so long since hath béen put into hys hands, as into the hands of the best Knight in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, and he which hath most done for the honour of <hi>France</hi>: and to serue him all the dayes of my life shall be my glory, and I will thinke all my trauell ease. If this Knight had his Ladie héere said the Hollandesse, he had little néed for to watch, hauing so earnest a Frend for him as you, he may liue without care of the great woe that those are woont to haue, which he touched with this passion. I perceiue by this said the French Ladie, you know well this euill by experience, for that ther is none that can cast these doubts, but they that haue felt Loues gréefe. Things are known ladie said <hi>Grisanea,</hi> without experience, for we may iudge of them by report. Not touching the euill that Louers do suffer said <hi>Orosia,</hi> for that it neuer commeth to a certayne and limitted end: for when the Louer thinketh his pain is pittied after he hath spent his life therein, he is still abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I beléeue Madame said <hi>Grisanea,</hi> you that haue bin such a seruant to Loue, can tell all the troubles thereof. Faire Princesse answered the Sauoyan Lady, I hope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="tcp:13976:82"/>
to sée the time, that you may talke by costly experience, and not be beléeued so easely, as you beléeued me, without knowing my glorie or gréefe. And in recompence hereof, in the behalfe of these Ladies, I doo request you to let vs bee pertakers of your voyce: for according as it is héere sayd, there is not the like to bee heard in this Countrey. You shall sée Madam said <hi>Grisanea,</hi> I will obey you in all I may, but I shall now put you out of all doubt my voyce is not so good as it is reported. And there with she tooke a harpe, and began to tune it with so excellent order and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement, that her gracing the gracious concord, began new discords in the princely Tartarian, who prepared his hart to giue in recompence for faire <hi>Grisaneas</hi> musique. Pittie it was to sée the amorous Princes new passion, but on these greéefes tis bootlesse to shew compassion, for the beloued onely can giue ease. The faire Ladie began, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the heauens a witnes: who reioycing at her musick, did with their influence inspire the harts of all that were present, kindling in them new cares of loue, &amp; more than all the rest the gentle Tartarian was rauished, his magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal armour not being sufficient to withstand it, but her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine voyce penetrated his soule.</p>

               <p>This frée Ladie had scarce concluded to make show of her libertie, being shortly after taken by the gallant Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian, when as the faire <hi>Grisalinda</hi> said. Wee liue not héere (gallant Princesse) with so much fréedome, nor in our Court doo we estrange the contents of loue: for wee sée with how much sharpnes those are chastised that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themselues for rebells against imperious loue: but though we be not snared, we feare the time, and so maye you shortly for all your disdaine. We haue had manie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs that haue to day abhorred loues lawes, and to morrow repented it, accusing their rashnes, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the same, as to a Prince, to whom now they pay iust tribute. And for that I doo desire it, I should reioyce to sée you begin to loose some what of your strangenes, for that I am perswaded, with some new meanes Loue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to demaund accompt of the time you haue spent from vnder his banner and seruice. Let vs not put her in so much feare said the faire <hi>Orosia,</hi> for that in flying from it she may finde a partie whereon to imploy her thought, and not finding him, hold her selfe happie, if shee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knowen so much libertie. Then said <hi>Alcisa</hi> wil I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, to sée how that is admitted which now so earnestly she condemneth: and taking the harpe out of her hand, shee gaue it vnto the Princesse <hi>Grisalinda,</hi> who tooke it, saying. I know not (faire Cousin) whether in behalfe of Louers I can say anie thing, with an instrument tuned with so frée hands. The thrée Knights attended hir song, and verie earnest was the Tartarian, who said vnto his Frends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:83"/>I doo not meruaile that in <hi>France</hi> there bee so valiaunt Knights, for that there be Ladies to animate those whom they loue, and kill them that they scorne. In this sort said the Dacian ther is vantage in louing, if from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth to be valiant. And perceiuing some new passion had hapned to him in hearing them sing, hee said: Come nigher, let vs heare what they will say in fauour of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. The Tartarian if it had not béene for discouering them, would haue exclaimed against loue, because yet his wound was gréene, but so it festred, that at length he proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the truest louer of his time. The Spaniard was so desirous to heare his Ladie, that he scarce heard what past betwéene them, yet hee and the Moore at last went verye nigh the window. When she began to play, shee gaue a heauie sigh, as a request to beg attention of him, whom she little thought to be so néere her.</p>

               <p>God deliuer me (said <hi>Orosia</hi>) that I should impart my thoughts vnto so frée a Ladie, for she neither knoweth how to ease gréefe, nor rightly to pittie the grieued. When I see (faire <hi>Grisanea,</hi> said the French Princesse) that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of your Louer dooth paine and gréeue you, then shal you finde me a comforter, and I will giue you knowledge of that little loue I haue: and I am so certain that it will be shortly, that I shall not erre ere long to say: God giue you ioy of your alteration. Meane while let vs depart, for feare we be too long mist. They gone, the Tartare stood confounded at the grace of <hi>Grisanea:</hi> at length he said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Frends. Of truth worthie Princes, although I had verie earnestly iniurde you, yet you could not haue taken better reuengement, than to bring me to a place where I haue lost my libertie, not knowing who hath tooke mee captiue. The harme is so common (sir Knight answered the Spaniard) that it is estéemed as the most certainest thing among Gallants, which professe the seruice of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. But it is so strange to me (answered the Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) that I cannot iudge thereof, but according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gréefe which it causeth. Thus conferring, and on the death of the <hi>Phrigian</hi> Lord, they tarried the retourne of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, who likewise gréeued, that the Princes were forced to giue so long attendance.</p>
               <p>At last they came both in their petticoates vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, the princely Ladie trembling to sée her selfe before her beloued Knight, imagining what offence she did vnto her fame, in comming in such sort: but the amorous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion did ouercome all, so that they came vnto the window without feare, and made a little noyse for a signe. So the
<pb facs="tcp:13976:84"/>
prince came vnto the window, which was somwhat low, and hauing no power to speake a word, he knéeled on his knées, demaunding her hands to kisse. They both remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned silent, which thing is common betwéene them that loue well: for when they méete, their eyes onely speake, their tungs are mute. The Ladie, séeing his dumbe pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, making strength of weaknes, said: I would not sir Knight, that my comming hether at so vnfit an hower should cause you to iudge it rather rashnes, than the bond wherein I stand bound to you for the good you haue done me. Besides, <hi>Alcisaes</hi> perswasion, is the greatest cause of this boldnes. Deuine Princesse (answered the fearefull Youth) I sée well, that your excellence intendeth euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly to binde mee more and more by your manie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. That I should conceiue either rashnes or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in this your humble visitation of mee, were agaynst my soule irreligious sacriledge, and against your deuine curtesie vnpardonable blasphemie. I rather blesse my Fates, that haue reserued me to this happie hower, honor your pittie that hath respected my passions, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my dutie to <hi>Alcisa</hi> for solliciting my sute so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Your owne deserts sir knight said <hi>Alcisa,</hi> was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the solliciter in your loues sute. I for my life and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious honours preseruation, am till my death your boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hand maid. And though vppon my soule I durst vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that neuer anie disloyall thought will enter into your couragious breast, yet is my Mistres charie of thys loue bargaine, for gentle knight, manie knights haue dealt vngently with gentle Ladies. Therefore ye must protest déeply ere she will beléeue, and kéepe religiouslye what you doo protest.</p>
               <p>Ah gentle Damsell said the Spanish Prince, to myne harts sorrow your eyes haue béen the witnes. And if yee doubt me, I sweare by the religion of true knighthood, by all the vnstained honour of rightfull armes, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous remembrance of my thrice reuerent Predecessors,
<pb facs="tcp:13976:84"/>
if <hi>Grisalinda</hi> will be gracious to her vowed knight, of a more constant seruant should no Lady in the whole world boast.</p>
               <p>I doo confesse sir knight said the princesse that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely bound vnto you, and your vowes I verely beléeue for true, but you shall pardon me for setting my affection, much more for plighting my faith to a knight whom I know not. Souereigne princesse said the Spaniard, after I had séene you, and that this Damsell declared vnto mée your worthines, I haue procured things that redound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your honour, séeking the certainest meanes to performe the same, and I haue not found any thing with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than to put my life in your seruice, and desire no other paiment but your acceptance. Touching my birth, I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you I am the Sonne of a most royall king, and sole Heire of a rich and populous kingdome, all which hopes with my true hearts spotlesse loue I humbly offer at your féete.</p>
               <p>The Princesse held her peace awhile, pondering the weightines of the cause: but the discréet <hi>Alcisa</hi> said vnto her, You néed not Madam make anie stay hereat, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his sute, although it be the greatest curtesie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may be granted: I will be his suretie he will be thankfull, and neuer contradict your pleasure, séeing with what plainnes you doo accept him. And therewithall perforce shee tooke her hands, and gaue them vnto the Prince, who inclosed them in his, not hauing anie power to speake, till y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse said. At my pleasure I make no question but I shal be reuenged for so manifest wrong done thus against my will.</p>
               <p>The prince séeing her somewhat angrie, sayd: Faire Ladie, if the righting of these wrongs must bee satisfied with my death, let me now receiue it, and I will account it welcomer than death. And therefore (answered the princesse) will I not this time with deserued death punish you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:85"/>Doo not procéed anie farther said the Damsell, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don vs: and therewith he offered to kisse her hands. Then she told him the next day she should goe to a house of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, charging him not to leaue <hi>France</hi> without her lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se. Thus parted they, he returning to his Frends the ioyfulst man liuing: and so his passion led him, that hee spake not to them till they came to their pages. The princes markt it wel, and laughed thereat: and the Dacian (though he were somwhat drowsie) requested to be partner in his ioy?

The Wiseman my master commendeth him to you, and biddeth you to weare this armour to day: and to you valiant Tartare (for the ayde and helpe that one daye the Empire of <hi>Grecia</hi> shall haue of you) he doth send these armes, for with them shall happen the greatest &amp; first content that now ye can desire.
<pb facs="tcp:13976:85"/>
(And as the other time) without any more tarrying, shée departed: leauing them greatly content, for that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was as good as they had séene. Then they left their other with the beauteous shield amongst the bushes, and with great spéed armed themselues, and mounted on their horses, they went foorth into the high way, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their Pages to come by little and little towards the bridge <hi>Sequana.</hi> When they were foorth they mended their paces, but they could not sée any body, so for that they would not loose the way, they alighted, till such time as the carefull and amorous <hi>Apollo,</hi> purposing anew to salute the Morning hasted him forwards in his course. At this time the thrée valiant Frends, beeing mounted on their light horse, tooke the trace of them that had passed: But for that the country was so full of trées, halfe the day was past and they had no newes of them, till they were tolde by a wood maker, that they were passed directly vnto the house of peasure, whether as the king that morning had gone to recreate himselfe. Almost deuining howe it should be, they went vpward into the field, till the hower of two then they saw a faire Tent armed in the middest of the field, nigh vnto the way that they passed to the house and there staied certaine Chariots that séemed to be ful of Ladies.</p>
               <p>The Princes stayed, and the Tartarian requested them that they would let him alone to goe into the fielde, and that they would tarrie for him there. For to giue him content the two frends did graunt it, who lighted from their horses, and when their Pages came, they comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Fabio</hi> the Dacians page, for that he was most discréet, that he should muffle himselfe, and goe thether, and sée what succéeded vnto the Prince of <hi>Tartaria.</hi> Who with his visor downe and his speare in his hand with a quiet pace, went directly vnto the Tent, at such time as came foorth therof a knight armed with yellow armour bordred with blewe, mounted on a mightie horse, and in the middest of
<pb facs="tcp:13976:86"/>

               </q>
               <p>The Tartarian receiued great content at the good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the knight, and staying to sée what he would do he saw that he went vnto the first Chariot, in the which there was alone thrée ladies, which séemed the most fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in all the world, all thrée apparelled alike in golde tynsell cut vpon blewe, and their haire according to the vse of <hi>Spaine,</hi> with sightly lockes, which graced more their faire faces, and comming vnto them the knight said.</p>
               <p>Faire Ladies, the solitarie knight commaundeth mee in his behalfe, I should doe to you his commendations, and for that he hath vnderstood the brauerie of the Ladies of <hi>France,</hi> and how renouned they are in the world, hee ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth there will bee knights desirous to shewe their forces in their seruice.

And I with the same launces doe defie all knights, with the condition aforesaid, that my passions is more iust than any that hath suffered by loue, my lady being the sole occasion, shee and no other deseruing to be lady and Mistresse of my thoughts.</p>
               <p>It caused the ladies to laugh at that which those two<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Without any reply or answering, he in the yellow armour bore downe his launce, and put himselfe in place whereas he and they in the Chariots might sée the Iusts.

               <p>He was mounted on a great and mightie horse of a browne colour, with a gallant semblance, tarrying to sée how his companion did, for that he should runne with two and himselfe with other two.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Samo</hi> went foorth to the encounter, but although the Moore was one of the valiantest in his Countrie: yet at the first encounter he lost the reines out of his hand, at the third the Duke of <hi>Soma</hi> went to the ground, his saddle all in péeces, with griefe vnto all, for that he was welbeloued. Foorthwith in his place entred the valiant Duke of <hi>Pera,</hi> assalting the one the other, the Duke was out of his saddle.

               <p>All the Ladyes and knightes fixt their eyes on him, in séeing his gallant shape, who passing before the chariot, made his horse knéele downe, with so gallant a grace that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most did affect him, but none more regarded him tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Princesse of <hi>Holland Grisanea,</hi> who by séeing him, yéelded in such sort, that she began to be angry with her selfe, for that she was so bold to speake euil of Loue the night past. Uerie quickly she made shew thereof, for turning vnto the Ladies she said. Let vs haue good hope in this knight, that will better defend our beautie than those that are past: with the affection wherewith she spoke it, it did plainely appeare that it did come from her heart, and therewith the braue French Lady said: I pray God Lady cosin, that the force of the knight of the Serpents bee alone to make frée the passage, and not to leaue some of vs without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>
               <p>The Hollandesse did well vnderstand her meaning: but she dissembled, and answered cleane contrarie to the matter, saying: I pray God that he be sufficient to cause them to surrender their armour vnto our guarders. They had made their defiance, &amp; with swift running of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they came the one against the other, and méeting in the middest of the way, they gaue such an encounter, that it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med they had pearced one an other thorough. The Moore
<pb facs="tcp:13976:87"/>
lost his right stirrop, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ming of his foote, because he would not fall, he made a foule wauering, which was séene of all, but purposing to make amendes for the same, he tooke another great speare, and went against the Tartare, and encountred him with so great force, that the vexed Moore, lost his Saddle, and the Tartare his reines, which was the occasion that his horse carried him verye nigh vnto the Chariot, but in recouering them, hee made him returne, and did a thousand gallant trickes with him, al the which were pleasing actions to the heart of the faire <hi>Grisanea,</hi> who could not chuse but say. This Knight faire Cosin, seemeth much like vnto him that yesterday had the praise of the Iustes. The like thought the other two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: but the Dutches broke it off saying, it cannot be he for that he would not come without his companion, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durst any of them come for the death of the <hi>Phrigian</hi> Prince.</p>
               <p>The procéeding forwards on their talke was cut off by the cruell Iustes of the two knights, for in the middest of their carréere they met in such sort, that it séemed it had bin two great rocks, the one passed by the other w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great vp rightnes, the one being greatly amazed at the strength of the other: and taking other great Launces, with all the swiftnes possible, they encountred, and shiuered them all in péeces, which whirling in the ayre declared the force of their rigorous armes. The Moore did a little stagger on the one side, but not in such sort to bee accompted notable, neither so but they did all praise his great force: but that of the Tartare was iudged in fauour amongst the Ladies, and amongst the knights with enuy, not onely vnto them but also to proud <hi>Mars</hi> if hee were there, for giuing them so great force. They returned with the great furie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were indued, and encountred in the middest of their course, shiuering their Launces in small péeces, which was the occasion that it pearced not their armour, but so oppressed the knights, that the horse of the Tartare
<pb facs="tcp:13976:88"/>
bore backward thrée or foure paces, and settled his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks on the ground, which made them that were present to thinke that all would haue come together: but he séeing how much it stood him in hand, and more there then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other occasion, it was néedful for him to profit himselfe of his strength, and to hold him fast vnto the necke of hys inchaunted horse, and pricked him so stiffe, that hee made him to leap forwards, which caused the Ladies to be verie desirous to know who he was. The curteous <hi>Andronio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and thought that the encounter had beene of small effect, wherwith he saw that the fierce Moore lay along on the ground, and by him his horse that did beare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, who with the force of that strong encounter, the one remained without life, the other without sence: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with verie lightly hee leapt on foote, and went vnto the yéelded pray, and it grieued him for that he thought he had bin dead he lay in such sort: and when hee came vnto him, hee tooke his helme from his head to giue him freshe ayre, so that he might come vnto himselfe, who at his return sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself in the power of his enemie, that willed him to yéeld, he answered: Ualiant knight it is not fit, that you should demaund more than the honor which you haue got in ouerthrowing me in this sort, it had béene greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vnto me, that you had ended my life, and sustaining my honor, then to leaue me so voide thereof. The Louer <hi>Andronio</hi> was greatly affected vnto the discréet words of his aduersarie, and without any more wordes, hee gaue him his hand and helped him from the ground, and craued pardon of him for the death of his horse.</p>
               <p>Nigh vnto them there was a French Knight, who was ashamed that hee was ouerthrowen by the Moore, who hauing no respect vnto reason, but vnto the passion which guided him, said: you haue not to receiue any griefe vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant knight of the Serpentes for this, for that it was first ordained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he who lost his saddle should loose therwith his horse, and it is rather a vantage, and that hee should
<pb facs="tcp:13976:88"/>
not inioy that which an other inioyeth not. The Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare could not but receiue griefe, to sée the signes of sorrow that he made to receiue that shame, which the French knight had vsed toward him: but Fortune did quickly giue him his hands full of occasion for to be reuenged on all.</p>
               <p>But the Moore vsing the licence and libertie which the Tartare gaue him, without taking leaue of any, tooke an other horse out of the Tent, and with his companion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the same forrest, and left the tent for the knight to do therewith his pleasure: who for that hee had surrendred it vnto the Ladies of the Chariot, on foote as hee was, for that they sent to call him, he went vnto them. And vsing great curtesie, wherof they were worthy, comforting his troubled brest: he said vnto them. Faire Ladies although I doe not know for whom I haue done this little seruice, yet I come to aske my discharge, with offer of my good will, for any other matter of great importance.</p>
               <p>Thankes vnto you gentle knight (answered the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hollandesse) for this newe offer, with securitie that for so much as you imploy your selfe in shewing your strength in the fauour of Ladies, there could not fal better occasion than is this wee haue séene, to frée this passage, els we should haue béene driuen to séeke others.</p>
               <p>The louing French Knights did not let to blush at the words which the Princess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Worthy Knight of the Serpents, said she, you shal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent these Ladies and me in declaring vnto vs your name, and who you are.</p>
               <p>With a gallant grace (answered the heroycall Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare) I would willingly faire Ladies that as fortune hath put into my hands, life, for to imploy it for your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, that it woulde giue mee strength and power for to doe a thing so iust, as to leaue my name in your handes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:89"/>But fortune enuying the glory that should follow héer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, forbiddeth me by a former charge to tell who I am: for that in telling thereof, it will bee more costly to my fame than vnto my life. The Holland Lady, with great content would haue answered him to the purpose (but greatly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that her cosin had béen she that had subiected his wil) yet séeing that it was impossible to get any more of the Moore, she said vnto him: of truth Sir knight it seemeth well by the companie that you bring with you vpon your armour, that you conforme your selfe well with them, for they haue not vsed the crueltie as you haue done with those knights in taking from them their honor, &amp; yet will not tell vs who you are. Faire Mistresse answered the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous youth, my small aduenture hath béen the forger of this deuice: but I doe giue you my word, that within thrée daies (with another deuice that shall not shewe so much rigor) to tell my name and who I am, or els to send you word thereof, if I cannot be the messenger. By your word Sir Knight, said the Sauoyan Lady, wee remaine sure it will be so. Assuredly (answered the amorous Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare) that with earnest truth I speake it, and first my life shall faile me, ere I breake my word, besides I wil leaue for a pawne one of my weapons. And so with a soueraign gallantnes, he tooke out his dagger (which the great wise man <hi>Gelasio</hi> had sent him with the armour) and knéeling downe he put it in the handes of the Princesse of <hi>Holand,</hi> and with it his heart more amorous then euer any knight of his Countrie, and said: With this faire Lady it shalbe Iustice in you to take reuengement, if I faile in that I haue promised.</p>
               <p>It were not amisse Cosin <hi>Grisanea</hi> (said the amorous French Lady) séeing with what affection you haue taken that dagger, that hee which hath giuen you a gift, should carrie in the place thereof an other from vs, being bound thereunto. The faire Dutches in the behalf of the Moore, did helpe to take a rich Iewell from the neck of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

                  <hi>Grisanea,</hi> and with a gallaunt grace said vnto him: Sir Knight, weare this for a remembraunce of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and assure ye that on your Knighthood we expect the performance. I remaine bound (faire Ladies, sayd the Prince) for this great fauour, and on a Knights word I will keepe my word: so mounting his horse, hee returned into the thickest of the Forrest, leauing the Ladies pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his discretion and valor. <hi>Grisanea</hi> could not hyde her ioy, but sportiuely thus began: I am prouided Ladies of an armed Tent and a Dagger, what hinders me now to be a souldier?

told ye before he earnestly loued <hi>Orosia</hi> Duches of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> And for that occasion neuer fitted him to declare his loue vnto her, he determined to steale her away, being boldned by his great force, and the strength of foure most valiant Giants that he brought with him, and a cousin of his that was the Knight at the Passage, and ambushing the rest of his Companie nigh vnto the House of pleasure whether the Ladies went.</p>
               <p>These were those that the mighty <hi>Andronio</hi> ouerthrew, who intending reuenge, ioyned with the Giants and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushed Knights: and this was the noyse that the Princes followed to the fresh and gréene field, where the Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an requested that hee might cléere the passage for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and hauing ended so greatly to his honor, being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of that rich iewell, he returned vnto the Knights, and gaue them knowledge of all that had succéeded, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted them verie much, by reason of their frendship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with the Tartarian. So he alighted to rest hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and tarried til it was night, that they might all thrée goe together to the house.</p>
               <p>The faire Moone had scarce begun to impart her light receiued of the Sunne, when these three Frends rid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the house of pleasure: yet being vncertaine of the way, they wandred till it was almost midnight, and then came into a mightie great field, where they be held trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a verie faire Chariot, and before it two most furious Giants, armed with strong plates of stéele, &amp; in the midst two knights, who séemed to be of great strength and after the Chariot other two mightie Giants, mounted on light horses, with fearful iauelins in their hands. When they came nigher vnto them, they heard that those which were within the Chariot made great lamentation, wherby it appeared they were forced.</p>
               <p>The enterprise was difficult, yet they determined to succour them, and to incourage them theretoo, the Dacian sayd: Worthie and valiaunt Frends, now is the time to
<pb facs="tcp:13976:90"/>
shew the courage of your hearts, in attempting so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an enterprise: do you two assaile those that are before, and I will prooue my fortune with those Giants behinde. On this they agréeed, and the Dacian was the first y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with his furious horse: at the noyse whereof the two Giants turned about, and séeing him alone, they thought him a very Foole, and one of them onely went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, whom the Prince in the incounter ouerthrew dead to the ground. By this the two valiant Louers had entred battell with the other foure, with such a noyse as if there had béen an hoast of Knights. The Dacian heard this furie, being in combat with the other Giant, &amp; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what néed his Frends had of helpe, hee hasted the battell, giuing the giant such a blow vpon the helme, that he tooke his sense from him: &amp; thinking he had béen dead, he entred like a Lion amongst the Giants and Knights, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon them stout and valiant Knights, for they are vile people, and too few to withstand our forces. That frendly voice was heard aswell of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two princes, as of the Ladies that were in the Chariot, who iudged them to bée their louers, according vnto the Knighthood they shewed. At this time the Giant which the Dacian ouerthrew, had recouered his heauie fawchion, and with mortall furye came to the Tartarian, striking him such a wonderfull blow, that he made him fall on his horse necke, voyding blood at his nose and eares. Then passing forwards, hee came vnto the two Moores &amp; said: Away with the ladies you like, while my fellowes kéepe these diuelish Knights busied. So the king of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> his Cousin and the Giant, went vnto the Chariot, and tooke each of them a ladie, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting could not auaile them.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they smit two such blowes, that they made them leaue their Ladies: and foorthwith there was betwéene them a sightly battell, for that the Moores were the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antest in all their Countrey.

These two perfect Frends when they saw their work done, went vnto the Ladies with their helmes off. The French prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse knowing her welbeloued Louer, receiued him with the greatest show of affection that she could, saying: Oh Flower of Knighthood, how shall I repay you thys great good? It is but little faire Princesse (said he) that we haue done for your libertie, your worthinesse and beautie dooth deserue it.

               <p>All were wondrously amazed at this new Aduenture, and could not imagine to whom the entry should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: yet were they ioyfull that before the water was deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they had vnderstood the effect. And for that it was late, and the princesses desired to returne to the house of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, they tooke their way thetherwards, with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vnto the Dacian, to sée how wel it succéeded with his Frends, he iudging them now not alone for Louers, but as men secured from Loues tempests: hauing a kinde of enuie at their happie estate. With this imagination and consideration of the manie troubles hee had suffered, hee kept no companie with the princesses: and that which worst and most greeued him at the heart was, that hee

O Sir said <hi>Orosia,</hi> if ye haue loued there is no doubt yée may againe, doe not disdaine a louers name: sée by example the fayre <hi>Grisanea,</hi> that was yesterday frée, and she forsooth would none of loue, singing, saying all was against loue, and now you sée the tunes her musique in another key. And so may he said the Holland Princesse, but belike he scorneth the French beautie, and meanes to séeke farther for more faire. So faire and so curteous said hee, haue I seld séene, and if I euer affect, I wish it may be héere. In this swéet conuersation they trauelled, when at the sixt hower, they saw much armed people trauelling the way agallop, right towards the Sea side. They imagined whether they went, commaunding their Pages to goe and aduise them of the libertie of the Ladies, that the knightes might bee quieted. So they prosecuted their way till they came ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nigh the house, whereas they met the King, and all those mightie Princes which went to séek them.

And when their times came, they were deliuered of two Sonnes the most fairest in all the world.

The Dacian did passe his frée time with his welbeloued frends, till on a day at the taking vp of the tables, there entred the Damsell which the wise man had sent him so many times, who making great curtesie vnto the king, she went vnto the prince <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno,</hi> and gaue him a letter from the wise <hi>Lirgandeo,</hi> who did read it aloude, being as followeth.</p>

There he found the lacke of help that his good frends had done for him, and was assured if they had béene there, those people had béen but a few to haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood their forces.

And with his sword he stroke him such a blow vpon the helme that glanced to the gorget in such sort that it made a troublesome wound, whereat issued much bloud, which was the occasion that the Moore returned (with much more furie than the Lion on the yéelded pray) and stroke the Tartare such an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart blow on the waste, that he made him to fall vpon a banke in the Shippe, but as quicke as thought hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he who neuer failed them that called vpon him in their necessitie, did ayde them: In that there came directly vnto them the inchaunted ship of the thrée couragious Princes, <hi>Rosicleer, Meridian</hi> and the heroycke Troyan, that was going vnto the kingdome of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi>: who with the stormes at Sea came that way, whereas the battaile was.

So they grapled their ship with that of the Tartare, and could not imagine, who that valiant knight should be, that made such defiance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so many: and for that they would not delaye theyr

succour, embracing their shields with their swords in their hands, they leaped in, and ouerthrew thrée that they met at the entrie. The warlike Gréeke went directly where as the great knight was in battaile, and without stay (for that he imagined he was a Rouer) he gaue him so strong a blow, that he almost deuided him in two parts, and ouerthrew him at the féete of his enemy, leauing him greatly amazed to sée so furious a blowe. And hauing no more time, séeing so good succour and the victorie at hand, he couragiouslie set vpon his enemies, hauing by him the piller of Knighthood, that would not let him strike a blow, he assalted them so fast on euery side. The other two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not idle with the rest, but séemed as lightning, striking on both sides to the griefe of those miserable knights, vpon whome came the iust iudgement of God, conformable vnto the life they led, and the great iniuries which they had done both by sea and land without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of nations, paying now all that they enioyed, for they dealt with knights that neuer stroke blowe but they killed or maymed an enemy. And the Grecian <hi>Mars</hi> being affected vnto the valiantnes of the Tartare, said: Uppon them stout knight, for they are before your force vile and base people. And therewith with a gallant semblance, he threwe his shield on his shoulder with his swoord in his hand (that of Quéene <hi>Iulia</hi> was not better) and began to wield his furious body so hastily, that within one hower they found not one with whom to fight, although there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the ship more then two hundreth knights all cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen men: but with the help of their frends, did he and the Tartare enter into the ships of their contraries, and did in strife maine other wonderful maruels till such time as they saw they could make no resistance, both the one and the other ship did yéeld, and craued mercy for their liues of the two valiant warriers: who vsing their accustomed clemencie, and that which is natural vnto worthy victors, they receiued them prisoners.</p>

               <p>With strange content went the curteous <hi>Andronio</hi> to kisse the hands of the warlike <hi>Greeke</hi>: who not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such costly curtesie, raysed him from the ground, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining imbraced of the <hi>Tartare</hi>: who with the ioy hée receiued thereof, said: I will not ventrous Prince y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the knowing of you be without giuing part of the ioy vnto my wel beloued Princesse.

He graciously entertained her, yet was hee verie impatient to heare of the death of <hi>Zoylo,</hi> inquiring of <hi>Andronio</hi> about the circumstances: who hauing tolde them, <hi>Rosicleer</hi> vowed reuenge, wheretoo <hi>Meridian</hi> &amp; <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristides</hi> promised their helpe. But the Gréeke princes sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row being perceiued by the Troyan, he altred their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and incited them to know of the knights that were prisoners, who was that mightie pyrate? and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise who faire <hi>Grisanea</hi> was? Of the last <hi>Andronio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued them, in manner as you haue heard: certefying them beside of the prince <hi>Don Heleno,</hi> whereat the Gréek did not a little reioyce, for that since they left <hi>Tinacria,</hi> hée neuer heard of him.</p>
               <p>Now touching the Rouer, a Knight that was prisoner and one that séemed a principall in that Crue, sayd: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand worthie Knights, that the dead Knight and Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of these ships and diuers other that range this Coast, was the furious <hi>Bruncaldo,</hi> a great Rouer, and feared of all these Ilands: for that he was Lord of one hereby, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a little one, yet the strongest of them al, for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie of the entrie, hauing at the port one of the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Castles in the earth, called the Doubtfull Castle, the Iland also taking name thereof. To kéepe which when
<pb facs="tcp:13976:98"/>
he goeth abroad, he leaueth two fierce Giants that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Sisters: and in that Castle he hath manie mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prisoners. The Princes pittying the estate of the Iland, intended to frée it and the prisoners: and in theyr procéedings were thus aduised by the Knight. The best meanes to take the Iland sir Knights, is to haue your ship towed as if she were taken, and to put out at our tops the common Ensigne of victorie, which is a Flag, with the Sunne in a blacke field: for otherwise the entrie will be verie difficult, by reason of a chaine that crosseth from one rocke to another. I being knowen will tell the warders <hi>Bruncaldo</hi> is in his bed wounded in taking the Prize. Of all wayes this is the surest, &amp; to this I aduise you, aswell for the reuerence I beare to your worthines, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion I haue of manie Knights and Ladies that remain there prisoners.</p>
               <p>They all liked his aduice, and caused the Tartarians Knights to enter the two ships, and hang out their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of victorie, towing the princes ship after them. The next morning they came within sight of the Castle, which was seated vpon a rocke, hauing a waye no broader than for two to passe, cut out of the same rocke. At the entrie it had two towers in which the Giants lay, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was the lodging of <hi>Bruncaldo,</hi> gallantly built, with stones of diuers colours: and betwéene these thrée tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was a large paued court, wherin fiftie Knights might combat on horsebacke.</p>
               <p>So soone as they had sounded victorie, they were answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from both the towers with excellent instruments, for ioy to receiue their Lord, and to warne them that kept the chaine to open it, which was presently done: whereat the princes greatly reioyced, and thanked the Knight, who (lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing vp his visor) told them on the shore that their lord was sore wounded. With this they landed, ascending vp by two and two: first <hi>Briano</hi> the Knight of the Castle and the valiant Grecian, after them the princesse and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells,
<pb facs="tcp:13976:98"/>
and so the rest in order. In this sort they ascended the steps, making as if they reioyced in their bootie, till such time as they were in the highest part of the Castle, vnsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected. When they came there, the two deformed giants (vnarmed) did receiue them, verie ioyfull that their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law was come, although gréeued that hee was so sore wounded: neuertheles (said they) wee will present this Ladie to the wife of <hi>Bruncaldo.</hi> But said the greatest Giant, I had rather deale with him that had so much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to wound my Lord and Brother. <hi>Briano</hi> aunswered: He paid his boldnes with his life, and lost his Wife (that is this Ladie), vnto whom my Lord commaundeth great honour should be done, for her beautie sake, and to bee in companie with his Wife, till he commeth foorth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ship. The disguised knights receiued great ioy to sée with what discretion <hi>Briano</hi> procéeded in his busines, and estéemed him (as indéed he was) to be a perfect good man, and a iust Knight.</p>
               <p>The Grecian prince made a signe vnto <hi>Oristides</hi> and <hi>Meridian,</hi> that each of them with foure of those Knights should (as though they went for some other matter) take the gates of the two towers, while he and the Tartarian with the two Giants &amp; the discréete <hi>Briano,</hi> went vnto the higher tower leading the princesse and her damsels as if they had been prisoners, to the great contentment of the Giants.</p>
               <p>Heere might the two couragious princes haue conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this aduenture without anie molestation, but they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted it base and voyde of Knighthood, to assaile them without armour: therefore they passed forwards with all their companie, till they entered into the great Court, at whose rich workmanship they all wondred. There they saw painted manie ancient pictures, the which did beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie more that sumptuous Court. There were excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought of Iasper stone two paire of staires, one right against another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:99"/>The princes gazed not at anie thing, least the Gyants shuld suspect them, who gaped so on the princesses beauty that they put her in great feare with their vgly countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Then they entred into the hall, which séemed to bee fit for an Emperour, the céeling being full of gold &amp; stones of rich price. The Wife of <hi>Bruncaldo</hi> being ther, moued not when she missed her Lord: but (as full of pride as ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie) said. I would excuse your comming Woman, so that my husband were vnhurt: but as hee was reuenged on your husband, so will I reuenge me on you. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she tooke foorth a great bunch of keyes, and gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a woman to carrie the Ladie to prison. The anger was so great that <hi>Andronio</hi> receiued to sée his Ladie thorough feare change colour, that without farther consideration, he pulled the keyes from the woman, and throwing them at <hi>Bruncaldos</hi> wife, he droue two or thrée of them into her forhead, and slew her where she sate. This chance much gréeued the Grecian, but it could not be remedied, and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all was discouered, he put the Ladies behinde him, &amp; drew his sword. The wrathfull <hi>Tartarian</hi> was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to assaile the Giants: who séeing the death of their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and how they were betraid, came towards the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with their fawchions aloft. To whom the Grecian said: Stand false Knightes, for wee are not accustomed to fight with vnarmed men: put on your armour, for the worthie arme that tooke away your brothers life, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so take away yours. Oh vile creatures said the Giant, will you delay my reuenge while I put on armour? I would <hi>Mars</hi> and all the Gods were before mee, and thou shouldst sée I had no néed of armour for them, how much lesse then for you? And in saying this, he stroke a blow at the Tartar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for that the Sonne o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Trebatio</hi> would not haue of them anie vantage, he again said: take your armour furious beasts, for therewith you shall haue enough to doo to deliuer your selues out of our hands. Yet ceased they not to strike, and they with great lightnes auoyded: till one of the Giaunts with a hoarce voyce said. Stay foolish Knights, and you shal sée me stay longer in arming my self, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in taking away your liues. So they descended the staires, making a great noyse, and at their comming into the Court they met foure or fiue of the Tartarians knights and slew them, offring as much to the princes at the gates, who letting slip their blowes entred within them, and with their armed fists feld them to the ground, &amp; wold haue cut off their heads. At which the Grecian came downe (hauing left the Tartarian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue to keepe the tower) and would in no case let them be smitten vnarmed, commaunding a Page of the Castle to fetch their armour, and in the meane time they came to themselues. And considering they were by two knights ouerthrowne, they blasphemed their Gods, and hasting to arme one another, the eldest said. Tarrie a little ye cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue people, and you shall sée how déere I will make you buy this treason. When they were armed, shaking their bright fawchions, they came against them all. <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was a Knight of great patience, but the prowd words of the Giant had so earnestly angred him, that it made him say thus. For that you shal vnderstand how I estéeme ye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come both ioyntly to me, and you shall finde my déeds dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from my words: and therwith he let flye thrée or foure blowes aloft, which made them séeke defence for theyr heads. When he saw them looke aside, he gaue the yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Giant such an ouerthwart blow on his thigh, that hee cut him to the boane: but the other Giaunt reached hym with the poynt of his fawchion vpon his shoulder, that it made him stoop with his hands to the ground. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall hall was toward the court, so that from thence the Tartarian and his Wife saw the valour of the Grecian:

And in so saying he gaue a thrust at the furious <hi>Tembloso,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnto the other Giant, striking him so mightie a blow vpon the helme, that hee made him almost senslesse. At the same time had the Troyan stroke such a blowe at his hands, that almost he had parted them asunder, which made him giue a fearfull shréeke, where with his Brother stroke the Gréeke Prince such a blow on the helme, that if <hi>Artemidoroes</hi> vertue had not bé<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

left hand pulled off his helme, and cloaue his head to the necke. Then he sat down to rest himselfe, and asked the Troyan how he fared? Well said he, though almost out of breath: but let vs méete the Tartarian and his Wife, who are comming to visit vs. With that the faire Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse came, and said: Thus farre (worthie Princes) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth the courages of women, to shew signes of gréefe or ioy, as they doo receiue cause by the successe of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. I thanke ye faire Princesse for your ioy, aunswered the Grecian. But their conference was broke off by the manie embracings which the Tartare vsed to the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, for the frendship which hee had with that vnfortunate <hi>Zoylo,</hi> whom in the face <hi>Andronio</hi> did much resemble, yet he had more strength than he that was dead. Then sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched they Castle, and found the Wiues of the Giants ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great lamentation for the death of their husbands. After they had dined, they required <hi>Briano</hi> and some of the Knights of <hi>Tartarie,</hi> to goe and release the prisoners. All the seruants and people when they vnderstood the death of the Giants, gaue their obedience vnto the Princes, more reioycing to receiue them for Lords, than those cruell Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
               <p>Then they demaunded the keyes of the prison of one of the Giants Wiues: who séeing themselues in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of their enemies, ioyned together with the keyes in their hands at a window that opened vnto the sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in desperately they threw themselues, rather than they would liue pittied. It was so high from whence they fell, that ere they came to the water, they were starke dead. That rash déed could not but gréeue them all, but séeing it might not be remedied, they commaunded that the doores of the prison should be broken open, which was done by the pages of the Princes verie sodainly. They being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised what number of prisoners were within the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dungeons, commaunded them to be brought foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court, aswell women as men, and manie children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:101"/>Who when they saw people enter (thinking they were of the Giants sending) they began to say: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> butcherly people, more crueler then the furies, will you ease so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deathes, with taking away of our liues: what profitte find you in executing your fury on them that cannot make resistance?</p>
               <p>Then said <hi>Argolio</hi> the Page of the Grecian Prynce, wee are none of those peruerse people which you thinke: but we are seruants vnto certaine knights who haue gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you liberty. One could not heare another, the noyse of pleasure was so great made by those miserable Captiues: some referring it to God like good Christians, others thinking that it came from Mahomet. So that there was none but gaue thankes vnto them whome they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for their Gods.</p>
               <p>With infinite ioy and great shewes of contentment came foorth all those miserable people, and when they came into the court, and saw the Sunne, they all knéeled on their knées, and gaue thankes vnto God for their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and those venterous knights. They were in all more than thrée hundreth persons, which caused no small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion vnto the Princes, who with some pittifull teares did accompany the people. Amongst them ther were some knights and people of respect, principally two women, and thrée or foure men, which were together on the one side. The valiant Gréeke went downe thether, and with him the other princes with their helmes off. They recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them with so great noise, that the one could not heare the other, till they all came and knéeled downe before the Grecian. But they who most reioyced were the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of the two women, that were seperated on the other side: for one of them and a knight holding their hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, went a great pace, vnto the Greeke Lord, and with a loud voice said: Oh flower of the Gréeke nation, was it not enough that in the beginning of your Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and my tender yéeres you gaue me a husband, and
<pb facs="tcp:13976:102"/>
defended my honestie at the cost of your person. Speake vnto me Prince of <hi>Grecia,</hi> for I am that <hi>Linerua</hi> your detter of life and honor, I am shée for whome you did not refuse the habite of a woman, to defend my life honor and fame.</p>
               <p>This is the husband you gaue me, now Lord of the vally of the mountaines. The Prince stayed for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, and by and by he fell into reckoning who they should be, and did embrace them with great loue, as hee that had to them great affection, when hee heard that which they declared. And taking her by the hand, he went with her to the Princesse, that shee might prouide her of apparell and her companions: and gaue charge to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créet <hi>Briano</hi> that he should likewise, prouide for al the rest of the people that hee had set at libertie. And there afore them all did this Lady tell who she was saying. O vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Prince, how I doe estéeme my selfe happie, since my eyes haue séene that which so long since I haue desired, for since you departed in the habit of a youth from the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the mountaines, we neuer left desiring to knowe to what end came so high a beginning as not being an armed knight you did for me: and declared vnto him, that which in the beginning of this great historie you haue heard, when as he changed with the apparell of this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (who was called <hi>Linerua,</hi> and slue that cruell <hi>Argion,</hi> and made voide, that abhominable custome which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued) til such time as <hi>Lelio,</hi> my brother &amp; your Page, at his returning from the great <hi>Britain</hi> for your absence, told vs, he did vnderstand that you were of <hi>Grecia</hi> and no lesse then a Prince: &amp; Son to <hi>Trebatio</hi> Emperor of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> If <hi>Linerua</hi> and her déer beloued husband <hi>Brandido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> reioyced hereat, you may put it out of doubt. So foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with when we knew the happie news of the Prince your brother, we did procure to sée you.

It goeth now vpon thirtéene yéeres heroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Prince that wee haue béen in prison, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of my Father and brother. And héerewith the Lady concluded with teares of ioy, for that she sawe the Prince.</p>
               <p>Hee did not so much estéeme your vertue as I doe (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Gréeke) that so cruelly hath intreated you: but thankes be vnto God that hath giuen you libertie, for vs to sée one the other: and nowe you are not to take any griefe for that which is past, but to giue order howe they may know of you in your countrie, and to remaine in this till order bee taken whether you shall goe thether, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine héere.</p>
               <p>The next day hee commaunded that all those of the Iland should ioyne together, and hee made vnto them a long oration concerning the hard seruitude which they were fréed of by the losse of the Giants. And that hée would make them a Lord and a gouernour by his owne handes, and told them who hee was, the more to reioyce them. And with the consent of them all they maried the discréet knight <hi>Briano</hi> with the daughter of <hi>Linerua,</hi> and caused them to sweare him for their Lord.</p>
               <p>They all receiued content with that the Prince or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and the new maried couple were verie ioyful to sée the liberalitie of the Prince, although time dyd come when it was gratified and payde.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:103"/>They were foure dayes in the doubtful Castle: In the end of which, the Princes did take their leaue of those of the Iland commending them vnto peace. The like did the thrée frendes vnto the Tartarian, which was no small griefe vnto the faire <hi>Grisanea</hi> and the Tartarian: but sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it could be no otherwise, they tooke it forwell.

If you haue Iustice answered the Grecian, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count your busines done, for that is able to giue vs forces more than we enioy. Your strength doth well assure use gentle knightes (said shee) although it were for a matter more difficult: but wee women haue this condition, where we loue, we are not in quiet, but when we see them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: and I beléeue that it is generall for all that loue, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be assured of the good, while they liue in hope: the like we haue in our anger, for that there was neuer wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath béene vexed, but would procure at cost of their liues to recompence their griefe, and rather yéelde vnto death then want reuengement. God deliuer me (said the gentle Troyan, vnto the Damsell) from falling into your wrath if you be so froward: and therefore I say hee liueth a merrie and swéet life, that hath neither ioye nor griefe caused by women. For first, for to get ioy he must serue a world of time, and when he commeth to receiue a fauour, it is with such trouble that ere hee féele it, by and by with the turne of an eye all is turned to his disgrace: But I beleeue women are of the opinion, that griefe at their hands, is an ease to a Louers heart.</p>
               <p>It may bée gentle Knight (sayd the Damsell) that he that pondreth not the content that the Louer receiueth (if the Lady beloued be estéemed) being busied in easie things, but doth remit the content onely to the odedience promised by loue, and to receiue discontent for glory, and for great content the griefe ordained by the Ladye, and rigorous thornes for tender flowers, comming from her handes.</p>
               <p>Of truth Damsell answered the Troyan, if this be all the fauour that Ladies doe giue: and thereby no other daintie to comfort their Louers, from this time I say: he that liueth of this doth not knowe what is good. She said: It séemeth that your companions bee of your
<pb facs="tcp:13976:104"/>
false league, or els they will make shewe to defend my profound opinion, and for this battaile I wil none of your ayde, except ye be Louers. There will not lacke answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers for you faire Damsell (said <hi>Rosicleer</hi>) for I doe know some that did liue in sorrow in respect of them that gaue it, for it is a swéete discharge for them that loue to suffer, if the minde be constrained by the fairenes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued: and this certaine imagination can doe so much, that when sorrow commeth, it is not felt, the reason is, for that the sences are found occupied, with so excessiue content, as commeth of a faire sight, that it is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to vnlodge it out of the minde. But there be some of so little heart, that at the first encounter they yéeld, without considering the grief that is procured to the beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his Lady, giuing to vnderstand that he is not able to anymate his heart against the assalting griefe. Who (if he knewe howe to loue) would contend and depart glorious from this battaile, if hée estéeme this tryumph for most honorable.</p>
               <p>Then answered the Troyan somewhat touched (if an other should haue spoken it, his swoord should haue defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it). This is when as the Lady is correspondent vnto her louer with daintie fauours, and sorrowfull for his griefe, and receiueth it as her owne, then is it no griefe that he doth suffer, being certaine of his doubt. Then said
<hi>Meridian,</hi> not one (Lord <hi>Oristides</hi>) being grieued, did marke the discharge of his griefe, for that it should not be meritorious before the Lady: being certaine what he would haue, and to lay before it the reward. This doth exclude reason from perfect loue, which is the notable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of minde, where with good is desired for the beloued, and doth procure it with trouble, and hath the reward, not of that which is hoped for, but of the acte wherewith it is done, leauing the reward of his content vnto the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerositie of the Ladie: then is it giuen more liberally and more earnestly, than when the Louer doth binde her
<pb facs="tcp:13976:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in declaring what he did suffer. Nowe you doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Sir Knight (said the Damsell to the Troyan) the truth of my opinion, and ye doe wrong to withstand it, being so reprooued of all. And I hope that before you depart from <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> you will change your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the curiositie, wherewith this truth is declared.</p>
               <p>In this communication they spent the morning, till it was high time to go to dinner: in a fresh and gréen groue they dined, recreating their sight, with the pearlye Fountaines and swéet Medowes, and their ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Princes came to the head or sping of a gallant Christall Fountaine, which was vnder certaine myrtle trées, and there they alighted, and let their horses taste of the water of that swéet and cléere spring and the gréen grasse that was there. Then did their Pages bring forth such victuall as they brought from the doubtfull Castle, making on the gréene grasse a more daintie Table than they had in <hi>Grecia,</hi> and they passed Dinner with as great content: if that <hi>Meridian</hi> had not disturbed it with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the losse of his wife, although he was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what eased with the confidence in <hi>Brandafidell</hi>: and they all no lesse reioyced at the swéet musike which the birds made in the shadow, than of that which they were wont to haue in the Royall Pallaces: but the one and the other they did leaue, for to heare a delicate voice, which at the sound of a Harpe they did heare not far off, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what it should be, they heard that it began with a prosound sygh in this sort.</p>

But that you shall perceiue doubt of his ablenes is no cause of this, I will warrant that (within these ten dayes, either here or where els soeuer you will appoint) this Knight shall ende the battell. I am content (aunswered the yong Knight) for that your gentle disposition doth more binde mee, than this Knights arrogancie: therefore let the battell be here, where onely accompanied with my solitarie thoughts, I will attend you. Stand aside said the valiant <hi>Troyan</hi>; in cases that concerne my owne honour, I am more bound, than to wait on strangers: therefore there is no reason to disturbe vs, till the battell be ended. It cannot be said <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicleer,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:106"/>
for you haue giuen your word vnto this Damsell in a time limitted, wherein if you faile she looseth her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and she that sent her her honour: and for this busines, without impeach of your honor, you may leaue it till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. The <hi>Troyan</hi> wold not denie the prince, so they parted, and left the Youth, much praising his valiantnes: and thereof the Troyan thus said. The beautie which he hath and his few yeres maketh me to doubt, for that in all my life I haue not séene a fairer Creature: what he shuld be I cannot imagine, except he be a kinsman to the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an prince, for he resembleth much the prince of the Sunne your Brother. All were doubtful whom he should be, but most of all the Grecian, for that his heart did giue him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly that he should be of his blood. With this suspition they came to their pages, and fell to such victualls as they had, and determined to loose no more time, because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next was their vttermost day. When dinner was done, they demanded the matter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduenture: the which (after she had cured the Troyans leg, and told her iudgement of his libertie) she began with a gallant grace to declare in this manner.</p>
               <p>You shall vnderstand worthie Knights, that of thys mightie Kingdome of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> is King a most ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous knight, called <hi>Astrafio,</hi> worthie of much praise for the prudent gouernment of his Common-wealth: and as he deserued, so had he the loue of all his people. It was the will of heauens high Commander to blesse him with two Daughters at a birth: so like, that the difference is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwéene them in their names: and so excéeding faire they were, that they rather were estéemed of all to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall Angells, than humane Uirgins. They were both brought vp and nourished in the royall pallace of their ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Father, who was so delighted in their excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that he had no other ioye or contentment, but to behold them, and to bee conuersant in their companies.
<pb facs="tcp:13976:107"/>
The eldest is called <hi>Thomiriana,</hi> and the yongest the faire
<hi>Sarmacia</hi>: who so delighteth in hunting and armes, that she is among Knights compared with the Empresse <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiana.</hi> When she was of age to weare armour, she was knighted by her owne Father, and maintained a mighty Iustes, to her eternall honour. So farre was the prayse of these two sisters spred, that <hi>Liuio</hi> the prince of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi> (calling himselfe the knight of the Crownes) came thether with one alone page, and fell in loue with <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miriana</hi> the eldest Sister: his affection so increasing, that he was forced to discouer it both to her selfe and to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: who reioyced and the Ladie likewise, that she was affected of so excellent a prince. All the Court was wyth their loue delighted, and she that most séemed to delight in it, was the warlike <hi>Sarmacia,</hi> who dailye conuerst with <hi>Liuio</hi> and her Sister, when they were in their amorous conuersation. So long she dallyed in beholding their dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, that all her thoughts were captiued with <hi>Liuioes</hi> perfections: and the more she striued, by reasons of wrong against her Sister, trespasse against her Father, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie against her owne fame, to suppresse this fire, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olenter it raged. Solitarines contents <hi>Sarmacia,</hi> if anie thing could content her: but nothing can content her, till <hi>Liuio</hi> know her hearts affection. So one day as they wore a hunting she discouered it to him, whereat the prince did not a little meruaile, but dissembled it, giuing her kinde words, somewhat to quench her burning desire: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this noble prince came vnto his <hi>Thomiriana,</hi> he confirmed the faith he had giuen her, with earnester shewes of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than before: The ielous <hi>Sarmacia</hi> was in presence, and not able to indure the sight, went foorth and wept: but <hi>Liuio</hi> (like a constant prince) the more to assure his <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miriana,</hi> demaunded her of her Father in marriage: who gladly graunted it. But when the prince would haue kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the kings hands as a Father, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furious <hi>Sarmacia</hi> stept betweene them, and said: Louing father, it is not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb facs="tcp:13976:107"/>
for the honor of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> to giue my Sister to a Knight so disloyall: who to your curtesie being bound, is notwithstanding most vniust. And this I will maintaine against all the world. The Lord of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> did wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the cause of her accusation, and thus answered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ualorous Princesse, your too much vniust rage causeth ye to doo me wrong, which in my honours defence (much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my will, you beeing a Woman) I will approoue. That may not be Prince <hi>Liuio</hi> said the King, for by our law the accused maye not enter battell with the accuser, but within two months bring one to answere for him. It is no small wrong answered the Prince, that being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I cannot defend my selfe. I am the gladder said the Lady, for I am willinger to punish some other for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice than your selfe, because my Father loues ye. Ah Ladie said the Prince, you know I know the reason of this falshood, but I will not publish your fault. I know well said shee, thou art impudently audacious: and were not my Father present, I would presently bee reuenged. The King commaunded them asunder, till the 2. months or the triall were past. You may well gesse at my Ladie <hi>Thomirianaes</hi> gréefe: who taking mée into her chamber, (after manie showers ofteares) thus said. O my faithful Damsell, how doo the heauens deuide my life in parting me from <hi>Liuio,</hi> by the tyrannie of my cruell Sister? Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten my death, O you destinies, if I may not liue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce with so loyall a Prince: for I vow if he be not Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my will, to be Deaths bride ere I marrie any other liuing on the earth. What hast thou got <hi>Sarmacia</hi> by this crueltie? Is this my reward for participating with thée my hearts secrets? Well thy gaine is, that thou hast got the name of a cruell Sister: and my hope is, that I shall finde one able to disprooue thy falshood. After this passion, she coniured me with manie ceremonious protestations, that I should with all diligence séek her a knight to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat her Sister, whereby shee might obtaine <hi>Liuio</hi> for her
<pb facs="tcp:13976:108"/>
husband. So I promised her, that no other than the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Grecia</hi> or some of their frendes I would bring for so iust a defence, although therein I lost my life. And nowe séeing my fortune hath fauored me to bring such high prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is time for you to shew that which you haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to all women that should haue néed of your forces: for on this dependeth the life of the Princesse <hi>Thomiriana</hi> and the noble Prince <hi>Liuio.</hi> Faire Damsel said the Troyan, your demaund is iust: for it is no part of a sister to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the content her sister receiueth, for shee was rather bound to kéep it secret and further her, that made her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker thereof. And though it be a hard thing to enter in battaile with a woman, yet I wil take it vpon me if these valiant Princes bee therewith content. Many thankes sir knight (said the Damsell) I giue ye, and I do receiue it for the greatest curtesie that nowe you can shew mee, in that the busines of my Lady is so dangerous, and séeing so ventrous and valiant a knight as you are doe deale in it, I am secure: and I doe beléeue your companions will thinke well of it. And to shewe the valor of their persons they shall not lacke occasions in this country: for it is said by wise men, there are héerein maruelous aduentures. They al reioyced in that the Troyan Prince would take vpon him the battell for the Princesse. And <hi>Meridian</hi> said: it séemeth vnto me faire Damsell, that this knight féeleth the effect of the Country, séeing hee hath begun to follow your band in putting his life in aduenture for women: a thing which before séemed impossible. And I beléeue worthie Prince (said the Damsell) hee wil shewe more than this, it may be we shall sée him leaue the battaile, or if he ouer come, bee ouercome by his enemy: many more frée than he haue lost their liberty in this country of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia,</hi> and it shal be no strange thing vnto her to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect such a frée heart, as he hath séemed to haue, for I am certaine in seeing him of so gallant disposition he will bee amorous: then shal be sée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

reproued. At this time they beganne to discouer the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Citty whether as they iourneyed, and therefore tooke their helmets which their Pages caried, and pulled downe their vizors, they kissed her on the chéeke, aduis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng her not to tell who they were: so they tooke the most swéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way to the Citty, and came thether at the third houre, when the king as yet had not gone out of the Pallace. They entred in at a gate called the serpent gate, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were in the stréetes following them, and the eyes of Ladies waiting on their gallant proportion: yet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny able to imagine what knights they should be. In this order they arriued at the Pallace, where as they alighted, and mounted into the Royal hall, where as they did see a great number of Ladies and Knights: the Ladies in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with the Quéene and her daughters, and Knightes did accompany the vertuous King. The entring of these thrée warriers did not a little trouble the whole Hall, for that they knew not what they would haue: but when they saw them goe directly to the King, they all pacified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>So when as the heroycke Troyan had done his bounden duetie, in lifting vp somewhat his visor, hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his talke vnto the King in this manner. Worthy King of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> my companions and my selfe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling to séeke aduentures to procure fame, as Knightes should, did heare somwhat far off from this place, that in your Court is great wrong done vnto the Prince <hi>Liuio</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> and vnto your daughter <hi>Thomiriana.</hi> For as it hath been told vs, you granted your daughter to him with great ioy: whereat arose your second Daughter (with confidence of her owne strength) and made contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof: whereas of right she should haue procured the effect, for many reasons that shee hath knowne. And so although I neuer combated against any woman: héere I saye, that I will defend the Princesse cause agaynst whome soeuer, from the Sunne rysing
<pb facs="tcp:13976:109"/>
to Sunne set, if he be content to commit it into my hands. Sir knight said the king, for your commendations of my vertue, I thanke you: but for the rest, it is put to the order of battell: so that there is nothing to stand vpon, but to sée if the prince will admit you for his Champion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with came foorth the prince, apparelled in crims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n taffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta cut vpon cloth of gold, richly laced, with so great gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantnes, that the princes did all affect him. All did vnto him curtesie, which he graciously returned: and humbly thanking all the knights for their great trauell, hee sayd vnto the Troyan. Sir, I referre to you my whole right, although (if it pleased the king that I might defend myne owne cause) I would bee loth to indaunger anie knight: but he saith, it is against his law. That law said the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian prince, is verie preiudiciall in a Common-wealth: for some may be accused, that can find none to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is not to be iudged by you sir knight (said the king, somwhat angerly) for those that ordained the law, did it with more reason than you haue shewed to contradict it. The Gréeke prince being vexed, thus answered: All that you say sir king, in your person I gainsay not: but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie anie other, that thinketh I presume to iudge any thing which I will not defend. Neither doo I beléeue sayd the king, that there will want knights to answere you, if ye make anie Challenge: and therfore you may vse your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Then answered the Grecian, your person excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (for the vertue which thereof hath béen reported) I do defie two knights together, so they be naturally borne in this kingdome, that will affirme this law to bee good and iust. And I doo defie other two said the prince of the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, that will maintaine there hath béen vsed iustice (according to the right of Nations) towards the prince of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> but rather great and manifest wrong. Which Challenge we will foorthwith defend by armes, because will not multiply their anger by delaye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be affected to maintaine this most vniust, violent and intollerable law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13976:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>There did not lacke foure knights that came foorth of the Principallest and moste valiant in all the Kingdom, such as were iealous of the honor of their king, and gaue their gages vnto the Princes, thinking thereby to get great honor. Then came the faire <hi>Sarmacia,</hi> not ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in her shining armour, but in a gowne of blew cloth of goldfull of Precious stones: vpon her head she wore a vayle so white that thorow it was plainely séene her gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den haire: about her necke hung a rich swoord by a red sendall, and although it were vpon the garment, yet it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be wrought in it. Ind this sort she passed by all the knights, who gaue her way to passe where the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were, who greatly maruelled to sée her gallant dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. And when shee came to them (being affected to their gallant proportion) she said: which of you gentle Knights is he that must make battaile with me. All of vs (answered the heroycke Grecian) are Knightes faire Lady to defend your beauty: but he whome fortune hath made choise of for this, is this Knight (pointing to the gentle Troyan.) She iudged him of high valor, and hee could scarce turne his head to behold her, his sences were rauisht in such forte that hee knewe not what thing could giue him content, but to serue that gracious Princesse, and it séemed to him that she came from heauen to make conquest of his heart, and performe that which the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell has said. Oh false and rigorous <hi>Cupid,</hi> shall I not put my hand to my penne, but thou must put thy selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me with thy cruell effectes? and that to <hi>Mars</hi> cannot be graunted to draw his swoord, but thou wilt laye hold on his shield? and that one drop of bloud goeth not out, but it must be done by thy hand? It is wel séen in the Nephew of <hi>Troylus,</hi> that only sight could humble to the rigorous yoke the high necke of that most frée knight: who with <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe would battaile, about the good he found in his fréedome. The new Louer could not speake, and loue alone left him courage for to séeke meanes how he might
<pb facs="tcp:13976:110"/>
not offend her whom he worshipped. The experimented Lady did verie well marke his disturbance, and would not suffer it to procéede any further, but said: when will you Sir knight that wee make our battaile? By and by said the valiant Troyan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death is looked for, to hasten it, is life. The Lady did well vnderstand it, and it gréeued her nothing at all, for that it séemed shee neuer saw a better proportioned knight. Then came the foure knights armed with their armor, and went into the court where as the warriers did abide their comming. The sixe knights at the sound of the the trumpets, did méete, and made strong encounters: but the two which they hit, they ouerthrew to the ground both horse and man, without any mouing of hand or foot, they no more mouing than a rock, and the two which remained on horsebacke, returned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them with their swoords in their hands: but the Grecian Prince, wold not that his delaying shuld be any hindrance vnto the Troyan, without drawing his swoord, hee went to one, and taking him in his armes, he pulled him out of his saddle, as though he had béen a child, and quesed him so hard that he made him to cry out. And he carried him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly vnto the standing where as the king was. At that instant came his frend <hi>Meridian</hi> with his foe, leauing the place for the noise of the people, in praising the strength of the two frends. In this sort they came before that noble king: and the Grecian said, mightie King, although the vertue which wee haue heard of you, doth binde vs to bee your frends and to serue you in whatsoeuer shalbe offered: yet the rigorous law hath made vs to passe the sound pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose which we brought with vs. Therefore we will not that héereof any thing should insue: but that you should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it with eyes of reason. Most valiant knights (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the curteous Lord) although it séemeth not so euill as you do iudge of it, I will make it voide, onely for to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which knights of so great strength and curtesie require. And so from this day forwards I do it hold for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<pb facs="tcp:13976:110"/>
but will that the contrarie be obserued. By this meanes most noble King, answered <hi>Meridia</hi> is the right way to atchiue to be well beloued, and not onely to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Then did the Iudges bring forth the Princes with great honor, and left them with the amorous Troyan, who had his eyes fixed that way, whence should come the Robber of his heart, till they saw her come accompanied with the most principallest of all the kingdome. What may the Troyan hope after, in that hee found himselfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, and how shall he defend for the Prince of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> when as striking his lady is more than death? This new seruant of <hi>Cupid</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had such variable and contrarie thoughts, that he knew not where to begin. Till in the end he determined not to hurt his Ladie in any sort that she should receiue anger, as you shall vnderstand in the Chapter following.</p>

The gentle Lady made no answere, but turned about her horse and came against the Troyan, who made shewe of the like: but at the encounter he lifted vp the point of his Launce, but shee shewing the promptnes of her balor, made her encounter in the middest of his shield so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it made him somwhat to decline backwards vpon his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You do me wrong Sir knight said she, so to driue off the battaile. But it is more wrong said he, that I should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in combat with her I so affect. The Lady somewhat angry, stroke him such a blowe vpon his shield, that it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a rock had fallen vpon him: &amp; seconded another with a thrust, that she made him almost to loose his saddle, and gaue him the third with so great courage nigh vnto the skirt, that she disarmed all that part: yet for all this the Troyan did nothing but breake her blows, and put a side his body by the lightnes of his horse. The minds of some that were present were in doubt, although the Prince of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was secure. Contrarie thoughts were in the rigorous Damsell, who made so great hast, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it tooke away her breath. The Troyan did beare her a mightie blow, and in crossing his swoord for that it was of better mettle than the Ladies, it cut hers asunder in the middest, whereat he receiued great discontent, for that which his Goddesse shuld receiue: but loue wroght so in that small time, that it forced him to shewe a gentle tricke, and gaue great suspition to all that did behold it. Which was, he seperated himselfe a little, and tooke hys swoord by the point, and offered it vnto his Ladie, saying: Let your highnes pardon mee in that you haue lost your swoord by my occasion, with this you may conclude the battaile, in taking away my life: which is the most readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in all the world to serue you. I haue no néed of other weapons (answered the valorous Damsel) hauing a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherwith to succour me, you haue not any thing to do but with your swoord to doe your best. It is not vsed, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of my life, said hee, in our Country, to make any battaile with weapon of aduantage: and therwith he put it vp into the sheath, wherat they all maruelled, and also the king, who could not refraine but say. This knight doth much estéeme of women, for that he hath no power against

Now doth the Troyan fully vnderstand the letter which the wise <hi>Gelasio</hi> did send, when they were vpon departure from the Iland of <hi>Fangomadan,</hi> that he should sée his head in the hands of hys most cruell enemy. And for that it might the sooner ve accomplished, he closed with the Infant, and laid his amorous armes on her: but hee found a contrary an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere in the angry Lady, blaming her owne ouersight, she did wound him cruelly with her dagger betwéene the ioynts of the vambrace, that it made him giue a pittifull grone, which caused the Lady the more to respect him, as though be had done al the seruice possible. And it could not be but that the gentle <hi>Sarmacia</hi> when she saw the bloud of him that loued her, vpon her dagger, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The amorous Troyan séeing himselfe hurt, tooke hold of her dagger by the hylt, with so great force that hee wrung it out of her hands, and left her without, and offered his vnto her say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it doth not profit gentle Lady, the procuring of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement with your weapons, for if you wil it must be with mine, although vnworthy for that they are dedicated to your seruice.

I for this time (said the somwhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned <hi>Sarmacia</hi>) wil none of your weapons, neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you till such time as with mine own, I take reueng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your cost. For the rest the Prince of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is frée, the heauens hath ordained it, &amp; my sister wife to him that I loued more than my soule: but I will first pul it out

with my own hands, than loue him that doth not consider my desert. Neither doe I thinke to put on any more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if I doe not let him vnderstand the euill he hath vsed toward me. And therewith so fast as hir horse could run she went foorth, the same way which the Grecian went, and none was able to stay her, although the King cryed out that they should doe it: for she rid threatning of them that did offer it, &amp; knowing her will they did let her passe, where as the Prince within a litle while did sée her enter into the Forrest that was so nigh vnto the Cittie. The worthy Lady being departed out of the place, leauing the Louer in obscure darknes with the absence of his Sunne, hee went vnto the King, requesting that foorthwith they might be married, hauing confidence that <hi>Liuio</hi> the prince of <hi>Laodicea</hi> had committed no offence. There néeded no great perswasions, for the king greatly loued the Youth. Euery one requested him to pull off his helme, and to tell them who he was: but he séeing that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that it would be troublesome to stay, he excused it as wel as he could, remitting it vnto the Damsell, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he tooke his leaue and said, that she shuld tel them whom he was the next day, for that he wold not méet with them. She did promise him not with a few teares, to sée her selfe absent from so valiant and worthy Princes: but for that she could doe no otherwise, she forth with made them to be knowen vnto her mistresse <hi>Thomiriana,</hi> that accepted it with great content, requesting her not to make it known vnto any til that day was past. All reioyced with the new Prince, for he was of all welbeloued, &amp; remained greatly bound vnto the princes, when as he knew who they were, where as we a while will leaue them.</p>

               <p>WIth new and carefull thoughts, went the Grecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prince forth of the Court of <hi>Lira,</hi> &amp; could not tell
<pb facs="tcp:13976:113"/>
who that faire and tender Youth should bee, that was so valiant. He knew not whether his horse did carrie him, neither what he did, he was so trobled in his imagination till such time as hee heard a rusling amongst the bushes: and looking with more attension then before he did, he heard a voyce which said vnto him. <hi>Worthy Sonne of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio, wherefore dost thou hasten to seeke the Knight, for the blowes thou smitest on his body, thou giuest to Oliuias soule.</hi> The obscure wordes did cause him more to suspect, and he could not imagine from whom it was spoken, but not reckning of them, he pricked forwards his horse with more hafte, directly whether as he thought he had left the knight: but he had not ridden many paces when he heard the same voyce, which said. <hi>Knight of Cupid, is this the loue thou hast vnto thy Oliuia, behold if thou dost this, thou goest against her will.</hi> Although I loose my life and all the Grecian estate, (answered somewhat alowd the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Prince) I will goe forwards to sée who this Knight might be. The voice said. <hi>O euill knight that for so many fauours giuen by thy Oliuia, thou wilt now pay her so euill, reioycing to goe to shed her bloud.</hi> This gaue him a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desire to know who the youth should be, and could not imagine that it should be his Sonne, for then he thought <hi>Oliuia</hi> would haue tolde him of it. In this doubt, the night ouertooke him, not far from a shéephouse, where hearing noise, he went thether, and asked part of their poore susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: to whom they gaue it with great good wil, for that he was of a gallant proportion &amp; wel armed. He sate down with them to supper: and when hee pulled off his helme, they receiued great content, to sée him so faire and Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall: being at Supper, the chéefest said vnto an other Shepheard: haue you séene one so like the knight that was héere yesterday? The Prince did well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them for that hee could speake the language, and asked them where he might find that knight they talked of? It may be said the shepheard, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil be here to night,
<pb facs="tcp:13976:113"/>
for he told vs yesterday, that he must remaine hereabout a few dayes. Can you tell me said he, whom he is? No, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Shepheard, onely somewhat of his valor wee can tell. For one day being here at dinner, there came a chased Liones, who would haue run vppon vs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt haue slaine vs, if he had not béen here: who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose vp, and at one blow cut her in two péeces, &amp; sat downe as though he had done nothing. Wee carried the Liones for a present to our holy Temple: and at our returne, we saw him ouerthrow two Knights at one Encounter, the one with his launce, the other with his armed fist, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more tarrying, he put himselfe into the thickest of the Wood. The prince reioyced at that he heard, imagining him to be his Brothers Sonne. So passing away a good part of the night, he parted from the Shepheards, leauing his horse with them, and went a good way off, putting his shield vnder his head, he fell asléepe: till <hi>Cynthia</hi> gessing the yong knight (who lay not farre off) to bee <hi>Endimion,</hi> shined with more than ordinarie brightnes, and with her light beames awaked both the knights at once: the yong knight bidding sléepe farewell with a great sigh.

               <p>The Louer of <hi>Oliuia</hi> would no longer stay, but pacing swiftly to the Youth, counterfetting his voyce somewhat like the Troyan, thus said: Up Knight, and defend thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing life, for I am come without my companie, because I would not be parted til I haue proued libertie the swéetest life. I doo much estéeme of you sir Knight (said the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Nephew of <hi>Trebatio</hi>) not onely for comming, but for comming thus vnto mee alone: and therewith la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing on his helme, hee assailed the Gréeke Prince in such sort, that at thrée resistlesse blowes hee ouerthrew him to the ground. O infernall Furies, to which of you shall I compare our Prince, when he saw himselfe by one alone Knight so handled? for rising againe, at two blowes hee left him almost senselesse: but recouering, there began the greatest battell in the world.

                  </gap>ight of that pittilesse battell, the contenders beeing so wearie, that they were forced to breath themselues: the couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous yong Knight imagining, that (except some diuell had possest him) it could not be the knight with whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batted the night before, touching true loue &amp; free libertie.
<pb facs="tcp:13976:115"/>
So thought the Gréeke prince himselfe, for neuer anie but his brother brought him to that estate. With this conceit his choller so increased, that without speaking any word he went against his Enemie, whom he found not vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and together they stroke such blows, that they both stooped on their knées. Foure howers they thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much wearied, but nothing discouraged. And in the midst of this contention, the wise <hi>Lyrgandeos</hi> Damsell came foorth of the Forrest, and put her selfe betwéen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saying: Stay Knights awhile, and heare me speake, for hauing done yee both seruice, I am come to aske a boon of you. Both the Knights knew her, and presently granted it. Leaue off your battell then said she: and though it be my request, yet is it for both your benefits. <hi>Rosicleer</hi> was somwhat mooued, yet at last hee said: Damsell, for your sake I am content, if this knight be so pleased. I am not pleased said the yong knight, to haue the battell cease. I will exclaime on you said the Damsell if you doo procéede, to be a false knight and recreant of your word. For you promised me when I guided you to the Caue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidon,</hi> (where you demaunded the ende of your loue, and whose Sonne you were) that you would neuer deny me a lawfull request: and this is most iust, for it requisite that betwéene you there be eternall frendship, and héere I am certaine it must begin. And in ending these words, shee vanished away, leauing them much amazed. Both of the knights put vp their swords, and the Grecian thus began. Most valiant knight, it séemeth this Damsell knoweth more of our estate than we our selues: and séeing she saith we must be frends, for my part I offer it you with most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire affection, being likewise heretoo mooued with certain inward motions, which I cannot expresse. Inuincible knight, answered the faire Youth, great is my benefit to haue frendship with the best knight in the World: and I may well say they told me true, that certefied me my best good should méete me in <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> And heere looke I
<pb facs="tcp:13976:115"/>
for as much good as I haue in <hi>Grecia,</hi> thogh there remain my Souereigne <hi>Oliuia,</hi> whom you (for then had the yong Knight tooke off his helme) so much represent, as were it not that I know she is not giuen to armes, I should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue it were her selfe: therefore faire Sir, resolue my sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious heart, of whence you are? What my selfe knows I will acquaint you with replide the Youth. The Soldan of <hi>Niquea</hi> brought mee vp, in companie of <hi>Doriano</hi> hys Sonne, and <hi>Liriana</hi> (my diuine Mistres) his matchlesse Daughter. Till I was of age to beare armes, I tooke the Soldan for my Father: who then knighting me thus said <hi>Rosabel,</hi> thy Parents are to me vnknowen, for a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onesse brought thée to mée an infant, and by a white Rose on thy breast thou hadst thy name: a Scroll shee brought in her mouth, which said thou shouldst be my greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, till the Swan put peace betwéene vs. Though it somwhat gréeued me to be of vnknowen Parents, yet my hope to enioy <hi>Liriana,</hi> possessed me with ioy: and she a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cherished my hope, till on a sodaine shee forbad mee to soll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So (discontent) I imbarked my selfe for <hi>Russia,</hi> purposing there at the Caue of the wise <hi>Artidon</hi> to enquire touching my birth: but I was driuen by tempest on this Coast, where I was no sooner landed, but I heard a voyce that said. <hi>Welcome the glorie of Greece and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of great Britaine, the greatest Frend your Father hath sends you this armour, and willeth you to leaue off that you weare.</hi> And séeing no bodie, this armour was laid by mée, which you sée fitteth my bodie as it had béen made for me. While I was arming mee therewith, a Dwarffe came vnto me, and said: Take courage <hi>Rosabel,</hi> for you shall in this armour méete one of the valiantest knights in the world, and him shalt thou assaile with bitter hate, beeing most bound to yéeld him loue. After the Dwarffe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, came the Damsell that parted our battell, saying to me: <hi>Rosabel,</hi> grant me a boon, and I wil bring you to the

Farre off is my natiue Country, where that I might iustly report I haue dealt with such a Knight, my desire is to proue my selfwith him that made the last battell. The Troyan stept foorth and said: I am the Knight ye looke for. It séemes you are indéed said the blacke Knight, therefore mount you, and defend this that you shall heare: You did not in the Combat yesterday the part of a Defendant, ye should haue forced your aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to confesse the wrong done to the accused, and not haue so delayed the time to make an end without victorie. Doo you know sir Knight said the Troyan, who was my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie? A woman said the other Knight, but that is not a whit materiall: the right of the battell thou performedst not, and thereupon growes my defiance, which if thou be a iust Knight thou wilt answere. Els (sayd the Troyan) let <hi>Sarmacias</hi> faire eyes neuer giue end to the begun sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of my heart, if thou be not answered and chastised al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for thy presumption. And therewith the furious Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian mounted his horse, and assailed his Contrarie, vsing all able violence hee could both with sword and speare.

But this blacke Knight vsed the like curtesie with him, as he had done vnto the faire <hi>Sarmacia,</hi> for indéede it was she: and neither with point of speare nor edge of sword did she returne him blow, but onely for foure howers defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her selfe against his fierce assaults: and then finding opportunitie, she cloased with him, saying.

At this, the Troyan sodainly retyred, and the Ladie vnarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her head, sayd: Now am I out of your debt. And out of yours shall I neuer be said <hi>Oristides</hi> (trembling with feare of her indignation), but pardon me diuine princesse, and receiue my sword that hath offended you, and with it the Owners heart. I receiue it said the Ladie, and giue you mine in pawne, till wee méete againe, as méete wee will: and in saying this, shee returned as swift as winde, leauing the princes not a little wondring and reioycing, but especially <hi>Rosabel,</hi> who highly delighted in the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians change.

Backe Knights, for so vniust a cause you should not make battaile: more iustly eyther of you should help women, and not séeke to dishonor them. Much lesse care hast thou of her (they answered) that with out any more consideration leauest her to the mercy of our swoords: and without any more respect, they both returned against the Dacian, mallice making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quickly frends. The Dacian wold not with the point of his Speare, take reuengement of such people, but with the end hee had in his hand, he stroke one such a blow vpon his harnes, that he buckled it to his brest in such sort that it tooke away his vitall breath, where with he fell dead to the ground: and returning to the second he stroke him so on the head, that he made his braines flye in the field, therewith quenching the desire they had vnto the Damsell. In the meane time <hi>Fabio</hi> his Page had vntyed her, who greatly maruelled at the valiantnes of the knight, and came vnto him saying. The heauen (Sir Knight) reward you for this you haue done for me. For from thence commeth the reward of them that giue such succours, which with my life likewise I will repay.

The Dacian took his way towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and came that night vnto a faire and delightfull groue of poplers, where he intended to passe away the night, being sommer: so there he alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his horse, and made his Target his pyllowe: but about aleuen a clocke at night he was waked by the noise of two shepheards, who not farre from him were a talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but he imagining it to be some other thing, buckled on his helme, &amp; went by little and little amongst the trées to sée who they were y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> talked, til by the light of the Moone he saw two shepherds set downe vnder a huge pine trée talking together. And as one that was frée from the grief of amorous cares, he receiued content to heare their talke, the one who séemed to be yonger then the other, with some shew of anger said. It is not to be doubted, frend <hi>Lisio</hi> that the brauerie of my shepperdesse excéedeth, for onely with her beautie, hath nature atchiued the name of famous.

And this will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, against them that be honored for Goddesses in the great <hi>Tinacria.</hi> And therewith taking foorth his wel tuned rebecke, he began this song with great swéetnes.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>My Loue is of the Heard beloued,</l>
                  <l>Yet by his teares she is not moued.</l>
                  <l>In the sand his words she writeth,</l>
                  <l>And rends the songs that heinditeth</l>
                  <l>O this she me with scornes requireth:</l>

               </q>
               <p>At the end of this song, thus answered the other Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. <hi>Aliano</hi> thou dost loue, and takest it for the best life: I doe not condemne thée, but rather conceiue as thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest the fame due to thy Shepheardesse. For this is the course of euerie louer, to say that his Shepheardesse is a Phenix, and for such a one doth hold her, his crow must néedes be a swan who euer gainsaie it: and yet there can be but one excellent, and if yours be she, whome doe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shepheards praise, especially <hi>Poncenio.</hi> The cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the amorous shepheard would not let him procéede any farther, but he said. It is sufficient frend <hi>Lisio,</hi> I can with my rough crooke make knowne that <hi>Poncenio</hi> is an heryticke, in affirming that his Shepheardesse deserueth the merit of mine: and being ouercome with cholar, at two leapes he put himselfe nigh vnto <hi>Poncenio</hi> with his knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie crooke in one hand, and in his other his Ierkin, and said. Defend thée shepheard, for it is time to sée, if thou hast hands to maintaine that which thou hast so falsely published. <hi>Poncenio</hi> was not a shepheard, that would take such reprochfull words: so with the swiftnes of a hawke hee put himselfe in the same order as his contrarie was, where you should haue séene one of the prettiest contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world: for as the shepheards did estéeme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be louers, they did not forget to be valliant. The Dacian Prince reioyced in beholding them, and greatlie wondred at the power of Loue, that amongst shepheards shewed this rigor: but he suffered them not to procéed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for that the contention would be perilous. And so with a quicke pace, came amongst them saying: giue way gentle Shepheard, it is not iust that this contention shuld
<pb facs="tcp:13976:120"/>
goe forwards. Valiant knight answered <hi>Poncenio,</hi> it is not so small a matter as you thinke, if you haue fasted loue, you can say it is the greatest and most iust quarrell and rather to choose death, than in this case to leaue off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: yet for all this, for my loue (said the Dacian) I will that ye would be frends. Of truth gentle Knight (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Poncenio</hi>) many daies past haue I procured thys frendship with all plainnes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, and I beleeue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was so simple, it hath bin occassion that this shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard doth thinke I doe it of necessitie, he knowing which all the world shall know, that if he loue, I liue by louing a shepheardesse, who in beautie, discreation and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, equalleth the most excellent. I cannot (said <hi>Aliano</hi>) but acknowledge the many good parts of your shepheardesse brother <hi>Poncenio</hi>: yet for all this you know, that my shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesse hath caused her to yéeld. These are passions (sir knight) said <hi>Lisio,</hi> so long time past, that it would be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to declare them: But since you haue taken the matter in hand, I pray you perswade them to leaue off contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons past and become frendes: for frendship doth ease the sower troubles of this amorous euill. And therewith the Dacian Lord went directly vnto the Shepherds, very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he had séene that controuersie, and he tooke them perforce by their hands, and made them frends, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured vnto death. And the more to binde their frendship, they all foure together sate downe on the gréene and fresh grasse, making a signe vnto <hi>Fabio,</hi> to bring the horses, and likewise to inioy the frendship of the shepheards. The gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Youth did pull off his helme, and shewed foorth his faire countenance, but he had not so soone pulled it off, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the shepheard <hi>Lisio</hi> fel down at his féete, saying. O war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Prince of <hi>Dacia,</hi> what a happy day hath this béen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me? wherein I haue séene that which I so much desired euer, him whom the gallant countrie of <hi>Tinacria</hi> worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for their God, as a restorer of their lost content. The prince caused him to arise, wondring how he was known
<pb facs="tcp:13976:120"/>
in those parts: and demaunding of him, howe hee knewe him. The Shepheard answered, Worthy warrier, I am a naturall <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> and haue there fed and kept Cattle, and came many times vnto the Citty, whereof the whole Country beareth the name, there I haue séene in the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace portrayed your figure, and the Emperour <hi>Alphebos</hi> of <hi>Trapisond,</hi> vnto whome those of <hi>Tinacria</hi> are so much bound. And your figure and his I so earnestly printed in my hart, that I desired aboue all things in the world to sée the substances. I giue you great thankes (said the Prince) for the good will which you haue shewed vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and mee, and in any thing I may, commaund mee. Great pleasure I shall take if you declare vnto mee any newes from those partes, for since I departed from <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> the Prince of <hi>Grecia,</hi> I haue not heard any thing thence for trauelling in strange Countries. That which I can say (answered the shepheard) is the ioy which the Emperor of <hi>Constantinople</hi> your Vnkle hath, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the Princes of <hi>Trapisonde</hi> to be the sons of the mighty <hi>Alphebo,</hi> although I beléeue it will bee no lesse ioy to know the Prince of <hi>Tinacria, Poliphebo,</hi> who they say is equall in valor to all the rest of the brethren: for being called the knight of the siluer branch in al parts whereas he hath trauelled, hee hath left the world full of his fame. The Dacian curteously thanked <hi>Lysio,</hi> and was ioyful at his newes: and after some earnest perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of them to continue frends, he prepared to ride to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome,</hi> the Shepheards bringing him on his way within the sight of the Common way, and were grieued to part with him.

It is like (said the Damsell) you loue your Ladie little, that dare not for her hazard a fal: but you shall iust ere ye goe, or shew great signes of cowardise. And therewyth she rid swiftly to the Knights and Ladies, who laughed excéedingly, especially when she told them he bare <hi>Cupid</hi> for his deuice, and yet denied to be amorous. Back they sent her againe with this message. Sir, our knights send you choice of thrée things: whether you wil iust with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, loose your shield, or blot out the deuice, for with that shield they sweare you shall delude no more. They haue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage (answered the prince) for Louers are made har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die by their Ladies fauors. The Damsell thinking him a pure coward, said: Therein they shall haue no aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, here, take this rich iewell for my fauor, on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that if you be ouerthrowne, you surrender it to the victor. Agréed said the Dacian: and with great gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he stood readie for the Iusts: all the thrée knights ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued fauors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies, to giue if he wer victor.

The first y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came against him was one of the red knights, whom the Dacian ouerthrew to the ground, beeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therat no more mooued than a rocke: then came the other red knight and was serued in the same order, to the great amazement of all the beholders. <hi>Heleno</hi> being nere the damsell said: I want a speare (faire damsell) for thys gréene Knight, playe you the Page and choose mee a good one, and you shall sée me well defend your iewell. The ioyfull Damsell chose two of the best speares, and giuing him one, he went against the gréene Knight, that stayed for him: and in the encounter both brake, and with their horses rushed so together, that the gréene Knight with his horse dead betwéen his legs came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. The prince comming to the ouerthrowne Knights said: Of this euill your selues are guiltie, heereafter iest not at them whose strength ye know not. The gréene knight curteously yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his iewell, but the red Knights defied him to mortall battell, but the Ladies in the Chariot forbad it: and vnto the Dacian the Damsell thus said: <hi>Roselia</hi> the Emperors Daughter (being the Ladie in gréene, accompanied with the Princesses of <hi>Scotland</hi> in red) desireth to know your name, and that you would accompanie her to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours pallace.

But thou shalt said the other Giant tel me, and as he was laying hold on the princes arme, with the great end of his speare he ouerthrew him to the ground, and with a light leape cléered the gate for his page and himselfe, stepping aside, to sée which way they tooke.

Our Gallant in this time was not idle, for that betwéene him &amp; the other Giant began a rigorous battell, which hee had quickly ended, but that the foure knights who were verie strong, greatly troubled him: but he soone dispatched two of them, and in the seconds fall, the Giant smit the prince so rudely on the helme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> made him to kisse the earth: but it was little for his good, for as he thought to catch him in his armes, the Prince arose with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> point of his sword vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, which vnder the skir of his armour passed through his heart.

The Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian would take no aduantage of him, but alighted from his horse, and taried til that the Prince was cleare of his, who very couragiously with his swoord in his hand came against the Dacian, giuing him so great a blowe, that hee made him stoop with one hand to the ground, &amp; turning to renue the same hee stroke him so vpon the right shoulder that <hi>don Heleno</hi> felt it euill: but rising vp he approached with so rigorous an answere, that he made him giue thrée or foure steps backwards ready to fall, and followed him so, that if hee of <hi>Gibia</hi> had not béen cunning, hee had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne him: for he séeing his intent, put the point of his swoord forwards, and as he was earnest to come on, if his armour had not béen magicall, our Dacian had not gone frée, for hitting him in the buckling of the brest-plate his swoord did somewhat enter, so that it was néedfull for him to beare backwards because he would not be hurt: but he returned with great cholar, and closed with his enemy, both giuing together so heauy blowes, that he of <hi>Gibia</hi> was forced to put both his hands to the ground to kéep him from falling, and the Dacian Lord, made an vnmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

staggering. From that time they continued wyth great force, no aduantage appeering betwéen them, he of <hi>Gibia</hi> maintaining himselfe for more then one houre with great honor against <hi>Heleno</hi>: yea halfe of the second houre was past, when as the cholar of the Dacian was turned into liuing bloud, and throwing his shield at his backe, he tooke his swoord in both his hands, and gaue him of <hi>Gibia</hi> so strong a blow vpon his helm that he cloue his head, and ouerthrew him dead at his féete, breaking his swoord in thrée péeces, the pommell onely remained in his hands. I will let passe the griefe that the faire <hi>Arbolinda</hi> sustained and leaue her in a sound in the Princesse lap, who was busied in beholding the knighthood of the Dacian Lord, who had no time to secure himself, when as like the wind the second Prince of <hi>Gibia</hi> came foorth with desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the death of his brother: and more respecting rage than the order of Knighthood, he came behind the gentle Dacian with the brest of his horse, with so strong an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, that he layd him on the ground, passing ouer him with his horse, and left him almost without breath: but in recouering himselfe, more furious than a viper of <hi>Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> he aboad the comming of his enemy, who came with so great swiftnes, that it was miraculous the Dacian eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cted that which he did. For as he passed by, he threw the pomell and hylt rf the swoord, with so great strength as if it had bin forced out of a péece of ordinance, and stroke him on the helme so vntoward a blowe, that whether hee would or no, he made him leaue his saddle, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sence to fall to the ground. The content was great that all receiued at so venterous a blow: and if thereat the worthy <hi>Roselia</hi> did reioice, there is no doubt, and the more when as she saw that the prince, as one that had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, went directly vnto the edyfice with an ireful pace, with the trunke of a speare in his hand: but he was not so soone come thether, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as betwéen the pillers, the earth did open, &amp; there came foorth a serpent, as long as a lance:
<pb facs="tcp:13976:127"/>
who beating the ground came against the Prince, that with no little feare did abide her comming. At first she rose vp so high that he could not strike her head, but her body the trunke was so short, but the serpent stroke him with her taile, with so great force, that shee threw him a good way from the pillers, giuing him a gréeuous fall to the ground: which did not a little gréeue the Emperor and al those that desired to sée an end of the aduenture. The Daci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an was so kindled in cholar, that he wisht it had béen two serpents: and with a light leape assalted the serpent, who giuing wonderfull shrikes came to catch him with her clawes: but before she could fasten her tallants, our <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> did execute his blow with the trunke of the Lance vpon her head, with so great force, that hee made her fall to the ground and followed her to haue stroken another blow, at such time as shee did incorporate herselfe in such sort, that he could not hit her but on the necke, breaking al in péeces the trunke of the Lance: but he went not away boasting of that blow, for the Serpent set her furious nailes vppon his shield, and pulled it so strongly, that she got it and brake it, which made the prince the more to wonder, for that hée thought his shield had béen magicall. And so with a newe feare, his Lady bearing him company with a thousand sighes, he did abide the Serpent with his armed fist, for he had no other armor left, and as she came aloft, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feare he went vnto her, &amp; lifting vp his hand, he stroke her such a blow vpon the head, that hee made her loose her blow, but yet she caught him betwéene her clawes with so great rigor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it séemed she had thrust them into his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. He thinking that he had bin wounded to death, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew out his dagger, and with the point nailed her in the head two or thrée times, and made her to stretch foorth her selfe with the pangs of death, in the middest of the edyfice. The Dacian arose vp so wearie and wounded, that all were greatly admired, how he could sustaine himselfe on his féete: but as though he had béen whole, he assalted the
<pb facs="tcp:13976:127"/>
shape that had the armour, and vpon a soddaine there pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before him, a furious Gyant saying. Stand cowardly knight, for first thou must know the swéetnes of my fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion, and therewith gaue him such a blow vpon the helm that halfe his head was vnarmed. The Dacian was in great feare of death, in séeing the small defence which his armour had, to that which the Giant had, and then found the lacke of his good swoord: but considering who did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, he went vnto the Giant, who again was lifting vp his heauie fauchion: the Youth making shew as thogh he would abide it, but at the fall, hee closed with him &amp; his dagger in his hand, and neuer left stabbing til he fel down dead. Then assailed he again the portrature, when sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a tempest filled all the place, so that the Prince could not be séene, and in the thicknes of this storme the great wise man <hi>Nabato</hi> apeared to the Prince, giuing him the armour and weapons of the portrature, and charging him not to stay after he had ouerthrowen the prince of <hi>Gibia,</hi> but hye to the sea where was his inchanted bark: for said the wise man in this storm <hi>Roselia</hi> and her frend the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of <hi>Arbolinda</hi> are taken away: but at last you shall méete with your content. With that the storm cleared, the Edifice was vanished, the two princesses among the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies missed, and the Dacian ouerthrowing the prince of <hi>Gibia</hi> for dead, poasted away like lightning on his horse <hi>Tirio,</hi> his page following him to the inchaunted Barke, leauing the Court in a confusion, till the Emperour was comforted by the wise <hi>Nabato</hi>; who tolde him though the taking away of his Daughter were gréeuous, and by her loue much bloud should be shed: yet should it be in the end ioyous, and for the honor of the Empire. The Emperour knowing <hi>Nabato</hi> euer to haue had care of his affaires, gaue credit to him, but yet retyred with the prince of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> both very sad into the pallace.

He had no sooner done it, but he beheld before him one lyke a mightie furie, who said: Thinke not vnhappie Knight, to win easily the victorie: and therewith lifted vp a huge mace, hauing also <hi>Celindos</hi> sword at his girdle: which the Prince espying, ioyfully ran within him, but could by no meanes recouer his sword, which so vexed him that he laid hold on his mace, and continued strugling with him for it more than an hower, at which time the furie vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leauing his sword on the ground, which he took vp with no lesse ioy than when he first won it. So being very wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he rested awhile in the midst of the Court, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the gallant building: at last he rose, and came to a gate of stéele, that had thereon this writing. <hi>Whosoeuer wil win the Armour of the beloued Iason, let him knocke with the pomell of his sword, and he shall find the entrance dangerous. Celindo</hi> (for all the threatning) knocked pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and the gate opened: but on either side stood two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Sagittaries, with hatchets of stéele in their hands readie to strike hauing their armes aloft. At which sight the Prince was somewhat amazed, but taking courage, he ran vnder one of the Sagittaries armes, which did not

God willing we will frée the prisoners in the Castle that these false Knights haue taken, and there will we rest to night. The Princesse bad him doo his pleasure. So set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward, they attained sight of the Castle a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Euening, and the Giant (putting on the Helmet of <hi>Friston</hi>) called to them within to open the gate, saying hée was <hi>Friston</hi> their Master, wearied with combat, and had brought a Ladie and a rich Prize with him. To whome the Knight that opened the gate said: Welcome my lord, here haue we also a Knight in rich armour, who slew fiue of your Knights within sight of the Castle, and him haue we trained in, and shut into your chamber. Use curteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Ladie said the Giant, and some of you bring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> key, that I maye chastise him with death, before I put off my armour. This was no sooner commaunded, but it was done, and <hi>Brandafidel</hi> perceiued it was the Knight that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted him in the battell, yet faining his intent, hee sayd: Prowd Knight, that hast entred my Castle without my license, come take thy weapons and descend into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, that I may punish thée for murdring my seruants. Thou speakest something like a Knight said the Prisoner, but I hope to punish thée, for maintaining such false cowards as these are. So they descended together, and as they were going downe the staires, <hi>Brandafidel</hi> with his mace bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two Knights that attended them, and turning to the Knight that went with him, he said: Assist me sir knight, as you did to day assist me in the battell at the chariot, and you shall sée we wil not leaue aliue one of these euill peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: therefore I pray you goe vnto the gate, that none es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape you. The Knight perceiuing who it was, ioyfullye tooke possession of the gate, while <hi>Brandafidel</hi> like a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie Wolfe raged vp and downe the Castle, and so chased them, that fearfull to be all slaine, they ran vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate, thinking to get foorth: but there death likewise encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred them, sitting imperiously on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knights sword in the rich armour, whom they had trecherously imprisoned.

In briefe, they slew all that could resist, onely a few ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants they saued, who séemed ioyfull to be deliuered from their tyrant masters. Then went they both to <hi>Floralinda,</hi> and before her the Giant said: Knight, be yet so kinde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs after all your passed kindnesses, as to tell <hi>Brandafi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> (the vowed Frend to prince <hi>Rosicleer, Meridian.

words to gratulate such fauour, a Page came riding to them from a goodly proportioned knight, whose armour was very precious, and two Lyons in his shield, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged them all to the Iustes.

Then <hi>Rosabel</hi> prepared himselfe, but the knight lifting vp hys Beuer said: Farre be it from <hi>Oristoldo</hi> sonne of <hi>Sacridiro</hi> king of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> to runne against any that so much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his fathers déerest frend.

All of them so grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as the dull earth drunke with their teares, sent foorth from her pierced bosome salt and brackish springs, that yet remaine in the forrests of <hi>Niquea</hi> as endlesse testimonies of that sad midnights misaduenture: the chast Moone clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her bright countenance, and swéet <hi>Venus</hi> in her spheare lookt more discoloured, than when the son of <hi>Mirrha</hi> was murdred by a sauage Boare, and the Day-Starre refused to lead backe the hoast of heauen, to giue way to the next daies morning: but mourned in the skies euen as when <hi>Ceyx</hi> his sonne was drenched in the Seas. But if all these Planets, Earth, Springes and Princes sorrowed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grief and rage of <hi>Rosabel</hi> so much excéeded all, as neither the fortunelesse Mother of those fourtéene Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters slaine by the son and Daughter of <hi>Latona,</hi> could with her griefe equall his sorrow: nor the wrath of <hi>Alcides</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sacrificed himselfe on the mountaine of <hi>Oeta</hi> be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this yong princes rage. And surely had not the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Lisarte</hi> preuailed, he had desperatly ended his life: who perswading him and the other princes, that by the words on the Christaline piller, which supported the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er where <hi>Rosabel</hi> was inchanted, it was very likely they were borne thether: and therwith combining themselues neuer to cease trauel til they had found them out: both <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabel</hi> and the other princes were somewhat quiet. So par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselues two and two: <hi>Rosabel</hi> &amp; <hi>Oristoldo</hi> went backe to <hi>Niquea,</hi> to answere for the imprisoned kings, and there to hearken if they might heare of the Ladies: the

two princes of <hi>Celandia</hi> sent home their ships and knights and onely with two pages followed this aduenture: so did <hi>Lisarte</hi> &amp; his son another way accompanied onely with the two disguised Ladies their pages. And séeing their heauy parting hath tyred my wearied spirits, I wil end this book (after that for your better memory) I haue collected the places together where we left our knights and Ladies.</p>
               <p>The gallant <hi>Torismundo</hi> prince of <hi>Spaine</hi> we left reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with <hi>Grisalinda</hi> the princesse of <hi>France</hi> &amp; his yong son, the valiant Tartarian with <hi>Grisanea</hi> princesse of <hi>Holland</hi> and their sonne, trauelling to his country, from the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iland where <hi>Rosicleer</hi> made Lord (after the death of <hi>Bruncaldo</hi> the Rouer and his brethren the Giants) the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet knight <hi>Briano,</hi> giuing him to wife the imprisoned Damsel daughter to <hi>Rosicleers</hi> old frends the Lord &amp; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the valley of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines. <hi>Rosicleer, Meridian,</hi> and the new Louer <hi>Oristides,</hi> we leaue going to Sea from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonia,</hi> ful of sorrow for the losse of <hi>Rosabel.</hi> The faire <hi>Sarmacia</hi> ful of iealous passion we left in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forrests of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and not farre off <hi>Brandafidel</hi> and <hi>Floralinda</hi> in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle they had gotten from <hi>Friston:</hi> the inchanter <hi>Gelasio</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned by <hi>Lyrgandeo: Liriana,</hi> her Cousins, and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landian princesse borne away in the Chariot. How <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabel</hi> and his frends parted, you heard before: onely wee haue not béen copious enough in expressing <hi>Roselias</hi> sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the Dacians absence, whom she last saw pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by <hi>Lisartes</hi> ship in his inchanted boat: where also wee last left him. And heere will wee leaue off, intending with him to begin our next Booke.</p>
