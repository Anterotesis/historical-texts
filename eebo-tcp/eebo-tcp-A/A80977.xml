            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Parlament aſſembled paſt the twelfth day of <hi>October</hi> in the year of our Lord 1643. It is (amongſt other things) ordained, that the fellowſhip of Merchants-adventurers of <hi>England</hi> ſhall continue and be a Corporation, and ſhall have power to levy monies on the members of their Corporation, and their goods, for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary charge and maintenance of their government; And that no perſon ſhall trade into thoſe parts limited by their Incorporations, but ſuch as are free of that Corporation, upon forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their goods; Provided that the ſaid fellowſhip ſhall not exclude any perſon from his freedome and admiſſion into the ſaid fellowſhip which ſhall deſire it by way of redemption (if ſuch perſon by their cuſtome be capable thereof, and hath been bred a Merchant) and ſhall pay one hundred pounds for the ſame, if he be free and an inhabitant of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and trade from that Port: Or fifty pounds if he be not free, and no inhabitant of the ſaid City, and trade not from thence; the ſame Ordinance to remain in full force, untill a Bill or Act ſhalbe prepared and paſſed in Parlament for the further ſetling, and full confirming of the priviledges to the ſaid fellowſhip according to the intent and true meaning of the ſaid Ordinance. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſaid fellowſhip is and hath been antiently authorized from time to time to make free election and choice of ſuch ſeveral Cities, Towns or Places in the parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the 17 provinces of the Netherlands, with the aſſent and agreement of the chief Governours thereof for their Reſidence, Mart and Staple, as they ſhall think moſt meet, commodious and convenient for their trade, trafique &amp; merchandize in thoſe Lands; and again to leave, forſake, alter and change the ſame at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And whereas lately ſince the peace concluded with the Lords the States General, the ſaid fellowſhip hath by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Concordates, with the Magiſtrates of the City of <hi>Dordrecht</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> agreed and made choice of the ſaid City of <hi>Dordrecht</hi> for the Reſidence, Mart and Staple of their ſaid trade within the Provinces, Countries, Cities and Places under the Government of the ſaid Lords the States General. Foraſmuch therefore as the ſaid treaty of Concordates, with the City of <hi>Dordrecht</hi> aforeſaid, was entred into, by and with our free knowledge and conſent; We, with the advice of Our Council, having taken the premiſes into our ſerious conſideration, have hereby thought at (with the advice aforeſaid) to ratifie and confirm the ſaid Treaty of Concordates, made and concluded between the ſaid City of <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> and the fellowſhip of Merchants-adventurers of <hi>England</hi> aforeſaid. And therefore in purſuance of the ſaid Ordinance of Parlament and the ſaid Treaty, We, with the advice aforeſaid, do hereby ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will and require, that all and every perſon and perſons, being free of the ſaid fellowſhip, and all Factors, Agents, and Servants belonging unto any of the ſaid fellowſhip, now being, or reſiding within any the Provinces, Cities, or Places under the Government of the ſaid Lords the States General, and that therein, or in any of them do exerciſe, uſe or profeſs the trade, traffique and merchandize limited to the ſaid Incorporation, do and ſhall at or before the tenth day of <hi>June</hi> now next enſuing remove themſelves, their goods, merchandizes, traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique and families reſpectively unto the ſaid City of <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> and do and ſhall from thenceforth, therein alone reſide and exerciſe their trade and traffique, both for themſelves and their principals, and in no other Province, City, or Place under the government of the ſaid Lords the States General, during the time that they, or any of them ſhall continue, and remain within the ſame, and ſhall therein uſe, exerciſe or profeſs the trade of the ſaid fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And furthermore that the trade of the ſaid fellowſhip may alſo for the time to come, be the better reduced and continued into and in this orderly and well governed courſe; We do hereby, with the advice aforeſaid, declare our pleaſure to be, and do ſtrictly will and enjoyn, that no perſon or perſons of this Commonwealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the Dominions thereunto belonging, ſhall at any time or times from and after the ſaid tenth day of <hi>June</hi> now next coming, ſhip, tranſport, carry, or convey, or cauſe to be ſhipped, tranſported, carryed, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, either from the City and Port of <hi>London,</hi> or from any other City, Town, Port, Haven, and Creek of the Commonwealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the Dominions thereunto belonging, by way of Merchandize, any woollen cloathes, or other <hi>Engliſh</hi> woollen manufactures, of what ſort or kind ſoever, now made, or hereafter to be made, unto any the Cities, Towns, or Places in <hi>Germany,</hi> or the ſeventeen Provinces of the Netherlands, ſave onely and except the Mart, and Staple Towns of the ſaid fellowſhip, of Merchants-adventurers of <hi>England</hi> in thoſe parts for the time being, or to one of them, upon pain of forfeiture of the ſaid woollen cloaths, and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> woollen Manufactures, and ſuch further and other paines, penalties, puniſhments and forfeitures, as by the ſaid Ordinance of Parlament, or by any other law may be lawfully inflicted on ſuch Offendors. Provided nevertheleſs that the ſaid fellowſhip ſhall not exclude any perſon from his freedome and admiſſion into the ſaid fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip who ſhall deſire it by way of Redemption upon ſuch Rules, Payments, and Fines reſpectively, as in and by the ſaid Ordinance of Parlament is reſerved, and as is herein before recited. And laſtly, We require and command all our Officers and Miniſters of Iuſtice, and the Commiſſioners of our Cuſtomes, and the ſeveral Officers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that ſervice, that they be ayding and aſſiſting unto the fellowſhip of Merchant-adventurers of <hi>England,</hi> in the ſupportation of their Government and regulation of their trade, and for preſervation of the priviledges, ju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>risdictions and franchiſes lawfully granted unto them by any Act or Ordinance of Parlament.</p>
