            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER</head>
                  <p>IN this sad declension of Religion, the
<hi>Seers,</hi> who are appointed to be the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Church, cannot but observe
that the Supplanters and Underminers
are gone out, and are digging down the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
and having destroy'd all publick
forms of Ecclesiastical Government, discou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd
an excellent, Liturgie, taken off the
hinges of Unity, disgrac'd the Articles of
Religion, polluted publick Assemblies, taken
away all cognizance of Schism, by ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all Sects, and giving Countenance to
that against which all Power ought to stand
upon their guard. There is now nothing left,
but that we take care that men be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
<pb facs="tcp:35125:5"/>
For concerning the Ornament and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of Religion, we cannot make that
provision we desire; <hi>Incertis de salute de
gloria minime certandum.</hi> For since they
who have seen <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in prosperity, and
have forgotten the order of the Morning and
Evening Sacrifice, and the beauty of the
Temple will be tempted to neglect so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a ministration, and their assembling
themselves together for peace, and holy Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and be content with any thing that is
brought to them, though it be but the husks
and acorns of Prodigals and Swine, so they
may enjoy their Lands and their Money
with it; we must now take care that the
young men, who were born in the Captivity,
may be taught how to Worship the God of
<hi>Israel</hi> after the manner of their fore-fathers,
till it shall please God that Religion shall
return into the Land, and dwell safely, and
grow prosperously,</p>
                  <p>But never did the excellency of Episcopal
Government apppear so demonstratively and
conspicuously as now: Under their conduct
and order we had a Church so united, so
orderly, so govern'd, a Religion so setled,
Articles so true, sufficient, and confess'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
so prudent and so obey'd, Devotions
<pb facs="tcp:35125:5"/>
so regular and constant, Sacraments so
adorn'd and ministred, Churches so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and religious, Circumstances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
so grave and prudent, so useful
and apt for edification, that the enemies
of our Church, who serve the Pope in all
things, and <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ in some, who
dare transgress an Institution and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Christ, but dare not break a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Pope, did despair of prevailing
against Us and <hi>Truth,</hi> and knew no hopes
but by setting their faces against us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
this Government, and then they knew
they should triumph without any enemy: so
<hi>Balaam</hi> the Son of <hi>Bosor</hi> was sent for, to
curse the People of the Lord, in hope that
the son of <hi>Zippor</hi> might prevail against
them that had long prospered under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now instead of this excellency of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Constitution of Religion, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are fallen under the Harrows and Saws
of impertinent and ignorant Preachers, who
think all Religion is a Sermon, and all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ought to be Libels against Truth and
old Governours, and expound Chapters that
the meaning may never be understood, and
pray, that they may be thought able to talk,
<pb facs="tcp:35125:6"/>
but not to hold their peace, they casting not to
obtian any thing but Wealth and Victory,
Power and Plunder: and the People have
reap'd the fruits apt to grow upon such Crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocks;
they grow idle and false, hypocrites
and careless, they deny themselves nothing that
is pleasant, they despise Religion, forget
Government, and some never think of Heaven,
and they that do, think to go thither in
such paths which all the Ages of the
Church did give men warning of, lest they
shoul that way go to the Devil.</p>
                  <p>But when men have try'd all that they can,
it is to be supposed they will return to the
excellency and advantages of the Christian
Religion, as it is taught by the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> for by destroying it no end can be
serv'd but of Sin and Folly, Faction and
Death eternal. For besides that no Church,
that is enemy to this, does worship God in
that truth of Propositions, in that unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and pious Liturgie, and in preaching
the necessities of holy life, so much as the
Church of <hi>England</hi> does; besides this (I
say) it cannot be persecuted by any Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that understands his own Interest, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he be first abused by false Preachers, and
then prefers his secret Opinion before his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:35125:6"/>
Advantage. For no Church in the
World is so great a friend to Loyalty and
Obedience as she, and her Sisters of the
same perswasion. They that hate Bishops
have destroy'd Monarchy, and they that
would erect an Ecclestical Monarchy must
consequently subject the temporal to it; and
both one and the other would be supream
in Consciences: and they that govern
there with an opinion that in all things
they ought to be attended to, will let their
Prince govern others, so long as he will be
rul'd by them.</p>
                  <p>And certainly for a Prince to persecute
the Protestant Religion, is as if a
Physician should endeavour to destroy all
Medicaments, and Fathers kill their Sons,
and the Master of Ceremonies destroy all
Formalities and Courtships, and as if the
Pope should root out all the Ecclesiastick
State. Nothing so combines with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if it be of God's appointment, as
the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
because nothing does more adhere to the
Word of God, and disregard the crafty
advantages of the World. If any man
shall not decline to try his Title by the
Word of God, it is certain there is not in
<pb facs="tcp:35125:7"/>
the world a better guard for it than the
true Protestant Religion, as it is taught
in our Church. But let things be as it
please God; it is certain that in that day
when Truth gets her Victory, in that day
we shall prevail against all God's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and ours, not in the purchaces and
perquisites of the world, but in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and returns of Holiness and Patience,
and Faith and Charity; for by these we
worship God, and against this Interest we
cannot serve any thing else.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time we must by all means
secure the founndation, and take care that
Religion may be conveyed in all its mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
parts the same as it was, but by
new and permitted instruments. For let
us secure that our young men be good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
it is easy to make them good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
unless they be abus'd with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and suck venom with their milk;
they cannot leave our Communion till they
have reason to reprove our Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore in the following pages
a Compendium of what we are to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
what <hi>to do,</hi> and what <hi>to Desire.</hi>
It is indeed very little; but it is enough
<pb facs="tcp:35125:7"/>
to begin with, and will serve all persons
so long as they need milk, and not strong
meat. And he that hath given the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Assistances to thee, desires to be
even a door-keeper in God's House, and
to be a servant of the meanest of God's
servants, and thinks it a worthy employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to teach the most ignorant, and make
them to know Christ, though but in the
first rudiments of a holy Institution. This
only he affirms, that there is a more solid
comfort and material support to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
spirit in one article of Faith, in one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of the Lord's Prayer, in one <hi>Holy Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
than in all the disputes of impertinent
people, who take more pains to prove there
is a Purgatory, than to perswade men to
avoid Hell: And that a plain Catechism
can more instruct a Soul, than the whole
day's prate which some daily spit forth,
to bid them <hi>get Christ,</hi> and persecute his
Servants.</p>
                  <p>Christian Religion is admirable for its
wisdom, for its simplicity; and he that
presents the following Papers to thee, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
to teach thee as the Church was
taught in the early days of the Apostles; to
believe the Christian Faith, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb facs="tcp:35125:8"/>
it; to represent plain Rules of good
Life; to describe easie Forms of Prayer;
to bring into your Assemblies Hymns of
Glorification and Thanksgiving, and Psalms
of Prayer. By these easy paths they lead
Christ's little ones into the Fold of their
great Bishop: and if by this any service be
done to God, any ministery to the Soul of
a Child or an ignorant Woman, it is hoped
that God will accept it: and it is reward
enough, if by my Ministery God will bring
it to pass that any Soul shall be instructed,
and brought into that state of good things,
that it shall rejoyce for ever.</p>
                  <p>But do thou pray for him that desires
this to thee, and endeavours it,</p>

And all these things God the Father
does for us by his Son, and the Son
by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy
Spirit by all means within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
which are operative upon and
proportionable to the nature of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

works Miracles, gives the gifts of
Prophecy and of Interpretation, that
teaches us what and how to pray,
that gives us Zeal and holy Desires;
who sanctifies Children in Baptism,
and confirms them with his grace in
Comfirmation, and reproves the
world, and consecrates Bishops and
all the Ministers of the Gospel, and
absolves the Penitent, and Blesses
the Obedient, and comforts the

and makes intercession
for the Saints: that is, the Church
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35125:24"/>
and those whom he hath Blessed,
appointed and sanctified to these
purposes, do all these Ministeries
by his Authority and his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and his Aids. This is he
that <hi>testifies to our Spirits that we are

to cry, <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> that is, who
inspires into us such humble confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of our being accepted in our
hearty and constant endeavours to
please God, that we can with
chearfulness and joy call God our
Father, and expect and hope for
the portion of Sons both here and
hereafter, and in the certainty of
this hope, to work out our Salvation
with fear and reverence, with
trembling and joy, with distrust of
our selves and mighty confidence
in God. By this holy and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed

Wisdom, and Utterance, and

can be necessary for the
Church in several ages and periods,
for her beginning, for her continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,

                           </hi> and love his

shall have him yet more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:

shall for ever be separated from the

nor in the world to come. Lastly, this
Holy Spirit seals us to the day of
Redemption; that is, God gives us
his Holy Spirit as a testimony that
he will raise us again at the last day,
and give us a portion in the glories
of his Kingdom, in the inheritance

and a journey. Every day propound
to your self a Rosary or a Chaplet of
good works to present to God at night.</item>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35125:30"/>
other occasions shall permit; but it is
good to be as regular as you can, and as
early. Remember, he that rises first to
Prayer hath a more early title to a
Blessing. Bnt he that changes night
into day, labour into idleness, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
into sleep, changes his hopes of
blessing into a dream.</item>

to do when he is up: for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath a Soul, and hopes to save that
Soul, hath work enough to do <hi>to make
his calling and election sure,</hi> to serve
God and to pray, to read and to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
to repent and to amend, to do
good to others, and to keep evil from
themselves. And if thou hast little to
do, thou ought'st to imploy the more
time in laying up for a greater Crown
of Glory.</item>
                        <item>4. At your opening your eyes, enter
upon the day with some act of piety.

bed, solemnly and devoutly bow your
head, and worship the Holy Trinity, the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</item>
                        <item>6. When you are making ready, be
as silent as you can, and spend that time
in holy thoughts; there being no way
left to redeem that time from loss, but
by meditation and short mental prayers.
If you chuse to speak, speak somthing
of God's praises, of his goodness, his
mercies, or his greatness. Ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
that the first fruits of thy Reason

fitted to the several actions of
dressing: as at washing your hands and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35125:31"/>
face, pray God to cleanse your Soul from
sin; in putting on your cloaths, pray
him to cloth your Soul with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of your Saviour and so in all
the rest.</p>
                           <p>For Religion must not onely be the
garment of your Soul, to invest it all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
but it must be also as the fringes to
every of your actions, that something of
Religion appear in every one of them,
besides the innocence of all of them.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>9. As soon as you are dressed with the
first preparation of your cloaths, that
you can decently do it, kneel and say the
Lord's Prayer; then rise from your knees
and do what is necessary for you in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to your farther dressing, or affairs of
the house, which is speedily to be done;
and then finish your dressing according
to the foregoing Rules.</item>
                        <item>10. When you are dressed, retire
your self to your Closet, and go to your
usual devotions; which it is good that at
the first prayers they were divided into
seven actions of Piety.

the Precepts of holy life.</item>

                              <item>3. Those portions of Scripture
which you use in your prayers,
let them not be long: a Chapter
at once, no more. But then what
time you can afford, spend it in
thinking and meditating upon
the holy Precepts w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you read.</item>
                              <item>4. Be sure to meditate so long, till
you make some <hi>act of piety</hi> upon
the occasion of what you medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35125:32"/>
either that you get some new
arguments against a sin, or some
new incouragements to vertue;
some spiritual strength and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
or else some act of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to God, or glorification of him.</item>
                              <item>5. I advise that you would read
your Chapter in the midst of your
Prayers in the Morning, if they
be divided according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the former actions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
little interruptions will be
apt to make your Prayers less te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and your self more attent
upon them. But if you find any
other way more agreeing to your
spirit and disposition, use your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
without scruple.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>12. Before you go forth of your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
after your Prayers are done, set
your self down a little while and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what you are to do that day, what
matter or business is like to imploy you
or to tempt you; and take particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
against that, whether it be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of wrangling, or anger, or covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or vain courtship, or feasting; and
when you enter upon it, remember up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what you resolved in your Closet.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35125:32"/>
If yo are likely to have nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
that day, a general recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the affairs of that day to God
in your prayers will be sufficient: but if
there be any thing foreseen that is not
usual, be sure to be armed for it by a
hearty, though a short, prayer, and an
earnest prudent resolution before-hand,
and then watch when the thing comes.</item>
                        <item>13. Whosoever hath Children or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
let him or her take care that all the
Children and Servants of the Family say
their Prayers before they begin their
work. The <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> and the <hi>Ten
Commandments,</hi> with the <hi>short verse</hi> at the
end of every Commandment which the

house and proper imployment, ever
avoiding idleness, or too much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of affection upon the things of the

Servants, but find them all
<hi>work</hi> and <hi>meat,</hi> call upon them careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
reprove them without reproaches or

and a friend to them, and exact of them

                        <item>16. In your Servants suffer any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against your self rather than against
God; endure not that they should
swear, or lie, or steal, or be wanton, or
curse each other, or be railers, or slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
or tell-tales, or sowers of dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the family, or amongst neighbours.</item>
                        <item>17. In all your entercourse with your
neighbours in the day, let your affairs
be wholly matter of business or civility,
and always managed with Justice and
Charity: never let it be matter of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
or enquiry into the actions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
always without censuring or rash
judgment, without backbiting, slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or detraction: Do it not your self,
neither converse with them that do. He
or she that loves tale-bearers shall never
be beloved, or be innocent.</item>
                        <item>18. Before dinner and supper, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35125:33"/>
as it is convenient or can be had, let
the publick Prayers of the Church, or
some parts of them be said publickly in
the family, and let as many be present
as you can. The same rule is also to be
observed for Sundays and Holy-days, for
their going to Church. Let no servant
be always detained, but relieved and
provided for by changes.</item>
                        <item>19. Let your meal be temperate and
wholesom according to your quality
and the season, begun and ended with
Prayer: and be sure that in the course
of your meal, and before you rise, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
your self, and send your heart up
to God with some holy and short Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
remembring your duty, fearing
to offend, or desiring and sighing after
the eternal Supper of the Lamb.</item>
                        <item>20. After meal use what innocent
refreshment you please, to refresh your
mind or body with these measures.
<list>
                              <item>1. Let it not be too expensive of
time.</item>
                              <item>2. Let it not hinder your devotion,
nor your business.</item>
                              <item>3. Let it be always without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
or passion.</item>
                              <item>4. Let it not then wholly take you
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35125:34"/>
up when you are at it; but let
your heart retire with some holy
thoughts and sober recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
lest your mind be seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by it, and your affections car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off from better things: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
your affections for God, and
sober and severe imployment.
Here you may be refreshed, but
take heed you neither <hi>dwell here,</hi>
nor <hi>sin here.</hi> It is better never to
use recreation, than at any time
to sin by it: But you may use
recreation, and avoid sin, and
<hi>that's the best temper.</hi> But if you
cannot do both, be more careful
of your Soul than of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment;
and <hi>that's the best
security.</hi> But then, in what you
use to sin, carefully avoid it, and
change your refreshment for
some other instance in which
you can be more innocent.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>21. Entertain no long discourse with
any, but, if you can, bring in something
to season it with Religion: as God must
be in all your thoughts, so, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
let him be in all your discourses, at
least let him be at one end of it; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35125:34"/>
when you can speak of him, be sure you
forget not to think of him.</item>
                        <item>
                           <p>22. Towards the declining of the day,
be sure to retire to your private devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Read, meditate and pray. In
which I propound to you this method,
On the Lord's day meditate of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Creation, of the works of
God, and all his benefits to mankind,
and to you in particular. Then let your
devotion be, humbly upon your knees to
say over the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Psalms, and
sometimes the 104<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, with proper Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
which you shall find or get: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the form of Thanksgiving which
is in the <hi>Rule of Holy Living,</hi> pag. 378.
in the manner as is there directed, or
some other of your own chusing.

with any one, or a great feast, or great
company, or a great joy, or a great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
then recollect your self with the
more diligence: ask pardon for what is

good. If you have omitted any duty,
make amends next day; and yet if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be found that was amiss, be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
still, and thankful, and pray God
for pardon if any thing be amiss that
you know not of. If all these things be
in your offices, for your last prayers be
sure to apply them according to what
you find in your examination: but if
they be not, supply them with short eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
before you begin your last

also and be sure to take notice of all
the mercies and deliverances of your self

                        <item>25. As you are going to bed, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as you can conveniently, or that you
are not hindred by company, meditate
of death and the preparations to your
grave. When you lie down, close your
eyes with a short prayer, commit your

and when you have done, trust him

by holy thoughts and aspirations, and
remember the sins of your youth: and
sometimes remember your dead, and
that you shall die; and pray to God to
send to you and all mankind a mercy in

                        <item>27. Upon the Holy-days observe the
same Rules; only let the matter of
your meditations be according to the
mystery of the day. As upon <hi>Christmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>

month at least: but let it be with these
cautions and measures.
<list>
                              <item>1. Do not chuse a Festival of the
Church for your Fasting-day.</item>
                              <item>2. Eat nothing till your afternoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotions
be done, if the health
of your body will permit it: if
not, take something, though it
be the less.</item>
                              <item>3. When you eat your meal, let it
be no more than ordinary, lest
your fasting day end in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
evening.</item>
                              <item>4. Let the actions of all the day be
proportionable ot it; abstain
from your usual recreations on
that day, and from greater mirth.</item>
                              <item>5. Be sure to design before-hand
the purposes of your fast, either
for. <hi>Repentance,</hi> or for <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or for the advantages of
<hi>Prayer,</hi> and let your devotins
be accordingly. But be sure not
to think fasting, or eating fish, or
eating nothing of it self to be
pleasing to God, but as it serves
to one of these purposes.</item>
                              <item>6. Let some part of that day extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

Confession of sins, and for beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

sake you set apart that day.</item>
                              <item>7. Be sure that on that day you set

and of Alms.</item>

                     <pb facs="tcp:35125:76"/>TO THE
Christian Reader.</head>
                  <p>AMong the so troublesome multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Books, and the no less
troublesome scarcity of good ones,
I have no reason to think this little
Piece will much increase the number of
the one, or not serve to balance the trouble
of the other: but I rather hope it may be
acceptable and useful, if either the great
Eminence of the Author, or the Argument
it self, or else the small bulk, which are
things that use to render works of this kind
considerable, be sufficient either to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
or excuse it. For the necessity of the
argument may recommend it not to most
Readers only, but very many Writers too.
And without doubt, many of those who
have been ambitious to put themselves into
the number of Authors by publishing their
abortive labours, will need the Rules
and Offices of this Manual, when their
Conscience shall cite them to Repentance,
and to ask God forgiveness for nourishing
Faction, and sowing the seeds of Discord,
<pb facs="tcp:35125:77"/>
and venting their crude Notions to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
trouble, and their own shame. For
such men in the use of this little <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridion</hi>
may find more comfort, and
do thimselves and the Age more right,
than in that small harvest of reputation
their own voluminous labours could bring
in, which are now very fitly preferred
from the Closet to the more worthy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries
of the Shop ond Kitchin. But
the most Reverend Author, to whose learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Piety thou owest these following assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who in the sweetness and mildness
of these lines has expressed the features
and lineaments of his own candid, serene
Soul, did not address them for his own
use in that kind. For that he was of
the Highest Order of our Church, he did
not owe to his Interest, which advances
some, nor to his Money, which prefers
commonly too many, but wholly to his
Vertues and his Learning, and those other
eminent Graces, that made his Example
as great in the Church as was his Dignity.
And this little Book is a great instance of
his Humility and Charity, which he does
in some kind still exercise, though he be now
gone to receive his reward for them; and
as he used to look into the necessities of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent
<pb facs="tcp:35125:77"/>
persons to relieve them with his
hand, so in this Portuise he descends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with the weaknesses and solitariness
of humble Penitents, directing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
their Devotions, and instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Repentance, and preparing
a constant store-house of relief for them
by his Pen. And now if a person so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in Grace, so innocent in Life, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such Exercises as this, (for what
thou receivest here, know, Courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it comes from his Counsel, and from
his daily Experience and Practise too) consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whether thou thy self art not concerned
to bring thy actions and life to as severe
a scrutiny and a repentance as operative.
If thou joynest with me in Opinion, here
is a Directory ready at hand: but if
not, thou needest it so much the more.
For our Sins, the less impression they make on
our Memory, the deeper they make on our
Conscience; and he is in some cases the
most guilty who presumes he is wholly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
Retract therefore that conceit, and betake

                        <p>YOU are to consider the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of this Duty. For if
we take care that the
Rooms which we eat or sleep in
should be kept clean, you cannot
but think that the cleansing of the Soul
is a Concernment infinitely beyond it:
and for doing this there is no other way
left but to search out every corner of it,
and to cast out every Sin, with every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
thought that hath defiled it.</p>

                        <p>You are to remember, that there is a
great Measure of Discretion to be used
in the Performance of this: so that you
may neither omit it, when your own
heart may tell you that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amiss in you which must be look'd
after; nor on the other side over-scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulously
pursue it, when you are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to your self of any notable Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but such as are incident to humane
frailty: for if you do not wilfully pass
over any of your greater Offences, but
confess particularly, and repent seriously
of them, God will more easily pass by
your lesser Infirmities, being such as the
Holy Prophet despaired of finding out,
when he so sadly complained, <hi>Who can
tell how oft he offendeth?</hi>

                        <p>That though it may not only seem,
but be impossible to you to recollect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
failing, and that your scrupulous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
of it may rather prove a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the Conscience than an Ease to
it; yet you are so far to exercise an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
upon your self, as by observing
these lesser particulars (though it be but
in gross) you may the better discover
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35125:79"/>
what the corruption of your Nature
sways you to; and having discovered it,
you are bound to strive to subdue it by

examining of the Merits of it; yet
there are times when this ought to be
more punctually and solemnly done, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
at such times as you set apart for

preparing your self for the devout Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

several Methods have been

Matter of it into Thoughts, Words

by their several Objects, either as
being immediately sins against God, or
against your Neighbour, or against your
own Soul. Others advise to set God's
holy Commandments before you, and to
examine by that Rule what you have

done amiss. But in the chice of this
you may free your self from all Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

the Mode of doing may easily be

                        <p>THat besides this Examination of your
Conscience, (which may be done in
secret between God and your own Soul)
there is great use of Holy Confession:
which though it be not generally in all
Cases, and peremptorily commanded, as
if without it no Salvation could possibly
be had; yet you are advised by the
Church under whose discipline you live,
that before you are to receive the Holy
Sacrament, or when you are visited with
any dangerous sickness, if you find any
one particular sin or more that lies heavy
upon you, to disburthen your self of it
into the Bosom of your Confessor, who
not only stands between God and you
to pray for you, but hath the power of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35125:80"/>
the Keys committed to him, upon your
true Repentance to Absolve you in
Christ's Name from those sins which
you have confessed to him.</p>

                        <p>You are to remember that you bring
along with you to Confession not only
unfeigned Sorrow and Remorse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for sins past, but settled Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the time to come never to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in the same kind again: for
without this, Confession is but a mere
Pageant, and rather a mockery of God,
than any effectual means to reconcile
you to him.</p>

                        <p>That having made choice of such a
Confessor who is every way qualified
that you may trust your Soul with him,
you are advised plainly and sincerely to
open your heart to him, and that laying
aside all consideration of any personal
weakness in him, you are to look upon
him only as he is a Trustee from God,
and commissioned by him as his Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

                        <p>That the Manner of your Confession
be in an humble posture on your knees,
as being made to God rather than man:
and for the Matter of it, let it be severe
and serious; but yet so as it may be
without any inordinate Anxiety and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
Scruples, which serve only
to entangle the Soul, and instead of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
you free, (which is the benefit to be
looked for by Confession) perplex you

you are to consult with your own neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities:
and as your Physician is not sent
for upon every small diftemper, which
your own care may rectifie; so neither
are you obliged upon every failing to be
over-scrupulous, or to think it a point
of Necessity presently to confess it: For
the Confessor cannot be always present,
but your God is, to whom if you apply
your self with Prayers and Penitence,
confessing in his ears alone whatever you
have done amiss, and stedfastly believing
that through the merits of your Saviour
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35125:81"/>
they shall never be imputed to you, you
may be confident that your Absolution
is at that time sealed in Heaven, but the
comfortable declaration of it you are to
look for from the Priest.</p>

aside some Day, either Weekly or (at

those crying sins which have occasioned
them; offering up your earnest prayers

deny me not a room among the Penitent.</p>

and humbled himself before thee, thou
hadst so much regard even of this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Penitence of his, as to promise not
to bring the evil upon him in his days.</p>
                     <p>But, Lord, if my heart deceives me
not, I do not only outwardly and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
but really and cordially Repent.</p>
                     <p>And therefore for the evil that I have
deserved, O my God, rather let the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment

                     <p>Rather let me perform the Penance of
my Tears here, than reserve it for that

do no good.</p>
                     <p>And having said all this, if my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
be yet imperfect, (as I know it

in this just balance) let the bitter
Sufferings of thy dear Son <hi>Jesus</hi> be cast

into the Scale, and then I shall not fear
if thou enter into Judgment with me.</p>

                     <p>I can Fast from a meal sometimes,
(though it be with much ado) and I
can Pray, though coldly enough; and if
the fit and qualm of my Devotion holds
out longer, I can strain for a Tear or two
to sprinkle upon my dry Devotions.</p>
                     <p>But should I fast my self into Air and
Emptiness, and weep my self into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
should I tear the skin from this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
Flesh of mine, I should never be able
to satisfie for the least of those Millions
of Millions of sins, which, through the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
moments of my life, either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:35125:96"/>
or knowingly, weakly or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
I have sinned against thee.</p>
                     <p>What I have transgressed against
others, I am not only sorry for, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as far as my power will reach, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie.
But for my sins against thee, my
God, I must lay my hand upon my
mouth for ever, for I have nothing to
return or answer.</p>
                     <p>But the comfort is, (and blessed shall
be my Soul if rightly I lay hold on it)
that it is thou, O my blessed <hi>Jesu,</hi> who
hast satisfied for me, one drop of whose
blood is enough to satisfie for the sins of
a thousand worlds.</p>
                     <p>And this being so, will thy offended
Eather be so rigorous as to require the
same payment again? Especially will
he require it of me, a poor, a broken, and
a bankrupt Sinner?</p>
                     <p>Canst thou exact the utmost farthing

                     <p>Nay, be confident (though it be with

those over-familiar corruptions of my
