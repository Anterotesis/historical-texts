            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

High Sheriff of the County of Essex.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Do not think my self obliged to make an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology
to the World for the publication of
this Sermon, which you very well know, Sir, is
none of my act, and I am sure was far from my
intention when I composed it; indeed, as for the
faults of the Sermon, I alone am responsible, but
then it ought to be considered that the more faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it is, the more obedience I have shewn in the
publication of it; and indeed, it would have
very ill become me, especially after I had been
preaching up Submission to Superiours, so far
to have contradicted my own Doctrine by my
Practice, as not to have complied with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
desires of the learned and reverend Iudge,
your self and those loyal Gentlemen of the Grand
Iury. I know very well that Discourses of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are but too needfull in such an Age as this,
wherein the minds of the People, by sucking in
the contagious breath of false Teachers, are so
wofully infected with seditious and rebellious
Principles; against which I have herein endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb facs="tcp:106255:3"/>
to prescribe as much antidote as the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
compass of a Sermon would contain; but in
so short a Discourse it is a hard matter to doe
justice to so copious an argument. And I am
apt to think, Sir, that had not your judgment
been too much bribed by the known candour and
goodness of your nature, by your kindness to the
Authour of it, and especially by your immoveable
Loyalty to your Prince, which could never be
shock'd by all the late attempts of a popular
Faction, you would have found defects enough
in it to have excused me for my own credit sake
from publishing it to the World; but since it
must be, I pray God it may answer your honest
intention, which I am very sure was to doe good
to the World by it, to open the eyes of those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
misled Souls that in numerous droves
have been seduced into Faction and Disloyalty,
and to direct their wandring steps into the paths
of righteousness and peace and obedience. I
remain,</p>
            <closer>

               <bibl>Rom. XIII. I.</bibl>
               <q>Let every Soul be subject to the higher
Powers; for the Powers that are, are
ordained of God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN which words you have first a Duty
injoined, <hi>Let every Soul be subject to
the higher Powers.</hi> Secondly, A rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
inforcing it, <hi>for the Powers that
are, are ordained of God.</hi> In the duty there
are three things considerable. First, The
extent of it, it is to <hi>every Soul.</hi> Secondly,
The matter of it, it is to <hi>be subject.</hi> Thirdly,
The Object of it, <hi>the higher Powers;</hi> of each
of which I shall discourse very briefly.</p>
            <p>First, Here is the extent of this Duty, it
is to <hi>every Soul,</hi> that is, to every man of what
Order or Degree or Quality soever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be High or Low, Rich or Poor,
Spiritual or Secular, none are exempt, <hi>let
every Soul be subject;</hi> without any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106255:4"/>
either of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successours,
or of the Body of the People, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
extends equally to both, because <hi>the
Powers that are, are ordained of God;</hi> they
are by God's Commission and rule by
his Authority, and therefore neither the
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the majority of the
People can claim exemption from this
duty of Subjection, without arrogating
to themselves an Authority superiour to
God's; for if we must be subject to them,
because they rule by God's Authority,
then it's certain there are none that are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to God but are under the force and
obligation of this reason.</p>
            <p>But then Secondly, You have here the
matter of this Duty, and that is to <hi>be subject,</hi>
in which comprehensive phrase is included
the whole Duty of Subjects to their Princes
and Governours, honouring their Persons,
reverencing their Authority, assisting them
against their Enemies, defending the rights
of their Government, and conscientiously
rendering to them their due Customes and
Tributes; but more especially and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
it includes our free and ready sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to them in yielding a chearfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106255:4"/>
to their Commands, so far as we can
innocently and consistently with our duty
to God, and where we cannot in patiently
undergoing all those pains and penalties
they shall think meet to inflict on us for our
disobedience, in suffering their unjust perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
without murmuring or clamour,
without disturbing their Government, or
resisting their Authority, or indeavouring
to repell their Force with Force, but meekly
submitting our cause to the judgment of
God, who is the Patron and Protectour of
oppressed Innocence: But for our clearer
understanding this necessary duty of sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jection
to our Princes and Governours, I
shall briefly explain the particulars implied
in it, which are these five.</p>
            <p>First, It implies our ready and chearfull
obedience to them in all lawfull things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our obedience to them in all
doubtfull things.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It implies our obedience to them
in all those cases wherein we are not able to
judge for our selves.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It implies great wariness and
caution, in pronouncing against their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and determinations.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106255:5"/>
            <p>Fifthly, It implies our meek and patient
submission to the penalties of their Laws and
determinations, when upon a full perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the unlawfulness of them, we cannot
actually comply with them.</p>
            <p>First, This subjection to our Prince im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
our chearfull and ready obedience to
him, in all lawfull things, for, whatsoever
God hath neither commanded nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by his own immediate dictate and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
he hath authorized his Vicegerents
to command or forbid, as they shall judge
it most expedient for the publick; so that
when they command what God hath not
forbidden, or forbid what he hath not
commanded, their will is God's, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us by their mouths, and stamps
their injunctions with his own authority;
and unless we admit this, we totally devest
the Magistrate of his power of making
Laws, because there remains no other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for new Laws, but onely that which the
Laws of God have left indifferent: so that
unless this may be commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the Magistrate, he hath no new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
left to make new Laws of, when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the matter which he injoins or forbids,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106255:5"/>
is left free and unrestrained by the Laws of
God, we are obliged in Conscience by that
divine Authority which God hath vested
him with, to render him a free and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obedience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Subjection to our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
implies our ready obedience to
them in all doubtfull things, for it is to be
considered, that 'tis as much our duty to
obey our Governours in things that are
lawfull, as not to obey them in things that
are unlawfull; and therefore if we onely
doubt whether their Commands are lawfull,
or no, our doubt ought to make us as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of disobeying as it doth of obeying
them, because the danger of sinning is on
both sides equal, and therefore in this case
where we are necessitated to determine our
selves one way or t'other, it is doubtless our
duty to determine on that side which makes
most for the publick security and peace, which
next to the Honour of God and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls ought to be prefer'd above
all things; wherefore in cases of a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
nature, 'tis both modest and safe to
subscribe to the judgment of our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
because in so doing we have not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106255:6"/>
onely our own ignorance to excuse, but
their authority to warrant us; and if we
should happen to be in the wrong through
our modesty and humility, 'twill be safer
for us than to be in the right through our
pride and self-conceit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This duty of Subjection to our
Governours, implies our ready obedience to
them in all those cases wherein we are not
capable of judging for our selves; for he
who refuses to obey his Governours in
matters that he cannot judge of, disobeys
he knows not why, and to avoid doing
that which he doth not know to be a Sin
refuses to doe that which he knows to be
a Duty; so that though that which he
refuses should be unlawfull, yet this cannot
be the motive of his refusal who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
not the reasons which make it so;
but by following the reason of our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
where our own cannot guide us we
take the best course we can not to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
and if we should be mistaken we
have this to excuse us, that 'twas by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an authority which God himself hath set
over us, whereas if we are mistaken on the
other side, we are altogether inexcusable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106255:6"/>
Fourthly, This duty of Subjection to
our Superiours doth also imply great wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and caution in pronouncing against
their judgment and determinations, for by
the Laws of Christian modesty we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to believe our Governours to be wiser
than we, because they have a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of things, and greater advantages of
inquiring into them; and therefore though
we may have some little probability that
their judgment is false, or their command
unlawfull, yet we ought not presently to
determine it so, unless it be in such plain
and evident cases as do not onely outweigh
the probability of their opinion but the
authority of it too; for he who rashly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
the command of his Superiours as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
plainly shews that 'tis not so much
the Sin of their Command that displeases
him as the Authority of it, and that 'tis not
his Conscience that takes offence at it, but
his Humour; for if it were Conscience,
the reverence which he bears to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which commands him would inspire
him with an awfull respect to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Superiours, and a modest su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion
of his own: He therefore who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106255:7"/>
upon every slight appearance of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
against the judgment of his Superiours
immediately pronounces it false and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
plainly shews that he hath too little
deference to them and too much to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and while he thus undervalues their
Wisedom and overvalues his own, it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
that he wants a great deal of that
modesty and humility that becomes a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and obedient Subject.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and lastly, This duty of Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to our Superiours also implies our
meek and patient submission to the penalties
of their Laws, when upon a full persuasion
of the unlawfulness of them we cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
comply with them; for when the
Commands of our Prince do interfere with
the Commands of God, it is an undoubted
Rule that we must obey God rather than
Man; but then at the same time that our
Allegiance to the Throne of Heaven obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to refuse <hi>active</hi> Obedience to our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Prince, it indispensably obliges us to
render <hi>passive,</hi> and not to use any violence
against him, though it be in the defence of
our Estates, or Liberties, or Lives, or which
ought to be dearer than all, our Religion;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106255:7"/>
for the just use of violence is founded in
a just authority over the Person upon
whom it is exercised, and supposes a right
in him that uses it to call the Person to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
against whom he uses it, and punish
him according to his demerit, without
which right the use of violence is an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
outrage and oppression; but sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes are in their several Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
next to and immediate under God, the
most high Sovereign of the World, and
therefore having no Authority but his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them are accountable onely to his
Tribunal; so that for Subjects in any case
whatsoever to offer violence to their Prince
is to usurp the Throne of God, and invade
his sovereign Tribunal, for in offering vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
to them we claim a superiority over
them, and in so doing impiously trespass
on the peculiar of the Almighty, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
his divine Prerogative of being King
of Kings and Lord of Lords; for since
God alone is placed above them, as being
the sole King of sovereign Kings, how can
we assume superiority over them without set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our selves in the place of God? unless
therefore we will render our selves guilty
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106255:8"/>
of the highest affront to, and prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the divine Majesty, we have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remedy, whenever we are reduced to
that extremity as that we cannot obey our
Prince without disobeying God, but to
discharge our duty courageously and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to God, and meekly and quietly to
submit to the unjust Persecutions of our
Prince, referring our Cause to that sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Tribunal before which Princes and
Peasants must one day give an account to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for every unjust and unrighteous
action: And though this may seem a hard
Chapter to those who consider onely one side
of the case, yet there is nothing more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
than that the liberty of resisting Princes
would prove a far greater mischief to the
World than all the Cruelties and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the most barbarous Tyrants; for
what though there never was any Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
so wise and good as not to be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with some faults and miscarriages, we
ought to consider that our World must be
governed by Men and not by Angels, and
that perhaps there never was any lawfull
Prince so bad, the benefits of whose Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
did not far out-weigh the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106255:8"/>
of his Tyranny; and that therefore it
is wisely eligible for us rather to suffer a less
evil than to deprive our selves of a greater
good. It is a notable saying of <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
where he brings <hi>Cerialis</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General
thus bespeaking his revolted Souldiers, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo
sterilitatem, nimios imbres &amp; caetera na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae
mala, sic luxum vel avaritiam dominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
tolerate: vitia erunt donec homines, sed
neque haec continua, &amp; meliorum interventu
pensantur; i. e.</hi> you must bear the Luxury
and Covetousness of your Rulers as ye
do Barrenness and unseasonable Showers;
there will be faults as long as there are Men,
but bad Men are not always, and we are
generally compensated for them with a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of good. But had God left us at
liberty to resist when we are opprest, the
consequence of this must have been an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
state of War, in which instead of
suffering the oppressions of one Tyrant, we
should every one turn Tyrant to every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore 'tis apparently for our
good that he hath tied up our hands. And
thus with all possible brevity I have explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Particulars included in this Duty
of Subjection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106255:9"/>
I now proceed to the third and last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in this Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> the Object of
it, <hi>viz. the higher Powers;</hi> by which it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
we are to understand the Persons of
sovereign Princes and Governours, and not
the Laws and Constitutions, as some of our
Republican Doctours pretend, for this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
was writ either under <hi>Claudius</hi> or <hi>Nero,</hi>
whose Wills were the onely Laws they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by, and yet these were the <hi>higher
Powers</hi> to whom the Apostle requires our
Subjection; and those whom he here calls
<hi>the higher Powers</hi> in the third Verse he calls
<hi>the Rulers,</hi> and in the fourth Verse he tells
us that this higher Power is <hi>the Minister of
God, and a Revenger to execute wrath upon
him that doeth evil,</hi> which must necessarily
be meant of the Governours, and not of
the Laws; and accordingly St. <hi>Peter</hi> thus
explains it, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. Be subject to every
ordinance of Man for the Lord's sake, whether
it be to the King, </hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as supreme,</hi>
which is the very word that is here u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for <hi>the higher Powers,</hi> so that by the
higher Powers here must be meant the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Persons that are vested with the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and sovereign Power; for that in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106255:9"/>
every Nation there should be a sovereign
Power is as indispensably necessary as that
there should be a Government; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there is any Government there must
be a last Appeal, otherwise no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or controversie can ever be finally
decided; and whereever the last Appeal is,
whether it be to a King, a Senate, or the
majority of the People, there must be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and sovereign Power from which
there can be no farther appeal, and against
which there can be no opposition or resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence;
for to talk of a supreme Power
which is not unaccountable and irresistible
is nonsense, for whatsoever Power is liable
to be called to account or resisted, hath a
Power that is superiour to it, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be supreme: and accordingly the Apostle
declares in the Verse ensuing my Text, that
<hi>whosoever resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God,</hi> and that <hi>they that resist shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to themselves damnation.</hi> Now the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
power to which we of this Nation owe
subjection is the King, whom our Laws
do declare and recognize to be our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and sovereign Lord, for so, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
the Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> declares,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106255:10"/>
that <hi>the Crown of</hi> England <hi>is in no earthly
Subjection, but immediately subject to God in
all things touching the Regality of the same,</hi>
and 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 21. makes this Recognition to his
Majesty, <hi>That his Grace's Realm hath no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
under God but onely his Grace, and that
next unto God they owe him a natural and
humble obedience;</hi> and in other Laws it is
declared to be high Treason to levy Arms
against the King either within or without
the Realm, and that it is unlawfull for both
or either Houses of Parliament to raise or
levy War offensive or defensive against his
Majesty or his Heirs and lawfull Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
and that it is not lawfull upon any
pretence whatsoever to take Arms against
the King, and that we are to abhor that
traiterous Position of taking Arms by his
Authority against his Person, or against
those who are commissioned by him; by
all which it is abundantly evident who
this higher Power is among us, to whom
we are to render our Subjection.</p>
            <p>Having thus explained the Terms of the
Duty, I proceed in the next place to the
Reason of it, <hi>for the Powers that are, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106255:10"/>
All Sovereign Princes do derive their
power and authority from God, whose Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
providence doth more peculiarly
concern it self in the disposal of Crowns
and Sceptres, and doth influence all second
causes to conspire in the advancement of
such persons to Empire, as he himself has
first chosen and approved, for there is no
person can have right to govern in God's
Kingdom under him, unless it be by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and authority from him; and indeed
to derive the authority of Sovereign Princes
from any other head but God, is in effect
to deny him to be the supreme Governour
of the World, which those persons would
do well to consider who make the people
the Fountain of regal authority; for as on
the one hand, if it be by God's Authority
that Kings Reign, it is God that governs by
them, and not the people, so on the other,
if it be by the peoples authority, it is the
people that govern by them and not God,
if it be the choice of the people that makes
their Prince without any Commission or
Authority from God, then it is certain that
Princes are the peoples Vicegerents and not
God's, but now in all governments the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106255:11"/>
is the Fountain of all inferiour au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
and if there be any authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its Jurisdiction that is not from it, and
dependent upon it, it must be coordinate
with it, and then it cannot be supreme,
how then can God be supreme Governour
of the World, when there are other coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Authorities with him that are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from him, and that owe not their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him? The Peoples choice therefore
even in Elective Governments, can signifie
no more than the bare presenting of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to God, to be authorized his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
by him, who if their choice be just
and lawfull, is supposed to direct them to
it by his providence, and consequently to
consent to and approve it, and thereby to
authorize the person so presented, for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
authority in the abstract is ordained
and instituted by God, but abstracted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
cannot govern without a person
vested with it, and to vest him with it, he
must not be onely applied to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but the Authority must be applied to
him; but now where the people have a
right to Election, they can onely apply the
person to the Authority, but 'tis God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106255:11"/>
and approbation which applies the
Authority to the person, who thereupon
commences supreme under God, and
hath no superiour Tribunal but God's to
account to, and thus according to the
Prophet <hi>Daniel, the most high rules in the
Kingdoms of men,</hi> because as Lord of all
the Lords, and King of all the Kings of
the Earth, he rules by their Ministry,
and they rule by his Authority; and hence
in Scripture they are said to be <hi>the Ministers
of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 6. <hi>The Christs or anointed
of the Lord,</hi> Isa. 45. 1. <hi>And are styled Gods,
and the Children of the most high, Psal.</hi> 82. 6.
And hence also they are said to act in God's
stead, <hi>and to judge not for men but for God,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6. And their Kingdoms are
said to be given them by God, and they
to be advanc'd to their Thrones by God,
2 <hi>Dan.</hi> 21. 37.</p>
            <p>Since therefore all supreme Powers are
ordained and commissioned and authorized
by God, it hence necessarily follows, that
to refuse subjection to them is no less than
open Rebellion against God himself; for
Kings in their several Provinces, are the
Viceroys of the Almighty Sovereign of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106255:12"/>
World, and therefore as he who denies sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the King's Viceroy affronts the
Authority of the King, so they who deny
subjection to the King, brave and affront
the Authority of the King of Kings; for
since it is by God's Authority, that the King
rules, 'tis God's Authority that they refuse
to be ruled by, for whatsoever the personal
qualifications of Princes are, we ought to
consider that the Character they bear is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
as being a ray and representation of
the great Majesty above; and therefore 'tis
not so much to them that we are obliged to
bow down as to the Divine Image which
they bear about them, so that like Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours
they derive not their honour from
themselves, but from the Sovereign Majesty
which they represent and personate, and
the veneration we render them like that
which <hi>Moses</hi> paid to the burning Bush, is
not so properly rendred to them, as to the
Divinity in them; whether therefore they
are good or bad we are obliged to respect
them as the supreme Vicegerents of God in
the World, and to consider their Persons as
consecrated with the Divine Majesty which
Robes and invests them, and herein consists
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106255:12"/>
the force of the Apostle's reason, <hi>for the
Powers that are, are ordained of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having given you an account
of the duty in the Text, <hi>Let every Soul be
subject to the higher Powers.</hi> I shall crave
leave briefly to inforce it, by some other
motives and considerations, besides that
which the Apostle here urges, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>the Powers that are, are ordained of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Consider, that upon our dutifull
Subjection to our Prince, depends our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Happiness and welfare; for as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
government there can be no Society, so
without obedience there can be no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and so long as men are indisposed
to obey, the Government must be a burthen
to them, and they to the Government; and
whilst the Rulers and Subjects instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supports are oppressions to one another,
they are in the ready way to dissolve and
fly in pieces, and what can the consequence
of this be, but an over-flowing deluge of
Miseries and Confusions, of the truth of
which, we of this Nation have not many
years agoe made a wofull experiment; for
when through our restless impatience of
Subjection, we had pull'd down our lawfull
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106255:13"/>
Sovereign from his Throne, and unhing'd
the ancient frame of our Government, what
was the issue of it but Oppression and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and endless Confusion? for when
once we had unfixt our selves from our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Centre, how did we roul through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
form of Government, still addressing to
each for relief and ease? and when we had
moved every Stone, and raised it to the
top of the Hill, it still came tumbling down
again upon us; so that ours, like <hi>Sisyphus</hi>
his labour was like to have no other end,
but various, restless, and endless Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
till at last, God took pity on us, and
resetled us on our ancient Foundations; so
that had it not been for this late shameless
and barefac'd Rebellion, by which if God
had not been more mercifull to us, we had
hurl'd back our selves again into our old
confusions, I could never have imagined
we could have been so abandon'd of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as in the same age to act over the same
Tragedy again; but if as a just punishment
of our Sins, God should permit us to be so
far infatuated, as to sell our liberties again,
for fear of being inslaved, to fight against
the principles of our Religion in the defence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106255:13"/>
of it, to rip up the Bowels of our native
Countrey to preserve it, and in a word, to
go to cross or pile with a company of beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Male-contents for our own Estates and
Fortunes, and run our selves into present
and certain mischiefs, to prevent future and
contingent ones; if these things, I say, should
happen again, which God forbid, a very
small Prophet may easily foretell the wofull
consequence of it; and when we shall see
our Fields strewed over again with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses
of our Friends and Relations, our
Cities, Towns and Countries laid waste by
an unnatural War, and shall come to cast
up our accounts, and to reckon all the
Bloud and Treasure we have spent, onely
to purchase Confusion or Slavery, then we
shall remember perhaps with tears in our
Eyes, that it was nothing but a surfeit of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
that caused our misery. But, beloved,
I hope better things of you, and of the
wisedom and dear-bought Experience of the
Age; if therefore we would be secured
from these publick Calamities, let us render
to our Prince all dutifull subjection, the least
defect of which is an apparent advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Ruine and Confusion.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106255:14"/>
            <p>Secondly, Consider that upon our duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
subjection to our Prince, the honour
of our Religion depends, for men do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
esteem and value things according to
the present good or hurt which they doe in
the World; and even Religion it self, though
it be the most sacred thing among men, is
usually valued by the present advantages
which accrew from it, and how beneficial
soever it may be as to the other Life, if it
should be found hurtfull and mischievous
in this, it will be impossible to secure it from
the hatred and contempt of mankind. Now
there is nothing in which men are at present
more generally concerned, than in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and security of the Government under
which they live, the weal of which is like
a publick Bank, in which every Subject
hath his stock and share; so that if once it
should appear that our Religion is mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to Government, mankind would soon
conspire to proclaim War with it, and to
decry and explode it as a publick nusance
to the World. Now the generality of men
do judge of Religion by the actions of those
that make the loudest Pretences to it, and
if once it appear that they are factious and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106255:14"/>
ungovernable, those who understand no
better, will certainly conclude that it is their
Religion that teaches them to be so, and
being possessed with this opinion of it,
it is no wonder if they fall foul on it, and
decry it for a common make-bate and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-cole:
for that which strikes at Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
strikes at mankind. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we represent our Religion as doing so,
by making it a pretence for Faction and
Disobedience, we doe what in us lies to
alarm the World against it, and to expose
it as a common Enemy, to the publick Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
of mankind; and I verily believe should
men consult the Devil himself, what course
they were best take to blast the honour of
Religion, he could not direct them to a
more effectual one than under sanctified
pretences to turn Rebels to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and accordingly heretofore the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
of Christianity could find no such
effectual calumny to blast and expose it as
this, that it was an Enemy to the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as wisely enough considering,
that could they but infuse into mankind
a belief of this scandal, there was nothing
could be more conducive to antidote mens
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106255:15"/>
minds against it, and to render it base and
infamous in the opinion of the World;
whilst therefore we conduct any seditious
design under the holy banners of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
we join hands with its open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
adversaries, and indeavour so far as in
us lies, to defend their most malitious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
against it; and our factious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
glossed with pretences of Christian
zeal, is a much stronger proof of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Calumny, than all the arguments of
<hi>Celsus,</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> and <hi>Hierocles</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because the confession of a seeming
Friend, is of much more credit than the
accusation of an open Enemy; whilst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we make our Religion a colour for our
Faction and Disloyalty, we confess it to be
guilty of the most infamous thing that it
was ever charged with, by the worst of its
enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> that it lays trains of factious
Principles in mens Hearts and Consciences,
on purpose to blow up, Thrones and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
and throw the World into Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins
and Confusions; whereas on the
contrary by our firm and unshaken Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to our Governours, we give an ocular
demonstration to the World, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106255:15"/>
is good for the best purposes, that
it is not onely beneficial in order to our
future happiness, which being distant and
invisible is not so apt to affect Men, but
that it is the most effectual instrument
even of our present safety and welfare, as
it is the great prop of Thrones and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
supporter of Government, upon which
the welfare of Mankind depends; and if
we can but once convince Men, as we
might easily do by our steady Loyalty, that
our Religion is the best security of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
without which the World of
Men is a mere Wilderness of Wolves and
Tygers, we shall in this doe it greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and give it a more glorious reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the World than by our most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
and specious pretences to Sanctity
without it; for whatever Men may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
it is demonstrable that factious God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is a greater reproach and scandal to
Religion than open profaneness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, consider that upon our faithfull
Subjection to our Prince the safety of our
Religion depends; for there is nothing in
the World can more indanger our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106255:16"/>
than our making it a pretence for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
for hereby we inevitably expose
it to the hatred of Princes, and doe what in
us lies to arm their power against it, for
by our actions we do in effect make this
open Declaration to them: <hi>Sirs, To tell you
plainly, ye may thank our Religion for our
Disobedience, we would be Loyal but it will
not suffer us, and therefore ye were best have
a care of it, for if ye do not suppress it it will
undermine your Thrones, and one time or other
arm the hands of your People against your
Persons and Dignities:</hi> When therefore we
set up our Religion against our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
we force them in their own defence
to set themselves against it, and to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
so far as in them lies to root it out of
the World, and if being provoked by our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
they should ever draw their Swords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, it may thank us for it, who first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the Quarrel and gave the Challenge, and
did in effect declare by out Actions, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they forced us to lay down our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
our Religion would force them to lay
down their Crowns, yea and though we
should succeed in our Rebellion and prove
too hard for our Governours, yet first or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106255:16"/>
last our Religion will be sure to smart for
it; for when we have pulled down them
we must set up some others in their room,
and whosoever they are, though they may
love the Treason by which themselves were
advanced, to be sure they will hate the
traiterous Religion, and never think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
safe in their Usurpation whilst those
Principles prevail in the Consciences of the
People upon which they rebell'd against
their former Governours; for let Men be
never so zealous for seditious Principles
whilst they are Rebels, you may depend
upon it they will be as zealous against
them when they are Usurpers, and be as
much concern'd to suppress and extirpate
them as ever they were before to uphold
and propagate them; of the truth of which
ye have a notorious instance in the late U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper,
who though while he was a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
was a zealous stickler for those Religious
pretences under which that barbarous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
was conducted, yet was no sooner
seated in the Throne but he grew quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weary
of them, and could he but have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
our sequestred Clergy from their
natural Prince, which he sundry times at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106255:17"/>
would willingly have pulled down
those Seditious Sects that raised him, and
re-established the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of
whose inflexible Loyalty to Government
he had had sufficient experience.</p>
            <p>Our Loyalty therefore is not onely the
honestest but the wisest provision we can
make for the safety of our Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hereby we recommend it to Princes
as the safest guard of their Thrones, and
the surest defence of their Authority, as
that which will secure and facilitate their
Government, and tie their Subjects to them
by their Hearts and Consciences, and when
by good experience they are convinced of
this, they cannot be enemies to it without
being enemies to themselves, and arming
their Power against their own authority.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, Consider that if we
of this Nation had no other motive, yet in
mere gratitude we stand obliged to render
faithfull Subjection to our Princes, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
with what an easie and indulgent
Government, and with what a succession
of excellent Princes God Almighty hath
blessed us, I know no Nation under the
Cope of Heaven that may be so happy as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106255:17"/>
our selves if we please; for as our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in the frame and constitution of it
a most easie Yoke and gentle Burthen, so
for sundry Ages we have had Princes as
gentle and gratious as our Government;
Princes that have studied our ease and our
happiness, and that have in nothing so
much exceeded as in their Mercy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
towards us; for, not to mention
that glorious Lady Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that
wise and learned, that peaceable and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Prince King <hi>Iames</hi> I. of the Blessings of
whose Reigns but few if any of us were
partakers, not to mention that pious and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way incomparable Prince <hi>Charles</hi> I.
whose sacred Bloud is such a monumental
shame to Treason and Rebellion, as must
make Rebels and Traitours, if they have
any modesty remaining in them blush and
be confounded for ever; besides these, it is
not long since that God almighty hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
us of one of the wisest, most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and mercifull Kings that ever swayed a
Sceptre, a King that had been long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to us not onely by the gentleness of
his Reign, the prudence of his conduct,
and the incomparable sweetness of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106255:18"/>
but also by sundry miraculous Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
and as miraculous a Restoration, a
Restoration that proclaimed and signalized
him the Darling and Favorite of the divine
Providence, a Prince that reigned in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Hearts by the inconquerable Charms
of his own native goodness, which had
virtue enough in them, had the thing been
possible, to have obliged Ingratitude, and
even to have made Faction ashamed, and
Fanaticism Loyal. And now to him in
despite of all the Hellish machinations of a
restless Faction, our present rightfull Lord
peaceably succeeds, a Prince whom God
seems to have reserved on purpose to make
us amends for the inestimable loss we su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
in <hi>Charles</hi> the Wise and Good; and
indeed considering the great and Princely
Vertues which adorn his Mind, and shine
through the whole Sphere of his activity,
we have all the encouragement in the world
to promise our selves a continuance of those
Halcion days under his happy influence, if
by our own intestine Seditions we do not
cloud and disturb them that we have so
long enjoy'd under the auspicious Reign of
his Brother; for if from an undaunted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106255:18"/>
courage and firmness of Mind, if from an
immense greatness and generosity of Soul,
if from an inflexible sincerity and integrity
of Manners, if from an impartial Justice,
sweetened with an indearing benignity of
Temper, if from the fair conjunction of all
these Royal Vertues in a Prince, a People
may presage their own happiness, we have
all these to build our hope on in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Sovereign, who to give an absolute
confidence to our hope, hath gratiously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited
in our hands that sacred pledge of
his own Royal Faith by a publick repeated
Declaration inviolably to preserve our Laws,
and Liberties, and Properties, and which
ought to be dearest to us than all, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
Religion of our Church, which for
purity of Worship and Doctrine, for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of Discipline and Government, for
loyalty of Principles and Practice, outshines
all the Churches in the World; and for us
to mistrust the security of that Faith which
yet was never forfeited to any Man, would
be not onely rude and disingenuous, but
unjust and malitious; so that considering
the admirable frame of our Government,
and the unparallel'd goodness of our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106255:19"/>
we are certainly the most obliged Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the World. And if after this we
should prove factious and disloyal, what will
the World say of us, but that we are a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of a base and ungratefull Genius, whom
no goodness can indear or oblige? and
what may we expect from God, but that,
as a just retribution for our black ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he should make us feel the smart of
all those barbarous Tyrannies and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which hitherto we have unjustly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of? Wherefore, unless we intend
to render our selves both infamous to Men,
and odious to God, let us chearfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with this great Precept of our Religion,
<hi>Let every Soul</hi> of us <hi>be subject to the higher
Powers,</hi> forasmuch as <hi>the Powers that are, are
ordained of God.</hi>
