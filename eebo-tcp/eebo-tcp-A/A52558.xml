            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Children and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators of <hi>Francis Noy</hi> in the other Bill are Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs.</head>
            <p>THat <hi>Phillip Noy</hi> the ſaid <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>William Noys</hi> late Father deceaſed, being poſſeſt of a Term for 99. years abſolute of Lands in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> worth about 200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> made <hi>Honour</hi> his Relict, and the ſaid <hi>Francis</hi> his Son Excutors.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>June 1671. Francis Noy</hi> dyed, and <hi>Honour</hi> as ſurviving Executor entred and quietly enjoyed the Lands untill her Death, which was in <hi>April</hi> 1675. having firſt made the Plaintiff <hi>William Noy</hi> her Executor, who entred and enjoyed quietly, until Sir <hi>Peter Courtny</hi> brought his Ejectment and obtained Judgment by default, and got poſſeſſion whilſt the Plantiff <hi>William Noy</hi> (being an Officer at <hi>Portsmouth)</hi> was attending his Majeſties ſervice there, above 200 Miles diſtant and knew nothing of it; Whereupon the Plantiff <hi>William Noy</hi> exhibited his Bill in Chancery to diſcover the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants Title, and to be relieved therein.</p>
            <p>The Defendants by Anſwer ſay, that Sir <hi>Peter Courtny Auguſt,</hi> 4. 1649. and one <hi>Holmes</hi> as ſureties only became bound with <hi>Humphry Noy</hi> Eſq; (Attorny General <hi>Noy's</hi> Son) to <hi>Edward Parker</hi> Eſq; in a Bond of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for payment of 500 <hi>l.</hi> and Intereſt, and confeſs he had alſo a Mortgage from <hi>Humphry Noy</hi> for further ſecurity thereof; and ſay.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Francis Noy</hi> one of the ſaid Executors by Deed, dated the 28th of <hi>November</hi> 1651. in conſideration of 50 <hi>l.</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to be paid, aſſigned the whole Term of 99. years to Sir <hi>Peter Courtny;</hi> And believe this Aſſignment was made for the conſideration of 50 <hi>l.</hi> and alſo to Counter-ſecure Sir <hi>Peter</hi> againſt his bond to <hi>Parker</hi> (although in truth no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is mentioned in the Deed, as concerning its being a Counter-ſecurity) and that <hi>Parker</hi> ſued Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> and got Judgment againſt him on the Bond in 1655. And that the Defendant Dame <hi>Amy,</hi> as Sir <hi>Peters</hi> Executor hath been ſince forc't to pay 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for principal and Intereſt, beſides coſts of Suit to <hi>Parker</hi> upon this Bond.</p>
            <p>That the Plaintiff, <hi>William Noyes</hi> Cauſe coming to be heard before the late Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman</hi> in 1672. and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants Council finding his Lordſhip to declare the ſaid Aſſignment could be taken at moſt to be but a ſecurity for the 50 <hi>l.</hi> inſiſted that the Adminiſtrator of <hi>Francis Noy</hi> who aliened the Term ought to be a party to the Suit, before it could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly be determined; Thereupon the Court ſuſpended giving Judgement untill <hi>Francis Noyes</hi> Adminiſtrator was made a party and brought to hearing.</p>
            <p>That the Plaintiffs the Children of <hi>Francis Noy</hi> thereupon took Adminiſtration to their Father, and were made Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and Anſwered <hi>William Noyes</hi> Bill, and exhibited their Original Bill againſt the Defendant <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff <hi>William Noy</hi> to be releived in caſe the right to the Eſtate be adjudged to belong to them.</p>
            <p>That both theſe Cauſes coming to be heard before the now Lord Chancellor, his Lordſhip was pleaſed to diſmiſs, the Plaintiff <hi>William Noyes</hi> Bill with coſts, which are taxed at 100 <hi>l.</hi> And as to the Plaintiffs the Childrens Bill directed an Accompt, and that unleſs they ſhould pay all the mony paid to <hi>Parker</hi> with Intereſt and coſts of Suit in Law, and in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, at ſuch time as the Maſter ſhould appoint, their Bill alſo to ſtand diſmiſſed.</p>
            <p>And the Maſter hath by his Report allowed 934 <hi>l.</hi> for Intereſt of the ſaid 500 <hi>l.</hi> which is Intereſt upon Intereſt, and 527 <hi>l.</hi> for coſts of ſuit, in all 1922 <hi>l-3 s-7 d.</hi> to be paid by the poor Plaintiffs the Children, in Six Months then next which they not being able to do, and the time being elapſed the ſaid Judgments, and diſmiſſions in both Cauſes are ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inrolled, and the Plaintiffs, the Children have nothing left but the Kindneſſe and Charity of their friends to live upon.</p>
            <p>By Order on Hearing, which is inrolled by the Defendants, they are only to have the money paid to <hi>Parker</hi> with Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Coſts, but not the 50 <hi>l.</hi> mentioned in the Conſideration of the Deeds, this not being proved to be paid, ſo they have thereby admitted that point to be adjudged againſt them, and there is no proof that the Aſſignment to <hi>Courtny</hi> was made to counter-ſecure him againſt the debt to <hi>Parker,</hi> nor any mention of any ſuch thing in the Deed: And it appeared the Aſſignment was not made till two years after Sir <hi>Peter</hi> became bound to <hi>Parker,</hi> nor any conſideration or reaſon why <hi>Francis Noy</hi> ſhould Counter ſecure Sir <hi>Peter Courtny</hi> againſt a debt that <hi>Francis Noy</hi> was no ways concerned in: But it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Defendants Anſwer, that <hi>Humphry Noy</hi> gave a Mortgage (beſides the bond) to <hi>Parker</hi> for the 500 <hi>l.</hi> and that this Mortgage is alſo aſſigned to the Defendants, who are in the Poſſeſſion, and receive the profits thereof; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Sir <hi>Peter Courtny</hi> had half the ſaid Money borrowed of <hi>Parker,</hi> and that he and the ſaid <hi>Humphry Noy</hi> had invited <hi>Francis Noy</hi> to one of <hi>Humphry Noys</hi> Tenants houſes, and there kept him up 2 days and 2 nights drinking, and then when he was diſguiſed with drink, got him to make this Aſſignment without any conſideration moving thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That the ſaid Defendants examined one <hi>Paſcho</hi> to prove the ſaid Aſſignment to be for Sir <hi>Peters</hi> Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecurity, but he being proved by many Witneſſes to be a man of infamous reputation, and guilty of ſeveral felonies, and to be then a Souldier in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Silly,</hi> at the time of Sealing the ſaid Deeds, and is no witneſſe thereto, though he ſwears himſelf preſent at ſealing thereof; they the Defendants were aſhamed to reade his Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> 2. The Caſe as between the ſeveral Plaintiffs is only, whether the Plaintiff <hi>William Noy</hi> as Executor of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Executor, or the other Plaintiffs the Children as Adminiſtrator of the Executor that aliened the ſaid Term (as the Caſe is) be intitled in Equity to have the premiſes in queſtion.</p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly hoped, and prayed, that the Diſmiſſion of the Plaintiffs Bill be ſet aſide, and that a Decree be made againſt the Defendant to re-convey the Premiſes ſo aſſigned by <hi>Francis Noy</hi> as above-mentioned to ſuch of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs, as ſhall appear to have moſt right to the ſame, and that the Defendants deliver up the Deeds, Evidences, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings touching the premiſes and account for the profits thereof.</p>
