         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had brought this small por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my intended labour to that unpolished perfection which now it is, and loth to let it go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without a <hi>Mecoenas</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it, I could not on the sudden resolve, either whom, or where to make my choice. For it is a tenet which may be easily granted, that men of retired lives, and small-grown fortunes, are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome known to many; it being with them as with those in the dark, who see and observe the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to and fro of others in the light, but are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen themselves: which condition, sith it doth little lesse then jump with mine, and reflect with
<pb facs="tcp:18622:3"/>
an opposite rade upon me, I could not, I confesse, at the first be setled, untill my second thoughts recalled the happie memorie of your gracious name: unto whom I could not but commit the patronage of this unworthy work; both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that I was then a student in that house, where and when your welcome presence made it glad; as also (if it be not presumption so to say) in that I was directed by one and the self-same tutour with your gracious self. But above all, my especiall motive hereunto, was the never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought of your kinde good will to students, and encouragement of those whose wishes are well devoted to the Muses. Now then, if it may please your Grace to make this book yours, by protecting it from the detracting crew of <hi>Zoilus</hi> his companie, I shall think my self alwayes too poore to expresse my thankfulnesse. Let it be as the grapes of Babel, who (as the Jews have it in a certain Apologue) sent upon a time to the vine-leaves of Judea, desiring to be oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by them; for otherwise they should be consumed by the heat of the sunne, and never suffered to grow up to maturitie. The wings of your favour may be as those leaves to shelter my green and scarce grown grapes; so shall I hope to see them thrive: not as the camomill, by being troden on; nor as the palm, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suppressed: for they be like to such a plant which needeth props, and is cherished by the
<pb facs="tcp:18622:3"/>
pearled distillations of crystall dew. And as for your gracious self, my wishes are, that your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and dignities may increase with your houres; and let eternall glorie be attendant on your vertues, to crown them with eternitie: so shall you live, not onely with saints above, but with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Howbeit he were no man that could not erre, no more then they whose rancor'd mouthes shall bite with scorn, or vent the poison of a loath'd disdain. In a word, if thou expectest quaint language, or fragrant flowers of flowing Rhetorick, I am somewhat sorie my sad fate should prove so cruell as not to give way for satisfaction. Beleeve it, I could have wished a better stile, and not been sorie to have soar'd aloft: and yet again I must confesse, that as eloquence was never any part of my essence, so neither was my aim so much at that, as to produce apt matter fitting the serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the subject I took in hand. And verily if in this my hopes fail me not, I do not fear but my pains will be accepted: for although I go not about to teach the learned (because <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles arbusta juvant</hi>) yet the ignorant may be instructed in what before they knew not; yea, and the learned also may be occasioned to call again to minde something which (for the present) hath either slept, or slipt their memories by reason of their better thoughts, and deeper contemplations. Be not therefore unjust judges in an harmlesse cause, nor forward censurers, churlishly to blast young springing blossomes in their tender bud: but rather take in good part this from him, who resteth, as his own, so also</p>

For that the world had both a beginning, and must also have an ending, even reason it self, although there were no Scripture for it, is sufficient.</p>
                  <p>As first, if the world were eternall, then there would be some memorie given us of the generations of men more ancient then that which Moses mentioneth: but there is none given us; for all other histories are but late in respect of the sacred storie: which is an evident argument, not onely against the eternitie of the world, but also against the fables of the Egyptians, Scythians, and Grecians, concerning their ancientnesse, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientnesse of their acts and deeds of fame.</p>
                  <p>For indeed (omitting their palpable fictions) when Ethnick writers tell us of any ancient thing, it is either concerning the Thebane or Trojane warre; of <hi>Cecrops,</hi> of <hi>Inachus,</hi> of <hi>Ogyges, Deucalion,</hi> or <hi>Ianus;</hi> of <hi>Ninus,</hi> or his father <hi>Belus,</hi> or of the warre of the giants, striving to heap mountain upon mountain that they might pull the gods out of heaven.

For to whom did they allude by their <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> with two faces, but to <hi>Noah,</hi> who saw the times both before and after the floud? Or whom did they point at by their <hi>Gigantomachia,</hi> when <hi>Pelion</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) must be set upon <hi>Ossa's</hi> back, and all thrown down with a thunder-crack; whom (I say) did they

                  <p>Secondly, thus it may be also proved; All things which are to us conspicuous, consisting of matter and form, are of themselves frail and fading, having such a nature, that they either are or may be subject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; but such is the world: and therefore as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of its essence it is finite; so likewise in respect of time it cannot be infinite, but have both a beginning and an ending. For first that is properly eternall, which is altogether incommunicable, or which is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, mutation, succession, and end: and such onely is God, and not the world. Secondly, it cannot be denied but that there is the same reason of the whole which is of the parts; so that if the parts of the world be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to corruption, then must likewise the whole world also: but the parts are (as we daily see) and therefore the whole.</p>
                  <p>But leaving reason, we have a rule beyond it, which is the rule of faith; whose first assertion makes it plain

                  <p>BUt concerning the worlds ending, here fitly may<note place="margin">The manner of the worlds end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is shewed.</note> arise this question, viz.

                     <item>2. If it be destroyed according to the qualities, then it shall onely be purged, the substance still abiding.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Now of both these opinions there can be but one truth; which I verily think to be in the latter of them. For although it be said in S. Peter, that <note n="*" place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the heavens shall passe away with a noise, &amp; the elements shall melt away with heat, &amp;c.</hi> Yet it is not so farre forth to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as that in their substances they shall be quite burnt up; but rather that they shall be purified in their vicious qualities, which the vanitie of sinne hath laid upon the model of the whole world. And this S. Paul points at when he saith, that <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>the creature it self shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of God. For we know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the whole creation groneth and travaileth in pain together untill now.</hi> And again in the hundred and second Psalme, where the Prophet saith that <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 102. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>the heavens and the earth shall perish, and wax old;</hi> he sheweth that their perishing shall onely be a changing: <hi>For as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatsoever therefore is spoken of their consuming, passing away, and perishing, is meant onely in respect of their corruptible qualities, the substance still abiding: and so shall the fire at the last day serve for a purging, not for an utter consuming. There shall indeed be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unchanged, because all things shall be renewed, and each thing brought into a perfect state, Acts 3. 21. <hi>A new heaven and a new earth,</hi> 2.

                     <hi>into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of God.</hi> It shall not be delivered onely in the libertie of the sonnes of God; that is, when they are delivered: but it shall be delivered <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, into their libertie; as it is Rom. 8. 21. If it were onely in their libertie, or when they are delivered; then in stead of a changing, there might be a consuming: which is in some sort a deliverie; because (although quite taken away) there is then no longer a subjection unto vanitie: but seeing it is into the libertie of the sonnes of God, it shall (like mans glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) put on incorruption; and so, <hi>suo modo,</hi> in its kinde, be partaker of an incorruptible state.</p>
                  <p>But in this changing, I think we may fitly exempt all<note place="margin">The creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at the worlds ending.</note> such creatures which now serve onely for the necessitie of mans life; as those which be for food, clothing, and the like: because then (at the end of the world I mean) there shall be an end likewise of all such needs.</p>
                  <p>Yet there are those who comprehend the brute beasts also, and other creatures having sense and life, within the limits of this libertie: but they do somewhat qualifie their meanings; as thus: They shall not be partakers of the glorie of the sonnes of God; yet in their kinde they shall be fellows with them in that glorious state, like as once they were in Paradise, before man had fallen. But whether I may embrace this opinion, I know not; and<note place="margin">See also Dr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets Hexap. on Rom. chap. 8. quaest. 34.</note> that in regard of the foresaid reason: unto which others also assent, <note n="a" place="margin">Pot.

For <hi>the moon shall shine as the sunne, and the light of the sunne shall be sevenfold,</hi> as saith the Prophet Esay, chap. 30. 26. which S.

Yea and <note n="*" place="margin">Zach. 14. 7.</note> Zachary also witnesseth that there shall be but one perpetuall day: for there shall be so great light that there shall be no difference between day and night; as some observe from thence.

Much more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may we think, when Christ shall sit in glorious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie upon his throne, and the just, who are the sonnes of God, shall be admitted to their paternall heritage and kingdome, that then God Almighty shall cause that all his creatures be decked with an extraordinary bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, beautie, and lustre. For although it be <note n="*" place="margin">Esay 60. 19. Revel. 21. 23.</note> said that the moon and the sunne shall shine no more, but rather that the Lord himself will be for an eternall light; yet it meaneth not that those starres should perish, but that the uncreated light shall be <note n="c" place="margin">Part. in Apoc. cap. 21.</note> more glorious. So that as now the greater light obscures the lesse; in like manner it shall be then when we come into that citie which want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the sunne or moon. It is not said, <hi>Solem &amp; lunam non habebit; sed, Non indigebit, ut luceant in ea;</hi> that the citie shall have no sunne and moon; but that it shall not want
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18622:12"/>
them to shine in it: silently declaring, that then indeed shall be those luminaries; yet they shall not then perform, as now, the same uses of light, being subject to motion, and an incessant wheeling up and down to cause a rising and setting, yea and to distinguish one time and day from another: For time is but as a space borrowed, and set apart from eternitie, which must at the last return to eternitie again. This for the heavens.</p>
                  <p>And as for the earth, our Saviour promiseth, amongst other blessings, a blessing to the meek, saying, that they<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 5.</note> shall inherit the earth: which promise of his (saith <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Willet, Hexap. in Rom.</note> one) we see is not performed in this world; and therefore to be then expected, when there is a new heaven and a new earth for the saints of God; and when the whole creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which now groneth) shall be delivered into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of God. Thus some.</p>
                  <p>But in this new heaven and earth we must not expect any terrene pleasures, as the carnall Jews do dream, as the Turks beleeve, or as that Heretick <hi>Cerinthus</hi> held, and after him the <hi>Millenaries</hi> or <hi>Chiliasts:</hi> because such pleasures are fading, and corruptible; joyes farre unfit for saints, whose very bodies have put on incorruption. We look therefore for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousnesse, as saith S. Peter, 2 Pet. 3. 13. and spirituall delight unto eternitie; as in Psal. 16. 12.</p>
                  <p>And further, seeing it is said that righteousnesse shall dwell in the new earth as well as in the new heaven, it may from thence be gathered, that both the heaven and the earth shall be the seat of the blessed; and that the saints shall <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 4. 14.</note> follow the Lambe whithersoever he goeth; and that there shall be an intercourse between the said heaven and earth: which is as Jacob in his <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 28. 12.</note> vision saw, when the angels were some of them ascending, some descending that ladder which reached from heaven to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18622:12"/>
earth: or as <note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 17. 3.</note> Moses and Elias were seen talking with Christ upon the Mount.</p>
                  <p>But herein let us not be too bold; for in this we may soon wade too farre: namely if we should nicely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how the saints shall then be disposed of; whether some alwayes to the heaven; some alwayes to the earth; or such like things which to us are unrevealed.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore suffice, that although the manner of this change be secret, and not known in every point, yet the change it self is most certain: and therefore hold we most certainly this truth for our stay, that the world shall end; and leave we the manner thereof to be exactly and particularly revealed by him, who will very quickly perform it.

                  <p>Now follows the time when.

I will leave that to them, who, out of a desire they have to lanch into the deep, have pried too farre (I fear) into the secrets of the Thunderer: for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we see that they do but wisely tell us foolish tales, and smoothly bring long lies unto an end, because they say more then they have warrant for: To whom <hi>Du Bartas</hi> by our famous <hi>Silvester</hi> thus sendeth greeting,</p>

                     <hi>snare</hi> upon the world, nor yet steal upon us as <hi>a thief in the night:</hi> But so it shall do. For <hi>of that day and houre knoweth no man,</hi> saith our Saviour: and we may take his word; because himself by his humanitie could not know it: although in his humanitie, by reason of his Godhead, he was not ignorant of it. Had he not therefore been God as well as man, and of a divine as well as humane nature, he must have remained ignorant in both with men and angels. Mar. 13. 32. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more concerning us, that we be not too bold, the same lesson which he taught his disciples is also ours, not <hi>to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power;</hi> as it is Act. 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>From whence we may learn, that whilest we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise our selves in things that be too high for us, we shall sooner betray our own curiositie, then deliver a truth. For, <hi>Maxima pars eorum quae scimus, est minima pars eorum quae nescimus;</hi> The greatest part of those things which we know, is the least part of what we know not.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon I cannot but think that the predictions of men in this kinde (especially seeing they are so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) must needs be as true as those amongst the brood of presumptuous Astrologers concerning the end of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, which (as <note n="a" place="margin">De verit. Christ. Relig.</note> 
                     <hi>Du Plessie</hi> observeth from them) should have been some hundreds of yeares before this time: nay, it should then have ended, when indeed it began most of all to flourish: And so I doubt not, but am certain, that the world also should have had many end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18622:13"/>
before this time, according to the doting froth of some mens idle fancies; which, if need were, I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. But as time was little beholding to them for cutting it off so short; in like manner they were as little behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to time for discovering their lies so plainly.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore (before I meddle further with such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved liars) leave them unto their best friends to gain (if they can) their credit for the time past, and addresse my self to examine those who talk of a time yet to come.</p>
                  <p>Amongst whom the Jews have a tradition, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they fetch from the school or house of Elias, yet we are not bound to credit it: For it was not Elias the Prophet, but a Rabbin of the same name, as the learned know; and who more fabulous, or more full of vain fancies, then those their greatest Doctours?</p>
                  <p>Six thousand yeares (saith he) the world shall stand, and then it shall be consumed by fire. Two thousand yeares shal be void or without Law; two thousand yeares shall be under the Law; and the last two thousand shall be the dayes of Messiah or Christ. Thus farre Elias. And that this opinion hath been favoured by <note n="†" place="margin">It was favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Ireneus, Lactantius, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, &amp;c. but disallowed by Ambrose and Augustine. See Augustine in exposit. Psal. 90.</note> some of old, and is also favoured now by some of our time, I am not ignorant: which chiefly they do for this reason; namely, because the six dayes of weekly labour do bear the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of 6000 yeares, wherein mankinde should endure the cares, and troubles, and travels of this world; and then shall come that Sabbath of Sabbaths in the heaven of heavens, when they are to rest from their labours. Or as God was six daies in creating the world before there was a Sabbath: so he shall be 6000 yeares in governing it; and then the seventh begins an eternall rest in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now this they ground upon the words of S. Peter; who, speaking of the day of judgement, noteth that a thousand yeares in Gods sight are but as one day, and one day as a thousand yeares, 2. Pet. 3. 8. So that in this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18622:14"/>
regard, for six dayes of weekly labour, they would have 6000 yeares of worldly trouble, and the like, before it endeth.</p>
                  <p>But if this weaknesse be the greatest strength for maintaining their assertion, then I do not doubt to see their cause fainting upon the ground, as not being able to subsist, or stand upright.</p>
                  <p>For first concerning the Rabbin, had he been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, he would certainly have been a better Seer. This I am sure of, that he was much deceived in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar division of his time, in making three periods, all of 2000 yeares apiece. For although the yeares of the world have been diversly accounted by sundry authours; yet you shall not finde the Rabbins just number of 2000 yeares, from the Creation to the Law; in any of them. <hi>Sealiger, Calvisius, Helvicus, Funccius, Bucholcerus,</hi> and others, who reckon the fewest yeares, do account 453 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two thousand; and yet they reckon not so many as they should by almost 60 yeares: some say altogether 60: as may be seen by <hi>Calvin, Iunius, Pareus, Ainsworth,</hi> or D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                     <hi>Willet</hi> on Genesis; besides many excellent Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers: especially S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                     <hi>W. Ralegh</hi> (that learned Knight) who in his historie of the world makes it plain.</p>
                  <p>And not onely doth this Elias fail in his first division, but in his second also: For from the Law to the death of Christ are not 2000 yeares; there be wanting well neare 500 to make them up. As for example, take a view again of <hi>Scaliger, Calvisius, Helvicus,</hi> or our countrey-man M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                     <hi>Thom. Lydiat,</hi> or <hi>Bucholcerus,</hi> or <hi>Petavius,</hi> or <hi>Funccius,</hi> and see if it be not even so. <hi>Bucholcerus</hi> (I think) want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fewest, and yet it is manifest that he falleth short of 2000. Whereupon it may be seen that in his first division (which is for the time before the Law) he overshoots; And in his second division (for the time under the Law) he is too short; imitating a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18622:14"/>
bad archer, who tries, but cannot hit the mark.</p>
                  <p>If then for the time past the Rabbin is found to be faulty, why should we be so mad as to give credit to him for the time which is yet to come? Questionlesse as he hath deceived us in the one, so likewise he will deceive us in the other; and therefore he is to beslighted and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing credited at all.

                  <p>But come we now to the examination of that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named place in Peter, which is brought as an help to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Jews opinion, because a day taken for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares, and applied to the weekly dayes, seemeth to point out six thousand yeares: so some imagine. But without doubt the Apostle meant no such thing; nor yet had in his minde to set down any strict manner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting times, peculiar to the court of heaven: For mark but the circumstances of the place, and view well the occasion given him to speak so as he did of the Lords coming to judgement, and then you shall soon finde, that it was to comfort the godly against the cavils and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the wicked; who, because the time seemed long to them, did thereupon mock at the promise of his coming, taking it as if he would not come at all. For, <hi>Where is</hi> (say they) <hi>the promise of his coming? since the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

great while since the world began, and yet what altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can we see in it? yesterday was as is this day: men are born and die as orderly as they ever did: nature keeps her course, and the like: Wherefore if the Judge had meant to come or shew himself at all, he would not sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that his coming should be thus long deferred, but would rather have shewed himself before thus many yeares could possibly be born. Thus, or after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, such mockers reasoned and cavilled with S. Peter: which cavill of theirs is agreeable to that of S.<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 12.</note> Paul, where he mentions such as did not beleeve the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but were like minded with these who mocked at the slacknesse of Christs coming to judgement.</p>
                  <p>Saint Peter therefore, that he might<note n="†" place="margin">It was but to shew (saith S. Augustine) <hi>contentnendam fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi tempo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </note> comfort the weak and confute the wicked, sheweth how to answer this their faithlesse objection; namely thus, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the time be long in respect of us, yet to God (with whom there is no time either long or short) it is not so. A day compared with an houre, to us may seem long: But a thousand yeares compared with a day, to God they seem but short; for what is time to eternitie? And therefore, although that day to the faithlesse seems so to be taken away, or deferred rather, as if it were not, or would not come because it quickly came not; yet know that it is not quite taken away. For (as the same Apostle speaketh at the 9 verse) <hi>God is not slack in his promises as some account slacknesse; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</hi> And this (questionlesse) was the Apostles meaning, farre differing from their fancies who from hence would fain gather that for one day God useth to account a thousand yeares, and a thousand yeares for one day. <hi>Hic sermo</hi> (saith<note n="d" place="margin">Marlor. in Pet.</note> one) <hi>est de aestimatione ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, qui non aequè aestimant tempus longum &amp; breve.</hi> This speech is according to the estimation of men,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18622:15"/>
who do not equally esteem of times long and short.</p>
                  <p>Which also doth yet further appeare by that in the 90 Psal. at the 4 vers. Where, as there is a comparison likewise between 1000 yeares and one day; so also, in respect of God, a thousand yeares are compared to that which is lesse then a day, namely to a watch in the night. For (saith the Prophet) <hi>God turneth man to destruction, and then he saith, Turn again ye children of men. For a thousand yeares in thy sight are but as yesterday, and they are gone as a watch in the night.</hi> To which purpose S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>

Whereas (saith he) if this sentence of the 6000 yeares were true, then the time might be known.</p>
                  <p>Let therefore they, who will, embrace this fancie of six thousand yeares for the whole time of the worlds continuance; I cannot: For sure I am, that the tradition of Elias hath greatly failed for the time that is past: if therefore it should be true for the time which is yet to come, it were more then an unheard of wonder: and as for the argument taken from S. Peter to uphold it, how his meaning hath been thereby forced, is declared.</p>
                  <p>Yet neverthelesse I will not deny but that the world<note place="margin">The world hath six Ages, but not reckoned by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of yeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>.</note> may stand six ages before it endeth; and so the ages, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not the yeares, may be compared to the six dayes of weekly labour: and that the seventh age shall begin at the resurrection, as was figured in Henoch the seventh from Adam, who died not as did the six before him, but was taken up into heaven. Unto this I assent as probable. But that each age should have a thousand yeares, is still
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18622:16"/>
denied; and as in setting them down according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture will be manifest.</p>
                  <p>The first is from the creation to the floud: and this by S. Peter is called the old world, 2. Pet. 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>The second is from the floud to Abraham. Matth. chap. 1.</p>
                  <p>The third, from Abraham to David. Matth. chap. 1.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, from David to the captivitie. Matth. chap. 1.</p>
                  <p>The fifth, from the captivitie to Christ. Matth. chap. 1.</p>
                  <p>The sixt is the time after Christ; called in many places the last age, and the last of times: as in Hebrews, chap. 1. 1. <hi>God</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>who at sundry times and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners spake unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last dayes spoken to us by his Sonne.</hi> And again, S. Peter calls this the last of times, 1. Pet. 1. 20. S. John also saith, <hi>Little children, it is the last time,</hi> 1. John 2. 18.</p>
                  <p>These I grant to be the six ages of the world: but who is so mad as to say or think that there were just thousands of yeares betwixt each or any of them? The Septuagints make more then thousands between some of them: and the Hebrews, they make lesse; excepting the first age. Yet if you will know their lengths accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which is none of the worst accounts, take them thus: and this account I may afterwards prove in another work.</p>
                  <p>The first hath 1656 yeares.</p>
                  <p>The second (if we end it at the beginning of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams peregrination and giving of the promise) hath the just number of 423 yeares.</p>
                  <p>The third (if we end it at the death of Saul and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Davids kingdome after him) containeth the number of 866 yeares.</p>
                  <p>The fourth (if we begin the captivitie in the first yeare of Nebuchadnezzar) hath 448 yeares.</p>
                  <p>The fifth containeth the length both of the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Persian, and Grecian Monarchies; together with so
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18622:16"/>
much of the Roman greatnesse as was past before Christ came into the world: amounting in all to the summe of 605 yeares, or there abouts; although we reckon no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the birth of Christ. But go rather to his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, and then this age is 634, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The sixth and last hath so many yeares as are from the time of mans redemption untill now: for hitherto this age hath continued, and shall not be ended untill the<note n="*" place="margin">1.

                  <p>But from hence I proceed; and on the sudden I have met some other sorts of calculatours. For so various are mens searching heads, that these things have not onely been boulstered out by Rabbinicall traditions, sabbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call symboles, and the like; but also by sundry other fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>Some have pretended revelations, and thereby delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many. Amongst whom learned<note n="e" place="margin">Ger. loc. com. Tom. 9. pag. 182.</note> Gerard makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a certain woman of Suevia in Germanie, who was called <hi>Thoda;</hi> &amp; she, in the yeare of Christ 848, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied<note place="margin">Impostours and false Prophets concerning the worlds ending.</note> that by the apparition of an Angel it was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto her, that the world should end that very yeare. After whom there were others as true prophets as her self: namely in the yeares 1062, 1258, 1345, 1526, 1530, &amp;c. He in the yeare 1526, ran up and down the streets, in the citie of S. <hi>Gallus</hi> in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> crying with horrid gestures, that the day of the Lord was come, that it was present. And he in the yeare 1530, did so strongly prevail with some, that he perswaded them the last yeare of the world was come; whereupon they grew<note n="f" place="margin">Ibid. ut antea.</note> prodigall of their goods and substance, fearing that they should scarcely spend them in so short a time as the world was to continue. But this surely was an Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisticall trick, and a chip of that block which maketh all things common; boasting of visions and dreams in an abundant manner.</p>
                  <p>Others have pitched upon certain Mathematicall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, and thereby constituted a time: amongst whom <hi>Ioannes Regiomontanus</hi> is said to be one, who part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought that the yeare 1588 should adde an end to the

                  <p>Some subscribe to Analogies taken from Jubilees, or from the yeares of Christs age, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and to omit many, sundry others have their tricks and devices in Arithmeticall numbers, whereby they can directly calculate the time, and make the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious multitude admire them, and lend a more then greedie eare to their feared predictions.</p>

                     </list>
All which do make (being added together) 1656, and not 1657, as they imagine: because that which is said of <hi>Noah</hi> in Gen. chap. 7. verse 6. viz. that he was 600. yeares old when the floud of waters was upon the earth, is expounded in two severall places after it, that it must be understood of his 600 yeare current, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. The places are Gen. 7. 11. and Gen. 8. 13; the one expressing the beginning, the other the ending of the floud: and so also the most and best chronologers hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have observed, although some do not.</p>
                  <p>Which, as it is agreeable to the truth of computation, so also (that I may answer one fancie by another) it is more congruous to the nature of the number of the yeare wherein it came: For <hi>Six</hi> is no number of rest; witnesse the six dayes of creation, the six dayes of our weekly labour, and the six ages of the world. But <hi>Seven</hi> is for rest; witnesse the sabbaticall dayes, the sabbaticall yeares, and that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eternall sabbath in the heaven of heavens, when the six ages of the world shall be ended.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, in the yeare of the world 1656, the Ark was without rest, and tossed upon the waters: but in the yeare 1657, it found rest; the waters were dried up and gone; and Noah then came out and offered sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>And further, admit it be said, that <hi>As it was in the dayes of Noah, so shall also the coming of the Sonne of man be:</hi> Doth this point out any thing concerning the time of his coming? Verily no. It shews indeed the great securitie that shall then be in the world amongst the wicked: so that as the floud came upon the old world when they feared nothing; in like manner shall the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Sonne of man be. But what is this to the time? Our Saviour doth not compute the time, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the manners of the times together; as may be very
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18622:19"/>
plainly seen by that which he hath elsewhere publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, saying, that <hi>the coming of the Sonne of man shall be,</hi> not onely <hi>As it was in the dayes of Noah,</hi> but also <hi>As it was in the dayes of Lot,</hi> Luke 17. 28.</p>
                  <p>For conclusion therefore, seeing the floud came before that yeare which they have computed, it may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that their <hi>Mundi conflagratio</hi> for the end of the world in the yeare of Christ 1657, is but an idle fancie. And as for the time which they referre to the dayes of Noah, we see that it is likewise referred to the dayes of Lot: the intent onely being to compare the times, and not compute them.</p>
                  <p>But secondly for their <hi>Mundi conflagratìo;</hi> admit it were so that the floud did not come untill the yeare of the world 1657 (as they would have it) yet why should it be that these numerall letters must be picked out of two Latine words rather then out of words in some other language? In Greek it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; out of which words you may gather 1830 at the least.</p>
                  <p>Surely in this we may say, that as in the making of anagrams upon a name, if one language will not help us, we may then write the name in some other tongue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then want letters for our purpose: so the same liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (belike) he took who was the first authour of this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for the worlds ending: wherefore we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it is but idle and not worth regarding.</p>
                  <p>Another (much like to this) is that which others have also hatched; whereby in the yeare of Christ 1645, should be the end of the world.</p>

of 2012 is 1495: unto which they adde so many as these words will afford, viz. PROPTER ELECTOS, which signifie <hi>For the elects sake;</hi> wherein is a number of 150; and so the whole summe amounteth to 1645, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as they fondly imagine) the last yeare of the world.</p>
                  <p>But if such or the like fancies could hold, then (que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse)<note place="margin">The former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion confuted.</note> the world should have had many endings since it first began; and must either have had a new creation, or else no world had been till now.</p>
                  <p>As for example, either in the yeare 1532, or in the yeare 1533, or in the yeare 1578, or in the yeare 1588, or in the yeare 1623, the judgement day (upon these grounds) was foretold to come. For first, in the yeare 1532, they had two wayes to prove it; either out of these words, VIDEBVNT INQVEMPVPVGERVNT; or out of these words, VIDEBVNT IN QVEMTRANS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIXERVNT;<note place="margin">John 19. 37.</note> which signifie, <hi>They shall look on him whom they pierced;</hi> the numerall letters being in either of these so many as will make 1532. Secondly, for the yeare 1533, they had this false proof, binding still upon nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merall letters, which they gathered out of these words, IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM, <hi>Iesus of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vide Buchol. chron. anno Dom. 1533.</note> 
                     <hi>Nazareth king of the Iewes;</hi> here being so many as will make 1533. Thirdly, for the yeare 1578, thus it was: viz. they take these words, ADVENTVS DOMINI, and in them they have 2012; out of which number they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted 517, which they gathered from DIES ABBRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIABVNTVR; and then the remainder makes 1495: unto which they adde the number of the letters [<hi>a, c, n, t, s,</hi>] in <hi>adventus,</hi> which were not numerall before, yet by their naturall position in the alphabet or crosse-row they give 56: then again by the same reason they take 27 out of [<hi>o</hi> and <hi>n</hi>] the non-numerall letters in the word <hi>Domini;</hi> both which numbers being added to 1495, do make 1578. Fourthly, for the yeare 1588, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18622:20"/>
manner of calculating is as before for the yeare 1645; unto which number having raised their summe, they subtract [<hi>a, e, n, t, s,</hi>] viz. 56: and so they have 1587 yeares, which they reckon compleat, and referre their prediction to the beginning of the yeare 1588. <hi>Vide Gerardum in locis communibus, pag.</hi> 185. <hi>Tom.</hi> 9. Fifthly, for the yeare 1623, thus was the fancie, IV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICARE VIVOS &amp; MORTVOS, <hi>To judge the quick and</hi>

                     <hi>the dead:</hi> Now here (as before) they were led by nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall letters, having so many as would make 1623, in which yeare they dreamed of the worlds ending. Now these times we know are past long since, but the event you see hath not answered to the prophesie. Things therefore of the like nature being yet to come, and built upon the same grounds, cannot but prove as false.</p>
                  <p>But what need many words be spent about the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of such idle dreams and foolish fantasies? Surely, that great and terrible day of the worlds ending, is a thing of greater moment then that it should be thus dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with. Let not therefore the quintessence of wit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose us to such impudent folly: For although it may somewhat please us in shew; yet, when the best is made of it that can be, it will be proved, not onely the doting froth of a wittie brain, but also a superstitious and an heathenish vanitie.</p>
                  <p>I have seen a world of fancies more upon this subject, especially such as may be taken out of<note n="g" place="margin">See Treas. of ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times, l. 4. cap. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Cusa,</hi> who was made Cardinall under <hi>Pius</hi> the second: But seeing they are as idle as the former, and built upon as false grounds, I scarce hold them worth the answering.</p>
                  <p>Yet (having come thus farre) let me go a little further, because in the next place I hope to meet some wiser men; granting (as indeed they ought) that the precise day and houre of the worlds ending cannot be known: yet they would not have any to be so<note n="h" place="margin">Napeir on the Revelat. Prop. 14 where he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the time to be betwixt the yeares 1688, and 1700; naming ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the yeare 1697, or 1699.</note> base of judgement,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18622:20"/>
as to conclude thereby, that an apparent length of this last age may not be found; or that seemingly between such and such yeares the judgement day shall not be known to come: For is it prophesied? and why are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, if they either may not, or cannot be understood? It is recorded in Matth. 24. 15. <hi>Let him that readeth, understand.</hi> It is said Dan. 12. 10. <hi>None of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.</hi> And Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation 1. 3. <hi>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that heare the words of this prophesie, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.</hi> And Dan. 12. 4. it is said, that these things towards the end shall be unsealed: for <hi>many shall runne to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</hi>
                  </p>

is meant the not making it too common on the sudden, because from the time of these visions untill the dayes of <hi>Antiochus</hi> were about 300 yeares. In which regard it is said concerning that other prophesie of the Revelation, that it must not be sealed up, because the time was at hand, Revelat. 22. 10. Yea some part of it was not onely presently to take effect, but even then in act, chap. 1. verse 19.

And further, were it so that we had perfect Synchronismes of all things prophesied in the Revelation (for that prophesie doth most concern the end) and knew how to link them together; yet if we erred in the true placing of our first link, it must needs be that the end of our reckoning either fall short, or else overshoot that period, which otherwise might point out an apparent time, if not directly of the worlds ending, yet of such prophesies as shall be fulfilled before it endeth: (for perhaps that which some take to be the apparent time of the worlds ending, may as well be taken for the time wherein other things prophesied shall be accomplished) but how long the end shall be after them, is unknown. We know that the seventh Trumpet shall give an end to all, because when
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18622:21"/>
that seventh Angel came and stood upon the sea, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Revelat. 10. 6.</note> the earth, he lift up his hand and voice to heaven, swearing solemnely by him who liveth for ever, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Wherefore I do well perceive, that it is no easie thing to finde an apparent length of this last age any long while before it endeth, unlesse we could be directly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified of the utmost periods of all the Trumpets; or knew the times of the seven Vials, which by seven Angels were to be poured out. The best and onely way is alwayes to watch, and to be evermore ready either for death or judgement: For certainly when that time comes, pure hearts (as <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh) shall prevail more than sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till words; good consciences, better then full purses; because the Judge will not be deceived with words, nor moved with gifts: neither is it possible that any should avoid him; for all shall be summoned to appeare before him.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the account of Times, it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that there should be a proposed point or mark, from whence every reckoning may take beginning; that thereby the yeares which have severall times of beginning, may the more truely be computed and compared amongst themselves. Wherefore it cannot be amisse to set down the most probable conjectures concerning the yeare wherein the world began; especially seeing amongst Chronologers it is usuall to referre their accounts either to the yeare of the worlds Creation, or to the birth of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning this, there be chiefly three opinions.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Some imagine that the world was created in the very time of the Summer Solstice, and that in the beginning of time, the Sunne entring into <hi>Leo,</hi> gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the yeare.</item>
                     <item>2. Others referre it to the Spring, when the Sunne entred into <hi>Aries.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. And in the last place 'tis supposed, that the world
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18622:22"/>
was made in Autumne, when the Sunne entred into <hi>Libra.</hi> Of all which I purpose to discourse severally, and to shew the best reasons for that which I think to be the truest time.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The first is an opinion maintained by <hi>Mercator,</hi> and (as is thought) was first hatched among the Priests of Egypt, who, observing the river <hi>Nilus</hi> to overflow about the Summer Solstice, adored it for a God, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of its inundation for an infallible beginning of divine actions in things created; and thereupon, for the beginning likewise of the yeare at the time of the worlds creation.</p>
                  <p>But if this were the onely cause, we may not unfitly say, that it was folly and superstition which first set this opinion abroach; and therefore he is worthy of blame who will go about to maintain it. And although <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> in his Chronologie seems to alledge some other reasons, thereby to uphold his share in it; yet his chief reason is not sufficient; for it is grounded upon that which is not granted; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Floud should end about <hi>Iuly;</hi> because in the eleventh moneth, which he supposeth to be <hi>May</hi> or <hi>Iune,</hi> when the Olive beginneth to put forth, the Dove brought green Olive leaves unto Noah into the Ark.</p>
                  <p>To which it is answered, That the word in Gen. 7. 11. which he taketh to signifie <hi>green leaves,</hi> may (as exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours witnesse) as well be taken for <hi>branches;</hi> even such as have been used to make Bowers with: which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the translation of the Septuagint) is expressed by a word signifying a dry stalk. And so saith that † Doctour, in his Hexapla upon Genesis, chapter the first, question the 17, that the word in the originall is <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>alce,</hi> which (as S. Hierome translateth it elsewhere) signifies the branches of Olives: and in the Septuagint it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a stalk without leaves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:18622:23"/>That therefore which the Dove brought, might be some branch of the Olive tree rather then the leaves; and so might the Floud end at the dead time of the yeare, rather then when things were fresh and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing.</p>
                  <p>But admit that the stalk or branch had leaves on it, yet it proves not that it was about <hi>May</hi> or <hi>Iune,</hi> when the Dove found and brought it; because it is recorded of the Olive, that she loseth not her leaves as other<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 16. cap. 20.</note> trees doe, but is green and flourishing all the yeare. Such leaves therefore as it had before the Floud, it might have after the Floud: for if they were new ones, they must needs spring out in seven dayes, because the Dove was sent out but seven dayes before, returning then as a creature disconsolate, not finding any thing at all.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 2.</head>
                  <p>ANother opinion is, that it was created in the Spring,<note place="margin">A second opinion is, that the world began at the Spring.</note> and that the Sunne (who is the Index of time, by whose revolution we account our yeares) began his course in <hi>Aries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The most forcible reasons to uphold this opinion, are these.</p>
                  <p>First, the naturall beginning of the yeare was in the Spring time, because Noah entred into the Ark the first moneth; and after a yeare, about the end of the second moneth, he came forth of the Ark again, Gen. 7. 8. Now the first and second moneths here mentioned, agree not to Autumne; because if Noah came out of the Ark at that time of the yeare, he could not then provide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with victualls for those creatures which were with him against the next yeare, by reason that the Harvest time was then past, and Winter coming on: so that the yeare naturally began in the Spring time, and not in Autumne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:18622:23"/>Secondly, it is likely that the world took beginning at such a time when things were growing more and more to perfection, as in the Spring; rather then when they were decreasing, as in Autumne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is no weak assertion to affirm that the world was created about that time of the yeare when by the second Adam it was redeemed; which was not in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne, but in the Spring.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the children of Israel coming out of Egypt were commanded to begin their yeare at <hi>Abib,</hi> called afterwards <hi>Nisan;</hi> which moneth agreeth partly to our <hi>March,</hi> and partly to <hi>April.</hi> [See Exodus chap. 12. verse 1; and chap. 23. verse 15.] Now by this command it is like that they were onely put in minde of their ancient custome which was in use amongst their Ancestours, and lost by them, since their going into Egypt, and death of the Patriarchs: For when the twelve Patriarchs, the sonnes of Jacob, were dead, they of their posteritie learned the customes of Egypt, and so came to change their yeare from the Spring to Autumne: But when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses brought them out from among the Egyptians, they had a command to reckon the beginning of their yeare from Autumne no longer, but from the Spring, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as hath been said) in the moneth <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Nisan.</hi> Now this is chiefly grounded upon that which Moses writeth concerning the order of the moneths in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of the Floud: For by that it appeareth, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient form of the yeare was no other then what was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the times of Moses when he wrote his histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, untill the end of the old Testament, and afterwards. Consider therefore the order of the moneths which was before the coming out of Egypt (I mean that order spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the historie of the Floud) and compare it with that order which God gave Moses command to put in practise, and see if it be not the same. So that as Moses
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18622:24"/>
reckoned the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, &amp;c. from <hi>Nisan,</hi> which began in the Spring; in like manner did <hi>Noah:</hi> for where can it be shewed in any place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, when the moneths are reckoned in their orders, that they take beginning from any other time?</p>
                  <p>And thus these are the chief reasons to uphold this opinion that the world should take his beginning at the Spring time of the yeare, at the Vernall Equinox, the Sunne entring into <hi>Aries,</hi> rather then at any time else.</p>

                  <head>Sect. 3.</head>
                  <p>BUt, if they be well weighed, I rather think that<note place="margin">A third and best opinion is, that the world began in Autumne.</note> those, who in the third place imagine that it was in Autumne, are nearest the truth.</p>
                  <p>For first in the description of the floud, it is true indeed that the first and second moneths there mentioned, are meant the first and second moneths of the yeare: but that they must take their beginning from the Spring, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then from Autumne, I cannot be perswaded. First,<note place="margin">An answer to their first reason who place the creation in the Spring.</note> because <hi>Iosephus</hi> (who wrote the Antiquities of his own nation) in his first book and 5 chapter writeth thus, viz. that the second moneth, being the moneth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the floud came, was called by the Hebrews <hi>Marhesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> and by the Macedonians, <hi>Dyo;</hi> both which moneths agree to that part of the yeare wherein our <hi>November</hi> falleth, and not <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May.</hi> Secondly, because the Chaldee Paraphrast begins the ancient yeare of the Jews from Autumne, as afterwards shall be shewed.</p>
                  <p>And further, whereas it is said, that if Noah were to go out of the Ark when the yeare was so farre spent, he must needs want food for those creatures which were with him; I answer, that it follows not.</p>
                  <p>For first, the mountain tops appeared by the <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. the first day. Gen. 8. 4, 5.</note> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the tenth moneth, which was (according to

                  <p>Neither secondly doth the temperature of the climate wherein the Ark rested, afford such a rigid winter, but that Noah might sow some kinde of grain, such as might afford him food against the next yeare, if need were; and so both himself and other creatures with him might be preserved and kept alive.</p>
                  <p>But what need I speak of Noahs providing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or them? seeing to the beasts, fowl, and the like, their dismission from the Ark was enough; especially there being but a few of every kinde.</p>
                  <p>And as for himself and his familie (who were but eight persons) they had libertie given them by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God to eat of any living <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 9. 3.</note> creature whatsoever, as well as of the green herb.

Tell me (say they) if the world were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in Autumne, and that Noah, with those living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which he kept alive, did then or at that time of the yeare come out of the Ark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how could they be sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the yeare being so farre forth spent? what? must they

hunger for the space of a whole yeare, or live with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, feeding, like Cameleons, on the aire? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To which he answereth, that these men speak, as if for their singular wisdome the Patriarch Noah had made them of his counsell when he carried food into the Ark, because thus punctually they seem to know how much of it was left when he came out from thence: which that it was all spent, how can they tell? yet neverthelesse concerning such creatures as lived ravenously by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on flesh, if Noahs old store were gone, I bid (saith he) that they take no great care for them, because they had dead carcasses enough to feed on. Likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the other kinde of beasts or cattell, let them not be too solicitous; because the mountains, being watered with such a fatting floud, and dried also since the <note n="*" place="margin">Or from the tenth to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond moneth. See Gen. chap. 8.</note> fifth moneth before, had now brought forth herbs, grasse, and young tender shoots by which those creatures might easily have their lives sustained. Which reason of his is very pertinent, either because it makes it appeare that it was possible to finde food if all in the Ark were spent; or that there might be some of the old store still remaining to help such creatures as were least able to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18622:25"/>
began to decline; which could not be in their insancie, but in their maturitie; not in the Spring time, but in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne. And so we finde it even in the historie of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation it self: for the trees, as it is said, were made to grow<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 29. and 3. 2.</note> up with their fruits on them; not green, but ripe, as is evident: not onely because they were pleasant to the eye, but also because they were good for food; in which regard they were made even in their very perfection: and so God is said to have seen them, not onely as they were good, but also as they were very good, which was with an approbation of their perfectnesse, as may be seen in Gen. chap. 1. verse 31.</p>
                  <p>Yet neverthelesse we know that the Almightie could have created trees with their ripe fruits on them, as well in that part of the yeare which is our Spring, as in Autumne: but surely the course of nature once begun<note place="margin">The course of nature was never changed.</note> was never altered: and therefore, as now they are in their perfection about Autumne, so were they then when they were created.</p>

For surely me thinks it is farre more probable that there followed a sad winter for Adam to bewail his horrid fall in, rather then an acceptable and pleasant summer: for do but grant this (which may not well be denied) namely that Adam fell presently after his creation, and then tell me what time of the yeare was fitter to expresse the time of his fall then Autumne.</p>
                  <p>For as the trees in Autumne being come to maturitie do then lose their beautie by the fall of their fruits and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18622:26"/>
leaves; or as the yeare then slides away like the day at the setting of the sunne: even so mankinde, as soon as he began to be in a perfect state, kept it not, but fell away and lost his happinesse: yet as the day is restored again by the rising of the sunne; and life is as it were put anew into the yeare by the return of the Spring: even so at that very time decayed man was again restored by the death of Christ, who in the Spring-time of the yeare paid the price of our redemption.</p>
                  <p>The fall therefore of man at the fall of the leaf, and the restoring of him at the reviving Spring, do make a more perfect harmonie, then if for their circumstances of time we should cast them both into the Spring: for as the death of Christ was contrary to Adams fall; so the time for the one was contrary to the time for the other: and yet being contrary, both do well expresse the nature of each act at either time.</p>
                  <p>And now, lest it may be doubted whether Adam fell<note place="margin">Adam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ll soon after his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> presently after his creation, this may be added as a proof.</p>
                  <p>First, that Sathan was a murderer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and therefore he delayed no time to purchase mans misery.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was the sixth day that man was created, even as on the sixth day he was redeemed. By which it appeareth that he fell on the very day of his creation. Whereupon <note n="*" place="margin">Upon Matth. chap. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Theophylact</hi> maketh this observation, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Sext â die homo est conditus, qui &amp; sext â hor â de ligno comedit: Sext â quoque die &amp; sext â hor â Christus cruci est affixus. Quâ igitur hor â Dominus hominem condidit, eâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem &amp; lapsum curavit.</hi> By which he meaneth, that as man was formed the sixth day, and did eat of the tree the sixth houre: so Christ reforming man, and healing the fall, was fastened to the tree the sixth day and the sixth houre. And hence also came that common saying concerning Adam, that <note n="*" place="margin">Broughton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>

                     <hi>In one and the same day he was</hi>

                     <hi>formed and deformed,</hi> not continuing in righteousnesse and true holinesse untill the Sabbath: for then (as some observe) he would have performed the ordinances of the Sabbath, which was to have eaten of the tree of life, and so have lived for ever, being never guiltie of that fall whose ach even yet the sonnes of Adam feel.</p>
                  <p>3. And surely Moses making mention of many times, would never have omitted this time of the fall, except it had been presently after the creation.</p>
                  <p>4. Besides, it must necessarily be granted that Adam fell before ever he knew his wife: otherwise Cain had been conceived without sinne, because presently after the man and woman were made, God said, <hi>Increase and multiplie;</hi> as in Genesis 1. 28. is manifest: but it is a thing not to be imagined that Cain was conceived without sinne; neither is it true that Adam accompanied with his wife untill after he was cast out of Paradise. Eve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and Mary may well be compared together; as thus: Eve being a Virgin, hearing the words of the serpent, and beleeving them, brought forth death. The Virgin Mary hearing the words of the Angel, and beleeving them, brought forth life. Such is their resemblance; and it very fitly serveth to teach us that the fall was soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the creation.</p>
                  <p>5. To which purpose that place in the nine and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Psalme, at the 13 verse, is very congruous, viz. that Adam lodged not one night in honour. For so (saith D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                     <hi>Willet</hi>) do the words signifie, if they be properly<note place="margin">Hexap. upon Gen. chap. 3. quest. 31.</note> translated. As for example, the word (saith he) is <hi>lun,</hi> which signifieth to lodge or stay all night: which by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Rabbins is expounded of Adam who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not one night in Paradise, but fell on the self same day of his creation: which for the time of the yeare bears a fit resemblance with the fall of the leaf, even as on the other side the redeeming of him bears a fit resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18622:27"/>
with the reviving Spring, when he was again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from his spirituall prison, like the herbs and plants from their earthly one.</p>
                  <p>All which considered, their argument is but weak to prove the creation of the first Adam in the Spring, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the redemption by the second Adam was at the same time: for we see by an exact and perfect harmonie how those times are better severed then conjoyned.</p>
                  <p>Let us come therefore unto their fourth reason now, and see the greatest force it beareth.</p>

                  <p>FOurthly, the children of Israel coming out of Egypt<note place="margin">An answer to their fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who place the creation in the Spring.</note> were bidden to begin their yeare at <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Nisan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now they (as hath been shewed) who maintain the worlds creation in the Spring, think that the yeare natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally began at that time, and that the Israelites by this command were onely put in minde to restore again their ancient custome which was in use amongst their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, before they went into Egypt.</p>
                  <p>All which is but a meer conjecture: for what author ever reported that the Egyptians made the Israelites for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their ancient customes? it is written no where but in some mens imaginations, and therefore it proveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In which regard we may be rather confident of the contrary, namely that the yeare was changed, and not renewed: especially if we consider but of this one thing more concerning the beginning of the Egyptian yeare, which was not from <hi>September,</hi> as the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; but from <hi>Iuly,</hi> or about the Summer solstice, when their river <hi>Nilus</hi> began to overflow. If therefore the Jews had altered the beginning of their yeare that they might observe the customes of the Egyptians and imitate them, why did they not reckon their first moneth from the Summer solstice, as did the Egyptians, but rather
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18622:27"/>
from the Autumnall Equinox, as did not the Egyptians? I confesse that conjectures in some cases for want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proof may hold water; but here the case is otherwise, as evidently appeareth.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>But it is objected, that the Chaldeans reckon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning<note place="margin">Object.</note> of their yeare from the Spring; and from whom did they learn their customes but from the ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews? wherefore the Hebrews of old time began their yeare from the Spring, and not from Autumne.</p>
                     <p>The Chaldee Paraphrast mentions no such thing, but<note place="margin">Answ.</note> plainly affirms the contrary; shewing that that moneth which after the coming out of Egypt was the seventh moneth, had in former times been the first moneth. This that authour affirmeth; then which what can be more plain?</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>But it is further objected, that the order of the<note place="margin">Object.</note> moneths in the history of the Floud makes it appeare otherwise; for it cannot be shewed in any place of the Scripture where the moneths are reckoned in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the first, second, third, &amp;c. that ever they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan but from <hi>Nisan:</hi> Moses therefore, according to the command of God, ordaining this moneth to be the first moneth, doth make no new institution, but reneweth the old, as before was mentioned.</p>
                     <p>To which it is answered, that when Moses had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">Answ.</note> to speak of the moneths of the yeare in the historie of the Floud, he must either mention them as he did, or else say nothing of them at all: For it is plain enough that all of them had not names to be called by; and must therefore be reckoned according to their number (if at all they be reckoned) from whence soever the reckoning began. We do not finde that any of them had names, excepting foure, untill after the captivitie. The foure were these: 1 <hi>Ethanim.</hi> 2 <hi>Bul.</hi> 3 <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Nisan.</hi> 4 <hi>Zif.</hi> The first was called <note n="*" place="margin">1.

from the excellencie and dignitie of it; not onely because it was the beginning of the yeare, but also of the rest and Jubilee. The next to it was called <note n="a" place="margin">1. King. 6. 38.</note> 
                        <hi>Bul,</hi> which is as much as <hi>defluens;</hi> because in this moneth the leaves do as it were flow, slide, or fall away from the trees. The seventh was <hi>Abib,</hi> so called <hi>à novis frugibus,</hi> from the new fruits or eares of corn then first appearing. The eighth was called <note n="b" place="margin">1.

                     <p>That therefore for the order of the moneths proves as little as any thing else.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I cannot see but that this opinion above all others may stand as the most probable, namely, that the yeare naturally began from Autumne; and so, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, the worlds creation was then.</p>
                     <p>The Autumnall Equinox was at that time (if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to our Julian account) about the latter end of <hi>October;</hi> but now it is about the 13 day of <hi>September:</hi> And the Sunne then entred into <hi>Aries</hi> about the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> which in these dayes is about the 10 or 11 of <hi>March;</hi> so much hath the Equinoctiall anticipated since the beginning.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>So that if the world began in the Spring, or at the Vernall Equinox, then we may account that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 21 or 22 day of <hi>April</hi> was the first day of the world. Or if it began in Autumne, then the

                  </p>
                  <p>But in my judgement the best opinion is (as hath been shewed) that it was in Autumne when things were not growing to perfection, but even in perfection it self, as Adam was, who presently after fell: so also the trees and plants in Autumne, with their fruits and seeds on them at the ripest, were in their perfection, began the course of Nature, faded afterwards by little and little through the approaching winter: which time seems to be a fitter time for Adam to bewail his fall in, and to make him the more sensible of his lost happinesse, then a pleasant and chearfull Summer; because by how much the more he was afflicted, he would by so much the more be sensible of his miserie, and thereupon long the more earnestly after the promised seed.</p>
                  <p>And not onely so, but also the fall of man at the fall of the leaf, and the restoring of him again at the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Spring, do make a more perfect and exact harmony, then if for their circumstances of time we should cast them both into the Spring. For (as hath been said) like as the death of Christ was of a contrarie nature to Adams fall; so the time for the one being contrarie to the time for the other, doth well expresse the nature of each act at either time.</p>

                  <p>Also we have testimonies in holy Writ to strengthen the same assertion, and to shew us that the ancient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yeare was from Autumne, because that <hi>Tekupha</hi> or Quarter is expressely tearmed the end of the yeare.

                  <p>Yet neverthelesse we are not to think that the first day of the seventh moneth was alwayes the first day of their yeare; for their moneths being lunar were move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: and therefore the head of the yeare was to take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning according to the course of the sunne.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said in Exod. 12. 42. <hi>It is a night to be much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to the Lord for bringing them out of the land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.</hi>

And not onely so, but also at the same time of the yeare (as God had determined it) there was a better and a greater deliverie to be wrought for mankinde; namely such a delivery as should free him from the bondage of Satan by the death of Christ. Now this may be called the <hi>Deliverie of deliveries;</hi> of which that other out of Egypt was but a figure, because it was but from a corporall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, whereas this was from a spirituall.</item>

                     <p>And thus came the yeare to be changed, which ever before pointed to the time of mans creation: but now it is made to point another way, namely to the time of mans redemption: by which God taught his Church (then typically delivered) how to expect the acceptable yeare of the Lord, and time of mans redemption; which was both proclaimed and purchased by that <hi>Lambe of God who taketh away the sinnes of the world:</hi> whose offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the crosse was at the same time of the yeare when that Paschal lambe, by which he was prefigured, was slain: which time why it is severed from Autumne, hath been shewed.</p>
                     <p>Yea thus came the first to be last, and the last first: thus came <hi>Nisan</hi> to get the dignitie from the other moneths, and to be called the beginning or first moneth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

may be added, that as the evening was before the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so was the Autumne before the Spring: for the yeare and the day have a kinde of analogie between the one and the other (as may be seen in the seventh day compared with the seventh yeare) and therefore they do well serve, the one to expresse the naturall beginning of the other.</p>

For <hi>Elohim</hi> being a word plurall doth signifie <hi>Dii, Gods:</hi> but being joyned with a word singular, namely <hi>Bara,</hi> which is <hi>Created,</hi> they then together shew that there are three persons in the Deitie, and that the three persons are but one God, who did create.

And
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18622:31"/>
not onely so, but they also shew that the three persons being but one God, did <note n="f" place="margin">Gib. on Gen. Quest. 1.</note> all of them create: For such is found to be the proprietie of the Hebrew phrase, <hi>Elohim bara,</hi>

                     <hi>Creavit Dii, The Gods created.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Of the Father it is witnessed, that he created as the fountain of goodnesse. For saith S. James, <hi>Every good and perfect gift is from above, &amp; cometh down from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. <hi>Of whom and through whom,</hi> saith S. Paul, <hi>are all things,</hi> Rom. 11. 36.</p>
                  <p>2. Of the Sonne it is witnessed, that he created as the wisdome of the Father. For, <hi>when he created the heavens,</hi> saith Wisdome, <hi>I was there,</hi> Prov. 8. 27. And again, <hi>By him were all things created that are,</hi> Coloss. 1. 14, 15. namely by him who did bear the image of the Father, and was the Redeemer of the world.</p>
                  <p>3. And lastly of the holy Ghost it is witnessed, that he createth as the power of the Father and the Sonne. For <hi>by his Spirit he garnished the heavens, and by his hand he hath formed the crooked serpent,</hi> Job 26. 13. and chap. 33. 4. Or, as the Psalmist hath it, <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hosts of them [spiritu oris] by the spirit of his mouth,</hi> Psal. 33. 6.</p>
                  <p>All which considered, and found to be done in the beginning, must needs be then when there was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent matter to work upon. For (<note n="h" place="margin">Gib. on Gen. Quest. 1.</note> as it is witnessed) the Hebrew word <hi>Reshith,</hi> which is englished <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> doth not signifie any substance; neither doth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word <hi>Bara, to create,</hi> signifie any way to create but of nothing: and thereby it is distinguished from the word <hi>Iatzar, to form,</hi> and <hi>Gnasha, to make.</hi> And therefore though now we behold a glorious something wherein appeares in every part more then much matter of wonder; yet at the first, saith noble <hi>Bartas,</hi>

And he, whose sufficiencie and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie is altogether absolute, must needs be able <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturali quadam ratione,</hi> by a certain supernaturall means, to produce all things out of nothing.</p>
                  <p>Of which nothing that I may say something, my best and onely way is to look at Moses, and (as neare as I can) explain his meaning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the beginning</hi> (saith he) <hi>God created the heavens and the earth.</hi> In which words he laboureth not so much to deliver a generall proposition of the works of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of the two distinct parts of the world, or of the matter of heaven and earth, as if the one word did insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate all the superiour parts of the world, the other all the inferiour parts beside: or as if taking both together, he meant by them joyntly <hi>totius mundi semen, the seed of the whole world,</hi> mentioning it under these two words of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> as a Chaos. This he meaneth not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that which concerns the Chaos is mentioned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the second verse. And what were it but a plain tautologie, to say that in the beginning God created a Chaos, and that Chaos was a Chaos? Wherefore in those first words he intendeth nothing more, then to shew that the world which now is called, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its parts, Heaven and Earth, was not from everlasting, but took beginning: and so without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie the right reading of his words doth also witnesse. For in their originall (as it is witnessed by expositours)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18622:32"/>
thus they sound, <hi>In the beginning God created these heavens and this earth:</hi> as if it should be said, These very heavens and this very earth which now we see in being, were not alwayes, but began. Then afterwards he proceedeth to shew how, and in what time God created them: speaking first how all was like a disordered and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chaos, the earth and the heavens not distinguished, but lying as it were in a confused heap all together. And this is manifest. For on the second day, when the heavens were made, it seemeth that their matter was from amongst that masse or unfashioned lump which was said to be void and without form, and not able to be kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, had not the Spirit of God cherished it, (for the Spirit of God moving upon the waters, did as it were sit upon it and nourish it, as a fowl doth her eggs, with heat and life:) yea their matter, I say, was from among the waters, which by the power of Gods word were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and stretched like a canopie round about the earth, as now we see them. In which regard S. Austines words are also pertinent, saying concerning this All of which we now speak, <note n="k" place="margin">Confess. lib. 12. cap. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Materies adhuc erat corporea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rerum informis, sine ordine, sine luce; It was yet an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed matter of corporall things, without order, without light.</hi> Or, as that <note n="l" place="margin">Du Bart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first day of the first week.</note> Nightingale of France hath sung it,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>This was not then the world: 'twas but the matter,</l>
                     <l>The nurserie whence it should issue after;</l>
                     <l>Or rather th' <hi>Embryon</hi> that within a week</l>
                     <l>Was to be born: for that huge lump was like</l>

                     <l>Which doth in time into good fashion come.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Thus and in this manner I cannot but think of these things, not doubting that Moses in his description of the sensible world meaneth otherwise; but sheweth that that heaven and earth which now we see, were in the beginning or first degree of being, an earth, or as an

earth, or one lump, without form, and void; a darkened depth and waters; a matter of no matter, and a form without form, as one speaketh; a rude and indigested Chaos or confusion of matters, rather to be beleeved then comprehended of us. <hi>And this,</hi> saith <note n="m" place="margin">Mr. Purch. in his first part, lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> he, <hi>is the second naturall beginning. For, after the expressing of the matter, followeth that which Philosophers call a second naturall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, Privation, the want of that form of which this matter was capable; which is accidentally a naturall principle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in regard of generation, not of constitution, here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by that part next us, earth, which was without form, as is said, and void. This was the internall constitution. The externall was darknesse upon the face of the deep. Which deep compriseth both the earth before mentioned, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible heavens also, called a depth, as to our capacitie infinite, and pliant to the Almighty hand of the Creatour: called also waters, not because it was perfect waters, which was yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused; but because of a certain resemblance, not onely in the uniformitie thereof, but also of that want of stabilitie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it could not abide together, but as the Spirit of God moved upon these waters to sustain them, &amp;c.</hi> Here therefore is the third beginning or principle in nature, that form which the said <note n="n" place="margin">Not the aire or winde; they were not yet.</note> Spirit by that action framed it unto.</p>

                  <p>God therefore doth not disable his omnipotence in not working all at once, but sheweth that he worketh all things <note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>according to the counsell of his will;</hi> which in this work of creation (prosecuted both by an order of time and degrees) is so farre from eclipsing his power, that it rather doth demonstrate both his power and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be infinite: and that <hi>he hath so done his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous works, that they ought alwayes to be had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> Psal. 111. 4. For in wisdome he hath made them all: And why not all at once, was because the counsell of his will was otherwise.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>But may we not yet enquire a further reason why it<note place="margin">Quest.</note> pleased the Almighty thus to will such a space, and would not rather produce this All perfect at once?</p>
                     <p>This perhaps may be thought a question too curious<note place="margin">Answ.</note> to be determined, because Gods will is a sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in all his actions; and therefore it is better left then looked into. Which surely might well be so, if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons urged prove too eagle-eyed and unprofitable, not bettering us in our dulnesse or want of knowledge. But otherwise, if they instruct man in any thing pertinent to his present condition, and inform him so as he may be somewhat reformed by them: then they may be urged without the brand of nicenesse or imputation of curiositie.</p>
                     <p>First therefore we may joyn with them, who say that perhaps it pleased Gods infinite perfection to take this leisure; because if the creatures had been made all at once, they might be thought to be increate, and not made at all; nor yet to have the like sense of their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18622:34"/>
as now they have, one seeing another made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, seeing the world was thus perfected by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees before man was, who (being made) was the chief inhabitant of it: me thinks so orderly to raise such a sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous palace for mankinde, whilest yet mankinde was not, what was it, but the declaration of a greater kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and a demonstration proving how kinde, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and how gracious God would be to us ever after being made? and therefore now we must not distrust him, but <hi>in all our wayes acknowledge him, and he shall direct our paths,</hi> Prov. 3. 5, 6. For so he hath promised, and so he doth perform to all that love and fear him; causing every thing to work together for their good; nay, for their best, as the Apostle speaketh. Or, as the Psalmist hath it, <hi>No good thing shall he withhold from them who live a godly life,</hi> Psal. 84. 12.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by this example mankinde may reade a lecture against himself, if heedlesly or hastily he behave himself in any work, and shall not rather proceed soberly and by degrees, making haste (as it is said) by leisure. For true it is, that with us a soft pace goes farre: Which made one <note n="*" place="margin">Bish. Hall, <hi>contemp. lib.</hi> 1.</note> fix this contemplation upon the works of creation, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>How should we deliberate in our actions which are so subject to imperfection; seeing it pleased Gods infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (not out of need) to take leisure!</hi> Upon thought of which, let us</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Make sober speed: for 'tis observ'd by proof,</l>

                     <p>Thus having (as it were) considered the first part of the first dayes work, we may now come more nearely to that which is the beauty of it, I mean the Light, which some call Gods eldest daughter, or the first distinguished creature, wherewith the Lord <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 104. 2.</note> decked the world as with a garment.</p>

                  <p>But of this resplendent creature (without which the beauty of the rest could not be seen) there are no few opinions.</p>
                  <p>1. Some would have it a spirituall Light; and so under it they comprehend the creation of Angels. But surely in my judgement their opinion is the founder who make it a naturall and materiall Light onely, such as now is in the Sunne, the Index of time, and the worlds bright eye. For as the office of the Sunnes light is now to distinguish between the Day and the Night; so was the office of this Light, being commanded to shine out of <note n="b" place="margin">Which was the locall, but not materiall origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of it, as saith Pareus. <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> darknesse before the Sunne was made: which being made, was the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ever after to retain it. If it were otherwise, or any other light, where is it now? shall we say that it is either extinguished or applied to some other use? surely I think not; because God (who made all by the power of his word) needed no instrument or help in the work of his creation: And therefore that Light which at the first made his works appeare, is no spirituall Light; but such and the same that now is in the Sunne. And yet perhaps, as <note n="c" place="margin">Aquin. Sum. 1. par. Quest. 70. a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18622:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is very probable that there was the like order obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in making of the invisible world, which was in the visible; and that on the second day, not onely the visible, but also the invisible heavens were created; yet so as both of them remained as it were unpolished or unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished untill the fourth day: For then as the outward heavens were garnished with Starres, so might the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and highest heavens be beautified with Angels. This me thinks is not obscurely pointed at in Job, chap. 38. vers. 7. <hi>Where wert thou,</hi> saith the Lord to Job, <hi>when the starres praised me</hi> (or <hi>sang together) and all the sonnes of men shouted for joy?</hi> it being here <note n="d" place="margin">See Dr. Willet on Gen. chap. 1. Quest. 33.</note> evident that when the Starres were made, the Angels also had then their being, &amp; rejoyced before God; which was but upon the fourth day of the creation. All this, I say, might well be thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Moses doth not directly mention it; which was because he applied himself to the simple capacitie of the people, describing the creation onely of sensible things, being that which at the first he intended, and did in plain tearms testifie in the beginning of his historie, when he said, <hi>These Heavens, and this Earth,</hi> of which I spoke before.</p>
                  <p>And further, were the creation of Angels compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the creation of the heavens and light, what were this but to leave the literall sense (which is to be followed in the historie of the creation) and to cleave unto Allegories?</p>
                  <p>But secondly, concerning this Light, others think that the element of fire was signified by it, whose effect is light, and whose act and qualitie is to enlighten: which made one therefore say, that <hi>The uncreated Light</hi> (viz. God) <hi>commanded this elementarie light to be, that so the thinner and higher element severed from the aire, might by his enlightning operation effect a light some shining,—and the aire, according to the nature thereof, receive it: which to</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:18622:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>the fire was an essentiall propertie,—to the aire an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall qualitie approved of God, as good both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and the future creatures.</hi> Thus some. But others except against it, affirming that this light was moveable, by the presence of it making day, and by its absence making night: which could not have been, had it been the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire; unlesse it be more or lesse in one place then in another, and not equally dispersed. Or, as <hi>Pareus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, it could not be the element of fire, because that is above the clouds (according to the common rules of Philosophie) and therefore in his judgement the fierie element was not untill the second day, being created with the <hi>Expansum</hi> or stretching out of the aire.</p>
                  <p>But unto these exceptions I think an answer may be framed, as I perhaps shall afterwards shew you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if (as some have done) we should think that this was the very light of the sunne, and then in the sunne, or in such a cloud or subject as was the matter of the sunne, the text would be objected against it; which affirmeth that the sunne was not untill the fourth day: for the creation of that was but then, although the light was before.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, <note n="e" place="margin">Aquin. Sum. part 1. quest. 70. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Now therefore, amongst a multitude of opinions which are besides these already mentioned, I (for mine own part) cannot but preferre this as the best; namely, that the light for three dayes space wanted a subject, such as now it hath: and yet it did perform the same office which now it doth being fastened to a subject, or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18622:36"/>
to the bodie of the Sunne, which is <hi>Vehiculum lucis, A Chariot for the light.</hi> For we may easily perceive that in the works of creation there is such an <note n="f" place="margin">God made one proper centre for all things of one kinde, unto which he redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>As for example, the upper waters must be severed by the out-spread firmament; and the lower must repair all to one sea, as their naturall subject: and as for heavie substances, they hasten downwards; and the light ones, they fly upwards. In like manner, that light which at the first was dispersed and fixed to no subject, doth presently (as soon as the sunne was) unite it self unto that body, as now it is.</p>
                  <p>This of all other seemeth to me the best opinion to pitch upon, and the most probable in this kinde: which may well be as an Embleme how God will one day ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his elect from all coasts of heaven to the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one glorie.

The night serveth to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the dayes exceeding drought, and to cool its heat; for by moistning the aire it makes the earth to fructifie: the day again warmeth the coolnesse of the night, melting the white hoarie haires of winters beard; and with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, cherishing, and nourishing of things, as well sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible as vegetative, addes life afresh into the dying uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; serving (as I said before) for the need full labours of man: For, as the Psalmist hath it, <hi>The sunne ariseth, and then man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labour untill the evening,</hi> Psal. 104. 22.

it is destinated or appointed for quiet and sleep, wherein the wearied bodies of living creatures are refreshed, and their strengths repaired: the noisome beasts now come forth and feed, lest coming in the day they might be a terrour unto men: For, as the Psalmist again recordeth, <hi>Thou makest darknesse that it may be night, wherein all the beasts of the forrest do move;</hi> as the lions roaring after their prey, and the like, vers. 20.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning this dayes work what it was, we finde it thus expressed, <hi>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters; and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which were under the firmament, from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and the morning were the second day.</hi> Gen. 1. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>This is the narration of what was done. And here let us consider, first of the Firmament: then of the waters which it separateth: and lastly of the severall Heavens, together with the regions of the aire, and of such appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances as we use to see there: unto which if any thing else be met withall pertinent to this dayes work, it shall be added.</p>
                  <p>The word <note n="a" place="margin">Janius, Gibbens, and others.</note> 
                     <hi>Rakiah</hi> translated <hi>Firmament,</hi> signifieth <hi>Expansum,</hi> or <hi>expansionem,</hi> which is a stretching out; not onely from the earth, but about the earth: so that the world being mans house, the Firmament is as the vaulted roof of it: Or ( as <note n="b" place="margin">Meth.

                     <hi>quaedam, omnia quae Deo ipso inferiora sunt, inclusa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinens;</hi> as a certain husk, shell, or box, inclusively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all things without the Heaven of heavens, or which are below that place where God doth manifest his glorie. Which also is further to be seen in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fourth Psalme, at the second verse, where it is said that <hi>God hath stretched out the heavens as a canopie:</hi> or, <hi>extendisse incurvando coelos tanquam conopeum,</hi> as some reade it: by which comparison it seemeth that the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament is not so much <hi>expansum ratione extensionis à cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro, quàm circa centrum;</hi> not so much a thing stretched out by reason of its distance from the centre, as about the centre.</p>
                  <p>And again, we call it the Firmament, because in the stretching out it was not weakened, but made strong: In which regard expositours do well observe the difference which is between <hi>Rakiah</hi> and <hi>Karah.</hi> For, the word which is here used, they reade it <hi>Rakiah,</hi> and <note n="c" place="margin">See Gibbens on Gen. chap. 1. quest. 5.</note> say that it doth properly signifie a thing made strong by stretching out; being therefore contrary to the word <hi>Karah,</hi> which is to break in stretching.</p>
                  <p>And the Greeks likewise, that they may give a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression according to the proprietie of the word, do translate it and call it <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, signifying to make strong or firm: and thus also the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Greek Philosophers observed, calling the whole compasse of the heavens <note n="d" place="margin">See Lydiats <hi>disquisitio Phys. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 196.</note>

                  <p>The Latines also call it <hi>Firmamentum;</hi> and we, in our speech, the <hi>Firmament:</hi> which in respect of its extension is the whole compasse of heaven on all sides; being as it were the case of the visible world and all things in it, as hath been shewed.</p>

                  <p>BUt from the concavitie of this firmament, we may passe to the convexitie of it. And now if it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as it is convex, then we shall come to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that which God assigned as proper to it most especially; viz. that it separate the waters from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For this out-spread firmament is by its office to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and to be, not above the waters, but between them: and therefore those waters which it separateth, cannot be such waters as are in the clouds, but rather above the concave of the firmament.</p>
                  <p>If they be such as are in the clouds, then are they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the middle of the firmament, then the firmament in middle or between them. And this made one argue thus, saying, <note n="a" place="margin">

And then again when they are there, they be soon gone: for the rain, proceeding from those vapours which we call the clouds, stayeth not long in the aire, but forthwith falleth down again; and so by little and little the vapour consumeth and the cloud is gone. How can it therefore be that these should be those su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percelestiall waters separated from all other waters by the firmament, seeing the firmament is above them? and not onely so, but also their proper place is here below, being but at times drawn from hence, and then it is as it were against their wills, which makes them therefore hasten hither again with all the speed they can: whereas on the contrary the firmament is to be between those waters, and not over them; separating them, not at times, but continually.</p>
                  <p>Neither may it seem strange how the out-firmament can be able alwayes to uphold them, seeing (as hath been said) it was made strong by stretching out, lifting then the waters up with it, and therefore well fitted for this office, and can no more fall then <note n="f" place="margin">

                  </q>
                  <p>This was his opinion concerning the waters separated
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18622:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the firmament; of which opinion are sundry more.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary side are other some who are of<note place="margin">The contrary and their reasons.</note> another minde, affirming that they are meant onely of those waters in the clouds: for (say they) the aire is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firmament; so also is the skie, &amp;c. And of the clouds it is said in Job, that <note n="*" place="margin">Job 26. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>God bindeth up his waters in thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent under them.</hi> So that, first as every part of the water is called by the name of water; in like manner every part of the firmament is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of the firmament: in which regard those waters in the clouds, although no higher then the aire, may be taken for those waters which the firmament doth separate: and secondly, that place in Job sheweth no lesse, making it appeare, how and in what manner the waters are separated by the firmament.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, <hi>Ex ipsa nubium natura,</hi> saith <note n="g" place="margin">In Gen. pag. 70.</note> 
                     <hi>Pareus, From the very nature of the clouds</hi> this appeareth to be so: for what other thing are the clouds but waters separated by force of the diurnall heat, and by the cold of the aire made thick? whereupon (as <hi>Plinie</hi> calleth them) they are said to be <note n="h" place="margin">Plin. lib. 31. cap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Aquae in coelo stantes, Waters standing in the heavens.</hi> Also, it may be added (saith <hi>Pareus</hi>) that Moses makes mention but of two kindes of waters, <hi>supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, &amp; inferas, the higher and the lower:</hi> but the clouds are waters, as hath been shewed; and no low waters; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are the upper waters: unlesse there be three kindes of waters, which is contrary to Moses.</p>
                  <p>Besides, this (saith he) is confirmed by the grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call construction of the words. For Moses saith, not that it divided from the waters which were <hi>supra Expansum;</hi> but thus, viz. from the waters which were <hi>desuper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panso:</hi> The sense therefore is, not that the waters were carried up above the whole <hi>Expansum</hi> or Firmament; but rather that they were carried upwards, so, as that with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18622:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the firmament they were <hi>supra and desuper;</hi> that is, <hi>above and on high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also, the name of heaven confirms no lesse: for (saith he) the <hi>Expansum</hi> is called according to the Hebrews <hi>Schamajim</hi> or <hi>Shamajim;</hi> from <hi>Sham, There,</hi> and <hi>Majim, Waters:</hi> which derivation is common. And therefore those upper waters are not quite above the <hi>Expansum,</hi> or the Firmament; but are <hi>there,</hi> that is, in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, namely in the middle Region of the aire.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the difference concerning these waters. And now let the reader choose which opinion likes him<note place="margin">The reader is left unto his free choice.</note> best. But for mine own part I like this latter worst: yet let me not tie another to be of the same minde any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he pleaseth: for it is no matter of faith, and therefore we have our free choice according to the best reasons and most forcible demonstrations. Wherefore let me proceed a little further, that thereby (as neare as I can) I may set down that which seemeth to me the best meaning and nearest to the truth.</p>
                  <p>First then I answer, that they do mistake who divide<note place="margin">The matter in question is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by answering the contrary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</note> the <hi>Expansum</hi> into parts, as if in so doing they could ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely cleare the matter in question: for it is not a part of the Firmament that is appointed to this separating office, but the whole Firmament; as any one may see, if he do but observe the words of God, producing and assigning it. Neither do we finde that the Firmament is any more then one. To divide it into parts so as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, is not to divide it into parts, but rather to make so many Firmaments as they imagine parts; like as every scale of an onyon is a severall and differing scale, and not one the part of another. And besides, neither is there the same reason between the parts of water and these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed parts of the Firmament: for then when God made the Sunne, Moon, and Starres, he would not have said, Let them be <hi>in the Firmament,</hi> but <hi>above the Firmament;</hi> for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18622:41"/>
they are farre higher then the clouds; yet, I say, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">The sunne, moon, and starres, are higher then the clouds, and yet they are not said to be above the firmament, but in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fowls also flie in it, but not above it.</note> higher then the clouds, he is said to place them but in the Firmament: and they being no more but in it, how improperly do we affirm those things to be above it, whose places are lower then either Sunne, Moon, or Starres!</p>
                  <p>And secondly, admit Job tells us that there are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters bound up in thick clouds; doth not Jeremie also tell us that they are drawn up in <note n="*" place="margin">

And as for the rain proceeding from those waters which we call the clouds, it stayeth not long in the aire, but forthwith falleth down again; shewing that of right their proper place is here below: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we make not three kindes of waters (as if we would be contrary to Moses) in saying that there are other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters above the concave of the Firmament, which on this second day of the worlds creation were separated from all other waters.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore observe but this, they being separated on this second day, how could they be such as the aire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth? for the middle Region of the aire, which is the place for the clouds, was not untill the third day:<note place="margin">There was no middle Region untill the third day.</note> Not untill the third day, I say, because it is found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and from sufficient witnesse proved true, that the tops of the highest mountains do reach up unto that place which we call the middle Region of the aire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some of them more loftie then the clouds.</p>
                  <p>As for example, in <hi>Iapan</hi> there is a mountain called <hi>Figeniana,</hi> which is some certain leagues higher then the clouds. And in <hi>Ternate</hi> among the <hi>Philippine</hi> Islands there is a mountain, which (as M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>

This surely was that mountain which <note n="i" place="margin">Lyd. de orig. fonti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Thus we see that there are lofty mountains: And indeed their loftines is the cause of a middle Region: for the hils, hindering the aire from following the motion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, do make it about their tops a fit &amp; convenient place to thicken these vapours into clouds, which by the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power of the heavenly bodies are drawn up thither.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore (that I may conclude) the place of the middle Region being both caused and also overtopped by sundry high mountains, it will appeare that there was no middle Region of the aire untill the third day, because the waters were all over the earth, and standing above the hills untill that very day: For then, and not before, God gathered them together unto one place, and made

the drie land to appeare, which before was covered with waters as with a garment, Psalm. 104. <hi>Rarior aqua,</hi> saith one, <hi>velut nebula, terras tegebat, quae congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne densata est; The thinne water, like a mist or wet cloud, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the earth, which by gathering together was made thick.</hi> In which regard it may be said, saith <note n="k" place="margin">Aquin.

                     <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that it was as naturall for the water to be every where about the earth, as for the aire to be about both water and earth: yet neverthelesse, <hi>propter necessitatem finis,</hi> saith he, <hi>for the necessitie of the end,</hi> namely that plants and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures should be upon the earth, it was meet that the earth should be so uncovered, and the waters so ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that the drie land appeare. Now this was a work pertinent unto the third day; and before this work done there could be no middle Region: and the middle Region being on this day and not before, how can the waters in the clouds be those waters which were separated by the out-spread Firmament on the second day? Neither do I here argue <hi>à facto ad fieri,</hi> because in the very creation of this Firmament, God then said, <hi>Let it be between the waters;</hi> that is, even then beginning its office and art of separating them. Which that it is even so, we see he speaketh next concerning the lower waters, and makes no more mention at all of those upper ones, because he had already done with them, and left them in their place unto which he had appointed them.</p>
                  <p>But furthermore, this tenent is not a little helped by a<note place="margin">Of the windows of heaven open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Floud.</note> consideration of the cataracts or windows of heaven which in the dayes of Noah were opened, and poured down rain by the space of fourty dayes: For me thinks the clouds could not be those windows of heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it rained fourty dayes, and before it left raining the waters were higher then the hills, being, when four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes were ended, fifteen cubits above the highest mountains, as in the historie of the Floud is manifest.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18622:43"/>
And hereupon it was that one once by the same reason concluded and said, that either it did not rain fourty dayes, (which assertion we are sure is false) or else it rained from some other where then from the middle Region: For seeing the middle Region it self was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before it ceased to rain, it cannot but be that the rain descended from some higher place.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>1. <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps some may think that the clouds mounted higher and higher as the waters increased; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that as the waters by little and little gat above the mountains, so did the clouds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This cannot be; because that which makes us distinguish the aire so as it may have a middle Region, is nothing else but the differing temper that it hath, both from the upper and lower Region; and this differing temper is caused by the hills, which hindering the aire from following the motion of the heavens, do make it a fit place to thicken those vapours into clouds, which by the attractive power of the starres and planets are drawn up thither; as already hath been shewed, and as afterwards shall be touched when I come again to speak of the severall Regions and their tempers; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you that it is an Axiome undeniable, that the farnesse from a circular motion gives quietnesse, coldnesse, and heavinesse; even as the nearenesse to it gives motion, heat, and lightnesse.</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>2. <hi>Object.</hi> Or secondly, perhaps some may think that the hills and mountains were not before the Floud, but made by the violence of the waters; and that Moses, when he would describe how high the waters were, doth but shew us that they were higher by fifteen cubits then the highest mountain that was then in his time: which he might well say, and make such a comparison, although there were no hills before the floud.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> That which hath been said in the former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18622:43"/>
concerning the cause of the middle Region, doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently stop this last objection, unlesse it be granted, that there were no clouds untill the Floud had made the hills: And indeed if any such thing be granted, then all is granted, and the controversie quite ended concerning these waters above the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>But besides that answer, I hope to make it appeare<note place="margin">That hills and mountains were not caused by the Floud.</note> that mountains, valleys, and plains were created in the beginning, and were before the Floud in the dayes of Noah.</p>
                     <p>For first, if hills were caused by the Floud, then it must be that the waters suffered an extream violent motion: but the waters being over the whole face of the earth had nothing to hinder them from their own free motion, nor any thing to compell them to a violent motion; such I mean as should make them work such wonders as are supposed. Had they been overtopped by any thing, then indeed running from one place to another there might have been a repercussion, and by such contention more strange accidents then were, might have been produced, as the making of hills, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Or secondly, if there were such a violent motion, (as questionles the waters moved untill all places were filled alike, with no small violence) yet the violence was not so great as to be the parent of the hills and mountains; for then without doubt it would have been so forcible also as to have turned rivers and changed them from one place to another, cast down all manner of buildings and structures, rooted up all trees and the like, so that after the Floud nothing should have had the same name, bounds, and description which before it had, neither would the memories of the former ages have been but buried from all succeeding time; which we know is otherwise: for if it were not, it is likely that Moses, speaking of the site of Paradise, and setting down all the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18622:44"/>
rivers of it exactly, would have specified it in his historie, that thereby after-ages looking for those places might not mistake or suspect the truth of his relation. Neither have we just cause to think that all buildings and ancient monuments of the Fathers before the floud were extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in the floud: For it is reported by <note n="l" place="margin">Pom. Mela, lib. 1. cap. 11. &amp; Plin. lib. 5. cap. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> and <hi>Plinie,</hi> concerning the citie <hi>Ioppa,</hi> that it was built before the floud, and that <hi>Cepha</hi> or <hi>Cepheus</hi> reigned there; which is witnessed by certain ancient altars, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing titles of him and his brother <hi>Phineus,</hi> together with a memoriall of the grounds and principles of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And of the citie <hi>Henoch</hi> there is a much like relation. But what need I mention more, seeing <note n="m" place="margin">Antiq. lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus,</hi> a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of good credit, affirmeth that he himself saw one of those pillars which was set up by Seth the sonne of Adam? and this for the truth of it was never questioned, but warranted by all antiquitie.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, seeing the dove was twice sent out of the ark, and returned with an olive branch at her last return, and not at her first, it is not without reason that we think the trees were not torn up by their roots, but remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed still fixed in the ground even as they had done before; for, if the trees had been swimming or floating upon the waters (as some may think) then the poore dove might have found one branch or other as well at the first as second time. Besides, when she did bring any thing, Noah took it not as a token what havock the floud had made, but as a signe that the waters were decreased: she therefore plucked it off from some tree growing on the earth, and not floating on the waters.</p>
                     <p>And last of all (although I say nothing of the delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and profit of the mountains, which do thereby even amplifie the goodnesse of God in his works, creating and not occasioning them) I shall need to point you no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the plain text it self, which doth most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

tell us, not that the waters were as high as the highest mountains which are now, or were then when Moses wrote his historie, but that even from the beginning there were hills and mountains whose loftie tops in the universall floud were covered with waters: for thus stand the words, <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 7. 19, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>And the waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills which were under the whole heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.</hi> Whereupon, as I remember, <note n="n" place="margin">Ains. on Gen.</note> one writeth thus, saying that this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was admirable, seeing there are mountains, as <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Olympus, Caucasus, Athos,</hi> and other such, that are so high, as their tops are above the clouds and windes (as Historiographers do report it) and yet see, all these are covered: and these being covered, the middle Region must needs be drowned; and that being drowned, how could the clouds be those windows of heaven which poured down rain for fourtie dayes? And those not being the windows of heaven, it cannot but be that the waters above the heavens are in a more remote and higher place, even above the concave of the out-spread Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>3. <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps you may think that I now pitch too much upon reason concerning this of the Floud; seeing it was caused not by naturall and ordinary means, but by the extraordinary power of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> To which it is answered, that this floud was partly naturall, partly supernaturall; and to shew how farre nature had a hand in this admirable effect, we may distinguish with them, who say that an effect may be called naturall two manner of wayes: first, in regard of the causes themselves: secondly, in regard of the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and application of the causes. If we consider the meer secondary and instrumentall causes, we may call this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect naturall; because it was partly performed by their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18622:45"/>
help and concurrence: but if we consider the mutuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and conjunction of these second causes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the first cause, which extraordinarily set them on work, we must needs acknowledge it to be superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</p>
                     <p>Now then, although we have built upon reason, and so found that before fourtie dayes fully ended the middle Region it self was drowned, whereupon it could not rain from thence; yet in so doing we do not argue amisse: for it is no whit derogating from the power of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to ascend up higher till we finde the cause of this long rain, and also the place from whence it came, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that when we have so done we shall plainly finde, that in regard of the direction and application of the cause it was extraordinarily set on work by a divine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation; and so the effect was supernaturall.</p>
                     <p>I may therefore now proceed: and that I may make the matter yet a little plainer concerning these cataracts or windows of heaven, and so by consequence of the waters also above the heavens, this in the next place may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; namely, that Moses setteth down two causes by which there grew so great an augmentation of water as would drown the world: the one was the fountain of the great deep: the other was the opening of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of heaven. Now if these windows were the clouds, then it seemeth that the waters were increased but by one cause: for the clouds in the aire come from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the sea, which by descending make no greater aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation then the decresion was in their ascending. And although it may be thought that there are waters enough within the bowels of the earth to overflow the whole earth (which is demonstrated by comparing the earths diameter with the height of the highest mountains) yet seeing the rain-water is made a companion with the great deep in the augmentation of the drowning waters,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18622:45"/>
I see no reason why that should be urged against it; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seeing it is found that the earth emptied not all the water within her bowels, but onely some: For thus stand the words, <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 8. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>The fountains also of the deep, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained:</hi> their store therefore was not spent when they had sufficiently drowned the world, but their fury rather was restrained, when they had executed Gods purpose by climbing high enough above the hills.</p>
                     <p>Cardinall <hi>Cajetane</hi> was conceited that there was a mount in Paradise which was not overflown, and there forsooth he placeth <hi>Henoch:</hi> The like dream also they have amongst them concerning <hi>Elias:</hi> And, as their champion and Goliah <note n="o" place="margin">

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is perswaded, all those mountains onely were overflown where the wicked dwelt. <note n="p" place="margin">Antiq. lib. 1. cap. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> also reporteth out of <hi>Nicholas Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenus,</hi> that the hill <hi>Baris</hi> in <hi>Armenia</hi> saved many who fled thither for succour. But these are dreams and devices, which are soon overthrown by Moses in his foresaid evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent text; where the words are so generall, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all and every mountain, under, not onely the Aiery heaven (as <hi>Cajetane</hi> collecteth) but under the whole Heaven without exception.</p>
                     <p>And now after all, what hindereth that there should not be waters above the concave of the Firmament, and that the opening of the windows of heaven should not be more then the loosing of the clouds? For it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and not without reason you see, that the rain, or a great part of it which fell in the universall Floud, came from an higher place then the middle Region of the aire: and that the upper waters are to be above the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not the parts of it, is an assertion well agreeing to Moses his description of this second dayes work.

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt concerning this it may be said, that it is not known whether the heavens be of such a nature, as that the rain falling through them should dissolve or corrupt them. Those indeed who follow <hi>Aristotle,</hi> make them of a <hi>Quint-essence</hi> altogether differing from things compounded of the Elements: But for mine own part more easily should I be perswaded to think that there is no such fifth essence in them, but rather that they are of a like nature with the Elements, or not much differing.</p>
                  <p>For first, although <hi>Aristotle</hi> deny any change or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to have been observed or seen in the heavens since the beginning of the world; yet he was deceived: For <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> who had better skill in Astronomie then ever <hi>Aristotle</hi> had, he (as <note n="a" place="margin">Plin. lib. 2. cap: 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> witnesseth) telleth us out of his own diligent and frequent observations that the heavens have had changes in them; for there was in his dayes a new starre like unto that which was once in <hi>Cassiopea.</hi> And that which is beyond the authoritie of

                  <p>What great difference then can there be between the heavens and things here below, seeing in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures both of them do tend to corruption, and are subject to mutation?</p>
                  <p>Besides, as it is with Man who is the little world, so certainly it is with <hi>Macrocosme</hi> who is the greater world: but man changeth and declineth daily, not being now as heretofore he hath been; and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as a good consequence it must follow, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er world doth also suffer change, and, by declining, alteration.

                  <p>Unto which adde this, namely, that these visible heavens, of which we now speak, were taken from that masse or lump which lay here below, and that the whole lump was created at once; in which regard it cannot be denied that they differ <hi>toto genere</hi> or altogether, but that they are of a much like nature with inferiour bodies or things here below. And as for <hi>Aristotle,</hi> he never would so earnestly have defended the contrary, had he not

                  <p>But besides all this, the observations of our best and modern Astronomers make much against him: for they have modestly and manifestly proved, that not onely new starres, but comets also have been farre above the moon. As for example, that strange starre which once was at the back of <hi>Cassiopea's</hi> chair, was of an extraordinarie height above it; for it shined without any difference of Aspect, Parallax, or diversitie of sight, even untill all the matter whereof it consisted was consumed; having alwayes (as the observers thereof do witnesse) one and the same sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every of the starres, both in all climates, and also in all parts of the heaven, no diversitie of sight at all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: all which in the lowermost Planets is otherwise, and perceived most of all in the moon, because the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter of the earth (according to which quantitie we dwell from the centre) hath a sensible bignesse unto the distance of the moons sphere from us. Had therefore that New starre, Comet, or what you please to call it, been lower then the moon, and not in the starrie heaven, then (like the inferiour Planets) it would have suffered a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallax or diversitie of sight, and never have kept such a regular motion as it did; contending not to be overcome of the starrie heaven in its motion, but to keep as it were an equall pace with it: thereby shewing that it was even in the Ethereall heaven it self. For this is a rule, that by how much a starre is higher then the earth, by so much it imitateth the highest heavens in their daily motion.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it this starre alone, but others also after it, even Comets themselves, whose places were found to be above the moon: for observing more diligently and exactly then in former times, the observers could easily demonstrate this truth also: thinking thereupon that many of those Comets which have been seen in former
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18622:48"/>
ages were burnt out, even in the starrie heaven it self, and not so many of them below the moon, as generally (without serious observation) have been supposed. <note n="f" place="margin">Lib. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">

                     <p>VVE may therefore now (if you please) look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Aire: and here, following the common path, and separating it from the starrie heaven, I must say that it is divided into three stages or Regions: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I verily think (as afterwards shall be shewed when I come to speak of the starres) that all this space, even from the earth to the eighth sphere, is nothing else but aire.</p>
                     <p>The highest Region is said to be exceeding hot, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<note place="margin">The highest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> drie, by reason of the neighbourhood that it hath with the fierie element (as is said) and with the starres; by the force of whose beams it receiveth heat, which is also much increased by following the motion of the heavens.</p>
                     <p>The lowest Region is somewhat contrary; for it is<note place="margin">The lowest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> said to be hot and moist: hot chiefly by the reflection of the sunne-beams meeting with the earth; and moist, by reason of the proper nature of the aire, and also by reason of the vapours exhaled out of the earth and water. This is the qualitie which commonly is attributed to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>But I think that we may rather say it is variable; now
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18622:50"/>
hot, now cold, and sometimes temperate; differing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the times and seasons of the yeare: In which regard <hi>Du Bartas</hi> writeth thus,</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>Neither is it altogether variable in regard of time, but also by reason of the diversitie of place; some climates being more hot and drie, some more cold and moist then others; which cometh to passe according to their distance from the Equinoctiall towards either of the Poles.</p>
                     <p>Thus for these two Regions. But now concerning the<note place="margin">The middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> middle Region, it is alwayes cold: yet surely in its own nature it would be warmer then the Region which is here below, were it not cooled by a cold oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the reflection of the Sunne-beams: For they, reflecting upon the earth, drive up above the beams of their reflection much cold from below, which being daily supplied is kept as a continuall prisoner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the heat above and the heat beneath.</p>
                     <p>Or, if you will, take it thus, namely that it is cold, but not extreamly cold: yet cold (I say) it is in respect of the two other Regions which are hotter then it. And this coldnesse happeneth partly through the causes before expressed; and partly by reason of the Aire in it which cannot follow the motion of the heavens, seeing it is hindred by the tops of the mountains.

But (as I said) it is not absolutely cold, but respectively: For if it were extream cold, then the heat of the Sunne would never passe through it to this Region here below; neither would there be grasse, herbs, and such high trees as are upon the tops of the mountains.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed; 1. In the highest Region, and oft times above it, be generated Comets or Blazing starres, and such like fiery Meteors of divers sorts. 2. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Region, Clouds, Thunder, Rain, Windes, Storms, &amp;c. 3. In the lowest Region we have Dews, Mists, Hoar-frost, Ice and Frost. As also here is your <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> or foolish fire, with other Lights burning about graves, or such like fattie places where there is store of clammie or fat oylie substance for their matter. These Lights are seen also in fields, and are driven by a gentle winde to and fro untill their matter be consumed.</p>
                     <p>Now these and every one of these, seeing they have their causes in nature, let us a little view them, both how and what they are: For they who send us to God, and his decree in nature, have indeed said what is the true cause, but not how it is by naturall means effected. For the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of producing these things doth no lesse amplifie the power and providence of God, then the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when they are produced.</p>

                     <p>ANd these things of which we now speak, seen in any of the Regions, by a generall name are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18622:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
called <hi>Meteors.</hi> And the matter of Meteors, as it is remote, is from the Elements; but as it is propinque or neare, it consisteth of Exhalations.</p>
                     <p>And Exhalations are of two kindes. 1. There is <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exhalations are of two kindes.</note> 2. <hi>Vapor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it come from the earth or some sandy place, it is <hi>Fumus,</hi> a Fume or a kinde of Smoke.</p>
                     <p>If it come from the water or some watry place, it is <hi>Vapor.</hi> For this is a rule, that <hi>A Fume hath a certain earthly nature in it, and yet is not earth; and a Vapour hath a certain watry nature in it, and yet it is not water.</hi> Or, if you had rather, take it thus; <hi>Fumus est mediae naturae inter terram &amp; ignem; Vapor verò inter aquam &amp; aërem:</hi> That is, <hi>A Fume is of a middle nature between earth and fire; but a Vapour is of a middle nature between water and aire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further, all vapours are warm and moist; and will<note place="margin">The nature of vapours.</note> easily be resolved into water; much like the breath that proceedeth out of a mans mouth, or out of a pot of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter standing on the fire: and these are never drawn higher then the middle Region of the Aire; for there they are thickened and conglomerated by the cold into clouds. And why vapours are warm, being drawn from that<note place="margin">Why vapours are warm.</note> which is cold, is not from any internall propertie of their own, but they receive this qualitie from the power and influence of the stars. For after that the matter is by them attenuated or made thin, their beams cannot but warm it, although it proceed from that which is cold.</p>
                     <p>Again, all fumes are as smokes which be hot and dry;<note place="margin">The nature of fumes.</note> which because they be thin and lighter then vapours, they often passe the lowest and middle Regions of the Aire, being sometimes carried even beyond the highest Region it self.</p>
                     <p>And thus we see how there are two kindes of Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;</p>
                     <q>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:18622:52"/>
                        <l>Th'one somewhat hot, but heavy, moist and thick:</l>
                        <l>The other light, drie, burning, pure and quick.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Moreover, these Exhalations being the matter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors (as hath been said) are either from the Earth or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As for the Fire and Aire, they are mixed with this matter, as with all other things, but not so abundantly that they may be said to be the materiall cause of any Meteor, although without them none can be effected. And thus much generally. But now more particularly.</p>
                     <p>And in coming to particulars, it may be found that these kinde of Meteors concerning which I speak, are<note place="margin">Three sorts of Meteors.</note> of three sorts; either Fierie, Waterie, or Aierie.</p>
                     <p>Fierie are of two sorts: either such as are in very deed fired; or else such as onely seem to burn, which are therefore called <hi>Phasmata:</hi> In which regard it may be said that these Fierie ones are either Flames or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions.</p>
                     <p>And again in respect of their matter, if they be such as burn in very deed, then they be either more or<note place="margin">Two sorts of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery Meteors which burn in very deed.</note> lesse pure.</p>
                     <p>Their place where we see them is according to the abundance and scarcitie, or rather qualitie of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof they consist: for if it be heavie and grosse, it cannot be carried high; but if it be not so grosse, but rather light and more full of heat, then it aspires and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends so much the higher by how much it is the lighter; sometimes above the highest Region of the Aire, even into the starry heaven it self; which is witnessed by our best modern Astronomers, who have observed many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets above the Moon.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, these Fiery impressions, according to the diverse disposing of their matter, are of severall fashions; and thereupon they have severall appellations, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according unto the names of those things unto which they seem to be like.</p>

                        <p>Again, some think that this Meteor is not so much set on fire, as directly under some starre or other which gives it a shining. But how this can be I cannot well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, seeing it shooteth obliquely as oft as directly downwards.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> They are no spirits, and yet leade out of the way, because those who see them are amazed, and look so earnestly after them that they forget their way; and then being once out, they wander to and fro, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither, sometimes to waters, pits, and other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous places; whereupon the next day they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly tell you strange tales (as one saith) how they were led up and down by a light, which (in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) was nothing else but some devil or spirit in the likenesse of fire which fain would have hurt them. But of this enough: and know last of all, that if one be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neare these lights, and the night calm, then going from them they will follow us, because there being no winde to hinder, we draw the Aire after us; or going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them they go from us, because we by our motion drive the Aire before us.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, when the like matter chanceth to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Of Helena, Castor and Pollux.</note> in some such part of the Aire as is over the Sea, then these lights appeare to marriners, and are called <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> if there be two at once; otherwise <hi>Helena,</hi> if there be but one: The reason of which names was this;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18622:56"/>
                              <hi>Helena</hi> was the daughter of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Leda,</hi> and by the heathens she was taken for a goddesse, but not for a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of good fortune: for this <hi>Helena</hi> was the cause of <hi>Troyes</hi> destruction; as thus. She was stollen away by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> the sonne of <hi>Priamus</hi> K. of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> stollen, I say, out of <hi>Greece;</hi> whereupon her two brothers <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> sayl to seek her, but they were never heard of more, or seen after: which losse of these brethren made it be supposed that they were translated into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those gods who use to give good successe to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners; for they were lost at sea; which is, as if they were translated from thence. Now then the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having seen by often experience that one light was to them a signe of some tempest, and that two lights were a signe of fair weather, they called the one light <hi>Helena,</hi> and the two lights they called <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi>

                              <hi>Quest.</hi> But why should it be, may some demand, that they should thus appearing shew either fair or foul weather? can any reason be shewn for it?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> It is answered, that one flame alone may be<note place="margin">Why two lights at once shew fair weather, and one light foul weather.</note> a signe of tempest or foul weather, because, that as that matter which burneth is so compact into one that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be dissolved into two; so in like manner the matter of tempest being exhaled, by the like cause is kept from being dissipated, and is so close together that before any long time it must needs work.</p>
                           <p>And again, when two lights appeare, why then it should be fair, it is because there is not the like work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in nature which was before; but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for as this Exhalation of the lights is divided; so the matter, which otherwise might be fit for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, is not thickened, but by the like cause is also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, scattered, and easily dissolved: insomuch that it cannot work so as at other times, when there

is a working to compact, and not to dissipate.</p>

                        <p>First, when clammie Exhalations are scattered abroad in the aire in small parts, and in the night are set on fire by an <hi>Antiperistasis;</hi> so that when any shall either ride or walk in such places as are apt to breed them, it is no wonder that they stick either on their horses, or on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they may be caused another way, viz. when the bodies of men or beasts, being chafed, do send out a fat and clammie sweat; which (according to the working of nature in things of this kinde) is kindled and appeareth like a flame.

                           <hi>Livie</hi> also maketh mention of two others, upon whom the like Meteor appeared: For <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> when he was a childe, even as he lay sleeping, had his hair on his head as if it were all on a fire. And upon the head of <hi>Marius,</hi> that worthy Romane, was the like appearance, even whilest he was making an oration to his souldiers. And I my self do also know one, who hath often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to me, that as he lay in his bed one night, his head
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18622:57"/>
was all on a flame; which hurt him not, although it greatly scared his wife and him, as I have heard them both confesse. Moreover, others testifie how they have been scared in their beds by a kinde of light sticking to their coverings, like dew upon the nap of a frieze coat: which must needs be this <hi>Ignis Lambens,</hi> caused by some kinde of clammie sweat proceeding from among them. For, that a clammie sweat will cause these things, is manifest in the nimble currying of a foggie horse; visible sparks appearing and coming from him, if it be done in the dark.

                        <p>But in a Comet two things especially are considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: the one the colour; the other the fashion: both which arise out of the diverse disposing of the matter.</p>
                        <p>Their colours are principally three. 1. If the matter<note place="margin">Three principall colours in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</note> be thin, then the colour is white. 2. If meanly thick, then the colour is ruddie, looking like fire. 3. If very thick, then their colour is like the burning of brimstone, or of a blew appearance.</p>
                        <p>Yet know that they are not alwayes exactly of these three colours without any difference, but as neare them as the disposing of their matter will suffer: as in stead of white we sometimes have them of a yellowish colour; in stead of blew, of a watchet or greenish colour, and the like.</p>
                        <p>Concerning their fashions (if we stand upon a curious<note place="margin">Two chief fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a Comet.</note> examination of them) they may be manifold: and yet, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> accounteth, they are principally but two, all their other shapes being dependant on these two. For first either they seem round, having beams round about them; which cometh to passe when the matter is thin on the edge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>, and thick every where else: or secondly, they seem as it were with a beard or tail; which cometh to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18622:58"/>
passe when it is but meanly thick towards some one side or other, and rather long then round. But some would have these two fashions to be three, because the tail sometimes hangs downward as well as sidelong: and so there is by this means <hi>stella crinita, stella caudata,</hi> and <hi>stella barbata;</hi> concerning which I am not much solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</p>
                        <p>That therefore which in these things I do much more<note place="margin">The strange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Comets.</note> wonder at, is the strange and admired multitude of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which are produced by them; as not onely change of aire, but change of heirs also, proceeding from the disturbance of states, translation of kingdomes, bloudy warres, and death of Potentates. Histories have carefully recorded these things, and left them to the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of after-times.</p>
                        <p>First therefore let it be observed, that when the kingdome of the Macedonians came to an end, in the last yeare of <hi>Perseus,</hi> which was about the yeare 584 or 585 of the building of Rome, a <note n="a" place="margin">Carion, ex Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, lib. 2.</note> Comet appeared, as if it came to point out the last period of that kingdome.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, when the Emperour <hi>Iovian</hi> attained to the empire, succeeding the Apostata <hi>Iulian,</hi> under whom the Church suffered much persecution; when (I say) the said <hi>Iovian</hi> was Emperour, and that under him both Church and Commonwealth were like to have had a <note n="b" place="margin">Socrat. lib. 4. cap. 22.</note> flourishing time (had he not been taken away by sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death) then also <note n="c" place="margin">Carion, lib. 3.</note> appeared a Comet, shewing that further trouble was yet to be expected.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly also, when a certain captain of the Goths, an Arian, named <hi>Cajan,</hi> had raised sedition against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Arcadius,</hi> God shewed by manifest wonders that both <hi>Arcadius</hi> and his citie should be well protected: but before this tumult (saith <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 3. pag. 294.</note> 
                           <hi>Carion</hi>) a strange Comet was seen, great and terrible, casting flames down to the very earth; the like whereunto no man had ever seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:18622:58"/>4 And again, other authours make mention of a strange Comet seen in the yeare of Christ 410, being like unto a two-edged sword, which portended many mischiefs. For Rome was taken about the same time by <hi>Alaricus</hi> King of the Goths. Sundry calamities happened both in the East and West; and so great slaughters of men were about those dayes, as no age ever afforded the like. All <hi>Europe</hi> was in a manner undone, no small part of <hi>Asia</hi> was affrighted; and <hi>Africa</hi> also was not void of those evils. Warre, Famine, Drought, and Pestilence, all of them strove (as it were) to trouble the whole world.</p>
                        <p>5. Also in these yeares, viz. 1400, 1401, <note n="e" place="margin">Of this Comet you may reade in <hi>Carion, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 854.</note> 1402, 1403, Comets appeared, and great calamities followed; sundry and unheard-of diseases were felt, rivers dried up, and plagues were increased. <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> K. of the Scythians and Parthians, with an innumerable host invadeth <hi>Asia,</hi> calling himself the WRATH OF GOD, and DESOLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF THE EARTH; as did <hi>Attilas,</hi> of whom it is written, that he named himself THE SCOURGE OF GOD.</p>
                        <p>6. Also in the yeare 1529 appeared <note n="f" place="margin">Alst. Chron. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A great famine and dearth was also in <hi>Venice</hi> and the countrey thereabout, which swept away many for lack of sustenance. The sweating
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18622:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sicknes<note n="*" place="margin">Idem, ibid.</note> also vexed <hi>Brabant,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and especially the citie <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where it consumed five hundred persons in the space of three dayes. Great warres concerning the Dukedome of <hi>Millain</hi> between the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Francis</hi> the French King. All <hi>Lusitania</hi> or <hi>Portugall</hi> was struck with an Earth-quake; insomuch that at <hi>Ulisippo</hi> or <hi>Lisbon,</hi> a<note n="h" place="margin">In Lanq.

Upon this followed a great pestilence in those parts. But a little before, viz. in the yeare 1530, was a great deluge in <hi>Brabant, Holland, Zeland,</hi> and the sea-coasts of <hi>Flanders;</hi> as also an overflowing of the river <hi>Tyber</hi> at Rome, occasioned by unseasonable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests of winde. Upon the neck of which troubles the Turk comes again into <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Austria;</hi> but he was beaten back, and a great company of his men slain and taken.

                        <p>Wherefore seeing these and the like accidents have been attendant upon the appearing of Comets, it may well be said that although they have their causes in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet <hi>Nunquam futilibus excanduit ignibus aether;</hi> The skie never burnt with such fires in vain. For (as one saith) <hi>Loquitur cum hominibus Deus, non modò linguâ humanâ, per Prophetas, Apostolos, &amp; Pastores; sed nonnunquam etiam ipsis Elementis in formas &amp; imagines diversas compositis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> That is, <hi>God speaketh with men, not onely with the tongues</hi>
                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:18622:59"/>
                           <hi>of men, by Prophets, Apostles, and Teachers; but sometimes also by the very Elements composed or wrought into divers forms and shapes;</hi> there being a Theologicall end of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Comets, as also a Naturall and Politicall end.</p>
                        <p>But first (before I come to that) I think it not amisse to<note place="margin">Why warres, deaths, famines and the like, are the effects of Comets.</note> speak something concerning these their events and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; namely whether it can be shewed why they should be wrought either so or so.</p>
                        <p>To which it is answered, that in some sort we may give reasons for this, and shew the causes of their signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. For being Comets they consist of many hot and drie Exhalations: And hot and drie Exhalations do not onely stirre up heat, drie and parch the aire, which may cause drought (especially when much of the earths fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is drawn away with the Exhalation) and drought bring barrennesse: but also the bodies of living creatures upon the distemper of the aire are mainly hurt, suffering detriment in the consumption of their radicall moisture, and suffocation, through the poysonous breathings which the bellows of the bodie suck in, and receive: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that there cannot but be sicknesses, plagues, and much mortalitie.</p>
                        <p>Besides which, that they should usher in warres, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, changes of kingdomes, and the like, may also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the same cause: For when the Aire is distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately heated, then it is very apt so to disorder and dry up the bloud in humane bodies, that thereby great store of red and adust choler may be purchased; and this stirreth up to anger with the thought of many furious and violent actions; and so by consequent to warre: and from warre cometh victorie, from victorie proceedeth change of commonwealths, and translations of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, with change of Laws and Religion: for, <hi>Novus Rex, nova Lex; New Lords, new Laws.</hi> Unto which also may be added, that because great personages live more
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18622:60"/>
delicately then other men, and feed more daintily, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as many new fashions in their diets as in their clothes, for their boards as for their backs, that their bodies therefore are more subject to infection, and will take the poyson of an intemperate aire before more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate livers; whereupon necessity inforceth that they die sooner in such a calamitie then other people, as he once witnessed that said, <hi>Plures pereunt gulâ quàm gladio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides, the death of great ones is more remarkable then when inferiour persons die, so that if but some of them be taken away in common calamities, it is as if they were onely aymed at; because they are obvious to every ones eye, as cities standing upon hills, which cannot be hid.</p>
                        <p>And now that our bodies should follow the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">Our bodies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the temper of the aire: and our mindes do somewhat sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with the bodie.</note> of the Aire, is nothing doubted, seeing every lame, aking, or bruised joynt doth witnesse it even to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ignorant: But that our mindes and manners should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the temperature of the bodie, is more strange and wonderfull. Yet true it is that by the mediation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and spirits, as also through ill disposed organs, the minde also suffereth. For the bodie is <hi>Domicilium animae,</hi> the souls house, abode and stay: so that as a Torch (saith <note n="†" place="margin">Burton, in his Melancholy.</note> one) gives a better light, and a sweeter smell, according to the matter it is made of; in like manner doth our Soul perform all her actions, better or worse, as her organs are disposed: or as wine savours of the cask where it is kept, so the soul receives a tincture from the body, through which it works. For the Understanding is so tied to, and captivated by his inferiour senses, that without their help he cannot exercise his functions; and the Will being weakened so as she is, hath but a small power to restrain those outward parts, but suffers her self to be overruled by them: of which I shall have occasion to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18622:60"/>
speak more in the <note n="†" place="margin">Chap. 7. sect. 3 parag. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> art. 1.</note> fourth dayes work, untill when I leave it; in the mean time adding, that Comets do not alwayes, when they bring sicknesses, corrupt the aire through immoderate heat and drinesse, but sometimes also through immoderate heat and moisture; as also by immoderate windes which may bring the poyson of the Exhalation whereof the Comet consisted, unto some such place as lieth obvious unto it, and the like. Yea and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the raising of windes come often showers and rains, or else overflowings of banks upon high tides and other loftie waters, which are forced over upon the violence of the windes.</p>
                        <p>Astrologers say that Comets do most hurt either unto those places to which they are verticall, or unto those countreys which are subject to the signe wherein they are (for they maintain that such and such countreys are subject to such and such signes:) but omitting part of<note place="margin">How to guesse at the signification of Comets.</note> that, they also tell us (which stands with good reason) that in earthie drie signes they produce barrennesse by reason of drought; in waterish signes barrennesse also by reason of too much wet; in aierie signes extraordinary winde; in signes of a fierie triplicitie, extraordinary heat, warres, fires, drought, and the like; and in all of these (seeing their operation is extraordinary) some one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous and infectious sicknesse or other.</p>
                        <p>Besides, they also <note n="i" place="margin">Origan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap> de ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibus, pag. 526, ex Cardano.</note> tell us that if a Comet be in fashion like unto a sword, it then signifieth warres and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of cities, &amp;c. If it be <hi>stella crinita,</hi> or blazing round about, and of divers colours; then it signifieth winde, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, heresies, and the like: but if it be blackish, with a short tail, and no hairs; then it is a signe of barrennesse, together with long and continued warres.</p>
                        <p>But know now that although these and the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents be produced by Comets; yet if Comets should not be, the case would be farre worse for mankinde, and more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18622:61"/>
readily would eager death seize upon him. For if that which is the matter of Comets were not taken into one place, and drawn, so as it is, up into the aire; it would kill us by being dispersed about our dwellings: such being the nature of their poisonous Fumes, as they by experience know who have seen the danger of damps whilest they played the part of Pioners under ground.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore let me adde, that the end for which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets<note place="margin">The severall ends of Comets.</note> are, is threefold: for either they appeare for a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall end; for a Theologicall end; or for a Naturall end.</p>
                        <p>In respect of a Politicall end they are so to be taken<note place="margin">Politicall.</note> for the Heralds of future calamities, that men being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned may be forearmed, and provided either to shun the threatned disaster, or else to endure with patience the common and inevitable misery.</p>
                        <p>In respect of a Theologicall end, they are either a<note place="margin">Theologicall.</note> signe of calamities, or else the efficient cause of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If they be a signe, then their end is this, viz. that they may be monitours, instigatours, and admonishers to repentance; and to desire and expect either the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, or mitigation of those publick punishments. But if they be the efficient causes of miserie, then their Theologicall end is, that they are sent as the instruments of punishing some such enormous malice and contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of mankinde as would not be kept under or restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any humane law or discipline.</p>
                        <p>And lastly in respect of a Naturall end, it is that those<note place="margin">Naturall.</note> pestiferous windes, spirits, or breathings, which are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from metallique liquours and the like in the earth, should be taken up farre into the aire from the common seat of men, that thereby we may partake the lesse of their malice: for being burnt out and consumed there, they can lesse hurt us, then if they were below. If they should remain in the earth, they then (as they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do) would rend and shake it: or should they remain
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18622:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
below in the neare neighbouring aire, they would poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son us <note n="k" place="margin">Witnesse the great plague which was in Portugal Ann.

                        <p>
                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:18622:62"/>Or if this New starre were not attended with that particular accident, because the<note n="a" place="margin">Viz. on Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew day.

                        <p>But by what instruments the execution of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects should be performed, we cannot tell. Yet this I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily think may be said, that those late, blessed, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red proceedings of the prosperous and successefull GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> whose manifold and sudden conquests made him a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle to the astonished world, that those (I say) do point us to him above all men, as being the man appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to shew the first effects of that strange starre; and that it was to have an operation farre surpassing the saddest consequents of former threatning Comets.</p>
                        <p>To which purpose I finde, that learned <hi>Tycho</hi> hath added a kinde of propheticall conclusion to that book of his which he wrote concerning this New starre; wherein he declareth (according to his modest and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse rules of art, proceeding in them not like a doting heathenish starre-gazer) that the effects were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by <note n="c" place="margin">And therefore he could not then name any one in particular.</note> succeeding events: which as they shall not begin (saith he) untill some yeares after the apparition, so they shall continue for a long time afterward. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the effect, or some part of it, was to fall out

Which thing is also somewhat agreeable to <hi>Tycho</hi> his own meaning, where he telleth us (although he nameth no particular person) that those noble Heroes which shall happen to be born at the first rising of this starre, are ordained to be the authours and atchievers of such great mutations as should then be, when the men ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them came to be fit, and of ripe age to work them. Thus he; the difference between us being, that he apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to the birth of such eminent men as were to be born when the starre first appeared; and I to that time when (according to his conjectures) the operation of it first began: which, albeit he casteth it into the yeare 1592, must not be untill the yeare after, being the one and twentieth yeare from the starres first rising, and the very yeare of the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> conception: For he was born on the last day of November in the yeare 1594; being also (as hath been said, both terms included) the very one and twentieth yeare from the starres first va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing.</p>
                        <p>Neither doth the time of his birth fall out thus fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">The place point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens hath 62 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of North latitude.</note> but the place likewise, which was to be the ominous nest concerning the occasion, or bringing forth of one, for the authour or beginning of the intended alterations, is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18622:63"/>
pointed at by the heavens to be such a place as hath for its latitude about 62 degrees from the Equator north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for in that parallel the starre moved day by day, and was verticall once every day to <hi>Norvegia, Swedia, Finlandia, Livonia, Moscovia,</hi> and <hi>Tartaria,</hi> with all such places as lie under the same parallel.</p>
                        <p>Now though the starre in his daily motion was in this manner verticall to more places successively then to the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> dominions; yet at the time of the next new Moon (which <hi>Tycho</hi> maketh a rule concerning the place, from whence either the occasion, or authours of the great changes should proceed) it was just over the Meridian of <hi>Finland,</hi> being verticall to that countrey: And who but the foresaid GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS King of <hi>Sweden</hi> hath the countrey of <hi>Finland</hi> as a part of his dominions? For he is not onely King of the <hi>Sweds, Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> but also great Prince of <hi>Finland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tycho,</hi> I confesse, doth not directly name the countrey of <hi>Finland,</hi> but chose rather to expresse the place by callng it <hi>Moscovia,</hi> or <hi>Russia,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Finland:</hi> wherein I finde (according to the observations of a learned and great Divine) that he was something mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. For in a book lately set forth, and intituled <hi>The new starre of the North,</hi> the said Authour, having made some observations from <hi>Tycho's</hi> writings concerning that starre, and applied them unto these times, doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly prove that it ought rather to be <hi>Finland</hi> border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Russia,</hi> then <hi>Russia</hi> or <hi>Moscovia</hi> upon <hi>Finland:</hi> withall, amongst other reasons which should make <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> choose that place, rendring this for one, that perhaps he was loth to bring the prediction too neare home, seeing there often happened divers distastes and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels between his Soveraigne the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the neighbouring King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> Which, upon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18622:63"/>
this ground may the better be granted, viz. because <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> was once fain to hide his head for denoting in too di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect terms a prediction too neare his own home, although it afterwards proved true. But I referre you to the book, and proceed.</p>
                        <p>And now we shall see, that not onely the time of his birth and place pointed at by the heavens, but the chief time also when the starres influence should be most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, doth point at him. For <hi>Tycho</hi> witnesseth that about the yeare 1632 (if not also a few yeares after) the chiefest force and influence of this strange starre should shew it self, the greatest significations depending upon the Trigonall revolution and transmutation of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: which force and influence, why he referreth it to those times, I leave to the admired perfection of his art, wherein he was a kinde of Phenix, and scarce hath left his parallel. For will you heare King JAMES of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memorie, and our late learned Soveraigne speak for him? his commendations then will surely be no lesse. For in certain verses (as being able to judge both of him and his treatises) he approves his labours, and commends his skill as superexcellent. The like also he doth in an Epistle which he wrote unto him: some of which verses, as I finde them englished, are to this effect,</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Great <hi>Tycho's</hi> labours also do fore-show</l>

                        <p>Now then, if the chief effects shall demonstrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about the yeare 1632; questionlesse the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> must not be baulked in his late proceedings, but taken as a prime man upon whom the beams of this New star hath shined: for his great famous victories, and never enough admired conquests in <hi>Germanie</hi> (that <hi>Sedes belli</hi>) atchieved in so short a time, have witnessed as much.

Nay, when I heare himself speak to his souldiers, and those citizens where he conquered, I am confirmed. For speaking to the men of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> thus he saith; <hi>Truely God hath marvelously preserved you, as he hath also pleased to call me to this work. For I had rather thought that the last day of judgement should come, then that I should come into</hi> Norimberg, <hi>and (as you said your selves) leave so farre behinde me mine own dominions, good subjects, and what else there is loving and deare unto me; and to bring along with me so many brave worthies, to expose their lives (as I do mine own) for the restitution, safetie, and preservation of the common Evangelicall cause, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of</hi> Germanie. And again, to those of his Court before <hi>Ingolstadt,</hi> amongst other things, he addeth this; <hi>I know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the good successe which it hath pleased God to afford me in my enterprises, hath made some to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, who labour to perswade the simple that I endeavour nothing more then mine own gain, and the robbing and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others. But I call to witnesse in this case the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who were thus spoiled, which I have again established in their own right and estates; as also the creditours of whom I have borrowed such extraordinary summes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, both at</hi> Frankford <hi>and elsewhere, and the dangers which I do daily expose my self unto: I call all these to witnesse, whether I have left mine own kingdome, and the dearest I have in the world, to any other end, and with other intention, but onely to destroy the tyranny of the house of</hi> Austria, <hi>and to obtain a profound and setled peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These words of his shew nothing lesse then that he was extraordinarily set on work to undergo such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes as the eyes of all the world have bravely seen him struggle with: and God knows who shall end that which his coming into <hi>Germanie</hi> hath begun. It was his own saying, that if he himself should not survive so long
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18622:64"/>
as to bring to passe so great a work, that then in his stead some other might succeed and go on, untill a full point and period were put unto the warre. For upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his deliverance from a cannon shot, he utters these words; saying, that he was not onely mortall, but subject also unto the very same accidents that the poorest and meanest souldier is subject unto. <hi>It is a generall law,</hi> (<note n="l" place="margin">In a speech to his court at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But perhaps it may be thought that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the place above the Moon doth sufficiently denie the ascent of any terrene Exhalation so high; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too great a difference between the one and the other; between the matter ascending, and the matter of that place whither it ascendeth.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I may partly answer as before, in the 4. Chapter and 3. Section, that seeing the out-spread Firmament in the creation was taken from that masse of matter which lay here below, and separated from it rather then created of any newer matter, that therefore (I say) there cannot be so great a difference as to bring in such an Antipathie as will not at all suffer any terrene Exhalation to scale those <hi>flammantia moenia mundi,</hi> or battlements of heaven; but rather, that without relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancie, or any great striving, the one may admit of the other, and entertain it as a guest neare of kin unto it self, or unto the nature of that place where the continuing starres have ever had their residence.</p>
                           <p>For, if I urge it further, it may well be proved even by<note place="margin">From the earth to the highest Firmament is nothing but aire.</note> opticall demonstration, that the great vast space from the earth, as high as the fixed starres themselves, is not of a diverse nature from the Aire; for if it were, then there would be a multitude of Mediums between the sight and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18622:66"/>
the thing visible: but there is no multitude of Mediums: For where there is a multitude of Mediums, there the beams which come to the sight from the thing visible would beget a multiplicitie of refraction in the said raies or beams; but it is manifest that there is onely one refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction found in the beams of the starres, and that but onely when they are neare to the edge of the Horizon, at which time the ascending vapours are between our sight and them: And therefore there is but one kinde of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium by which the starres offer themselves to our sight: And being but one Medium, there cannot be such diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of natures between the heavens and things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the elements. Whereupon it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that an Exhalation may ascend into the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the starry heaven, and so by consequent have a mutuall concurrence with such matter as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens do naturally afford towards the generating of supralunary Comets, or new admired starres.</p>
                           <p>Indeed I must confesse that were I of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his opinion, I then would cry out with <hi>Auditus</hi> in the <note n="p" place="margin">Called <hi>Lingua.</hi>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18622:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there generated, hath there its place of residence, is for no other reason but because of an imagined attrition of the spheres and orbs: Which seeing they are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and that all is filled with Aire, the Elementarie fire is not hindred from ascending, but may have a more loftie station. For questionlesse, this kinde of fire, as<note place="margin">What place the Element of Fire possesseth.</note> it is not visible to the sight, so neither may it be thought any other thing then the more subtill, light, and hot part of the Aire; in which regard it must needs be both in and of that part, which is nearest to the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: For both the motion of the heavens is there most swift; and also, there is the greatest neighbourhood to that infinite number of starres fixed in the heavens.</p>
                           <p>An earthly Exhalation may therefore climbe above the Moon, and yet not runne through a fiery purgatory, or be consumed by the way.</p>
                           <p>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                              <hi>Lydiat</hi> our countreyman, his opinion is, that if we consider of this Element, not as it is absolutely pure, then the greatest part of it is in the starres (of which see more in the fourth dayes work) and some also is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, as being there a great cause of generating metals; occasioning the burning and breaking out of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sulfurous hills, and the like.</p>
                           <p>But of this enough. And in the consideration of it I have made way (you see) for the admittance of terrene Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to joyn their forces towards the effecting of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pralunarie Comets, or new and strange admired starres. This, I say, I have proved as a thing both possible, and not unlike. But that they do alwayes therefore thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, I am not certain; neither will I stand curiously to decide it.</p>
                           <p>Let therefore learned <hi>Tycho</hi> his tenent go for currant concerning <hi>Cassiopea's</hi> starre, that the heavens onely were the materiall parents of it, and especially the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xia,</hi> or white milkie way; unto the edge of which place
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18622:67"/>
(whilest it appeared) it was situated, and continued vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in the same, for the space of 19 moneths, or thereabouts.</p>
                           <p>And thus I conclude, adding herewithall concerning other Comets whose station hath been supralunarie, and time of continuance any thing long, that if in them there could be any right to challenge a portion out of the same storehouse, then questionlesse they were tyed to rest beholding both to the heavens, and also to the earth, for the matter of their composure. But for ordinary Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets the case must needs be otherwise, seeing their place and small continuing time confirm it.</p>
                           <p>These things for mine own part I think more probable then if I should affirm that the Planets afforded certain Exhalations, which by force of the Sunne are expired and exhaled from them, and being exhaled are made the matter of all kinde of Comets above the Moon; yea and New starres also (as some affirm) consist of no other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: wherein they dissent from <hi>Tycho,</hi> thinking (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him) that the <hi>Galaxia</hi> affords no matter toward the composure of these appearances. For (as <note n="r" place="margin">Lib. 3. Met. cap. 2. Art. 7.</note> 
                              <hi>Fromondus,</hi> a late writer, affirmeth) <hi>Simon Marius</hi> beheld a New starre in the yeare 1612, in <hi>Andromeda's</hi> girdle; and one <hi>Iustus Prygius</hi> beheld another in the constellation of <hi>Antoninous; Kepler,</hi> in the yeare 1602, saw one in the constellation of <hi>Pisces;</hi> and <hi>David Fabricius,</hi> in the yeare 1596, saw another in the <hi>Whale;</hi> all of them farre enough distant from the <hi>Galaxia</hi> or milkie way.</p>
                           <p>But suppose all this; must the continuing starres there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs be forced to waste their own bodies, and spend themselves in teeming such ample portions of matter as are required for glittering Comets, or New strange shining starres? Surely if they should suffer their bodies to be thus exhaled, they could not choose but fall into a deep consumption, and be visibly disproportioned
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18622:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in their shapes and figures, farre otherwise then we see them: For it is a long time since the world began, and no few Comets have had their seats above the Moon, where they all cry out against an opinion so improbable, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the changes would be such as would be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and visible enough to every vulgar eye.</p>
                           <p>Besides, it cannot but be granted, that for ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors every starre and Planet hath an exhaling vertue as well as the Sunne: why therefore should they now desist and leave it all to him, who, if he may have this libertie, will at the last suck them all to nothing? These men may well imagine (as they do) mountains in the Moon, with woods and groves, seas and rivers; and make every planet another world: but yet 'twere good they knew that God made all but one, althoûgh the parts be two; and that Adam being cast out of Paradise was sent to till the ground and labour the earth, which he sought, not with the man in the Moon; for he knew that that was not to bud forth with fruit, bear trees, and the like, because it had another office. For <hi>Let the earth</hi> (saith the Almightie) <hi>bring forth grasse, herb, fruit, trees,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but let there be lights in the Firmament, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Also, if the Sunne should work thus among the starres, and that there should be vapours exhaled from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, how comes it to passe that we perceive no clouds in the Ethereall vault, and that we cannot see them glide between starre and starre, flying upon the wings of such windes as must necessarily upon the admittance of this tenent be generated there? Perhaps they will answer that these things may be, and we not see them, by reason of the great distance between us and them. Well, be it so; yet know, that although we could not see them, we should sometimes feel them, and perceive our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earth to be watered with showers of rain, when we
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18622:68"/>
see nothing but a cleare skie over us. But it may be they again will answer, that the starres do not frequently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford such Vapours and Exhalations, but sometimes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and then if they be not copious enough to make such a cloud as may shine like a Comet or blazing starre, they are rather dispersed into nothing, then turned into rain: for their matter is too hot and drie to make a rainie cloud. In good time. The starres do not frequently afford such Exhalations; and why so I pray? surely the sunne is never so farre distant from some one Planet or other, but that he would make this his operation appeare, if he had at all any such working, or power of exhaling matter from them; and, if not a waterie, yet a drie cloud might be visible. The starres surely are of such a nature that they be rather fed and nourished by vapours, then compelled to suffer an unwilling wasting caused by an exhaling vertue, which is improperly given onely to the Sunne, because onely to him: and from whence these Vapours come, which upon all likelihood do continually nourish the starres, shall be shewed in the fourth dayes work.</p>
                           <p>Neither do some exempt the Sunne from these eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, but affirm that day and night he also expireth vapours from him: which others again denie, because they imagine that this publick lamp of the world ought to be more immortall, lest being extinct, he should be quite without light, and afford the world nothing but black and dismall darknesse.</p>
                           <p>That therefore which before I affirmed, joyning in part with <hi>Tycho,</hi> who fetcheth matter from the <hi>Galaxia,</hi> seems to me farre more probable concerning the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these appearances. For first, the <hi>Galaxia</hi> doth sensibly appeare as if it were an ample storehouse, and had large portions of matter, reserved onely for such purposes; which, when there is a working in nature apt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18622:69"/>
and convenient to produce it, is liberally afforded, and sent thither where the most power is to attract it. And secondly, that an earthie Exhalation may sometimes be admitted to joyn with the abovesaid matter, this seems to me a reason, because, like other low and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Meteors, these also shew themselves or first begin to shine in the Autumnall season, and not in the Spring, Summer, or Winter Quarter.</p>

For when an Exhalation which is more hot then ordinary, meets with cold and moist vapours in the middle Region of the aire, and are inclosed all together in an hollow cloud, it cannot but be that they fall at variance; and by this strife being driven together, the Exhalation is made stronger: and either by the motion, or by an <hi>Antiperista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> it is set on fire; which violently breaking the clouds whilest it seeks for libertie, gives an horrid sound. A si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude may be taken from a chest-nut, apple, or egge breaking in the fire; or from the cracking of moist wood, or any such like thing: for this is apparent, that when any inclosed hot winde is holden and withholden so as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18622:69"/>
it can have no vent, it will then seek it self a way by breaking the skin, shell, or case; and in the breaking, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is with violence, it must of necessitie make a noise. And thus it is in thunder.</p>
                        <p>But observe that in thunder the noise made is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of a like sound: for in respect of the hollownesse, thicknesse, or thinnesse of the cloud, and small or great force of the Exhalation, the sound is altered.</p>
                        <p>A great crack is caused when the cloud is very hollow,<note place="margin">Great cracks.</note> his sides thick, and the Exhalation very drie and copious: which if it break the cloud all at once, then it maketh a short and terrible crack, much like the sound of a gunne. If it rend the cloud all along, breaking out by leisure, then it makes a noise like to the rending of broad cloth, or the ratling of stones out of a cart.</p>
                        <p>A small crack is caused when either the cloud or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation<note place="margin">Small cracks.</note> is but weak; or the cloud strong, and the Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of some little quantitie. And in small thunders it sometimes falleth out that when the sides of the cloud are stronger then the force of the Exhalation is able to break, that then it runneth up and down within, and sticking against the cold and moist sides, maketh a noise much like to the quenching of an hot iron in cold water, or of a squib made of wet powder: in which regard <note n="r" place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 43.</note> 
                           <hi>Plinie</hi> seemeth to averre that thunder is but the quenching of fire in a wet cloud. Also if the Exhalation be meanly strong, and the cloud of unequall thicknesse, then it breaketh out at the thinnest places, and makes a kinde of buzzing noise like to a winde blowing out of narrow holes.</p>

                        <p>The first is caused thus; either when the cloud is so thin that it cannot keep in the Exhalation till it be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18622:70"/>
but suffereth it to go presently forth, making a noise like to the winde out of a pair of Smiths bellows: or else when the cloud is so thick, and the Exhalation so slender and thin, that although it stirre up and down within the cloud, yet it fireth not, but wastes it self within that prison, as not being able to get out. And thus may thunder be without lightning.</p>
                        <p>The second is caused, when either the Exhalation and<note place="margin">How there may be lightning without thunder.</note> Vapour are both thin, and the cloud also as thin: or else thus, namely when many thin, light, and hot Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by immoderate heat are drawn up from the earth, and by the absence of the sunne are destitute of that force by which they should be drawn up higher; yet somewhat ascending by their own nature, (in that they be light and hot) they meet with the cold, either of the night in the lowest Region, or else of the aire in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Region; and so by an <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> or resistance of contraries, they are beaten back, and with the force of their motion set on fire, as in summer nights and evenings we often see after an hot parching day.

                        <p>Another sort they call <hi>Coruscatio;</hi> which indeed is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the shining of the lightning; the shining or glittering of it rather then the lightning it self: for in this regard we can perceive a flashing when there be no clouds above our Horizon; or if there be clouds, we see the flashing when our backs are turned from them; or else we often perceive even through a thick cloud that it lightened, when the lightning came not so low, but onely issued out of a thinner cloud which was above that thicker one, and shined through it.</p>
                        <p>A third kinde is called <hi>Fulgur:</hi> and this is accompanied with thunder, caused by the strife and reluctation which the Exhalation maketh in the cloud, shewing it self in<note place="margin">Why we see the lightning before we heare the thunder.</note> the breaking of the said cloud: and although the crack

be heard long after we have seen the fire, yet they come together; the seeming difference being, because the quicknesse of our sight preventeth our hearing; which is so much the sooner done, either when the thunder is farre off and not neare unto us, or when the winde is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; which is also seen in the cleaving of wood, or any the like knocking: for let us be but in some sort distant from the partie making the noise or striking the blow, and we shall see the ax heaved up again before we heare the sound.</p>

shoots it out, and look whatsoever is in the way, it overthroweth, burneth and dasheth in pieces. Howbeit, when it striketh the earth, it is reported to go never above five foot deep.</p>
                        <p>All this is pertinent to that which is called <hi>Fulmen.</hi> But for that other, which is <hi>Fulgur,</hi> the case is farre otherwise. For in regard of the little plentie of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it never falleth to the ground, but is wasted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by the way.</p>

                           </note> viz. <hi>Terebrans, Discutiens,</hi> and <hi>Urens:</hi> or (as some call them) <hi>Scindentia, Infuscantia,</hi> and <hi>Urentia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The first is said not to burn, but rather to pierce,<note place="margin">The first kinde is drie of qualitie.</note> cleave, and extirpate such things as are obvious to it. For seeing it is more subtill and pure then grosse, as also won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous drie, and carrieth with it great plentie of spirits, winde, or breathings, it must needs produce strange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and passe through the pores of any thing be they never so small; striking through with such wonderfull swiftnesse, as that it cannot possibly hurt, but where it is resisted and hindered by the close composure of that matter against which it striketh. And hereupon it comes to passe that money is sometimes melted in the purse, &amp; the purse not hurt at all; the bones broke, and the skin sound: yea and sometimes the whole man burnt to ashes when his clothes are not consumed, with many the like strange accidents. And why it should cleave a wine vessell and the wine be so dull as not to runne out untill some 2 or 3 dayes after, this may be a reason; viz. in regard of the swift alteration and change, whereby also all the clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minesse of the wine is drawn to the outwardmost part, which keepeth in the wine as in a skin, not suffering it suddenly to disperse it self.</p>
                        <p>2. The second kinde burneth not to ashes, but blasteth<note place="margin">The second kinde is something moist.</note> or scorcheth, leaving the tincture of fire, and as it were
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18622:71"/>
of smoke behinde it; for the things which it striketh do use to look black, or of a footie colour, like unto a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys stock. And this is caused in regard that this kinde of lightning is farre more full of moisture then the other; and yet in a manner as subtill, swift and pure: otherwise it would not blast but burn.</p>
                        <p>3. The third kinde is <hi>Fulmen Urens;</hi> and this is <hi>magis</hi>

                           <hi>igneum quàm flammeum,</hi> more fiery then flamie; being of a grosse and earthy substance, having much slimie matter in it: which makes it therefore set such things on fire as are combustible, whensoever it meeteth with them.</p>
                        <p>And yet there are some things which (as <note n="*" place="margin">Plin. lib. 2. cap. 55.</note> it is said) the lightning hurteth not. As for example, The <note place="margin">The Poets therefore write that she carries Jupiters armour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> Eagle, Joves bird, is free. The laurell is not hurt: neither can the earth be wounded any more then 5 foot deep. Such places also as are covered with the skins of Seals, or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calves, are secure: wherefore of old time the tents of the Emperours were covered with them for their better safetie. <hi>Suetonius</hi> telleth us a storie of the Emperour <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi> how he was scared with Thunder; who, although he bragged and boasted of himself that he was a god, and threatned warre with <hi>Iupiter</hi> for a shower of rain that fell against his minde, was neverthelesse by and by so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with thunder and lightning, that he thereupon runnes and hides his head under a bed.</p>
                        <p>Moreover it is said, that if lightning kill one in his sleep, it openeth his eyes: if it kill one whilest he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it shutteth them. The reason being because it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him that sleepeth, and killeth him before he can shut his eyes again: and him that waketh it so amazeth, that winking he dieth before he can open those eyes of his which the sudden flash of the lightning caused him to close.</p>
                        <p>And know that it is not good to stand gazing upon the<note place="margin">Not wholesome to gaze on the lightning.</note> lightning at any time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when it doth no other hurt, if
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18622:72"/>
it be any thing neare us, it may dry up, or so waste the crystalline humour of the eyes that it perish the sight: or it may swell the face, making it to break out with scabbes or leprosie, caused by a kinde of poyson in the Exhalation which the pores of the face and eyes admit and receive. For this is certain that the matter of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, seeing it cometh from sulfurous and other poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous metallick substances, is much infected, and therefore hurteth where it entreth.</p>

                           <hi>Artic. 1.</hi> The <hi>Galaxia</hi> is no Meteor.</head>
                        <p>ANd thus have I done with all those kinde of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors which are fiery in very deed, whether pure or mixt.</p>
                        <p>Now it followeth that I speak of such as are fiery onely in appearance; not being such as they seem to be, but rather seeming more then they are.</p>
                        <p>Some account eight of them, and make the <hi>Galaxia</hi> or milkie way to be one. But that last may rather be left out: For although <hi>Aristotle</hi> would have the <hi>Galaxia</hi> to be a Meteor, yet his opinion is worthily misliked of most men, and that not without good reason.</p>
                        <p>For if it were a Meteor, and of the nature of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Exhalations are, it would be at the length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed like to other Meteors: but this circle never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth nor decreaseth; and therefore it is no sublunarie concretion attracted and formed out of the starres which are above it, and placed by their power in the highest part of the aire.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18622:72"/>
Moreover, if this his tenent were true, why hath it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued (the <hi>Galaxia</hi> I mean) in the same form, place, and magnitude alwayes from the beginning of the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till now? And besides, other starres might also attain to the like luminous concretion as well as those which he imagineth to be over it.</p>
                        <p>And moreover, this milkie way of <hi>Aristotle</hi> would admit of a Parallax, were it so as he perswadeth; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opticall consideration (saith noble <hi>Tycho</hi>) by the shining of the fixed starres through it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a strange refraction, differing farre from that which is occasioned by the vapours that are seen about the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon. For they seldome rise to the twentieth degree of altitude; whereas this, proceeding from the <hi>Via lactea,</hi> would reach to the greatest height.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore we may say that it is rather of the nature<note place="margin">What the <hi>Galaxia</hi> is.</note> of the heaven, or a certain heavenly substance, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thicker then the other parts of heaven: or (if you will) much like to the matter of the starres, or to the substance of the moon; but diffused and spread abroad, and not conglobated into one bodie as the starres are. For although all be filled with aire from the earth to the fixed starres, yet there the matter may begin to be more thick, firm, and solid; and so the waters above the heavens are the better upheld.</p>
                        <p>For conclusion therefore, not reckoning this amongst any of these Meteors fierie onely in appearance, I may account them in number seven.</p>

                        <p>ANd particularly for the appearance of colour in the clouds, it ariseth not from the mixture of the foure qualities, as it doth in bodies perfectly mixt, as herbs, stones, &amp;c. but onely from the falling of light upon sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or darknesse; the light being in stead of white, and the shadow or darknesse in stead of black. Not that they are alwayes perfectly white and black; for they differ according to the qualitie and composure of the cloud: wherefore some be very white, and that is when the vapour whereof the cloud consisteth is very subtil and thin; some yellowish, when the vapour is thicker; some ruddie and duskish, when it is meanly thick; some black, when it is very thick; and some greenish, when it is more waterie then ordinary, being best discerned when it is farre from the Zenith, and obvious by an oblique aspect.</p>
                        <p>The red and ruddie colours are seen onely in the<note place="margin">Why red clouds are seen onely in the morning and evening.</note> morning and evening, when the light of the sunne is not in his full force; for at other times his light is too vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cleare, strong and piercing. And by a diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of these colours, I think a man may as easily judge of fair or foul weather and the like, as a physician may of the temperature of the bodie by inspection of the urine. But of colours you may see more <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. Parag. 6. Artic. 1.</note> afterwards.</p>

                        <p>ANd now concerning many Sunnes; they are called <hi>Parahelii,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">

should say, <hi>apud solem:</hi> because they are as it were with the sunne in place, as also not absent from him in splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and fashion.</p>
                        <p>Their generation is after this manner; viz. when a smooth waterie cloud which is of equall thicknesse, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and still, is placed on the side of the sunne: not under the sunne, for then there would be a circle; nor opposite to the sunne, for then there would be the appearance of a Rain-bow: but on the side; which must not be too farre off, nor yet too neare: for if it be too farre off, then reason telleth us that the beams will be too weak to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect in a convenient manner: or if it be too neare, then the sunne will disperse it without any image at all.</p>
                        <p>Now if such a cloud as this we speak of shall happen to be on both sides of the sunne, then the appearance will be as if there were three sunnes; whereas there is indeed but one: the other two being the images of the true Sunne, seen onely by reflection or refraction upon the cloud on either side. Or be there more pieces of such a cloud then one, set at a convenient distance; then there may be many sunnes: even as in a broken looking-glasse, every part will shew the shadow of that face which is obvious to it.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, these many sunnes may be said to have a<note place="margin">What is signified by many sunnes.</note> double signification; the one naturall, the other superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</p>
                        <p>According to their naturall signification, they beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rain and moist weather; because they cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare but in a moist disposition of the aire.</p>
                        <p>And as for their supernaturall signification, experience hath witnessed, that they have appeared as the porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of change in states and kingdomes; or as the foreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods wrath upon sinners. For this is a rule, that<note place="margin">A rule and in observation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning strange sights.</note> such things as are strange may be derived both from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall causes, and also include God the chief and best

cause of all things; by whose admired providence each thing is ordered, &amp; by whose unspeakable wisdome each particular change hath been decreed: yea even in the course of nature (before ever nature was) he both fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw and appointed how things should happen; although in respect of our weaknesse and want of skill, the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them out be too abstruse and hard. For as I verily beleeve, that not so much as one poore sparrow falleth to the ground without Gods providence; so I do also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that by his providence likewise he bringeth to passe these and the like things, for such ends, as he in his secret counsell hath determined; using his creatures (whose courses in each particular he both set and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw) as instruments and means to effect them.</p>
                        <p>But I proceed. And as for the supernaturall significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these sunnes, experience (I say) hath witnessed that some strange thing or other usually followeth after them. As not long before the contention of <hi>Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> for the Empire of Rome, there appeared three sunnes, as it were pointing out the strife which followed soon after between them three <note n="a" place="margin">Fulks Meteors.</note> for the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall diadem.</p>
                        <p>Also in the yeare <note n="b" place="margin">Stows Abridg. of chron.</note> 1233, upon the 7 day of April, foure sunnes were seen besides the naturall sunne: in which yeare (as <hi>Lanquets</hi> chronicle testifieth) there was great debate kindled, and much variance stirred up between <hi>Henry</hi> the third, K. of <hi>England,</hi> and the Lords of his kingdome: and in the very <note n="c" place="margin">Stow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ibid.</note> next yeare, <hi>England</hi> was wasted with fire and sword from <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi> which said town was also burned: and at the same time was a great drought and pestilence.</p>
                        <p>Also in the yeare <note n="d" place="margin">Idem.</note> 1460, three sunnes again shewed forth their orient faces, which was but the day before the three Earls, viz. <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Wilt-shire,</hi> fought their

great battels in <hi>Wales</hi> at <hi>Mortimers</hi> crosse (as <hi>Stow</hi> in his Abridgement affirmeth;) where the Earl of <hi>March</hi> put the other two to flight, and slew many of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And again, in the yeare 1526, towards the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the second, King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> 
                           <note n="e" place="margin">Fulks Meteors.</note> three sunnes marched out, <note n="f" place="margin">In the yeare 1619 were 3 also seen at <hi>Lovan</hi> in the moneth of May, at the rising of the Sunne. <hi>Fromond.

                        <p>And now after the consideration of many Sunnes, it followeth that I speak of many Moons, of which it is no hard matter to know the naturall cause, seeing their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is, as before hath been shewed concerning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sunnes.</p>

                           <hi>Artic. 6.</hi> Of the Rain-bow.</head>
                        <p>THe Rain-bow is to be spoken of next: And this is nothing else but the apparition of certain colours in an hollow, watery, distilling, or dropping cloud direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposite to the Sunne, representing in its fashion half a circle.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:18622:76"/>Or thus; It is a bow of many colours, appearing in a dewie, dark, droppie, and hollow cloud, by reflection of the Sunne-beams opposite to it. For this is certain, that lightsome or luminous bodies do cause images, colours, or appearances upon slender, clean, and thin objects: Now of all bodies the Sunne is most lightsome; but the aire and water are clean, thin, and slender.</p>
                        <p>Here then it appeareth that the Efficient cause of the<note place="margin">The efficient cause of the Rain-bow.</note> Rain-bow is the light or beams of the Sunne; which fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into fit, apt, or convenient matter, opposite to them, are refracted and reflected to our sight.</p>
                        <p>The Materiall cause is not water in act, nor yet<note place="margin">The materiall cause.</note> thick aire, but a dewie vapour; which is not <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuus, sed potiùs corpusculis guttularum discretus;</hi> not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of one bodie, but rather severed into many bodies, or little drops.<note place="margin">The formall cause.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Form of it is to be gathered out of the Figure and Colours.</p>
                        <p>And for the Figure, we see it is circular: But yet it never representeth to us any more then a Semicircle; and not alwayes so great an arch: The reason of which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the centre or middle point of the Rain-bow, which is diametrally opposite to the centre of the Sunne, is alwayes either in the Horizon, or under it: So that seeing our sight of the heavens is cut off by the earth in such a manner as that we can never see above half of them, it must needs be, that the appearance of this circle be either more or lesse to us, according to the Sunnes great or little distance from the Horizon.<note place="margin">The colours in the Rain-bow.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as for the colours, they are commonly accounted three, viz. Ruddie, Green, and Azure. To which some adde a fourth. The first is in the thickest and darkest part of the cloud: For where a bright shining falleth upon a darkish place, there it representeth a ruddie colour, being somewhat like a Flame. The second is caused by a more

weak inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>action, being in a remoter and more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie part of the cloud: whereupon it looketh greenish.</p>
                        <p>The third, which is further into the cloud, proceeds from the weakest infraction, and is therefore of a more dark and obscure colour, tending to a blew or an azure hue. And sometimes a fourth colour is also perceived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very like a yellow or orenge-tawnie, proceeding from a commixture of the red and green, according to <hi>Aristotles</hi> judgement: of which the learned may see <hi>Iul. Scaliger, exer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>Now these colours in some rain-bows are more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or apparent, in others more remisse or obscure; which is according to the aptnesse of the cloud, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And in rain-bows caused by the moon (for sometimes,<note place="margin">Moon-bows.</note> though seldome, they have been seen in the night) the colours are weaker, whiter, and lesse conspicuous; being in a manner as white as milk: which is, because the moon having a borrowed light, is nothing so strong in the projecting her raies, but farre more feeble then the sunne.</p>
                        <p>But come to the finall cause, and you will finde it two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold;<note place="margin">The finall cause.</note> partly Naturall, partly Supernaturall.</p>
                        <p>As it is Naturall, we take it either as a signe of rain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot appeare but in a waterie cloud, which is so prepared that it is ready to fall in very drops: or as a<note place="margin">How to judge of the weather by the rain-bow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> signe of fair weather; namely then when the beams of the sunne are strong, and the heat of it so great that the moisture of the cloud is dried up, and the drops attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into thin aire. All which may be discerned after this manner, viz. when the colours grow either darker and darker, or clearer and clearer. For if the colours appeare dark, thick, or obscure by little and little, till at the last they bury themselves in a black cloud, then rain follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But if the colours by degrees grow clearer and clearer till at the last they vanish away, then we may
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18622:77"/>
expect fair and bright weather. And this as it is a naturall signe.</p>
                        <p>But now as it is Supernaturall: and then we behold it as a signe or symbole of Gods mercie towards the world, betokening that it shall never be destroyed again through any Deluge or universall Floud. For <hi>it shall be a signe of the covenant</hi> (saith God) <hi>between me and the earth,</hi> viz. <hi>that there shall be no more a Floud of waters to destroy the earth,</hi> Gen. 9.<note place="margin">The derivation of Iris, signifying the rain-bow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           </gap>, <hi>dico;</hi> First, because this bow publisheth or telleth to us the constitution of the aire. Secondly, because it declareth the covenant of God made with the world after the Floud; shewing that his wrath is so farre forth appeased, that he will never drown the world again; which appeareth even in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der observed in placing the bow: for we see it with the bended ends downwards, and as one that holdeth a bow in peace; insomuch that had it a shaft in it, the earth should not be shot; neither ought man to fear that the Lord will shoot any more such arrows of displeasure as before.</p>
                        <p>Some have thought that there was no rain-bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Floud, but that it appeared since; because God saith, <hi>When I make the heaven thick with clouds, I will put my bow in the clouds,</hi> Gen. 9.</p>
                        <p>To which it may be answered, that God saith, not<note place="margin">The rainbow was before the Floud.</note> that he will of new create a bow, but that he will then put it into the clouds so as it never was before; namely to be a signe, &amp;c. So that although it were not as a signe of any covenant before the Floud, yet without doubt it was as a Meteor then as well as now; and therefore was: otherwise we might deny both bread, and wine, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18622:77"/>
water to be before the institution of the Sacraments: for it is the same reason. Wherefore, as there was water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever it was used for the water of regeneration in the Sacrament of Baptisme; and as there was bread and wine before ever they were used as signes at the holy Communion: so also the rain-bow was before ever it had that office to be a signe of Gods covenant between him and mankinde, just as at this day it appeareth even to such as are not of the Church; very Heathens and Pagans beholding it as well as we.</p>
                        <p>Besides, there were from the beginning the same cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in nature to produce it: for there wanted neither a sunne to draw vapours from waterie places, nor yet a convenient place in the aire to thicken them into clouds; neither was the sunne destitute of sparkling raies to make reflexion and infraction: but as it is caused now, so also then; and to think otherwise were to think amisse.</p>
                        <p>Some again have been perswaded that this bow was before, but was not in a cloud before. And thus thought certain amongst the Hebrews.</p>
                        <p>But this is a reasonlesse assertion, and against all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie, and not at all approved by Divinitie. For how could that appeare in a cleare aire, which can have no existence or being, but in a dewing or distilling cloud? Verily of both absurdities the former was the better, namely that it was not at all: and yet that also wanted grounds to uphold it, as hath been shewed, and is yet further manifest. For seeing the Lord God in six dayes finished the creation, and set the perfect order of all his creatures; it followeth that the rain-bow had then his place either in being or in power. And thus from two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities<note place="margin">A grosse absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of some who think that there shall be no rain nor rain-bow 40 yeares before the worlds end.</note> I bring you to a third. For further more, it hath been the opinion of some idle doting brains to think that there shall be no rain, nor rain-bow, 40 yeares before

the end or destruction of the world by fire; because the very aire (say they) must be prepared a long time before by a continuall drinesse, and each thing made fit for combustion.</p>
                        <p>Which surely is a brain-sick fancie. For what do they in this but shew their extream follie; derogating, not onely from reason, but also from the power of God? For is not God able to destroy the work of his own hands without such a supposed preparation, and make the world combustible in an instant, if need be? Or should there be no rain, and consequently no bow (because it appeareth in a waterie cloud) then how should the fruits of the earth be preserved? Great famine and miserie must needs follow in the world if this be true. For when the clouds drop no fatnesse, then the ground pines away through barrennesse; and when the heavens are iron, then the earth is brasse: whereas it is manifest, that at the coming of Christ there shall be pleasant and fruitfull times; times full of mirth, wherein they shall eat and drink, marrie and be given in marriage, even as it was in the dayes of Noah. Who therefore will think that these men are in their right mindes, whilest they affirm that no rain shall fall by the space of 40 yeares before the world endeth?</p>
                        <p>The Jews as soon as they behold this bow (not daring<note place="margin">What the Jews do at the sight of the rain-bow.</note> to gaze upon it) do presently go forth and confesse their sinnes, acknowledging that they are worthy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed with a Floud as the old world was; and in being spared they celebrate the mercie and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>There is also another thing observable concerning this bow which I may not forget; namely this, The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie which (according to some mens fancies) is involved in the colours.

                        <p>I Begin therefore with clouds. And a cloud is a vapour or Exhalation cold and moist, drawn from the earth out of wet or watery places, by heat of the Sunne, into the middle Region of the aire; where by cold it is so thickened and knit together, that it hangeth, untill either <note n="a" place="margin">It is said that clouds have sometimes fallen down to the earth with great noise, to the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They may also fall by drops through their own weight.</note> the own weight, or some resolution, causeth it to fall. If it be a great cloud, it is <hi>Nubes;</hi> if it be but a little one, it is called <hi>Nubecula.</hi> The name comes <hi>ab obnubendo, id est, operiendo coelum,</hi> from hiding or covering the heavens: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a cloud (through the thicknesse that the vapour is condensed into) hindereth, that a lesse portion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens is conspicuous, then otherwise would be.</p>
                        <p>It is also two-fold; either fertill, or barren.</p>
                        <p>A fertill or fruitfull cloud affordeth rain: but a barren cloud doth not; because it is at length by the blasts of winde, and vertue of the heavenly bodies, turned into thin aire.</p>
                        <p>And to either of these clouds belong motion &amp; colour.</p>
                        <p>Their motion is caused by the winde most commonly, through whose force they are driven to and fro: But if the windes blow not, then they are drawn along by the Sun, and made a companion with him in his travels, alwayes moving that way which the Sunne goeth.</p>
                        <p>Concerning their colours I spake before in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi> 5. <hi>Article</hi> 2. And therefore here you may expect the lesse: yet let me say that they are either simple or mixt.</p>
                        <p>Black or white are simple; because they consist of no other colours. But red, green, and the rest, are mixt.</p>

at all why any certain height should be determined: for they are of unequall heights, differing both according to the matter of their composure, and also according to the time of the yeare; being lower in winter then in summer: for when the sunne hath the greatest force they then ascend the higher; and in his smaller force they hang the lower.

                           <p>FRom clouds I proceed to speak of rain. And rain is nothing else but as it were the melting of a cloud turned into water. Or, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> it is the flux of a fertill cloud resolved by the heat of the sunne into distilling drops of water, which being depressed with their own weight, fall down to the earth. For when the matter of the cloud, being a cold vapour, and earthly humour, is drawn from the earth and waters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middle Region of the aire, and there thickened through the cold, dwelling in the confines of that place, it is at the last dissolved, and cannot therefore but fall down in drops: which drops, if they be great, are caused,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18622:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either by the quick resolution of the cloud, or else by the little distance of it from the earth. But if they be small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then either the <note n="a" place="margin">This may be seen if any will but assay to poure water from an high place.</note> great distance or slow resolution ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them of no ample quantitie.</p>
                           <p>The first of these is named <hi>nimbus;</hi> the other is called <hi>imber.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And note that the dissolution (as hath been said) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of heat; which is not onely of the sunne, but of windes also of an hot temper: as is seen in the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern winde, which bloweth up rain sooner then any other winde. And as for rains which come from cold coasts, and at cold times of the yeare, if the cloud be not at such times (as some may think) dissolved through the heat of any winde, it dissolveth it self through its own weight, (being a little holpen by the sunne) for it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in the aire even whilest it can stay no longer. And at these times also, if we consider all aright, we shall finde that the winde somewhat helpeth, although not so speedily as from hotter coasts: for naturally there is a kinde of heat in every winde, (because it is an Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hot and drie) although by accident (as from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the place over which it passeth) it may be altered: of which I shall speak more afterwards. And besides all this, the secret influence of the Planets worketh greatly towards the dissolution of the foresaid vapours.</p>
                           <p>But I proceed. And now it followeth that I divide all sorts of rain into two kindes: First, such as are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;<note place="margin">Ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary rains.</note> secondly, such as be extraordinary.</p>
                           <p>I call those ordinary when nothing but water falleth. And I call those extraordinary which others call prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious rains: as when worms, frogs, fish, wheat, milk,<note place="margin">Prodigious rain.</note> flesh, bloud, wooll, stones, iron, earth, &amp;c. fall from the clouds. <hi>Plinie</hi> makes mention of many such prodigies as these, in the 56 chapter of his second book; setting down the times when they happened.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="147" facs="tcp:18622:81"/>Concerning all which, next under God (the causer of the causes causing them) these or the like reasons may be urged to shew how it is possible they should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and upon what causes they naturally depend.</p>
                           <p>1. And first for the raining of worms; it may be thought<note place="margin">Worms.</note> that the putrefaction of some dead carcasses or other hath been drawn up into the aire as fumes and vapours are, where it breedeth such worms as use to breed out of the like matter here below.</p>
                           <p>2. The like may be said of frogs, when the vapour is<note place="margin">Frogs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </note> exhaled out of marish grounds at such times as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender.</p>
                           <p>3. So also of fishes; excepting that (as is supposed) the<note place="margin">Fishes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </note> force of windes may suddenly sweep away little frey out of ponds upon montanous places: and so also little young frogs, with many the like things, may be taken up. Some write of a whole calf falling from the clouds; and have been thereupon perswaded that it is possible, of Vapours and Exhalations, with the power of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bodies concurring, a calf may be made in the aire. But this is idle. It was therefore (as others write) taken up in some storm of whirl winde, and so let fall again.</p>
                           <p>4. As for wheat and other grain, it hath been observed<note place="margin">Wheat.</note> that their raining down hath often come in case of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, to the great preservation and refreshment of the distressed: in which regard it may be supposed that it was an immediate work of God, wrought without the rule of nature: so, that were all the wits in the world prest into one, yet were they all too weak to shew a true cause of such a prodigie. Which made <hi>Du Bartas</hi> write concerning such;</p>
                           <q>
                              <l>Let them declare what cause could yerst beget</l>
                              <l>Amid the aire those drizzling showres of wheat,</l>
                              <l>Which in <hi>Carinthia</hi> twice were seen to shed;</l>
                              <l>Whereof that people made them store of bread.</l>

                           <p>To speak therefore as I think, I will not boldly affirm how this was caused, but onely touch at the possibilitie of it; namely, that it might be effected like unto other strange rains, first drawn from the earth into the aire, and then sent down again. For (as I have <note n="b" place="margin">Paragraph <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                    <desc>•…</desc>
                                 </gap>. art. 3. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</note> already said) in shewing probable reasons for such things as are strange, we do also include God the chief and best cause of all things. And so also we reade, that when the Red sea was bayed up with a double wall, to give the children of Israel safe and free passage through it, God sent a strong East-winde all that night, &amp;c. by which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were divided. Exod. 14. 21. And again, when the Quails came and filled their tents, being as it were rained round about them; they were brought from the sea with a winde, and let fall a dayes journey on this side, and a dayes journey on that side, even round about their camp. Numb. 11. 31.</p>
                           <p>He that hath seen (saith <note n="c" place="margin">Fulk, in his Meteors.</note> one) an egge-shell full of dew drawn up by the sunne into the aire, in a May morning, will not think it incredible, that wheat and other grain should be drawn up in much hotter coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys then ours is, much rather the meal or flower which is lighter.</p>
                           <p>5. By the like reason also it sometimes raineth milk:<note place="margin">Milk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </note> for when the <hi>intensissimus solis calor,</hi> the vehement heat of the sunne, shall either draw milk from the udders <note n="*" place="margin">Which may the sooner be done in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in hot countreys.</note> of cattell, and shall mix it with the other parts of the cloud; or shall so throughly trie, purifie, digest or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct the vapour, that it may look something white, then will the drops look as if it rained milk.</p>
                           <p>6. As for the raining of flesh, it is supposed to be after<note place="margin">Flesh.</note> this manner, namely through the drawing up of bloud from places where much bloud hath been shed, which being clottered together seemeth as if it were flesh.</p>
                           <p>7. And so also it may rain bloud; namely when it is<note place="margin">Bloud.</note>
                              <pb n="149" facs="tcp:18622:82"/>
not clottered together, but thinner, &amp;c. In the yeare of Christ 480 was such a rain. As also in the yeare 864, neare unto <hi>Brixia</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> was the like. Yea and before either of these times, our own <note n="d" place="margin">Lanquet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <div type="subdivision">
                              <p>But, say some, there is often great store of bloud spilt,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and yet no prodigie appeareth.</p>
                              <p>To which is answered, that it is not the ordinarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling<note place="margin">Answ.</note> vertue which resteth in the starres and Planets that can draw up such bloudy vapours, although much bloud be spilt; but then onely when there is a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall concurrence of causes: for sometimes they are disposed to one thing, sometimes to another. And for the working of any strange thing, it must be when there is a strange kinde of combination amongst them. To which purpose we know (although we cannot alwayes directly see and demonstrate how they are mixed and combined) that they principally intend and cause at the same time other changes, of which the visible prodigie is but the proclaimer or fore-runner: as, if you look but a little before concerning Comets, you may see, and so rest satisfied.</p>
                              <p>And unto this also adde, that there may be drops like unto bloud, and yet no bloud drawn up: And this may be, either when the Sunne draweth vapours out of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified watery places, in which (as I have often seen) in a drought resteth much slimie and red-coloured corrupted water; or else when the Sunnes immensive heat doth so boyl the water in the cloud, that like unto the urine which a man maketh in a burning fever, it looketh red when it falleth. The like cause I gave before unto the water of a white colour: but know that it must then
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18622:83"/>
be of another qualitie, the matter of the vapour I mean: for there are some kinde of waters, as is well known, which being boyled turn to white salt, &amp;c. And as for a red colour, the ordinarie rain sheweth that it is possible: for we see that ordinary rain-water looketh alwayes more brown then spring or river-water, being as if a more powerfull operation would turn it into red.</p>

                           <p>8. The raining of wooll or hair, is when a certain<note place="margin">Wooll.</note> mossinesse like wooll, such as is upon quinces, willows, and other young fruits and trees, is drawn up by the Sunne among Vapours and Exhalations, which being clottered together falleth down like locks of wooll, or hair.</p>
                           <p>9. Concerning stones, they proceed from earthly<note place="margin">Stones.</note> matter gathered into the clouds, as before was shewed concerning the Thunder-stone, &amp;c.</p>

                           <p>10.

Eccles. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 39</note> clothes of the Jews, when in the dayes of the Apostata <hi>Iulian</hi> they went about to restore their citie and temple. For when the said <hi>Iulian</hi> raged with impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and devilish fury against the Christians, he gave the Jews licence to build their temple, that they might restore again their ancient sacrifices, and the like things that they longed for: at which time <hi>Cyril</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and he (to animate the Christians) shewed that it was impossible for the Jews to finish that work which they had begun: alledging the prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel in his ninth chap. at the 27 verse; and also that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour in the 24 of Matthew: by both which places it did appeare, that <hi>their house was left unto them desolate,</hi> and that <hi>there must not be one stone upon another;</hi> but that <hi>their desolations must be perpetuall.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus it happened to the Jews. But this surely was a thing altogether miraculous. For their red crosses came not alone, but were accompanied with other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies. As first of all an Earth-quake, which overthrew and tumbled down their building which they had raised upon the old foundation. Then came forth a fire which consumed all their engines and instruments. And last of all fell these drops, imprinting upon their clothes, crosses with so deep a stain, as they were not able to wash them out: And both the <note n="f" place="margin">Theod. <hi>Histor.

                              </note> same night, and night after, was also a bright signe of the crosse seen int he skie, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his Ecclesiasticall historie reporteth: adding herewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that when the Jews saw this, they fled and returned home, being perplexed through fear of a divine scourge; confessing that he, whom their forefathers had nailed to a crosse, was God indeed.</p>
                           <p>This was both the prodigie, and the issue of it: of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18622:84"/>
which, being so plainly miraculous, I know not what to say.</p>
                           <p>But I finde that other times have in a manner afforded<note place="margin">Reasons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Red crosses at other times.</note> the like. Wherefore (although I speak nothing at all of these at this time thus miraculous) concerning them some reasons may be given.</p>
                           <p>And not to go farre, <hi>Magirus,</hi> in the <note n="g" place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 6.</note> Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Physicks, telleth us, that in <hi>Suevia</hi> a Province in <hi>Germanie,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord <note n="*" place="margin">So also in West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia, <hi>ann.</hi> 1543. at Lovane, 1568. <hi>ipso Pentecostes die.</hi> And in the yeare 1571 <hi>in duione Embdensi, in Frisus Orientalibus.</hi> See Fromond.

Which impression (as he alledgeth out of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> his sixteenth book <hi>De subtilitate</hi>) might be procured thus; viz. because a certain kinde of extraordinarie dry dust sticked to those garments; which, by the piercing or through-washing drops falling upon it, was so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously divided into parts, that there seemed a figure as of a crosse. Or thus, because the woven threads in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had such a form. Or else (which is most probable) because the humour in the middle part lay on high, whereas the sides were but thin, and fashioned according to the dashing of the drop. For when a drop falleth upon any thing with a kinde of force, we see that most of the humour resteth in the midst, whilest certain sparkling raies are dashed about the sides: And thus he thinketh it might be then, in the fall of those staining drops; which why they stain, hath relation to that which I said before concerning the raining of bloud.</p>
                           <p>I will therefore now conclude; adding in the last<note place="margin">The devil many times worketh in the Aire.</note> place, that the devil, by Gods permission, both often hath and also doth produce many such prodigies as these that I have spoken of, with sundry other like unto them; especially amongst the <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 78. 49.</note> Heathen, Pagan, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious nations.

Secondly, God created him a good Angel; and although, like man, he lost much by his fall, yet thirdly by his long observations, and continuall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he hath as it were made up the breach, or want of his created knowledge, by acquired skill: and therefore, when he hath <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 8. 31.

                           </p>
                           <p>Wherefore (as I said) I do not doubt, but that many such as the former strange prodigies, especially long ago in heathen times, and amongst heathen people, were procured by his power.

                           <p>Besides, it is apparent that in the little world, I mean when parties are possessed, the devil can cause them to vomit strange things out of their mouthes and stomacks; as crooked pins, iron, coals, nails, brimstone, needles, lead, wax, hair, straw, live eels, and the like; of which many have been eye-witnesses, confirming the same for truth.

                        <p>DEw offers it self in the next place, as being a neare kinsman to rain. For it consisteth of a cold moist vapour which the sunne draweth into the aire: from whence, when it is somewhat thickened and condensed through cold of the night, and also of the place whither the sunne exhaled it, it falleth down in very small and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discernible drops, to the great refreshment of the earth.</p>
                        <p>And this is certain, that the morning and the evening are the onely times when it falleth; the reason being in<note place="margin">Why dew is but in the morning, and at evening.</note> regard of the sunne, which both positively &amp; privative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly causeth it. Dew at night is caused privatively; dew in the morning, positively. At night or in the evening pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively, because when the sunne setteth, the lowest part of the vapour, not being high enough to hang in the aire, falleth down through absence of the sunne. And in the morning positively, because at the return of the sunne the residue of the vapour, together with the augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it (haply by some condensed aire caused by cold of the night) is dissolved by his approaching beams, and so made fit to fall, rather then hang any longer. For look what vapours are about the Horizon at the rising of the sunne, are dispersed by his first approach; and so it comes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18622:85"/>
to passe that the morning as well as the evening afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth dew. But know that if the vapour be not convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Why no dew is a signe of rain.</note> placed, that is, if it be very high above the Horizon, or in a loftie station of the aire, then the sunnes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching beam neither dissolveth nor disperseth it; whereupon we have no dew, but rather look for rain, because the matter of dew is still in the aire, staying there till it be turned into a cloud, and so into rain.</p>
                        <p>And now by this you may see what is the materiall, what the efficient, what the formall, and lastly what the finall cause of dew.</p>
                        <p>The materiall cause is a subtil and moist vapour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thinnest of all vapours.</p>
                        <p>The efficient cause is the temperate cold of the night, together with the absence and approach of the sunne.</p>
                        <p>The formall cause is the sprinkling of most thin drops, which the hand can scarcely perceive.</p>
                        <p>And the finall cause, that (without rain) the earth may have some refreshment.</p>

                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth the like, shewing among other things, that both in respect of matter, and place of generation, they do well agree; to which is also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent the calmnesse, clearnesse, and quietnesse of the time wherein either of them falleth. For both of them consist of subtill thin vapours, and are generated in the lowest region of the aire, because upon some high hills there is neither hoar-frost nor dew to be seen; the vapour (as it seemeth) ascendeth not so high: And as for a windie obscure time, it is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to them both. The difference being, that hoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frost is congealed in the vapour before it can be turned into water: The one caused in a season that is temperately warm; the other when it is cold. The materiall cause therefore of hoar-frost is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thinne vapour. The formall, is the congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18622:88"/>
of it; by which it differeth from dew. The efficient is the autumnall or winter cold: for those are the most common and ordinary times peculiar to it, although sometimes it comes as an unwelcome guest in the spring and summer, when the aire through cold is forward to send it. And last of all the end, or principall effects (when it cometh not out of season) or the finall cause, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or shutting up of the pores or breathing holes of the earth, and about the roots of plants; that thereby their spirits, being the chariots of heat, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their own bowels for the good of such things as they give life unto.

                        <p>THere is no great difference between the matter of snow, and matter of rain and hail; excepting (as some think) that the vapour for snow is of an hotter qualitie then the vapour for rain, and yet not so hot as that which is the materiall cause of hail. For it is a tenent amongst Philosophers, that hot things being cooled are<note place="margin">Hot things cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are soonest congealed.</note> apter for congelation then cold: as is seen in warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taken from the fire, which will more suddenly and throughly be frozen then that which never felt the heat. And this comes to passe in regard of the pores or passages made into the water through heat: into which the cold entring, it both cooleth it the sooner, and congealeth it the more.</p>
                        <p>Neither is there any difference between white frost and snow; excepting that frost is made of a vapour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Arist.

For, say some, <note n="b" place="margin">Havenreut. com. In Arist. de Met. lib. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>Nix est spuma quaedam, Snow is a kinde of froth:</hi> and when it loseth part of its frothie nature, and begins to melt; it loseth also part of that whitenesse which at the first it retained. To this also may be added the coldnesse that is infused into it when it is congealed, as being a cause of whitenesse; even as in phlegmatick bodies and cold countreys may be seen: For such people are alwayes whiter of complexion then others; cold being the cause of that their whitenesse.</p>
                        <p>Such winters as are void of snow, are not so good for<note place="margin">Warm winters hurtfull.</note> the fruits of the ground, as more snowie winters. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note n="c" place="margin">Lib. 17. cap. 2.</note>

                        <p>Wherefore, to see the earth do penance in a cold white sheet, and the woods hang periwigd with wooll, bending their boughs in token of thankfulnesse to gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair'd <hi>Hyems</hi> for their safetie from the cold, is a sight both wished and welcome: the good whereof will shew it self, when liberall Nature, out of her bounteous ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, bestows more beauteous raiment on them.</p>

                           <hi>Artic. 6.</hi> Of Hail.</head>
                        <p>HAil is said to be engendred of rain being congealed into ice, the drops freezing presently after the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving of the cloud.</p>
                        <p>Or (as some say) a cloud resolved into water, in the fall congealed, maketh hail.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> assenteth to the same, affirming that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall neare cause is rain; the remote a cloud; the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent an <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> or a mutuall adverse strife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween cold and heat; as in the first book of his Meteors, at the 12 chapter, may be seen: affirming moreover that the precedent heat of the water whereof it is made, helpeth to the speedie concretion of it: being agreeable to that which I said before concerning snow; namely that it consisted of a warmer vapour then rain, and yet not of one so warm as that from whence hail proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon I think we may make this a conclusion
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18622:89"/>
concerning hail, and say that it is an hot vapour drawn<note place="margin">What hail is.</note> into the middle Region of the aire; where, by cold of that Region, it is made thick into a cloud, which falling down in drops like rain, is presently met withall and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered by the sudden cold of the lowest Region, and so congealed into a kinde of ice. Now this sudden cold thus meeting with it, is in the highest part of the lowest Region, and caused by an <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> of heat from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which forceth up the cold to the greater augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it; and so (because the vapour it self at the first was also warm) it doth very speedily turn it into ice: for seeing (as hath been said) it was formerly warm, it is the sooner cooled; because heat having made it thin and full of passages, gives leave to the cold, both to pierce it more suddenly, and also more soundly. And this most commonly is the manner of generating hail.</p>
                        <p>But know that hail may sometimes also be made in<note place="margin">Winter-hail how and where it is made.</note> the middle Region; and then it is without an <hi>Antiperista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis:</hi> of which sort for the most part is that small and spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie hail falling in winter, when there is no such heat in any part of the aire, by whose <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> it may be congealed. For seeing the drops are scarcely come to the densitie of water before their congelation, as also seeing they are something swollen through the spirit of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation, they appeare not onely round, but also light, and hollow, or of a spungie substance, little differing from the matter of snow, being generated in the middle Region as well as this kinde of hail. And thus comes hail in winter.</p>
                        <p>But at other times of the yeare, the hail being more stonie, or better hardened, it may well be caused by an <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> proceeding from the heat of this lowest Region, which sendeth up, imprisons, and augments the cold above it.</p>
                        <p>And know that hail-stones are not alwayes of one and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18622:90"/>
the same bignesse, but are variable according to the<note place="margin">The sundry fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hail-stones</note> quantitie of the drops whereof they be made; the cause whereof is their propinquitie or remotenesse from the earth, as was shewed before concerning the different drops of rain. And for the most part, know that they be also round, because the drop is so. Yet neverthelesse they be sometimes knotted and piked with many corners; or else fashioned like a <hi>Pyramis:</hi> the last of which shapes proceedeth from the spirit of the vapour which ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the top of the drop so soon as the lowest part of it toucheth the congealing cold; and so ascending, it makes it smaller above then below. And as for the triangled, knottie, or many-cornered shapes, they are caused thus, viz. when many are suddenly congealed and frozen into one.</p>
                        <p>Note also, that sometimes little straws, or light chaffie stuffe, is found within the stones; coming thus to passe, because they were at the first blown up from the earth by the winde, and mixed with the vapour.</p>
                        <p>And again know that sometimes you may see hail-stones all icie and cleare without, having within them (as their centre) little white round spungie parts. The reason of which is, because those white ones with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were generated in the middle Region: but in their fall justling themselves against the drops of rain which uncongealed came from the same cloud, they gat a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie substance on their outsides, which being frozen to them looketh cleare like ice; and so makes the whole conglomeration appeare in the shape and fashion before mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it hath not seldome been that hail hath<note place="margin">Hail doth many times much hurt.</note> done much hurt. Yet evermore the greatest fear is whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the ripe corn standeth in the eare. For a violent storm of hail thresheth it so throughly, that turning the words a little, we may truely say, <hi>Illa seges demum votis non</hi>
                           <pb n="165" facs="tcp:18622:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>respondet avari agricolae.</hi> Such a storm was felt in many parts of this kingdome not long ago, namely in the yeare 1631; which, about the beginning of harvest (beside the harm it did to other things) untimely beat out much corn in the fields to the great damage of many people. And at sundry other times also heretofore the like sad accidents have been. Wherefore the ancient husbandmen amongst<note place="margin">How the heathen used to secure their fields from hail and other harms.</note> the heathen (as <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> mention) had certain charming verses to keep hail and other dreadfull cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities from their fields: in which they shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of a like minde unto those devilish enchanting haggs, who made the Poet sing, <hi>Carmina vel coelo possunt deducere Lunam,</hi> Charms can pull even the very Moon out of heaven. But this was not all: For beside these, <hi>Palladius</hi> also makes mention of others who would take the skins of Crocodiles, Hyena's, or Sea-calves, and lay them here and there about their grounds; or else have a bloudie Ax lifted up in threatning manner against the heavens; or an Owl set staring up, with her feathers spread abroad. All which are but magicall, devilish, and absurd practises; such, as even an old doting woman (whose confidence is the sheers &amp; the sieve) cannot but acknowledge to be void of any the least shew of reason: fit therefore for heathens onely, and not for Christians. For let Christians know that there is a God above, who can better secure their seed sowen, then all those magick spells and foolish fopperies. For, <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 107. 34, 35</note>

                        <p>Here then I end this discourse concerning hail, and now proceed to speak of mists.</p>
                     </div>

                        <p>COncerning which, I like their division best who make two kindes of mist; the one ascending, the other descending.</p>
                        <p>That which ascendeth (saith D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                           <hi>Fulk</hi>) goeth up out of the water or earth as smoke, but seldome spreads it self any thing farre; being most of all seen about rivers and moist places.</p>
                        <p>The other (saith he) namely that which goeth down towards the earth, is when any vapour is lifted up into the aire by heat of the Sunne, which, not being strong enough to draw it so high that the cold may knit it, suffereth it to fall down again after it is a little made thick; and so it filleth all the aire with grosse vapours, obscuring the Sunne from shining on us.</p>
                        <p>Now this last kinde of mist may be two-fold; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">The descending mist is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> congealed, or incongealed. That which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed comes neare to the nature of that matter whereof white frosts consist; and is never but in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cold time: it often also stinketh; which perhaps<note place="margin">Why mists and fogs stink.</note> comes to passe in that the matter whereof it is made was drawn out of lakes, or other muddie
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18622:91"/>
and stinking places. Or thus; the matter of this mist hath much earthy substance in it, which the hindering cold suffereth not to be consumed: and from this comes an unpleasant and an unwholesome smell. This wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">A rot for cattell, and an harm to men.</note> as also the water of dissolved frost, is very bad for cattell to drink: for it will quickly rot them. Neither can it be good for any one to walk abroad in such a mistie time: For, by breathing, we draw this unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vapour into our bodies, and so corrupt our lungs extreamly.</p>
                        <p>But for incongealed mists, they are in warmer and more temperate seasons, coming neare the nature of that matter which is the matter of dew. Some call it a sterill vapour hanging neare the earth, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moist enough to drop like rain, nor yet hot enough to be carried up on high into the aire. Yet as sterill as it is, sometimes we finde that it is but the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of rain: For when it departeth, if it ascendeth,<note place="margin">How, by a mist, to judge of the weather.</note> then rain followeth; if it descendeth, then expect a hot and fair day. And here an end concerning mists.</p>

                        <p>FOr mine own part I must confesse I have not seen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who have writ any thing concerning this cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web-like kinde of Metcor: and therefore at the first I rested doubtfull, not knowing whether it were best for me to speak any thing of it or no. But at the last finding that some false tenents were engrafted amongst the ignorant, as if they perfectly knew what thing it was, I thought good to adde something whereby their fond opinion might be taken away, who, as in a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18622:92"/>
dream, suppose it to be spunne from out the spiders bowels: which cannot but be a strange absurditie. For it is evident that some one of these threads con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth more matter then many spiders; their bodies not being big enough to afford a thing so copious: neither are their webs at any time of such a length, or their threads of such a thicknesse, as these thus fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the aire.</p>
                        <p>This Meteor therefore (since it is a Meteor) may rightly be supposed to proceed out of a through-boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or digested vapour, being mixed with earthy and slimie Exhalations: and, although it be no spiders web, yet the temperature of it little differeth from that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuous humour and slimie <note n="*" place="margin">And that's the reason why (when it hangs on the stubble, or the like places) we see so many lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle spiders busie in it: for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth as it were feed them, and (perhaps) through the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, generate them.</note> excrement which they in their spinning send out from them.</p>
                        <p>As for the time, it appeareth neither in Summer nor in Winter, but in the Spring and Autumne; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it requireth a temperate heat and temperate drinesse.

                        <p>1.

But he withall acknowledgeth that they are assertions more curious then certain. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he understandeth by these foure Angels, the good Angels of God; and the foure windes he expoundeth to be the spirits of Satan, and executours of vengeance. For in a figurative sense, these and the like things are to be taken.</p>

                        <p>To which it may be answered, that this opinion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though<note place="margin">Answer.</note> better then the former, cannot float farre before it sink, and will therefore drown him in an errour who sticketh to it.

                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> testifieth, we fall into other absurdities upon the admittance of this tenent; (or else we dissent from them who maintained it of old) imagining thus, that when the aire is compelled to move, we have winde; when it standeth still, it is thickened into a cloud; when it raineth, it is condensed into water: all which is very idle.</p>
                        <p>For furthermore, if the winde were nothing else but<note place="margin">Winde is more then the motion of the aire.</note> the motion of the aire, then it would necessarily follow that all and every aire moved should be winde: but all and every moved aire is not winde: therefore winde is more then the moved aire.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Havenreuter,</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Aristotles</hi> Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, proveth the assumption by this similitude. Even as every flowing water (saith he) although there be great plentie of it, cannot be called a river, but that onely which ariseth from a fountain, or hath some certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of fluxion: so also, not all and every aire, moved by one kinde of means or other, can be called winde, but that onely which is as it were derived from some begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or fountain. As for example, the aire which is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about by the heavens, is moved, yet it was never call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18622:94"/>
winde. And again, in a bloudie bulleting fight, the aire is forced and stirred by the thundring sound of gunnes, and yet no winde is raised by it.</p>
                        <p>Besides, make winde to be nothing else but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the aire, and then there can be no sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son given why we should have greater plentie of windes at one time then at another; nor yet why they should blow from this point or corner, rather then from that. In which regard they also are confuted who suppose that the motion of the heavens moveth the windes: for if they were moved by the heavens, then the winde must blow alwayes one way, and never turn into a differing corner. But it followeth.</p>
                        <p>Another opinion (and this is the last that I mean to<note place="margin">Another opinion.</note> mention) maintaineth that the windes do actually reside somewhere, and are shut up as in a prison, from whence they have sometimes libertie for a while, but at length they retire, &amp; betake themselves to their dennes or cave again.

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And if at any time it<note place="margin">The cause and effects of an earthquake.</note> happen that these exhalations can have no way made them, but are kept close prisoners; they then (by striving to get out) shake the earth: which makes sad mortals alwayes fear, sometimes suffer, and not seldome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, winde may be thus defined; namely that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18622:95"/>
it is a certain plentie of hot and drie exhalations void of<note place="margin">The definition of winde.</note> pinguid matter; which being partly aspired, and partly exhaled out of the earth, are driven about it, lest the aire should be corrupted.</p>
                        <p>The matter then, we see, must be an exhalation. The quantitie of it must be copious: and so <note n="b" place="margin">Met. lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> also witnesseth; affirming that in the generation of windes, there is a concourse of many exhalations, by little and little begetting a large masse of matter. The qualitie of which matter must be hot and drie, not mixed with any fattie substance: for if it were of a pinguid nature, then it would be enflamed like lightning; seeing lightning is an hot and drie exhalation and like unto this, save onely that it containeth great plentie of fattie matter, such as is not amongst the matter of winde.</p>
                        <p>Unto which adde this observation, that a meer ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie exhalation is never the whole matter of winde. For it draweth up many mixed vapours with it, as may be seen if we call to minde the storms and showers which<note place="margin">Why it useth to rain when the winde is down.</note> often happen upon the allaying of a winde. For that part of the exhalation which is more moist and vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then the rest, is thickened and condensed into a rainie cloud, whilest the other is either drawn high into the upper Region, or else quite wasted, dispersed and consumed.</p>
                        <p>Also know that the aire may increase and augment<note place="margin">The aire moved augments the winde.</note> the exhalation after the motion is begun, and so the blast seemeth the greater. For the exhalation cannot but drive some part of the aire before it; then followeth other some after it, lest there should be <hi>vacuum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And furthermore, in that I assent to a twofold effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause of winde, viz. the beams of the sunne attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and also some certain subterranean fires expelling, it is not without reason: for it evidently appeareth, when the sunne hath either little or no force to draw
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18622:95"/>
up an exhalation, that then we have often great blasts; as those Northern windes in winter, and boisterous blasts, which happen in the night above our Horizon, when the sunne is under it. And unto this may be also added the secret influence of the Planets, who being in such or such a position do powerfully cause the earth to afford the aire great store of windie exhalations. As for example: the aspect of <hi>Iupiter</hi> (especially his conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) with the sunne, causeth great windes; producing also (as they may be placed) thunder and hail, as well as fair weather. And as for <hi>Mercury,</hi> if he be aspected either with the sunne, moon, or <hi>Iupiter,</hi> in <hi>Gemini, Libra,</hi> or <hi>Aquarius,</hi> it is evermore an infallible signe of winde; unlesse there be some other particular and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full influence to crosse it: for, as some have found it, generall influences may hinder those which are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                        <p>But come now to the motion of windes. I said before<note place="margin">How the windes are moved, and by what.</note> in their definition, that they were driven about the earth: and now it may be demanded how that motion is, and from whence it proceedeth.</p>
                        <p>Their motion is a laterall or sidelong motion, caused through the aspiring of the exhalation and detrusion of the aire. For the exhalation is hot and drie, and drawn up by the attractive power of the sunne &amp; other starres; whereupon, whilest it tendeth towards the middle Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the aire, it is beaten down again through the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and densitie of that place: and so, with a refracted and disjoynted force, it is driven hither and thither, and not suffered to fly up, nor willing to fall down in respect of the great levitie in it: and having as it were divided the contention between both (viz. the cold of the aire, and heat of the exhalation) neither overcoming other; it flyeth, not directly up, nor directly down, but laterally or obliquely: for it is <note n="c" place="margin">Haven<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18622:96"/>
those things which are moved partly by force, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly naturally, move themselves obliquely. By which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son lightning also, shooting starres, and the like Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, fly not directly down, nor up; but sidelong, as the winde: unlesse it be, that when they consist of Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genean parts, or parts of a divers kinde (which some also attribute to the matter of windes) they then, through the strife of those their elevating and depressing parts, have a transverse motion as before.</p>
                        <p>The place from whence this motion of the windes<note place="margin">Where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the winde beginneth.</note> beginneth, is from above.</p>
                        <p>First, because the motion must necessarily begin from that place whither the exhalation is carried, as is seen in a vapour turned to rain.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, because all those things which have great force, there, where they have their greatest force, are not farre from their head or beginning of motion: but the windes have their greatest force in places up on high: therefore there they begin their motion, as <hi>Havenreuter</hi> proveth.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, know that the rednesse of the skie, and all other visible signes of winde, do declare that some spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or windie breathings are above, which in short time will be turned into blasts. For rednesse is a token of the adustion of exhalations in the aire: and the breaking of a circle about the moon from some one side or other, doth also shew the winde that is above, but not as yet come down unto us. The like also doth the swift motion of a single cloud in a cleare skie when we feel no blasts below.</p>
                        <p>Besides, the hot and drie exhalation we know is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed first upright, and cannot therefore move obliquely untill it be encountered: wherefore the motion begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the aire above, and not in places here below.</p>
                        <p>And yet some imagine that certain particular windes,<note place="margin">Particular windes.</note>
                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:18622:96"/>
which are known but onely in some countreys, have their immediate motion from out the caverns of the earth, without any ascent into the skie: and this they prove, because the blast bloweth not farre, but is like the winde that cometh out of a pair of bellows, strong neare the coming forth; but farre off, is not perceived.</p>
                        <p>Upon thought of which let it also be known, that the<note place="margin">Why the winde bloweth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one way.</note> blowing of the winde sometimes one way and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another way, dependeth upon no other cause then upon the situation of the place from whence the exhalation ariseth: and that it is sometimes stirred up one where, sometimes another where, proceedeth from the operation of the heavens.</p>
                        <p>Also know, that windes diametrally opposite cannot<note place="margin">Opposite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For if they be of equall strength, the one will be as powerfull as the other, and so not one give place to either. Or if their forces be unequall, then the one will overcome the other, and so the conquered must upon necessitie give place to the conquerour, and rather joyn unwilling forces with him, then be against him.</p>
                        <p>Yet neverthelesse, if they be obliquely contrary, they<note place="margin">Oblique windes.</note> may blow together: and by how much they are the more oblique, by so much they stirre up the greater stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and tempestuous blasts.</p>

                        <p>And again, the laterall were called by these names that follow, and thus placed from the Cardinall.</p>
                        <p>As first, the East hath on the Southern side <hi>Eurus,</hi> or

                           <hi>Vulturnus:</hi> and on the Northern side <hi>Coecias,</hi> or <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spontus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, the South winde hath on the East side <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi> or <hi>Euronotus:</hi> and on the West side <hi>Lybonotus,</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro-Africus;</hi> so called because it declineth from the South something towards Africa.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the West hath on the South side <hi>Lybs,</hi> or <hi>Africus;</hi> so called from Lybia and Africa, the Regions from whence they proceed: and on the North side there is <hi>Corus</hi> or <hi>Caurus,</hi> called also <note n="b" place="margin">Origan. de effect. cap. 5.</note>

                           </gap> the East side of the North point there is blustering <hi>Bore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> which is a bellowing winde, blowing with a loud hollow sound; and is therefore derived by <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> in his <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 22.</note> Attick nights, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. This division <hi>Aristotle</hi> also assenteth unto, making three windes in every quarter; as in the second book of his Meteors, at the sixth chapter, may be seen.</p>
                        <p>But the mariners make 20 more besides these: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much<note place="margin">The mariners reckon 32 windes</note> that the whole circumference of the Horizon is divided into two and thirtie equall parts, which they call and distinguish by severall names. And now observe in this division, that there be foure Cardinall windes, as before: foure middle windes, which are just in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest between each Cardine: eight laterall, already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: and sixteen collaterall: making, in the whole summe, the aforesaid number of two and thirtie.</p>
                        <p>Know therefore that the Cardinall, and middle windes, are properly the principall: the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lesse principall and subordinate: divided therefore
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18622:98"/>
into laterall and collaterall; as hath been mentioned.</p>
                        <p>And as for those middle ones, they be such as we call South-west, South-east, North-west, and North-east windes. <hi>Notolybicus</hi> is the South-west winde; and <hi>Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peliotes</hi> the South-east. <hi>Borrholybicus</hi> is the North-west winde; and <hi>Borrhapeliotes</hi> the North-east.</p>
                        <p>The rest, being sixteen in number, and collaterall, have their places, one between each of the other: and so the circumference is divided into 32 parts, as before I shewed. Now the names of these sixteen are borrowed from those lateralls with whom they have the greatest neighbourhood, by <note n="f" place="margin">Orig. Ephes. lib. de effect, cap. 6.</note> adding <hi>Meso</hi> and <hi>Upo</hi> to them. For <hi>Meso</hi> comes from <gap reason="foreign">

As for example: <hi>Eurus</hi> is a laterall winde, a little from the East towards the South: and this hath on each side of it one collaterall. That which is between <hi>Notapeliotes,</hi> or the South-east winde and it, is called <hi>Mes'eurus,</hi> being middle between a principall and a laterall. But that which is between the East and it, is called <hi>Up'eurus,</hi> as being subject unto <hi>Eurus.</hi> And by observing this order you may give names unto all the rest: for <hi>Meso</hi> and <hi>Upo</hi> will compound them.</p>
                        <p>Yet neverthelesse ordinarily the mariners name them thus.

                           <hi>Artic. 4.</hi> The nature and qualitie of the windes.</head>
                        <p>IT may well appeare by that which already hath been written concerning the generation of windes, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very winde in it self, or in respect of the matter causing it, is of an hot and drie qualitie. If therefore, blowing from any quarter, we finde it other, it is by accident, and not through any inherent propertie: for windes do ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more participate of the nature of that place by which they passe: If by snowie mountains, then bring they with them the cold of those mountains; if by marshes, contagion; if by woods, their blast is broken; if by san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die plains, they are warm; if by moist watry places, they are wet.</p>
                        <p>And therefore for particular windes, the <note n="a" place="margin">Windes blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and famous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Panormus,</hi> or <hi>Palermo</hi> in <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <hi>Panormi</hi> in <hi>Sicil</hi> are extream hot; for before they pierce thither, they scoure through the plains of <hi>Sicil;</hi> and taking heat from the sands, they carrie it into the citie. The South winde at <hi>Genua</hi> is cold, because it passeth the sea, and taketh coldnesse thereof without touching the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it arive. But the North winde which bloweth through <hi>France</hi> (saith <note n="b" place="margin">In a book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the world.</note> one) cometh from the sea, and taking some measure of heat by the saltnesse thereof, and finding no mountains covered with ice or snow in his passage, augmenteth his heat by passing over the fields of <hi>Normandie, Champaigne,</hi> the isle of <hi>France,</hi> and other provinces, even to the hills of <hi>Auvergne:</hi> which being moderately heated by the South winde on the one side, and the North winde on the other, bringeth forth every where excellent pastures, and feedings for cattell
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18622:99"/>
and sheep, besides divers sorts of medicinable plants and most perfect simples. Also in <note n="c" place="margin">Origan. Ephem. de effect. cap. 5.</note> some places it is found that the Eastern winde moisteneth, and the Western winde bringeth drought: and in other some the Western moisteneth, and the other drieth. So that it is possible for one and the same winde to have a divers qualitie; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not in it self, yet by accident; as at the first was mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Yet neverthelesse generally, and in most places, the North, with his associates, is cold and drie: the South,<note place="margin">Their qualities according as they commonly blow.</note> with his companions, is warm and moist: and the East, with his adherents, is farre more drie then the Western and his neare neighbour windes.</p>
                        <p>The reasons whereof may be. First, for the North,<note place="margin">Norths qualitie.</note> because it bloweth over many snowie mountains, and ariseth from a climate which hath little neighbourhood with the sunne, where the vapours be few, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations many that arise out of sundry islands by the way. Unto which also adde, because the exhalation passeth not farre before it come at us, that therefore it seldome bringeth rain: for the exhalation hath not time enough to spend the driest portion of it, so as the South winde doth; who passeth both over more waterie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and also cometh further before we feel it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for the South winde, it cometh over the<note place="margin">Souths qualitie.</note> Mediterranean sea, out of which the sunne begets abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of waterie vapours, which mix themselves with the windes, causing them thereupon to be the blowers in of rain. And as for their heat, it is because they blow from the Equator where heat is most predominant. Also know that a long and gentle South winde may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cause clearenesse and fair weather, most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the summer season, because it is by nature hot; and therefore blowing for a certain space, it so warmeth the aire, that the vapours which otherwise would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18622:99"/>
rain, are not suffered to be knit, but are attenuated and made so thin that they come to nothing; or being any thing, they prove onely barren clouds, affording little rain.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the East winde is found to be the driest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Easts qualitie.</note> it cometh over a great continent of land lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East, out of which many drie and earthie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations are drawn. In winter these windes are very cold and freezing; but in summer they are pleasantly warm, but healthfull: and if at any time they blow up rain (which is not ordinary) they then continue it by the space of a whole day; even as the like also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happeneth from the North. The reason of which<note place="margin">Why the East and North windes sometimes bring rain for a whole day.</note> I take to be, because (perhaps) their lateralls, not being absolutely of the same qualitie, may arise together with them, and so bring rain; especially, if at the same time there be any other working in nature apt to moisten the skie with vapours. For it is affirmed that <hi>Eurus</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Coecias</hi> on the other side, being two laterall windes pertinent to the East, do naturally raise clouds, and often turn them into rain; as do also <hi>Upocoecias,</hi> and <hi>Mes'eurus,</hi> their collateralls. And so also <hi>Cyrcius</hi> may do, and <hi>Borrholybicus,</hi> being on the West side of the North, if either of them happen to arise and joyn, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though but weakly, with the Northern blast. For in their own sole blowings they beget both snow and hail; either of which may fall down in drops of rain, when the mixture of qualities is found to be divers.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the Western winde is farre more moist<note place="margin">West windes qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> then the East, because it passeth over the great ocean of the Atlantick sea, which must needs cast out many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie and moist vapours, and they cannot but beget rain and showers. It is said also to be of a cold temper; but surely not of an absolute coldnesse: for it is found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that a direct <hi>Zephyrus</hi> or <hi>Favonius,</hi> with their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18622:100"/>
collateralls, <hi>Mesocorus,</hi> and <hi>Up'africus,</hi> are warm and pleasant, bringing sometimes hot showers, sometimes warm and cleare weather. And therefore it is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by certain authours, that this winde may blow from a cold place, and yet bring heat. For although (in regard of the place over which it cometh) it be cold; yet in respect of the time when it usually bloweth, it is hot. Which <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 1. carm. od. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>Horace</hi> also pointed at, saying,</p>
                        <q>Solvitur acris hyems grat â vice veris &amp; Favonî.</q>
                        <q>

                           <l>Return of Spring, and of the Western winde.</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>Or will you heare what others say? <hi>Lemnius</hi> (as <hi>Origanus</hi> relateth) affirmeth that this Western winde and his collateralls are of a changing temper. For although in the beginning of the Spring they be pleasing and gentle, and are found to recreate and cherish all things, seeing they are warmed by the moderate heat of the sunne, which makes them bring out the beautie of trees, and flowers, to the view of the world; and also causeth the bloud and good humours to appeare, which in winter lay hid, as if they were not; casting away also the clouds of the minde, and begetting jocundnesse in the heart: yet neverthelesse, Autumne ending, and the circuit of the yeare enclining to Winter, the foresaid windes do blow unkindely, striking the sea and land with many a tempestuous blast, and unwished breathings.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, this also may be observed, that the long<note place="margin">The effects of a long-continuing winde, at certain seasons.</note> continuance of the windes in any of these quarters, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth these and the like effects.</p>
                        <p>As first, the East winde breedeth in cholerick bodies sharp fevers, raging madnesse, and perilous apostumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the South winde breedeth corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and in hot bodies cramps, giddinesse in the head, or the falling sicknesse, pestilence and cruel fevers, viz.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18622:100"/>
when they blow long in the winter. This is held to be the most unwholesome winde.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the West winde breedeth phlegme in moist bodies; it procureth sleep, causeth apoplexies, and the like; and is never so churlish as when winter begins to approach.</p>
                        <p>And last of all, the North winde is good against the pestilence; and yet in cold bodies it breedeth plurifies, coughs, gouts, and (in some) squincies and sore throats: but yet of all windes it is held to be the wholesomest, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be sharp in our winter moneths.</p>
                        <p>And this also note, that a continuall still summer is a<note place="margin">A signe of plague and earthquake.</note> signe of plague or earthquake: for a standing aire putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and an enclosed winde shaketh the ground.</p>

                  <p>Because in the former day, the work belonging to it, compelled my winged pen to soar aloft, not suffering her to come unto the ground till now. For she was to walk above the Firmament, and view the out-spread buildings laid in the flowing waters: then through the Regions of the liquid aire she was to trace a path; which finished, she must be content to frame her self unto a lower pitch, before any leave be granted to ascend again. And indeed I think it is what both she and I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for we were long detained there.</p>

done on this third day of the world, that into three main parts it may be severed: for by viewing the words which he hath written of it, the same will be apparent. <hi>And God</hi> (saith he) <hi>said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the drie-land ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: and it was so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And God called the drie-land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grasse, the herb yeelding seed, and the fruit-tree yeelding fruit after his kinde, whose seed is in it self, upon the earth: and it was so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the earth brought forth grasse, and herb yeelding seed after his kinde; and the tree yeelding fruit, whose seed was in it self, after his kinde: and God saw that it was good.</hi>

                     <hi>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the summe of all; which (as before was said) consisteth of three severall parts.</p>
                  <p>The first whereof concerneth the <hi>gathering together of the waters,</hi> in these words, <hi>And God said, Let the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under heaven be gathered together unto one place.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The third is pertinent to the <hi>sprouting and springing of the earth,</hi> in these words, <hi>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grasse, the herb yeelding seed, and the fruit-tree yeelding fruit after his kinde, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All which in their orders are severally to be discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, together with such other things as are pertinent to the said division.</p>
                  <p>And concerning the two first, observe that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes as it were sirnames on them; calling the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of the waters, Seas: and the drie-land he calleth Earth.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> Of the gathering together of the waters, which God called Seas.</head>
                  <p>VVAter and earth are the two lowest elements; and this was that day which brought them to perfection: for untill now they were confused; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their matter, although not quite void of form, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at this time a better form of due distinction and more comely ornament. The informitie was expressed before, when Moses said that the earth was void and invisible, because covered with waters: but the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is then expected and declared when the waters are gathered, and the drie-land made apparent.</p>
                  <p>It is a wonder (sure) to think what a confused ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie the waters made by their effusion; for they did rather tyrannize then orderly subdue or govern this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour mirie masse: wherefore it seemed good to the Almightie maker, first to divorce one from the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave them leave so to be joyned each to other, that both together might make one globie bodie; which (according to the best approved writers) is one and twentie thousand and six hundred miles in compasse.</p>
                  <p>But concerning this gathering together of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there arise certain questions, which may not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>As first, it is enquired, How the waters were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered<note place="margin">Questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are said to be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together.</note> together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How it can be said that they were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one place; seeing there be many seas, lakes, rivers, and fountains that are farre asunder.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whether they be higher then the earth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Whether there be more water then earth.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Whether the earth be founded upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:18622:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sixthly, Why the seas be salt, and rivers fresh.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly and lastly, What causeth an ebbing and flowing in the sea, rather then in rivers.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>Concerning the first of these questions, those who<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Quest. 1.</hi> Which sheweth how the waters were gathered together.</note> think that there be no <hi>Antipodes,</hi> supposed that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did runne together and cover the other part of the earth which is opposite to this where we dwell. But the experience of skilfull navigatours and famous travellers, yea and reason it self, doth crie against it.</p>
                     <p>Others imagine that it was some mighty winde which dried them up; or that the fervent heat of the sunne effected it. But both think amisse; because the drie-land (saith one) appearing all at once, was so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by a greater power then either of the winde or sunne, which could not work it at once, nor scarcely in a long continuance of time: neither was the sunne made untill the next day after. <hi>Dixit igitur &amp; factum est;</hi> he spake the word onely, and by the power of that word it was done. For the efficient cause of the sea was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word of God; the materiall was the waters; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall was their gathering together; and the finall partly was, that the drie-land might appeare. <hi>Ezekiels</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 1. 16.</note> wheels were one within the compasse of another: and so was the earth, water, and aire, before the powerfull word of God commanded this their gathering: the earth within the water; the water within the aire; and the aire within the concave of the Firmament. Which if they had all for ever so remained, and man made as he is, the world had been no house for him to dwell in, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had it been a work so full of never ended admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as now it is.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the pores and holes of the ground were full before this gathering; yet neverthelesse their bodies must be willing to be made the beds for more. That they were full, it proceedeth from the nature of the water,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18622:104"/>
falling downwards and filling them. That being full, they are yet made capable of more, might proceed both from a more close composure of the not hollow parts of the earth, and also by making these waters thicker then they were before. For whilest the not hollow parts were made more solid, the hollow could not choose but be <note n="*" place="margin">Job 38. 10.</note> enlarged: and whilest the thin and vapourie waters were better thickened and condensed, the outface of the ground could not be obscured, but shew it self as one released from out a waterie prison. Some adde unto this their heaping together in the high and wide seas, whereby it cometh to passe that they flow to and fro at flouds and ebbs, and do often force out water-springs from out the highest mountains: which last, whether it be so or no, shall be examined afterwards.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>The next question was, how it can be said that they<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Quest. 2.</hi> Shewing how they were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one place.</note> were gathered to one place; seeing there be many seas, lakes, rivers and fountains that are farre asunder.</p>
                     <p>It was a strange conceit of him who thought that this one place unto which the waters were gathered, was separate so from the earth that the waters by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should make a globe, and have their proper centre; for leaving to descend towards the centre of the earth, they were gathered to a centre of their own, and so the drie-land appeared.</p>
                     <p>But this opinion is very false, and worthy to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongst absurdities: for (as the <note n="*" place="margin">Esay 40. 22.</note> Prophet Esay writeth) the Lord is said to <hi>sit upon the circle of the earth.</hi> Now experience sheweth that it is not the earth alone, but the earth and sea together that make one globe or circle.</p>
                     <p>This one place then whither the waters were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was not a place separated from the earth, being in the aire or elsewhere, but was in the very body of the earth it self. Neither was it one place strictly taken, as
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18622:104"/>
it meant one point or angle of the earth: or, as if there were no <hi>Antipodes,</hi> half the earth under us was to be covered with water.</p>
                     <p>But rather it is called one place, because in the whole globe of the earth, every place is either water or land: or (if not so) because there is but one body of all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are: for every part of the water is joyned unto the whole as it were with arms and legs, and veins di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly dilated and stretched out. So that either under the earth, or above the earth, all the waters are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which also the wise man witnesseth, Eccles. 1. 7.</p>
                     <p>But haply some may think, because this gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the waters is called Seas, that therefore the one place, unto which they were gathered, is not to be understood of every collection or gathering of water, but onely of the sea.</p>
                     <p>Well, be it so. And if this rather then the other be the meaning of Moses his words, it may be answered, that although the sea be divers in name, yet all seas are so continued together, that one sea is perpetually joyned with another: and thereupon the name given, is not <hi>Sea,</hi> but <hi>Seas;</hi> as in the text is manifest.</p>
                     <p>Yea and hereupon it also is, that Geographers make these waters come under a fourefold division. For they either call this gathered water, <hi>Oceanus, Mare, Fretum,</hi> or <hi>Sinus.</hi>

                        <item>3. <hi>Fretum,</hi> a strait, is a part of the ocean restrained within narrow bounds, and opening a way to the sea.</item>
                        <item>4. <hi>Sinus,</hi> a creek, or bay, is a sea contained within a crooked shore, thrusting out (as it were) two arms to embrace the lovely presence of it.</item>

                           <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps you will say that the Caspian sea is a sea by it self, and therefore all seas joyn not the one unto the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> To which it is answered, that this sea is either as a <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Fulk in his Met. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. saith that some lakes are so great that they bear the names of seas: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which he reckoneth this Caspian sea.</note> lake in respect of the contiguous or joyning seas; or else it was no sea in the beginning of the world, but began onely at the ceasing of the Floud, &amp; was caused by the waters coming down from the Caspian hills, setling themselves in those declive and bottomie places where the said sea is. <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> are perswaded that it joyneth it self unto other seas by running into the Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Northern ocean through some occult passages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground; which is not improbable. But howsoever, this we are sure of, that the river <hi>Volga</hi> is joyned to it, being as another sea, and having no lesse then seventie mouthes to emptie it self: which river is also joyned to the river <hi>Don,</hi> and that hath great acquaintance with the Euxine sea. Besides, <hi>Volga</hi> is not a stranger to <note n="a" place="margin">As <hi>Duina major,</hi> and <hi>Duina minor</hi> called also <hi>Onega.</hi> Look into the maps of Russia or Moscovia.</note> other waters which fall either into the Scythian or Baltick ocean: insomuch that it may be said, this Caspian sea is tied (as it were) with certain strings to <note n="b" place="margin">Viz. the Eux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, Baltick, and Scythian or Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern seas.</note> three other seas: and so, not onely all waters are made one bodie, like as before I shewed, but (if this gathering must needs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the seas) even all seas also shake hands, and by one means or other mutually embrace one the other.</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>A third question is, Whether the waters be<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Quest. 3.</hi> Shewing whether the waters be higher then the earth.</note> higher then the earth. Concerning which there be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours on both sides; some affirming, some denying.</p>
                     <p>That they be higher then the earth, it is thus affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>First, because water is a bodie not so heavie as earth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is observed by sailers, that their ships flie faster to the shore then from it; whereof no reason can be given, but the height of the water above the land.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to such as stand on the shore, the sea seemeth
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18622:105"/>

                     <p>Fifthly, the arising of springs out of the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains doth declare it, because the water cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced higher then the head of the fountain opposite to it. As for example. Like as we see a spring that riseth in an hill, conveyed in lead unto a lower ground, will force his waters to ascend unto the height it beareth at the fountain: even so the waters which stand above the mountains, do force out springs of water, by necessary and naturall cause, out of the highest mountains.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 104.</note> Psalmist doth witnesse the same, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moreover that God Almighty <hi>hath made the waters to stand on an heap, and hath set them a bound which they shall not passe, nor turn again to cover the earth.</hi> And Jer. 5. 22. <hi>Fear ye not me, saith the Lord? will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetuall decree that it cannot passe it; and though the waves thereof rage, yet can they not prevail?</hi> Thus on the one side.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding all this, methinks the other part (yet choose which you will) is most probable.</p>
                     <p>For first the water indeed is a bodie not so heavie an earth, yet heavie enough to descend, not being of an aspiring nature, but presseth eagerly towards the same centre that a stone or any part of the earth coveteth: It cannot therefore possibly be above the earth, although not so heavie as earth, unlesse there were no hollow pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the ground to receive it. But God Almighty, in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18622:106"/>
gathering them, provided lodgings for them, lest they should turn again and cover the earth: which also is insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated by the Hebrew word <hi>Kava,</hi> signifying to congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate or gather together; from whence the Latine word <hi>Cavus,</hi> hollow, may seem to be derived. Besides, should it be alledged that the hollow places could not be deep enough to receive them, what were this but to curtall the earths Diameter or thicknesse? for suppose the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters stood above the hills before they were gathered to one place; yet know that even the Semidiameter of the earth is deeper by no few miles then the highest hill. Suppose you could imagine an hill to be above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand miles high (which is impossible) yet the earths Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter would be two thousand, foure hundred, and above 36 miles deeper then that height. As for example; if the earth be 21600 miles in compasse, then the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter will be 6872 8/11 miles; and if the Diameter be 6872 8/11 miles, then the Semidiameter must be half so much, viz. 3436 4/11 miles.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, suppose it be observed by sailers that their ships fly faster to the shore then from it: this proveth not the sea higher then the land. For know that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to see a ship sail more speedily homewards then out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; because when it approacheth to the shore, it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with a continued motion which makes it the swifter: but when it goeth from the shore, it doth but begin its motion, and is therefore slower then before. This (if need were) might be proved by many plain and familiar examples.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, suppose that the sea seemeth, to such as stand on the shore, to swell higher and higher, till it put a bound to the sight; this rather proveth the sphericall roundnesse of the earth and sea, then any thing else; shewing that both together make one globie bodie. Which, why it is perceived rather in the water then the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18622:106"/>
land, this may be a reason; namely because the sea, being a plain and liquid element, and spacious enough, doth better shew it then the earth, which hindereth our full view by reason of many woods, trees, and other fixed obstacles which the sight meeteth and encountreth by the way.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, although <hi>Sesostris</hi> K. of Egypt, and after him <hi>Darius</hi> K. of Persia, dared not to make a cut out of the Red sea into <hi>Nilus,</hi> for fear of drowning the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, because they supposed that the sea lay three cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits higher then the land of Egypt: yet (as some report; how truely, I cannot tell) the <hi>Ptolomies,</hi> kings of Egypt, effected the work without any danger of inundation. But suppose they had not done it, or suppose it were granted that the Red sea were higher then the plains of Egypt; yet it followeth not (unlesse one swallow can make a summer) that the sea in generall is every where higher then the earth. As for the height of the Red sea above the land neare adjoyning to it, <note n="d" place="margin">Met. lib. 1. cap. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> seemeth to give a reason, perswading himself that there is such a change in the universe, as that that which hath been sea is sometimes land, and that which hath been land is sometimes sea: and so he thinketh of those low grounds neare the Red sea, that they have been gained from the sea. The like we may also think of many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Netherlands, and of that small part of sea which is between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Callis;</hi> as <hi>Verstegan</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in his restitution of decayed antiquities, cap. 4. pag. 97.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, suppose that certain springs arise out of the highest mountains, must the sea therefore needs be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then those mountains? surely I think not. For albeit I be not of <hi>Aristotles</hi> minde, nor of their opinions who do not derive the rivers from the seas, nor make subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them who give a sucking and an attractive po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18622:107"/>
to the veins of the earth; yet I finde it as a thing possible, although that part of the sea which lieth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the head of the fountain, or to the place where the water first breaketh out, be lower then the ground, that the said water may neverthelesse easily ascend, and not break forth untill it finde a place convenient. Now this ascent is caused by the sea, which, seeing it is a vast bodie, is very ponderous and heavie, and cannot be thrust back by the water at the head of the fountain opposite to it, but rather it doth potently and strenuously croud on the said water through the hollow ports and passages of the earth, untill at the last it springeth forth.</p>
                     <p>Were it so indeed that there were an equall weight of both waters, (I mean of the sea-water driving, and of the spring-water arising) then the ascent of the one could not be higher then the <hi>superficies</hi> of the other: but seeing the weights are unequall (which <note n="e" place="margin">De subtil lib. 3. pag. 123.</note> 
                        <hi>Cardan</hi> did not well consider) the stronger and heavier must needs drive on the weaker and lighter, causing it sometimes to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend even above it self.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly and lastly, that which the Psalmist witnesseth concerning the standing of the waters on an heap, I take to be nothing else but the gathering of them to one place, so and in such a manner, that their coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be called Seas, and their forsaking the land be called Earth: for if one place of Scripture be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another, it will appeare to be even so. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is said, Ecclesiastes 1. 7. <hi>All the rivers go into the sea:</hi> but the water hath his naturall course downwards, and cannot be forced up, but by the heavier weight; as hath been shewed. Secondly, because it is said Psal. 107. 23. <hi>They go down to the sea in ships: down,</hi> as to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place; and not <hi>up,</hi> as to the higher. And for that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of Jeremy, viz. <hi>Fear ye not me? &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet speaks there of no miraculous work against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18622:107"/>
but of the ordinary providence of God by naturall means, keeping back and bounding the sea; as at the 24. verse is manifest. For there he gives the like instance of the rain; which we know is not wrought by miracle, and yet it sheweth the watchfull providence of God, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the world by the naturall course of the creatures.</p>
                     <p>Judge then if they be not mistaken, who would have the sea higher then the earth.</p>

                     <p>Now here I am perswaded that the answer may be either double or doubtfull. For if we have respect to the known parts of the world, then I think there may be more sea then land. But if we have respect to all, both known and unknown, then perhaps there may be as much land as sea: For we see that in the maps of the world, the Southern parts are not known, and therefore they write <hi>Terra Australis nondum cognita:</hi> which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be sea or land, is uncertain. <hi>Pareus,</hi> upon Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, is perswaded that the land is more then the sea, alledging a proof out of <note n="*" place="margin">2.

                           </hi> Shewing upon what the earth is founded.</note> upon the waters.</p>
                     <p>The Psalmist seemeth to affirm it, Psal. 24. verse 2. For (according to the common reading) it is, <hi>He hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the flouds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which it is answered, that if the earth (as it is) be the receptacle for the waters, or holdeth the waters in the concavities of it, how can it be that the waters
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18622:108"/>
are in stead of a foundation? Job saith, <hi>He hangeth the earth upon nothing,</hi> chap. 26. 7. If upon nothing, then not upon the waters, for they are something. And again, even the Psalmist also saith, <hi>The foundation of the earth cannot be moved,</hi> Psal. 104. 5. If not moved, then not founded upon the waters, for they are moveable; flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to and fro, sometimes this way, sometimes that way, and never standing still.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore when the Psalmist saith, <hi>The earth is founded upon the seas,</hi> he meaneth that it is so placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, as that it is made fit to be a place for habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And so Expositours understand the Hebrew word <hi>Gnal;</hi> viz. in such a sense that it doth signifie <hi>above,</hi> and not <hi>upon:</hi> In which sense, the waters that it sustaineth do not hold it, but are holden by it: for they are in it <hi>tanquam in utre,</hi> as in a certain vessel; and do alwayes strive to come as neare the centre as is possible.</p>
                     <p>For conclusion then of this question, thus much must be known; namely, that when God made the world, he made <note n="*" place="margin">Wisd. 11. 22.</note> all things in number, weight, and measure: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the earth (although it be hanged upon <note n="*" place="margin">Job 26. 7.</note> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) is so equally poysed on every side, that it cannot but be firmly upheld; and no more fall then the sun out of the firmament, or the starres out of heaven. For hath not man sometimes shewed an admired portion of skill in this or that rare work which he hath wrought, and effected by nothing else but onely the deep and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found rules of art? yes surely hath he. And if man be so potent as to make his skill admired, yea and by those who are men as well as he; what may we think of the Maker of men, but that his art is much more then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and his wisdome much more then matchlesse; so that the world, and all the parts thereof, afford no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but matter of wonder?

                     <p>The sixth question is concerning the saltnesse of the<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his second book of Meteors, at the 3. chapter, setteth down (besides his own) three opinions concerning this saltnesse. One whereof is, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters overflowing the earth in the beginning of the world, were so dried up by the heat of the sunne, that not onely the drie-land appeared, but all those waters which remained (being the sea) were so sucked and robbed of their sweet savour, that they could not but be salt.</p>
                     <p>Another opinion agreeing to that of <hi>Plato,</hi> who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating the sea <hi>ex tartaro,</hi> or from great and deep gulfs in the earth, or (with others) drawing it through the bowels of the earth, gave occasion to think that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it self was sweet, and yet became salt by reason of the divers savours that it met withall in the ground or veins of the earth. Which cause, by the<note n="i" place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           </gap> Arist. de Met. lib. 2. cap. 1.</note> interpretours of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is also attributed to <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> &amp; <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> as being pleasing to them. For as water strained through ashes is endued with a certain tart and salt kinde of acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; so the sea is made salt by some such kinde of earth through which it passeth: which is as others have also thought, who suppose that the saltnesse of Mineralls doth much conduce to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>A third was the opinion of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> who affirmed that the sea was but the sweat of the earth, being (as it were) rosted by the heat of the sunne; and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore salt, because all sweat is of such a savour.</p>
                     <p>Now these three opinions <hi>Aristotle</hi> endeavoured to confute by severall reasons, shewing other causes of the seas saltnesse. And indeed had it been so with him that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18622:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he could have repaired unto Moses, then had the first opinion been struck dead more easily then it was; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Moses would have told him that the drying of the earth, and gathering of the waters, were one day elder then either sunne or starres.</p>
                     <p>And for the second, if it be taken in a qualified sense, it is not much amisse: for although <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith that if it be a true opinion, then rivers would be salt as well as seas, because they runne in the veins of the earth; yet know that all and every vein is not of one and the same temper; as is apparent by the differing qualitie of springing waters.</p>
                     <p>As for the third, it seemeth rather a ridiculous then philosophicall opinion: for sweat is but a small part of that humour contained in any bodie that yeeldeth sweat; but the sea is not the smallest part of humour in the bodie of the earth: therefore it neither causeth the sea, nor saltnesse of it.</p>
                     <p>But beside all these, there are other opinions also. Wherefore some again have attributed the cause to adust vapours, partly let fall on the sea, and partly raised from it to the brinks and face thereof; Others to the motion of the sea; Some to under-earth, or rather<note n="k" place="margin">Lyd. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>But that which followeth seemeth absolutely the best, namely that it is effected by the working of the sunne, which draweth out the purer and finer parts, leaving the grosser and more base behinde; even as in this little world of our bodies, the purest part of our nourishment being employed in and on the bodie, the urine and other excrements remaining do retain a perfect saltnesse. Unto which opinion they also assent, who affirm that the saltnesse is radically or originally
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18622:109"/>
in the matter of the water; which must be so understood as the water hath in it an earthy kinde of substance of a drying nature: which (as I suppose) was not first in the matter of the waters before they were gathered unto this one place where now they are; because, as is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and written, there be salt mines in sundry places, as in a certain hill in <hi>Barbary,</hi> out of which perfect salt is digged, and used for salt after it is made clean and beaten small. All which doth greatly commend the providence and wisdome of God: For it is not unlike but that the<note place="margin">The sea made salt by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the ground: that is my opinion.</note> sea was by his wisdome and providence gathered into such salt valleys of the earth, as were otherwise barren and unfruitfull: with which substance, the gathered water being mixed, must needs partake both of an earthy matter, and also of a salt savour; yet so, as this salt savour cannot be drawn out, and sensibly perceived in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of many sweet humours joyned with it, without a separation first made by the heat of the sunne, of the thinner parts from the thicker: And so the sunne is a disponent, though not a productive cause of this salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>Now this opinion may be strengthened by many reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, because sea-water, when it is boyled, doth eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate a dewie or watrie humour, which being collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept together, hath a sweet tast or savour.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because vapours drawn from the sea and turned into rain, are void of saltnesse.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, because the sea in summer, and towards the South (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth) is more salt then else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; which cometh to passe in that the sunne, at that time and place, draweth away more of the sweet hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours then at other times.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, because the sea is fresher towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, then at the top; as some have found by using pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises to experience it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:18622:110"/>Fifthly, because (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> again testifyeth) if an emptie vessel sealed up with wax, be by some means or other caused to sink into the sea, and there let lie for a certain space, it will at the last be filled with very fresh and sweet water, issuing in through the insensible small pores of the wax: for by this manner of passing into the vessel, the thin is strained from the thick: yea by this means, the earthy and adust part, which carrieth the saltnesse in it, is excluded, whilest the other is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For in every salt savour, two things are required; viz. an adustion, and an earthie kinde of substance of a drying nature: both which are found in the sea. For (according to the testimonie of Physicians) sea-water doth heat and drie more then other waters, and is also more ponderous or heavie; yea and it doth more easily sustain a heavie burden, giving it lesse leave to sink then the fresh silver-seeming streams.</p>
                     <p>And thus we see how the sea comes to be salt. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth to shew why rivers be not salt, as well as seas.<note place="margin">Of rivers; and from whence they proceed.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the better explaining of this, the first thing considerable will be concerning the originall of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and rivers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> handled them amongst Meteors of a watry<note place="margin">Arist. de Met. lib. 1. cap. 13.</note> kinde, because he supposed that there was the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of rivers within the earth, which was of watry Meteors in the aire above the earth. For if this aire (saith he) coming neare to the nature of a vapour, is by cold turned into water; then the aire which is in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the earth, may be, by the same cause, conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into water also. According to which grounds, we cannot but make this the originall of fountains and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; namely, that they are ingendred in the hollow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities of the earth, and derive both their birth and continuall sustenance from the aire; which piercing the open chinks or <hi>chasma's</hi> of the earth, and congealed by
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18622:110"/>
the cold of those places, dissolveth into water (as we see the aire in winter nights to be melted into a pearlie dew, sticking on our glasse windows) and being grown to some quantitie, it will either finde a way, or make a way to vent its superfluitie. All which agreeth very well to the nature of the aire, which seeing it is hot and moist, the heat being gone it is thickened, and so easily turned into water.</p>
                     <p>And as for a continuall running of rivers caused by this water, it is (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) by a perpetuall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of new aire.</p>
                     <p>But to this opinion we may not absolutely make sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription; for although aire may be thus converted into water, yet the sole matter of rivers cannot come from hence: it may haply be an helping cause, but not a prime, or principall cause. For first, sith the aire is a thin subtil bodie, there is necessarily required an abundance of aire to make but a little quantitie of water; insomuch that it is not doubted by some without cause, whether the dennes and hollow places of the earth be vast enough to receive so much aire as can make water enough to runne along, untill it break out into a river or spring. Secondly, there be many fountains which have (as it were) a kinde of ebbing and flowing at certain direct and set times, which they keep as constantly as the very sea it self.

                     <p>For concerning springs, it is true indeed that they are
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18622:111"/>
fresh; and this freshnesse, notwithstanding their salt originall, may be ascribed to percolation and straining through the narrow spungie passages of the earth, which makes them leave behinde (as an exacted toll) the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, thicknesse, and saltnesse. So that you see, sea wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (though in it self of a salt and brackish savour) by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through divers windings and turnings of the earth, is deprived of all unpleasantnesse: and by how much the spring-heads of rivers are<note n="p" place="margin">Putei prope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, falsi; longiùs, minùs; procul, nihil. Ial. Scal. exercitat. 50.</note> remote from the sea, by so much are their waters affected with a delightfull relish: yea and why they ascend up to the highest mountains, already hath been declared. Unto which may be added, that they come not with a direct course from the sea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those hills; neither do they ascend directly upwards on the sudden, but by degrees: and so, winding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves through many crooked passages and turnings, they do (as it were) scrue themselves up to the convenientest place of breaking out; and cannot go back, because the sea is a farre heavier bodie then the vein that cometh from it; even as the bloud in our veins is nothing in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the liver, from whence each vein of bloud hath its first beginning.</p>
                     <p>But I draw towards a conclusion, adding in the last<note place="margin">The benefit and use of waters.</note> place, that of waters (be they seas, or rivers) we have a threefold use and benefit.</p>
                     <p>First, that out of them, drink may be afforded to man and beast; as it is Psal. 104. 11. <hi>They give drink to every beast of the field: the wilde asses quench their thirst, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that running through the earth, as bloud through the bodie, by interlacing it, and sometimes overwhelming it, they make the earth able to produce those fruits which are necessary for the life of man: which benefit of overflowing, so fattens the whole land of Egypt, that the priests of that countrey did thereupon ascribe the beginning of time, or of every thing that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18622:112"/>
now is, to that time of the yeare when their <hi>Nilus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed, or when it first began to lift up it self above the banks, and diffuse an ample portion of manuring bountie into the lap of the land: which is as good to them as if <hi>Iupiter</hi> should descend in a golden shower. And for other places, where there be no such luckie flouds, there it is found that these bounteous watrie bodies yeelding vapours, do purchase for them such dropping showers of rain, that <hi>the valleys stand so thick with corn, that they laugh and sing:</hi> and therefore these are great benefits challenging most humble thanks; as it is Psal. 107.</p>
                     <p>The third is, that they can quell the rage of the hottest element, and keep our mansions from cinders, or a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie conversion into ashes.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is, that they yeeld us an easinesse and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse of conduct and traffick, by which each place partaketh of the blessings of every place.</p>
                     <p>Yea these, and many more, are the benefits of water, without which the life of man could not be sustained. But here I contract my sails, and end this question: for by coming on the shore, I shall the better view that which remaineth concerning this liquid element. Wherefore it followeth.</p>

                     <p>The next and last question propounded, was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Quest. 7.</hi> Wherein is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cause of the ebbing and flowing of the sea.</note> the fluxion and refluxion of the sea; wherein I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (as neare as I can) to shew, both why seas have that alternate motion, as also why such murmuring brooks and rivers, as do not ebbe and flow, are destitute of the foresaid courses.</p>
                     <p>The motion of the sea is either naturall, or violent. The first is performeth on its own accord: the other it doth not, but by some externall force compelling it.</p>
                     <p>The first, being a naturall motion, is such as is in every other water; namely that all waters do evermore flow into the lowest place, because they have an heavinesse
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18622:112"/>
or ponderositie in them. And thus the ocean naturally floweth from the North, where it is highest, unto the South as the lower place: for<note n="q" place="margin">Zanch. Tom. 3. lib. 4 cap. 1. quest. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now this motion is called a motion of Equation; because it is for this end, namely that the <hi>superficies</hi> of the water may be made equall, and distant alike on every side from the centre of gravitie.</p>
                     <p>The other, being that which dependeth upon some externall cause, is such as may be distinguished into a threefold motion. One is rapt, and caused by force of the heavens, whereby it floweth from <note n="*" place="margin">Note that this is pertinent to the openest seas, as the Atlantick and Southseas, and especially between the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, where is a constant Easterly breath caused by the superiour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which draw together with them, not onely the element of fire, but of the aire and water also.</note> East to West. The second is a motion of Libration, in which the sea striving to poise it self equally, doth (as it were) wave from one opposite shore to another. And note that this is onely in such as are but strait and narrow seas, being a kinde of trepidation in them, or (as I said before) a motion of Libration; just like a rising and falling of the beam of an equall-poised balance, which will not stand still, but be continually waving to and fro. The third and last is <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procatio,</hi> or <hi>Aestus maris,</hi> called the ebbing and flowing of the sea.</p>
                     <p>The cause of which hath added no little trouble, nor small perplexitie, to the brains of the best and greatest Philosophers. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that master of knowledge, helps us little or nothing in this question.

                     <p>But leaving <hi>Aristotle,</hi> we shall finde as little help from his master <hi>Plato,</hi> who (as did also the Stoicks) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the cause to the breath of the world. Such also have been the fancies of others; among whom, <hi>Kepler</hi> may not be forgotten, who in good earnest affirmeth and beleeveth that the earth is a great living creature, which with the mightie bellows of her lungs first draweth in the waters into her hollow bowels, then by breathing respires them out again. A prettie fiction this; and well worthy the pen of some fabling poet, rather then to be spoken in good sober sadnesse, and affirmed as a truth.</p>
                     <p>Others would have the cause to be by reason of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the holes of the earth forced out by spirits; which comes something neare to that before concerning the breath of the world.</p>
                     <p>A third sort attribute the cause to the circular motion of the earth; affirming that there is a daily motion of the earth round about the heavens, which it performeth in 24 houres: the heavens in the mean time onely seeming to move, and not moving in very deed. This opinion came first from the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and is defended by
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18622:113"/>
the <hi>Copernicanians</hi> as an effect of the foresaid motion. As for example; the earth moving swiftly round, the water not able to follow the motion, is left behinde, and caused to flow to and fro; like as in a broad shallow vessel may be seen: for put water in such a vessel, and let it be swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pulled forward, and then you shall see that by being left behinde, it will beat it self against the one side, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other can at all partake of its company: and so it is also in the earth, leaving the waters behinde whilest it moveth.</p>
                     <p>But if this opinion be true; first tell me how it comes<note place="margin">The earth hath no circular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to passe that the sea doth not ebbe and flow alwayes at one and the same time, but altereth his course, and is every day about one houre later then other. Secondly, shew me why the tides are at one time of the moneth higher then at another. Thirdly, let me be informed why broad lakes and large rivers do not flow as well as seas. Fourthly, let me be rightly instructed how it comes to passe that things tend to the earth as their centre, if the sunne (as <hi>Copernicus</hi> and his followers imagine) be the centre of the world. Fifthly, shew me why the aire in the middle Region is not rather hot then cold: for surely if the earth should move round with a diurnall motion, as they maintain, then the middle Region must be either farre higher then it is, or else the aire would be so heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by going round, that the coldnesse in it would be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little or none at all; for it is a ruled case, that <hi>Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio à motu circulari dat quietem, frigiditatem, et gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; sicut propinquitas dat motum, calorem, et levitatem:</hi> and thereupon it comes to passe that we have coldnesse in the middle Region, the cause first beginning it being in respect of the hills which hinder the aire from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion of the heavens; as in <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. chap. 4. sect. 2. and chap. 5. sect. 2. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph 1.</note> two severall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the second dayes work I have declared. Sixthly, I would also know why an arrow being shot upright
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18622:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should fall neare upon the same place where the shooter standeth, and not rather fall beyond him, seeing the earth must needs carry him farre away whilest the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row flyeth up and falleth down again: or why should a stone, being perpendicularly let fall on the West side of a tower, fall just at the foot of it; or on the East side, fall at all, and not rather be forced to knock against it? We see that a man in a ship at sea, throwing a stone upright, is carried away before the stone falleth; and if it be mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in any reasonable height, not onely he which cast it, but the ship also is gone. Now why it should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the motion of the earth, I do not well perceive. If you say that the earth equally carries the shooter, aire, arrow, tower, and stone; then methinks you are plainly convinced by the former instance of the ship: or if not by that, then by the various flying of clouds, and of birds; nay, of the smallest grashopper, flie, flea, or gnat, whose motion is not tied to any one quarter of the world, but thither onely whither their own strength shall carry them: some flying one way, some another way, at one and the same time. We see that the winde sometimes hindereth the flight of those prettie creatures; but we could never yet perceive that they were hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the aire; which must needs hinder them if it were carried alwayes one way by the motion of the earth: for from that effect of the earths motion, this effect must needs also be produced.</p>

                     <p>Unto which I must first answer, that in these mensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations we must not think to come so neare the truth, as in those things which are subject to sense, and under our hands: For we oft times fail, yea even in them, much more therefore in those which are remote, and (as it were) quite absent, by reason of their manifold distance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I also answer, that the wonder is not more in the swiftnesse of the motion, then in the largenesse of the circumference: for that which is but a slow motion in a little circuit (although it be one and the same moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on still) must needs be an extraordinary motion in a greater circle; and so, I say, the wonder is not more in the motion then in the largenesse of the circumference. Wherefore, he that was able, by the power of his word, to make such a large-compassed bodie, was also able so to make it, that it should endure to undergo the swiftest motion that the quickest thought can keep pace with, or possibly be forged in imagination: For <hi>his works are wonderfull, and in wisdome he hath made them all.</hi>

                     <p>Besides, do but go on a while, and adhere a little to the sect of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and then you shall finde so large a space between the convexitie of Saturns sphere, and the concavitie of the eighth sphere (being more then 20 times the distance of Saturn from us, and yet void of bodies, and serving to no other purpose but to salve the annuall motion of the earth) so great a distance, I say, that thereby that proportion is quite taken away which God the Creatour hath observed in all other things; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them all <note n="*" place="margin">Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Neither do I think after this that it was the earth which went back, but the sunne upon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz<note place="margin">Esay 38. 8.</note> his diall in the dayes of Ezekias. For when God had made the earth, what said he? did he bid it move round about the heavens, that thereby dayes, weeks, moneths and yeares might be produced? No. What then?

And for motion, it was absolutely and directly bestowed upon the heavens and starres: witnesse those very words appointing to the sunne and moon their courses; setting them in the heavens so as they should never rest, but be for signes, and for seasons, for dayes and for yeares. And<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> so also the wise <note n="*" place="margin">Ecclus. 46. 4.</note> Siracides understood it, saying, <hi>Did not the sunne go back by his means, and was not one day as long as two?</hi>

                     <p>I conclude therefore, and concluding cannot forget that sweet meditation of a religious and learned <note n="*" place="margin">Bish.

                     </p>
                     <p>And now, laying all together, if the cause be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the effect perisheth. My meaning is no more but thus; that seeing the earth is void of motion, the ebbing and flowing of the sea cannot be caused by it, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon some other thing.</p>
                     <p>Or again, were it so that the earth had such a motion,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18622:115"/>
I should scarce beleeve that this ebbing and flowing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on it. For (as I said before) if this were the cause, it could never be that the course of ebbs and flouds should keep such a regular alteration as they do day by day: Neither could it produce a cause why the tides should be more at one time of the moneth then at another: Nor yet (as some suppose) could the waters be suffered to flow back again, but alwayes must be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on as fast as they can, toward the Eastern part of the world. But I leave this and come to another.</p>
                     <p>It was a mad fancie of him who attributed the cause to an Angel, which should stand in a certain place of the world, and sometimes heave up the earth above the waters, sometimes constraining it to sink below them. In an ebbe, he heaves it up; and in a floud he lets it sink.</p>
                     <p>As improbable also is that of some others who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine one Angel to be an Angel of the water, whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is (as in the pool of <hi>Bethesda</hi>) to move the waters to and fro: and for proof of this, that place is alledged in the <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 16. 5.</note> Revelation, where when the vials were poured out upon the kingdome of the beast, one of the Angels is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Angel of the waters. But know that the same an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer made before concerning the moving of the windes, will serve to stop this gap. Or were it so that we must be tied to a literall sense, the compulsion overthrows the assertion; because he is called an Angel of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not for that he causeth them to ebbe and flow, but because it was his office to corrupt them and turn them into bloud.</p>
                     <p>More probable was their opinion who attribute the cause to certain subterranean or under-sea fires, whose matter is of neare akin to the matter of the Moon; and therefore, according to her motion, they continue their times of burning: and burning, they make the sea
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18622:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so to boyl as that it is a tide or high-water; but going out, the sea sinks again.</p>
                     <p>But now if this opinion were true, then the water in a tide would be thinner, through the heat which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it to ascend, thinner then at other times: and so a ship carrying one and the same weight, would sink deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a floud then in an ebbe; which experience shews to be otherwise. Yea were it so that there were such supposed fires in the bottome of the sea, causing it to swell up like boyled water, then it would also follow that the sea-water would be so hot that it might not be touched: For if the heat of the supposed fire be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make it ascend, it is sufficient also to make it hot: which would appeare lesser in an ebbe then in a floud.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, omitting these and the like opinions, the<note place="margin">This is the most probable cause why the Sea ebbs and flows.</note> most allowable is to attribute this flux and reflux, to the effects of the divers appearances of the Moon: For we see by experience, that according to the courses of the Moon, the tides are both ordered and altered. By which it is not improbable that the waters are drawn by the power of the Moon, following her daily moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even as she is carried with the <hi>Primum Mobile.</hi> Yea were it not so that the sea were hindered by some accident, some have supposed that these waters would go round from East to West in 24 houres; and so round again, even day by day. The accident hindering this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion, is in regard that the West ocean sea is shot in between the firm land of America on the West part, and the main land of Africa and Europe on the East part. But were it so that there were no such accidentall let in the sea, to be hindered by the land, it would order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the Moon, and go daily round: And seeing also it is hindered by such an impediment, it is a probable conjecture to think, that it cannot but be forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18622:116"/>
for the firm land beats it back again. Thus M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <p>Others there be who attributing the cause to the moon, do demonstrate it after another manner; namely that through her influence she causeth these alternate motions: and this influence of hers worketh according to the quadrate and opposite aspects of her position in the heavens; or according to the quadrate and opposite configurations from that place where she was at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. For the seas, <note n="z" place="margin">Sir Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Heydon, in his defence of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Astron. chap. 21. pag. 432.</note> saith a well learned writer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to flow when the moon by her diurn rapt motion from East to West, cometh to the nine a clock point in the morning, or is South-east: then they will continue flowing untill she come to a quadrate aspect, or to 90 degrees, which will be about 3 of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, or be South-west when they cease from flowing and begin to ebbe, continuing so untill she come to 180 degrees, or the opposite place, which will be somewhat after nine of the clock at night, being the opposite place to that from which she began her flowing. Then again they begin to flow, and so continue untill she attain to 270 degrees from her first place, which will be after three in the morning. And then lastly they begin to ebbe, and so continue still, untill the moon come to that place where she was at the beginning: for there the floud begins again. Thus it is ordinarily; yet her illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the sunne and other starres may hasten, hinder, or something alter the moons influence, as we see in spring-tides, at the change and full; and neap-tides, at quarters and half quarters of the moon: confessed by <note n="a" place="margin">Idem, pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 433. cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21.</note> those who have been great masters in Astrologie.</p>
                     <p>And let this also be known, that though the moon have dominion over all moist bodies, yet not alike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of other causes concurring; as the indisposition or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18622:117"/>
unfitnesse of the subject, or for want of matter, and the like considerations. As for example, though it be proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there be tides <hi>in mari Atlantico,</hi> yet they are<note place="margin">Why all seas do not ebbe and flow</note> not to be perceived, by reason of the vast widenesse and profunditie thereof: in other places also of the sea are no tides, being hindered by the strength of some current,<note place="margin">Why fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do not ebbe and flow.</note> which prevaileth: and in fresh water there is no tide, because of the raritie, thinnesse, and subtiltie thereof, which cannot retain the influence of the moon.</p>
                     <p>And note also that in such havens and rivers as ebbe and flow, there may be great diversitie; which cometh to passe both according to the indraught, as also by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the crooked and narrow points and turnings of the banks, which do let and stay the tide from that which is the common and ordinary course in the main bodie of the sea: but afterwards, when it is in, and hath taken his sway, then it cannot so soon reverse back, but must continue untill the water behinde it be descended or eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed into the sea. The river <hi>Thames</hi> may serve as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in this: for it is not a full sea in all places of it at one instant, being three parts of a floud at the lands end, before it can be any floud at <hi>London.</hi> But were it so that there were no creeks, islands, straits, turnings, or other accidentall hinderances, then there should be no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence found in any sea, but the whole bodie should be swayed up and down with a constant course: whereas since it is otherwise, the times for every such place must be once found out, that thereby they may be known for ever.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the cavils of some men are nothing worth, who by bringing particular and rare (perhaps vain) examples, do think to take away this power from the moon. For sith this lunar regiment is pertinent to most seas, and that all our ocean doth follow her; the exceptions taken from certain straits, creeks, bayes, or
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18622:117"/>
such like places, ought to be referred to accidentall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances; as to the unaptnesse of the places, rocks, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the regions, differing nature of the waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or other secret and unknown impediments; such as manifest themselves in <hi>Cambaia.</hi> For it is reported, that there, although the tides keep their course with the moon, yet it is contrary to the course they hold in these parts; for they are said to increase, not with the full of the moon, but with the wane; and so the sea-crabs do likewise: amongst other things the nature of the water and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the region may much avail to this, if it be true. And in the island of <hi>Socotora</hi> (saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Purchas</hi>) Don John of <hi>Castro</hi> observed many dayes, and found (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to the Indian and our wont) that when the moon riseth, it is full sea, and as the moon ascends, the tide descends and ebbeth, being dead low water when the moon is in the meridian. These things are thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and if they should be true, yet we must know that they are but in particular seas, as I said before, where a generall and universall cause may be much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and in a manner seem as if it were altered.</p>

For this is a generall rule, that all waters differ according to the qualitie of the place from whence they arise. Some again are sowre or sharp like vineger; and these runne through veins of allome, copperas, or such mineralls. Some may be bitter, that flow out of such earth as is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by adustion or otherwise. Some may be salt, whose current is through a salt vein.

For the end of the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the waters was, that the earth might shew it self; and not onely so, but that also it might appeare so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and drie.</p>
                  <p>Two things therefore (saith <hi>Pareus</hi>) did the earth in this act principally receive: one was that it might be conspicuous; the other, that it might be solid and drie:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18622:122"/>
and both depended upon the law of great necessitie.</p>
                  <p>For first, had it been continually covered with waters, how could it have been a place for habitation? either man must have been otherwise then he is, or else the earth must, as it was, be uncovered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, were it uncovered, and not also drie and solid, it could not conveniently have bore up those li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, weights, and other things, which tread and presse upon it. Whereupon Expositours well wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that earth is so named from the Hebrew <hi>Erets:</hi> which (say they) implieth a thing trod and runne upon by the creatures on it, and heavenly orbs about it. The same word spoken of particular places, is englished <hi>land;</hi> as the land or earth of Canaan, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Here then it appeareth, that this was that time when the earth received her proper elementarie qualitie: which it had potentially before, but not actually till now. Now therefore, it being not onely uncovered, but also made drie, it might easily be distinguished from the other three elements of fire, aire, and water.

that even as an infant is potentially rationall by nature, but is made rationall in act, by youth or yeares; so it was with the earth, both before and after the drying of it. Unto which let this also be joyned, that the earth is not so arid or drie that it is void of all moisture: for then it would be dissolved and fall into dust. But it is arid and dry, that it might be solid and firm; retaining in the mean time, even in the solid parts of it, such a conveniencie of humour, that all parts may both be glewed together, and also have sufficient nutriment for the things, which, like to a teeming mother, she either bringeth forth, or nourisheth in her wombe.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the earth prepared: and thus was it made a fit habitation for man to dwell on. But, as if man were not alwayes worthy to tread upon such a solid foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we see it often shakes, and quakes, and rocks, and rends it self: as if it shewed that he which made it, threatened, by this trembling, the impietie of the world, and ruines of those which dwell upon the earth.

                  <p>The Romanes, in times past, commanded by publick edict, that prayers and supplications should be made in time of an earthquake: but they must call upon no god by name, as on their other holy-dayes, for fear they mistook that god unto whom it belonged.</p>
                  <p>And the most ancient of the Grecians called <hi>Neptune</hi> the shaker and mover of the earth; because they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18622:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the cause proceeded from the fluctuations and flowings of waters up and down in the hollow pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under ground.</p>
                  <p>Others thought that the shaking proceeded from the downfalls of subterranean dens or caves; and that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whole mountains sunk in, and they caused the trembling.</p>
                  <p>But by that which I said before in the generation of<note place="margin">The cause of earthquakes.</note> windes, it appeareth, that what it is, which is the cause of windes above the earth, is also the cause of trembling and shaking in the earth. For when it happeneth that aire and windie spirits or Exhalations be shut up within the caverns of the earth, or have such passage as is too narrow for them, they then striving to break their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, shake the earth, and make it tremble. Now this imprisonment is said to be caused thus; namely, when the earth, which is dry by nature, happeneth to be watred by continuall rains; then, not onely the pores and caverns thereof are stopped and closed up, but even the aire and Exhalations within the earth, are increased. To which purpose, D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                     <hi>Fulk,</hi> in the third book of his Meteors, writeth, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>The great caves and dens of the earth must needs be full of aire continually</hi> (for there is no <hi>vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> in nature:) <hi>but when by the heat of the Sunne, the moisture of the earth is resolved, many Exhalations are generated, as well within the earth, as without; and whereas the places were full before, so that they could hold or receive no more except part of that which is in them be let out, it must needs follow that in such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys where the earth hath few pores, or else where they be stopped with moisture, that there, I say, these Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions striving to get out, do either rend the earth, or lift it up; that thereby either a free passage may be had, or else room enough to abide within.</hi> I am perswaded, that as in other windes, there be also in this, subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18622:123"/>
fires, which help to move and stirre the Vapours and Exhalations. Neither do I think that the Sunne is the onely cause of shutting the pores of the ground: for then, earthquakes would in a manner be as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and common, as dryings after a rain: Some of the other Planets therefore have their operation in this effect. Which (as Astrologers witnesse) is <hi>Saturn,</hi> being of an astringent nature: and chiefly in earthie signes, must this be produced. For (say they)<note n="n" place="margin">Origa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse this is not altogether idle: For the influence of the Planets is divers, and may as well (according to their places and positions) work these effects, as have any power at all in the changes and alterations of the aire, in the producing of Meteors, cherishing of plants, and the like. And happily it is not <hi>Saturn</hi> onely, nor the bright beams of the Sunne, but other of the Planets also being conveniently placed and disposed, which helpeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this sad effect.</p>
                  <p>Authours vary about the kindes of earthquakes; some making more, some fewer kindes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aristotle, De Meteoris lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. maketh onely<note place="margin">The kindes of earthquakes.</note> two; <hi>Tremor,</hi> and <hi>Pulsus;</hi> a <hi>Trembling,</hi> and a <hi>Beating.</hi> Some adde a third, which they call <hi>Hiatus.</hi> Others make seven. And some adde onely foure: to which may be joyned a fifth.</p>
                  <p>The first is, when the whole force of the winde driveth to one place, there being no contrary motion to let or hinder it. Many hills and buildings have been rushed down by this kinde of earthquake, especially
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18622:124"/>
when the winde causing it, was strong: For if it be a feeble winde, it onely looseth or unfasteneth founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: if lesse feeble, then without further harm, the earth onely shakes, like one sick of an ague. This is called a laterall, or side-long shaking.</p>
                  <p>The second is not so much laterall as perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or upright; which is when the earth with great violence is so lifted up, that the buildings are like to fall, and by and by sinketh down again: For after the winde, that caused the earth to swell, is broke out of prison, the earth returneth to his old place even as it was before.</p>
                  <p>The third kinde is <hi>Hiatus,</hi> a gaping, rending or clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the earth, one part being driven so farre from another, that whole towns, cities, hills, rocks, rivers, seas, and the like, are swallowed up and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen again.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is a shaking that causeth sinking; and is farre differing from the former: For now the earth splitteth not, but sinketh; this being in such places, where, though the surface of the ground be solid, yet it hath but a salt foundation; which being moistened with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter driven through it by the force of the shaking Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is turned into water also. Thus was the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Ocean caused to be a sea, whereas before it was an island; according to the <note n="n" place="margin">Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Concerning which, this I think may be supposed, that <hi>America</hi> was sometimes part of that great land which
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18622:124"/>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> calleth the Atlantick island, and that the Kings of that island had some intercourse between the people of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> Some have related that they were the sonnes of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and did govern part of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> as well as of the said island: in which regard there was knowledge of the late known parts long ago. But when it happened that this island became a sea, time wore out the remembrance of remote countreys: and that upon this occasion, namely by reason of the mud and dirt, and other rubbish of the island. For when it sunk, it became a sea, which at the first was full of mud; and thereupon could not be sailed, untill a long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>me after: yea so long, that such as were the sea-men in those dayes, were either dead before the sea came to be cleare again, or else sunk with the island: the residue, being lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle expert in the art of navigation, might, as necessitie taught them, sail in some certain boats from island to island; but not venturing further, their memorie perished. And not onely so, but also thus: this island sinking, might so damp up the sea, that neither those that were in these parts, did ever attempt to seek any land that wayes to the Westwards; nor yet those who were remaining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that part of the island that did not sink, would ever attempt to seek any land unto the Eastwards: and so the one forgot the other.</p>
                  <p>More I might say touching this thing: but this (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) is more then enough. Yet that such an island was, and swallowed by an earthquake, I am verily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and if <hi>America</hi> joyned not to the West part of it, yet surely it could not be farre distant, because <hi>Plato</hi> deseribes it as a great island: neither do I think that there was much sea between <hi>Africa</hi> and the said island. But I leave this digression and proceed.</p>
                  <p>The fifth kinde of earthquake is contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for as before the ground sinks down, so now it is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18622:125"/>
cast up, like as in the second kinde already mentioned: onely this is the difference, that now it returneth not to its place again, but remaineth a great mountain: an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme whereof may be seen in the busie mole casting up hills in a plain ground. And note that if such a rising be in the sea, it not onely causeth overflowings, but produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth likewise many islands, such as were never seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And thus there may be five severall kindes of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</p>
                  <p>Know also that an earthquake hath both his <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The attendants of an earthquake</note> and <hi>Subsequentia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Antecedentia</hi> are the signes which go before it, and shew that it will be.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Consequentia</hi> or <hi>Subsequentia,</hi> are the effects which follow after it, and shew that it hath been.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Antecedentia,</hi> or signes, they be of these<note place="margin">Signes of an earthquake.</note> sorts chiefly.</p>
                  <p>First, a great tranquillitie or calmnesse of the aire, mixed with some cold: the reason of which is, because the exhalation which should be blowing abroad, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the sunne is observed to look very dimme certain dayes before, although there be no clouds: the reason of which is, because the winde which should have purged and dissolved the grosse aire, is taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and enclosed within the bowels of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the birds flie not, but sit still beyond their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wont, and seem as if they were not fearfull to let any one come neare them: the reason of which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause either the pent exhalation sendeth some strange alteration into the aire, which slenderly breatheth out of some insensible pores of the earth; which it may do though the exhalation comes not out: or else it is that they are scarce able to flie for want of some gentle gales for their wings to strike upon; it being a thing well
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18622:125"/>
known, that birds flie more willingly, and cheerfully, when the aire is of such a temper.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the weather is calm, and yet the water of the sea is troubled and rageth mightily: the reason of which is, because the great plentie of spirits or winde in the bottome of the sea beginneth to labour for passage that way, and finding none, is sent back again; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon soon after it shaketh the land. This is evermore a certain signe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the water in the bottome of pits and deep wells is troubled, ascending and moving as if it boyled, stinking, and is infected: the reason of which is, because the exhalation being pent, and striving to get forth, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth some stinking mineralls and other poisonous stuffe to the springs of those waters; and they, with the strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling exhalation, stirre and attaint them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, there is a long thin cloud seen in a cleare skie, either a little before sunne-setting, or soon after: now this is caused by reason of the calmnesse of the aire; even as <hi>Aristotle</hi> observeth, that in a quiet sea, the waves float to the shore, long and straight. I do not think that this alone can be any more then a very remote signe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be joyned with some of the other signes already mentioned: for although such a cloud may be seen, yet every calm brings not an earthquake, neither are all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alike subject to them.</p>
                  <p>The last signe, and that which cannot but be infallible, is the great noise and sound which is heard under the earth, like to a groning, or very thundering. And yet some say, that this is not alwayes attended with an earthquake: for if the winde finde any way large enough to get out, it shaketh not the earth. Now this noise is made by the struggling of the winde under the earth.</p>
                  <p>Next after the <hi>Antecedentia,</hi> the <hi>Consequentia</hi> of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18622:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
earthquakes would be considered; and these (as I said)<note place="margin">Effects of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</note> be their effects: which indeed be not so much the effects of the earthquake, as of the exhalation causing the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</p>
                  <p>The first whereof may be the ruine of buildings, and such like things, together with the death of many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. About the 29 yeare before the birth of Christ, was an <note n="p" place="margin">

About the yeare of Christ 369, <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> again telleth of an earthquake, which was in a manner all over the world, to the great damage of many towns and people. The like was in the yeare 551: at which time, a quave of the earth swallowed a middle part of the citie <hi>Misia,</hi> with many of the inhabitants, where the voice of them that were swallowed, was heard crying for help and succour. He also, in the yeare
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18622:126"/>
562, mentions another, wherewith the citie <hi>Berintho</hi> was overthrown; and the isles, called <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Again, he writeth of a great tempest and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in the yeare 1456, wherein (as he hath it out of <hi>Chronica chronicorum</hi>) there perished about <hi>Puell</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> 40 thousand people. Also, <note n="x" place="margin">Fromond. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>t. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. but Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet nameth the yeare 1508.</note> in the yeare 1509, the citie of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was sorely shaken, innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable houses and towers were cast to the ground, and chiefly the palace of the great Turk; insomuch that he was forced to fly to another place. Thirteen thousand perished in this calamitie. Again, in <note n="z" place="margin">Idem.</note> the yeare 1531, in the citie <hi>Lisbon,</hi> a thousand foure hundred houses were overthrown (or, as some say, one thousand five hundred) and above six hundred so shaken that they were ready to fall, and their churches cast unto the ground, lying like heaps of stones. This earthquake was attended with a terrible plague and pestilence. And thus do these examples confirm the first effect.</p>
                  <p>A second is the turning of plain ground into moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and raising up of islands in the sea, as <hi>Thia,</hi> in the time of <hi>Plinie;</hi> and <hi>Therasia,</hi> which (as <hi>Seneca</hi> witnesseth) was made an island even in the sight of the mariners, or whilest they were looking on. Thus also <hi>Delos, Rhodos,</hi> and sundry others, came to be islands.</p>
                  <p>A third effect is the throwing down of mountains, and sinking of islands, and such like. Thus perished the Atlantick island, as I shewed before: yea thus also pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, by the breach of the earth, those famous cities of <hi>Achaia,</hi> viz. <hi>Helice</hi> and <hi>Buris:</hi> of which <hi>Ovid</hi> writeth thus,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Si quaras Helicen &amp; Burin, Achaeidas urbes,</l>
                     <l>Invenies sub aquis: Et adhuc ostendere nautae</l>
                     <l>Inclinata solent cum moenibus oppida mersis.</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>

                     <l>Th'Achaean cities, (never lost in minde)</l>
                     <l>

                     <l>Those ruin'd towns and drown'd walls as they row.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>A fourth effect is the cutting the neck of some <hi>Isthmus</hi> from the continent: and thus <hi>Britain</hi> was <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Verstegan,</hi> in his restitution, <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> severed from <hi>France; Africa</hi> from <hi>Spain;</hi> and <hi>Sicilie</hi> from <hi>Italie,</hi> with the like.</p>
                  <p>A fifth is the translation of mountains, buildings, trees &amp;c. unto some other places: of which we may finde testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in good authours of credit. <hi>Albertus</hi> calls this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a vection or a carrying.</p>
                  <p>A sixth is the breaking out of rivers and fountains in some new places: which happeneth by the breaches made in the earth amongst water-springs, through the violence of the Exhalation.</p>
                  <p>A seventh is plague and pestilence, caused by the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous fume of the Exhalation: such as was in the yeare 1531, before mentioned, when <hi>Lisbon</hi> was so strangely shaken: For putrid Exhalations infect the Aire; and the Aire, us.</p>
                  <p>An eighth effect is famine; which may be by reason of the shocks and shakings of the earth, making it thereby become as it were sick and steril. Or else it may be by reason that the long pent vapour carries with it a blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurtfull fume.</p>
                  <p>A ninth is sometimes the discovering of new burning hills; which may happen when the abundance of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone and sulphurous matter that is under ground, is set on fire through the violent motion of the Exhalation: and so it breaketh forth.</p>
                  <p>A tenth is (or else should be) the fear of a Deitie. For if it be the Lords will by this work of his, in his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid nature, to shake it, no land can be sure, no place so strong that can defend us. Nay, the more strong, the more dangerous: For the higher, the greater fall. With the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Last of all, this I will adde: and it is a saying of one, well worthy to be remembred. <hi>The whole earth</hi> (saith he) <hi>is nothing but the centre or point of the world.

Here we bear honours; here we exercise rule; here we desire riches; and here mankinde troubleth and turmoileth himself: here we wage warre, yea civil warre; and make the very earth become soft and fat with the crimson bloud of our mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all slaughters. This is that place where we drive away from us our neare neighbours, ditch in his grounds to ours, and so measure our demeans by driving others from our coasts, that thereby we may be like to him who can freely triumph in any part of the earth. But what of all this? When time, by ending us, hath put a measure to our covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; then, after all, what a small portion shall he obtain, who is dead and gone from all?</hi> O amatores mundi, cujus rei gratiâ militatis? <hi>Oh ye lovers of the world, for the sake of what thing is it that you strive?</hi>

For after God had discovered it, and made it drie, he commands it to bring forth every green thing; as grasse, herbs, trees, &amp;c. by which he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to change a mourning, black, and sad-russet weed, into a green, gallant, rich, enameled robe; and, lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to paint it self in braverie; having green grassie locks, whose hair doth not more adorn then profit; whose rosie cheeks are not more admired, then, for their vertues, wisht: whose frank, free, fragrant, fruitfull breasts do so nourish her own children, sprung from her never resting wombe, that they again adde nourishment to other things; both man and beast gaining by her never ending labours. For God, by saying <hi>Let it bring forth,</hi> did not onely give an abilitie or power of bringing forth, but brought that power also into act; causing this act to be so begun, that it might be continued from thence to the very end of time. And to this purpose we see it is,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18622:129"/>
that the herb must bring forth seed, and the tree bear fruit. For God would not that either the herb should be sterill, or the tree barren; but with their seeds and fruits, according to their kindes: by which it was, and is, that their kindes both were, and are preserved. For first we see the buds spring up; these at the first are tender, but afterwards, growing a little older, we call them herbs: the herbs, being of convenient growth, bring forth flowers: under the flowers, grow and wax ripe the seeds: the seeds being ripe and cast into the ground, do again bring forth the tender buds; and they herbs in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kindes; and so on, as before: by which you may see, how God hath constituted a never ending course in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; being the same in the trees also, as well as in the herbs. For their tender branches do not grow to be woodie, but by little and little; then they aspire to the height and name of trees; and being trees, they blossome; from their blossomes arise fruits; and within their fruits be seeds; and in those seeds resteth the power of other sprouts, or tender shoots.</p>
                  <p>Now some would observe from hence, that here is mention made of three kinde of plants and fruits that the earth bringeth forth; viz. the bud, the herb, and the tree: which by others are distinguished into herbs, shrubs, and trees. But I rather think the bud is to be exempted, and not taken as one peculiar thing proper to a kinde of its own. For (as I have already shewed) that which is the bud, may be taken, either for the tender shoot of any herb or grasse, or else for the tender and unwoodie branches of shrubs and trees: for that which they be in their sprouting, they are not in their perfection: neither are they in their perfection what they be in sprouting.</p>
                  <p>And is it not an endlesse wonder to see the varietie,<note place="margin">The varietie and vertue of herbs and trees.</note> growth, power and vertue of these, the earths rich live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? some great, some lesse; some little, some low; some
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18622:130"/>
large, some long; some, whose vertue excells in this; some, whose power appeares in that: some hot and moist; some cold and drie: some hot and drie; some cold and moist. Of all which I purpose to give my reader a taste, that thereby he may be driven to admire the rest.</p>

When the fruit within these shells is almost ripe, it is full of water, which, as it ripeneth, changeth into a white harder substance: at the first this liquour is sweet, but with the ripening groweth sowre. The tree affords a very medicinable juice; and, if it stand one
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18622:148"/>
houre in the sunne, it is good vineger; but distilled, it may be used in stead of wine or <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> There be wayes also to make sugar of it, and of the meat in the nut dried they make oyl: Of the pith or heart of the tree they make paper: of the leaves they make coverings for their houses, tents, mattes, and the like. Nay, their apparell, firing, and other necessary commodities, they gather from this tree. Thus some. Or, according to others, it is thus described. In the isle of <hi>Zebus</hi> there is a fruit which they call <hi>Cocos,</hi> formed like a <hi>Melon,</hi> but more long then thick: It is inclosed with divers little skinnes, so strong and good as those that environ a Date stone. The islanders make thread of the skinnes, as strong and good as that which is of hemp. The fruit hath a rinde like a drie Gourd, but farre more hard: which, being burned and beaten to powder, serveth for medicine. The inward nut is like unto butter; being both as white, and as soft, and besides that, very savoury and cordiall. They make use of this fruit also in divers other things. For if they would have oyl, they turn and tosse it up and down divers times: then they let it settle some few dayes, at which time the meat will be converted into a liquour like oyl, very sweet and wholesome, wherewith they oftentimes anoint themselves. If they put it into water, the kernell is converted into sugar; if they leave it in the sunne, it is turned into vineger. Towards the bottome of the tree they use to make a hole and gather diligently into a great cane the liquour that distilleth, which amongst them is of as much esteem as the best wine in these parts: for it is a very pleasant and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some drink.</p>
                     <p>There is also among the Indians a tree called <hi>Arbore</hi>

It hath this propertie, that in the day time and at sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting you shall not see a flower on it: but within half an houre after, it is full of flowers, which at the sunne-rising fall off, the leaves shutting themselves from the sunnes presence, and the tree seeming as if it were dead. The Indians have a fable of one <hi>Parisatico,</hi> who had a daughter, with whom the sunne was in love; but lightly forsaking her, he grew amorous of another: whereupon this damosel slew her self, and of the ashes of her burned carcase came this tree.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:18622:149"/>

But it was not long before one of their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, entertained by a Spaniard, discovered the tree with the properties of it; which he at the first held for a fable, untill his own witnesse saw it was true; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was almost ravished with the miracle: but the woman was put to death by the islanders, for her treacherie.</p>

                  <p>Of these kindes I purpose to speak a word or two, which shall be as it were to explain the table to such as know it not.</p>
                  <p>The first, or principall metalls, are <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie:</hi> These are of themselves, because other metalls do not help to make them, but they help to make other metalls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Brimstone,</hi> is said by some to be the fat of<note place="margin">Brimstone.</note> the earth with fiery heat decocted unto his hardnesse; which is the cause that it so speedily is enflamed, and burneth even in water.</p>
                  <p>Or thus. <hi>Sulphur</hi> is a metallick substance or matter, consisting of a more subtill Exhalation, fat and unctuous, shut up within the veins of the earth. It will burn sooner then the fat of beasts: for although it be fatter then <hi>Brimstone,</hi> yet it is farre colder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:18622:150"/>
                     <hi>Mercurie</hi> or <hi>Quicksilver</hi> is a slimie water, mixt with<note place="margin">Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver.</note> a pure white earth; which metall, for the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it doth consist, is thin, cold and heavie.</p>
                  <p>Or thus. <hi>Quicksilver</hi> is a metallick matter, consisting of a waterie vapour, more subtil then ordinary, which is mixed with earth to conglutinate or knit it together; and, by the heat of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> it is digested into what it is. It pierceth metalls, because of the extream thinnesse; which, together with the heat of it, makes it be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall motion: and the motion, by a Metaphor, causeth it to be called <hi>Quicksilver.</hi> Moreover, it is also called <hi>Mercurie,</hi> because as Mercurie is joyned to all the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, so this to all metalls: or as Mercurie is moved ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes, so this is apt for any motion.</p>
                  <p>The lesse principall metals are derived from these<note place="margin">Metalls derived from the two first.</note> first. I call them lesse principall because they are not of themselves, but produced by the help of the other two.</p>
                  <p>These I divide into two sorts; the pliable, and the lesse pliable.</p>
                  <p>Pliable metals are pure: and that, either more or lesse.<note place="margin">Pliable metalls of the purest kinde.</note> The more pure, are <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gold</hi> is the onely purest of all metals, and is composed<note place="margin">Gold.</note> of a most pure red <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and of the like <hi>Quicksilver:</hi> they are red, but not burning. This metall is onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; all other be corruptible. It is perfect, because it is concocted with sufficient heat, and mixture of <hi>Sulphur:</hi> whereas all other metals, either are not so well conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or else they have not the due quantitie of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone: and (as it is affirmed by the Alchymists) because nature in all her works seeketh the best end, she intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of all metals to make gold: but being hindred, either for want of good mixture, or good concoction, she bringeth forth other metals; although not so precious, yet in their severall uses, every way as profitable, if not more: for it is scarce a question <hi rend="sup">f</hi> whether there be more<note place="margin">Moores <hi>iliopia</hi>

use to the necessitie of mans life, in Iron and Lead, then is in Gold and Silver. Gold never rusteth, both because of the purenesse of its parents, free from poisonous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and also because it is so solidly composed that no aire (which causeth all things to corrupt) can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into it.</p>
                  <p>This perfection, together with the rarenesse, and beautie of it, hath caused fond mortals to doat so much upon it as they do. Nay, will not one pound or ounce of this go further then ten, either ounces or pounds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie? The Poets saying agreeth to it,</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>And hereupon I think it is, that most men dispraise this metall, and yet but few who would not have it.</p>

                  <p>These are the complaints. But it is neither in Gold nor Iron or the like, that these evils rest; the causes of ill ought rather to be imputed to the devil and wicked men. For true it is,</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>And thereupon saith <hi>Du Bartas,</hi>

work, as of unperfect metals to make perfect, or else to force nature to his purpose, by his quintessences and Elixers; so that what by purging, what by concocting, what by mixing of Sulphur and Quicksilver, and much other like stuffe, at length he turneth the wrong side of his gown outward, all the teeth out of his head, and his bodie from health to a palsie, and then he is a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and so he must, nay, will be called.</p>

                  <p>The lesse pure pliable metalls, consist some of them of<note place="margin">Pliable metalls lesse pure.</note> more Brimstone; some, of more Quicksilver: neither are any of these two so pure, as those in the mixture of Gold and Silver.</p>

It is hot and drie in the fourth degree, vehemently binding, being of great force to season and preserve raw flesh, (as some affirm) and is also good to beget sound flesh in festered sores, and to stench bloud.

Or thus; It is an impure metall consisting of much crude, earthie, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ust Sulphur, and a modicum of filthie and bad Mercurie. This (saith the Philosopher) although it be hard, yet by daily use it is worn and wasted: the reason being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it hath in it least of Mercurie, and most of an earthie Sulphur. The quenching it in water makes it harder and harder: but if it be quenched in the juice of<note place="margin">How to soften Iron.</note> bean-shells or mallows, it becometh soft: and so also doth the often heating it, and cooling it without quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <note place="margin">Lib. 54. cap. 14.</note>

                  <p>The hard ones, are all kinde of stones.

                  <p>To which it is answered, that although they be not in the number of such kinde of metalls as are pliable, and will melt; nor yet abound with that matter of mixture which they do: neverthelesse they may bear the name of metalls, according to that generall name specified in the derivation of the word <hi>Metalla.</hi> And in that regard I made a difference of metalls, and drew them out in the former table.

                     <hi>Haematites,</hi> or the <hi>Bloudstone,</hi> is a stone outwardly of a<note place="margin">Bloudstone</note> bloudie colour, inwardly like iron; and of such hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that the file can scarcely bite it. The qualitie of this stone is to stench bloud, either in a wound, or at the nose: also, it will eat proud flesh out of a sore. It is to be found either in Ethiopia or Arabia.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Magnes,</hi> or the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> is coloured like iron,<note place="margin">Loadstone.</note> but blewer, and tending to a skie colour: it hath vertue not onely to draw iron to it self, but also to make any iron on which it is rubbed, to draw iron also. It respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the North and South pole; and loseth not this secret vertue, unlesse it be rubbed with onions or garlick: which is certainly true, as may be proved by cutting any of the foresaid roots with a knife touched by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. Some affirm, that physically used, it purgeth the dropsie, and helpeth the flux.</p>
                  <p>Also, it is supposed that there are certain magneticall hills, or mountains of Loadstone under the artick pole, and they are the causes why things touched with this stone, tend alwayes that way. But learned <note n="*" place="margin">In his exercises against Cardan.</note> 
                     <hi>Scaliger</hi> (as well he might) laugheth at this conceit. Again, others (with better probabilitie) are perswaded that the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone inclineth towards the starres of the pole by a secret

sympathie; even as certain flowers and plants turn themselves with the sunne. And for the attractive vertue which it also hath in drawing iron, it is supposed to be also by a kinde of sympathie and likenesse of substance; there being two causes of attraction: one is <hi>Similitudo;</hi> and the other is <hi>Fuga vacui.</hi> Heat draweth in <hi>Fuga va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cui;</hi> and in the similitude of substance, every part is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to draw its own proper nourishment.

                     </note> one) sith iron is as it were the aliment or nourishment of the Loadstone, it therefore draweth iron to it. And, that iron is a kinde of nourishment to the said stone, appeareth in that the filed dust of iron cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it doth long preserve it; and in tract of time the dust will be consumed; augmenting thereby the accretion of the stone. Not that it eateth, or is nourished by it as a thing having life: but even as the elements are moved to their places, as being their end and perfection; so it is in the attraction between this stone and iron, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion which is caused by their reall contaction.</p>
                  <p>This I think may be supposed. But I leave it to the readers further enquirie, and abler examination.</p>

those Spanish mountains would be remembred, where there is a salt cut out, and drawn as stones are out of a quarrie; in which place it afterwards increaseth, and filleth up the gap with more salt again. <hi>Du Bartas</hi> calls this the brine-quar-hill in Arragon.</p>

                  <p>But leaving these, I come to the second kinde of Salt,<note place="margin">Boiled Salt.</note> which is artificiall and made, or boiled salt. For although the matter be naturall, yet the making is by art. From whence it comes to passe, that of one and the same salt water, this man will boil better Salt then that man; and he then another. Yea, some, out of water lesse salt, will boil and make better Salt, then others out of fountains more salt.</p>
                  <p>Many be the places where they make Salt after this manner, by boiling of salt water: neither is this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ours destitute of such fountains or wells. For at the towns called the <hi>Witches</hi> in Cheshire, there is a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie water, which by boiling is turned into white Salt.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18622:162"/>
And the same water is said to be as good to powder any kinde of flesh, as brine: for within 24 houres it will pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beef sufficiently. A great blessing of God to raise up such springs for our use so farre within the land: as also an evident argument, that the Sea is made salt by the substance of the ground; of which I have spoken my minde already.</p>
                  <p>And here unto all this, I could adde the necessitie of<note place="margin">Salts necessitie.</note> Salt; which is such, that we cannot well live without it: and therefore it is the first thing that is set on the table, and ought to be the last taken away; according as one translateth out of <hi>Schola Salerni,</hi> saying,</p>

By means whereof he accounteth them in worse case then malefactours or fugitives, who if they once recover the Altar, are there secured from fear, where neverthelesse the superstitious are in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thraldome: And from hence arose that ancient say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Primus in orbe deos fecit timor:</hi> And hence it also was that the heathen, in institution of their sacrifices, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as well to all their gods that they should not hurt them, as for any help they expected from them. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample whereof we have again among the poore silly Indians, who sacrifice their children unto the devil at this very day, because they be mainly afraid of him. And of old (as it is storied) we have the example of <hi>Alexander Magnus,</hi> who sacrificed to the sunne, moon, and earth, that thereby he might divert the evil luck, which (as he feared) was portended by an Eclipse but a little before. And the Jews did not onely burn incense to the Queen of heaven, but offer up cakes unto her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as in Jer. 7. 18. From which kinde of idolatrie Job did thus acquit himself, saying, <hi>If I have beheld the sunne when it shined, or the moon when it walked in brightnesse: or if my heart hath secretly enticed my mouth to kisse my hand unto it, or by way of worshipping it: then this were ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie that ought to be punished,</hi> chap. 31. verse 26. It ought indeed to be punished, because God Almightie had forbidden it; as in Deut. 4. 19. <hi>Beware lest thou lift up thine eyes to heaven, and when thou seest the sunne, and the moon, and the starres, even all the host of heaven, should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est be driven to worship and serve them, which the</hi> LORD <hi>thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And in Jerem. chap. 10. vers. 2. <hi>Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismaid at the signes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: for the heathen are dismaid at them:</hi> Which is, as if it should be said, The way of the heathen is to worship their gods with a servile fear, and attribute divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

to the creature. But you which are my people, do not you so: for God willeth not that the works of his hands should be worshipped. Or thus, He there teacheth them to have their trust so firmly fixed on him, that what disaster soever the heavens in the course of nature should threaten unto them, they ought not to fear it.

                        <p>BY <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> which Moses saith were created in the beginning, we are to understand all and every part of the whole Universe: whose matter was created at once, and made as it were the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house for all things else; as alreadie in the first dayes work I have declared. Howbeit some contend, that the starres and lights of heaven were not made out of any matter either of the earth, or the waters, or of heaven, or any thing beside; but immediately out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Which certainly is scarce agreeable to the whole scope of creation: For, in the beginning, the matter of all was made. And perhaps, as it was proper to the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:18622:166"/>
earth to bring forth herbs, grasse, and trees, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God in the third dayes work; so also (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) it was as proper to the heavens, in some sort, to afford the matter of the luminaries and otherstarres, as soon as God said, <hi>Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven.</hi> And herein those Philosophers were not much amisse, who defined the starres to be the thicker part of their orbs. Yet neverthelesse not so to be followed, as if the heavens afforded any solid orbs; unto which, as the knots in a tree, or the nails in a wheel, or the gemme in a ring, the starres are joyned. For besides that which I have alreadie spoken of the whole space within the concavitle of the firmament, viz. that it is but aire; yet purer and purer the higher we climbe: which I proved in the second day, both by opticall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, height, consumption, and motion of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, with the like; besides that (I say) there be other reasons also to declare it. For not onely certain Poets have confessed as much, calling the Skie <hi>Spirabile coeli numen,</hi> as we reade in <hi>Virgil;</hi> or a <hi>Liquid heaven,</hi> as <hi>Ovid</hi> tells us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying, <hi>Et liquidum spisso secrevit ab aëre coelum:</hi> nor yet is it confirmed by the testimonie of <hi>Plinie</hi> alone, who followed herein the opinion of ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; but even reason also and exquisite modern ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations have made it plain. For suppose there were solid orbs, or that this concave were not filled with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid aire, would it not follow that there should be as it were <hi>penetratio corporum,</hi> or that one Sphere should cut another in sunder? Questionlesse it would. For the Planets move so up and down that they often enterfeir and cut one anothers orbs, now higher, and then lower; as <hi>Mars</hi> amongst the rest, which sometimes (as <note n="*" place="margin">Epit.

                           <hi>Hypothesis</hi> and <hi>Systema</hi> of the world make it also plain, that the sphere of the Sunne must be interfected by the orbs of <hi>Venus, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mercury?</hi> which could not be if the heavens were impenetrable, or differed <hi>toto genere</hi> from this soft aire wherein we live and move.

For there is that which we call the Elementarie fire; there, I say, and not in a lower place: although <hi>Aristotle</hi> would have it <hi>in concavo lunae,</hi> or next under the orb of the moon; of which see more in the second dayes work.</p>
                        <p>And herein I do willingly also embrace the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> that the starres for the most part are fierie: yet so, as they in some sort participate also of the other ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that thereby their bodies may be (as it were) glewed together, and firmly concreted into a durable lump: differing no otherwise from a Comet then ice doth from crystall, or a cleare solid gemme from bright brittle glasse. An experiment whereof we have in that new starre of <hi>Cassiopea's</hi> chair; which, because it was of a more solid composition then ordinarie comets, and of a nearer nature to the matter of the continuing starres, did therefore appeare like one of them, &amp; lasted a long while with them before it was extinguished: for had it not been exalted to a great perfection and solid composition of the parts, it had been gone, extinct, and vanished, a long while sooner. And in granting to them something of every element (although their greatest portion, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the sunne, be fierie) it comes to passe that they have differing qualities: of which see more afterwards in the Astrologicall part of this dayes work. Neither
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:18622:168"/>
shall I need to stand upon it as a thing necessary for me to prove, whether they make warm the aire and us by any heat which is formally in them, or by the attrition made with their beams. Onely know, that it is hotter in summer then in winter, because when the beams of the sunne come nearest to a perpendicular trajection, their heat is the greater, because their reflexion is the stronger.</p>
                        <p>But leaving this, give me leave to proceed, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute more fully the matter in hand, that thereby I may shew my meaning now more clearely concerning the daily nourishment of these bright heavenly lamps. For (as hath been said) seeing their chiefest matter is of that nature of which it appeareth to be, they must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie be nourished out of some store-house or other; otherwise the world comes to decay, <hi>&amp; impavidum feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ruinae,</hi> and the very ruines will strike him who fears it not. For satisfaction therefore in this, it cannot be amisse to remember the opinion amongst sundry of the ancient Philosophers, who said the truth, and yet erred in declaring it: as <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> who allowed the matter of the sunne to be fierie, and that it was nourished by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours attracted from the ocean. Also <hi>Anaximander</hi> and <hi>Diogenes,</hi> after whom <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and the Stoicks, thought in like manner, that the sunne was nourished by waters: and lest it should perish through any defect of aliment, they fondly supposed that the oblique motion which it had from one Tropick to another, was to finde out moist humours, that thereby it might live perpetually. Now these things very worthily were held by <hi>Aristotle</hi> to be ridiculous and absurd; as in the second book of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, at the second chapter, is apparent. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse succeeding times did in a manner pitch still up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same tenents, and would not onely have the sunne and rest of the Planets, but even all the other starres nourished by vapours and watrie humours, as
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:18622:169"/>
well as they. For amongst others, it was <hi>Cicero's</hi> opinion in his second book <hi>De natura deorum;</hi> making the sea, and waters of the earth, their daily store-house. See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Seneca</hi> in his 6 book and 16 chapter of Naturall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions; and <hi>Plutarch in libello de Iside;</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> in his Naturall historie, <hi>lib</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. whose words are these, <hi>Sydera verò haud dubiè humore terreno pasci, &amp;c.</hi> These indeed spake the truth, but (as I said before) they erred in declaring it. For it is nothing probable, neither may it be granted, that all the seas, or waters in the world, are able to afford moisture enough for such a purpose.</p>

and penetrable aire, and that the starres have no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid orbs to uphold and move them, it may not unfitly be questioned how they should hang in such a weak yeelding place, and yet (according to their times) keep such severall certain distances one from another, as we see they do.</p>
                        <p>To which, perhaps, some would answer, that every starre, in respect of his either more or lesse fiery qualitie, doth either more or lesse ascend from the centre; and so, according to his gravitie or levitie, rest naturally higher or lower as in his proper place: the aire having a like power in the upholding of fiery bodies, which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath in carrying of airie bodies. For as a piece of <hi>Brasill,</hi> or <hi>Lignum vitae,</hi> will sink lower into the water then some lighter kinde of wood wherein there is more aire: In like manner that starre which hath most of his matter from the more grosse elements, takes his place in the lowest room; whereas the lighter ones are naturally seated higher. And indeed this is an answer which would serve the turn and bear out the matter well enough, if there were no starres but those which we call the fixed starres; for they are never observed to be higher or lower, but alwayes of one and the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the centre. But seeing there be Planets likewise whose distances are unconstant, and whose places are at some one time farre more absent from the earth then at some other; nay, Mars is sometimes nearer then the sunne: seeing it is so (I say) their gravitie or levitie cannot absolutely be the cause: but rather ought this to be referred to that infused force which his hand first gave them who placed them there. For as the Sea being stirred by the moon to a loftie flux, and having lifted up his rolling waves above the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring banks, would in all probability overflow the earth, if the Almightie had not infused it with some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:18622:171"/>
qualitie, saying, Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further; as we reade in Job: So likewise the starres would not keep their high and low places at certain infallible times so as they do, and be so orderly in their motions as they are, were it not from the power first put into them when they were placed in the firmament: of which I spake but a little before, when I shewed they were no living creatures. For conclusion therefore, I like well of the former reason if it be referred to the fixed starres; but as concerning the Planets, we see that it holdeth not in all and every part, nor yet is absolutely found sufficient. And yet for further satisfaction of the curious, let it be supposed that the aire is ever thinnest in that place whereunto the sunne is nearest: so that though the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets naturally have but one place, yet accidentally they may be found either higher or lower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to their approaching to or from the place of the sunne; like as may be seen in one and the same weight, if it be proved how unequally it will sink in divers waters, and in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a differing thicknesse.

                        <p>THe former part of my discourse hitherto in this dayes work, was chiefly founded upon these words, <hi>Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven;</hi> and upon these, <hi>And God made the starres also.</hi> But now I come to speak of their offices: The first whereof is that exquisite one above the rest; I mean their bright and radiant shining, by which the dismall clouds of foggie dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse are daintily devoured, and the sweet comelinesse of the worlds ornament made apparent. For without light all things would appeare like the face of hell or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and each parcell of the worlds fabrick lie buried in black obscuritie, &amp; dismall squalour. Whereupon one speaketh worthily, saying, that amongst those <note n="*" place="margin">But how it is a qualitie see afterwards.</note> qualities subject to sense, there is none more fit to shew the due <hi>decorum</hi> and comely beauty of the worlds brave stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, none more fit then light. For where it spreads it self (either above us, or below us) all things are then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compast with such a splendour, as if a golden garment were dilated over them, or curiously put upon them. Let it not then be ashamed to shine &amp; shew it self to the praise of him who made it; For, <hi>Praise him sun and moon: praise him oh ye stars and light,</hi> was Davids song. But to proceed.</p>

It is called <hi>Lux</hi> as it is in the fountain, that is, in a bodie which is lucid of it self; as in the sunne: so saith <hi>Zanchius.</hi> But it is <hi>Lumen</hi> as it is in some <hi>Medium,</hi> that is, <hi>in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore diaphano,</hi> as is the aire, or water. <hi>Lumen enim nihil aliud est quàm lux, lucisve imago, in corpore diaphano.</hi> From whence may be gathered, that that primarie light, which we comprehend under the name of <hi>Lux,</hi> is no other thing then the more noble part of that essence which is either in the sunne, moon, or starres: and so far as a corporeall substance may be given to fire, it may be also attributed to that which is properly called light; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and of those lamps of heaven which were made <hi>ex primava luce</hi> chiefly, and so came to appeare of a fiery colour. Whereupon <hi>Patricius,</hi> writing against the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks, saith, <hi>Lux est essentia stellarum.

                        <p>And again, concerning <hi>Radius,</hi> which is a Beam or Ray, it is no primarie light neither: but rather (as <hi>Patricius</hi> also writeth) it is <hi>Fulgor à Luce exiliens in rectam &amp; acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam figuram, seu in modum Pyramidis &amp; Coni promicans.</hi> To which, <hi>Scaliger</hi> is affirming; saying, <hi>Lux est alia in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore lucido, ab eo non exiens; &amp; alia à corpore lucis exiens, ut Lumen &amp; Radius.</hi> And <hi>Zaharel</hi> also saith, <hi>Lux, alia est pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè dicta in astris ipsis; alia, à luce producta in perspicuo.</hi> Whereupon I cannot but be perswaded, that light in it self, properly &amp; primarily taken, must be an essentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie; as formerly I have related: but to the aire, or other things enlightned by it, it is an <note n="*" place="margin">Observe this difference: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause light com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken is said to be a qualitie.</note> accidentall quality ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God as good, both to himself &amp; the future crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                           <hi>in ipsam essentiam susceptricem, &amp; in eam quae ipsi accidit qualitatem:</hi> yet here the case proves otherwise; because the sunne and starres have <hi>susceptam semel, secúmque immixtam lucem.</hi> And again (as saith <hi>Theodoret</hi>) <hi>Lucem quidem condidit ut voluit.

                        </p>
                        <p>And as touching the brightnesse of the starres, the sunne may well be called <hi>Oculus mundi, The eye of the world.</hi> For he is indeed the chief fountain from whence the whole world receiveth lustre; shining alone, and enlightning our whole hemisphere, when all the other starres are hid. From whence some Philosophers and Astronomers have been of opinion that the fixed starres shine not but with a borrowed light from the sunne. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his 2 book and 17 chap. of the opinions of Philosophers, saith that <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> and his disciples the Epicures, have been of this minde. But according to the mindes of the best authours, and nearest equipage to truth, the starres are called lights, as well as the sunne and moon; although there be a difference between them, either of more or lesse. For Paul distinguisheth between<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 41.</note> the starres and sunne, <hi>non privatione lucis, sed tantùm gradu.</hi> And when God said, <hi>Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven,</hi> he made not the sunne alone, but the sunne, moon, and starres: the light in the starres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in very deed darkened by that in the sunne; which doth but differ in degree from that in them: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is that the starres shew themselves by night onely when the sunne is hid, or in some deep pit whither the sunne-beams cannot pierce. If therefore we cannot see them, <hi>Id non solis, non stellarum culpâ fit, sed oculorum nostrorum hic est defectus: ob solaris enim luminis copiam ac vigorem debilitantur.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>And as for the diversitie of their influence, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualitie of the subject causeth this diversitie. So that though this light, for the first three dayes, was but one in qualitie, it came to have divers effects as soon as it was taken and bestowed upon the starres and lights. And (perhaps) as there is in them the more of this fire, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>otter is their qualitie: but little fire, and more water, the moister and cooler; and so also, the more earthy substance, the darker.</p>
                        <p>Neither do I think that we may altogether exempt<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>
                           </note> the moon from her native light. For although she shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to us with a borrowed light, yet it is no conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to say, she hath therefore no own proper light. There is (saith <hi>Goclenius</hi>) a double light of the moon; Proper, and Strange. The Proper is that which is Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall to it self, or <hi>lux congenita,</hi> a light begotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the moon, and essentiall to it, although it be but weak. The other is that which it borroweth from the sunne; as is seen in eclipses &amp; monethly revolutions: For she is one while full, another while hid; one while horned, another while half lightened; which is but in respect of us, who cannot see what light she borroweth, but as she approacheth from the sunne: for otherwise she is half lightened alwayes. Or (if you please) consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it thus, that as a well polished Mirrour transporteth the light of the fire, or the sunne, against a wall or a floore; so the moon receiveth her light from the sunne, and reflecteth it in the night upon the earth: for the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:18622:173"/>
sunne, being then absent, gives an abundant and free leave to see it. And again, as in a Mirrour, which hath behinde it his foil of lead scratched and torn, a man may perceive certain spots; So in the moon, because her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<note place="margin">The <hi>Macul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>But if it be so in the moon, why may not the other starres shine likewise with a borrowed light as well as she?</p>
                        <p>I answer, Because we have not the like reasons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. Neither is it like (saith <hi>Patricius</hi>) that that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable companie of fixed starres in the highest part of heaven (which is so much more noble then the place of the sunne, by how much it comes nearer to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of heavens) should shine but by the light of the sunne: For neither in them, nor in any other of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, doth any man see a waxing and waning of light; nor yet are they ever eclipsed, but shew alwayes of one and the same brightnesse: and therefore it is not the same reason between the moon and them. Perhaps, if their bodies were composed in the same manner with the bodie of the moon, or had the like proportions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments that she hath, it might be so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but her lownesse shews her gravitie; and her gravitie her soliditie; and her soliditie shews, not onely her own light to be weak through a want of that fierie matter, or <hi>lux primaeva,</hi> which is in the other starres in a differing degree, but also her aptnesse for reflexion is declared to be such, as she may well shine by a borrowed light.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit I do also think that the starres have <hi>aliquid lucis alienae,</hi> which they receive from the sunne. To which <hi>Patricius</hi> also assenteth (as he is mentioned by <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 10. quest. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>Casman</hi> in the first part of his Astrologie) saying, <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit</hi>

                           <hi>quidem omnibus, sed lucere nequaquam facit. Nam &amp; ipsa flammae sunt, &amp; suâ essentiâ lux sunt, non minùs &amp; suis viribus lucere possunt, &amp; lucent. Sed lumen suum eis sol addit, lucémque eorum reddit lucidiorem. Lucem ergò eis non indit, sed insitam adauget:</hi> meaning that the sunnes light inereaseth the light of the starres, making it the brighter and the clearer: which must be understood of them, so long as they are at a convenient distance from the sunne. For if they be too neare, either the lesser light is obscured by the greater (as is seen in the Planets, being often hid by the beams of the sunne) or else such a dark starre as <hi>Mercurie,</hi> will with the losse of his light shew us his dark bodie, which sometimes happeneth, being then seen as a spot in the sunne: For if you take <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> in his best hue, he hath but a cloudie countenance, and a leaden look; which therefore argueth that he hath a thick bodie and little light: of which I shall need to say no more.</p>

                        <p>THe twinkling of the starres is the vibration or trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of their light. Or rather thus; It is when the light of any starre seemeth to tremble. For indeed, to speak properly, the starres themselves do not twinkle, as we think they do; but either from the trembling of the eye, or motion of the aire, this appearance proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For when the eye looks long at a sensible object whose brightnesse excelleth the sense, it then beginneth to faint, and being weak and wearie, is possessed with a kinde of trembling; and thereupon we think that the starre it self twinkleth. Also the Optick Masters confesse and prove, that the forms of the starres are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18622:174"/>
of the sight reflectly, and not rightly: that is, a right line drawn from the eye falleth not into the centre of the starre, but into the form of it reflected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted in the aire to the sight. Now it is manifest, that as the aire hath one motion proper to it, which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; so hath it another motion improper, caused by the revolution of the heavens every 24 houres, which draweth all the airie region about therewith: by which means the apparent form of the starres is distracted, seeming to cast forth sparkles, called twinkling. For if the bodie move wherein the form of the starre appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it must be so: which we may well prove by a piece of silver in the bottome of a swift running brook, or by the reflexion of the starres seen in the same: for by the running of the water the reflected form is distracted, and as it were broken: and so it is likewise in the aire with the starres.</p>
                        <p>But may not this twinkling be seen in the Planets as well as in the other starres? I answer, that not alwayes, yet sometimes it may: and this is but when a watrie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour is neare unto them, which is carried and tossed of the windes with a various motion: for then the forms of the Planets also being refracted in the said vapour, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the sight as if they twinkled. Now this is most of all perceived in the East at the time of their rising: whereupon it comes to passe that the common people<note place="margin">A reason of the Sunnes dancing.</note> have supposed they have sometimes seen the sunne dance, and as it were hop up and down; which, why some have attributed it to such and such dayes, is <note n="*" place="margin">See Seal. Exer. 63. &amp; Goclenius Disput. Phys.</note> fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: For this may be upon any day when the sunne meets with a fit portion of vapours at the time of his rising; and the other Planets may also in some sort sometimes shew it, when they have climbed to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different height above the Horizon: which because it is not ordinarie, some have falsely supposed that the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:18622:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
twinkle not at all. And again, let this be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that (if there be fit vapours rightly placed) Mars and Venus twinkle more then Saturn, Jupiter, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury: but otherwise this appearance is neither in Mars nor Venus, nor any of the rest.</p>

                        <p>IF I should expound the words of Moses so nicely as some have done, the starres must then either signifie nothing in the course of nature, or else be for signes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of seasons (as Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter) and of dayes and yeares.

                        <p>And first let us observe out of it, that the starres, by a divine ordination, were set in the heavens to be for signes of future events: wherefore it is said, <hi>Let them be for signes.</hi>

LET THEM BE FOR SIGNES, he thus speaketh, saying, <hi>They were created, not onely that they might fill the world with their light, but also that they might be for signes of future things. For by their rising, setting, defections, apparitions, occultations, and other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi>

                           <hi>of motion, they teach men to conjecture of the event of things: as of plentie and dearth; of the growing up or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of creatures animate; of cleare weather and storms; of calms and windes; of overflowings and of droughts; of the quiet motion of the sea, and the boisterous times of waves; of the anniversarie changes of times, either when the Summer shall be tossed with tempests, or the Winter scorched with heat; or when the Spring shall be clothed with the nature of Autumne, or Autumne imitate the Spring. Yea</hi> (saith he) <hi>by these some have foreshewed when there should be a shaking or trembling of the earth, with infinite other things which have certainly come to passe, insomuch that it may be truely said, The starres were appointed for signes and seasons.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Philo:</hi> then which what can be plainer?</p>
                        <p>Neither are we to take them as bare, naked, and simple<note place="margin">The Starres are causes as well as signes.</note> signes onely, but as causes also of worldly events: which whilest some have denied, what do they but runne mad with reason, and plainly oppose themselves to more then common sense? For it is certain that the same thing may be both a signe and a cause: a cause, as it worketh to an effect; and a signe, as, being presented to the sense, it leadeth us to the knowledge of the effect: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the starres are called signes, their causalitie is not excluded. Howbeit, in some things, when they work upon a subject not immediately but by accident, they be then occasions rather then causes.</p>
                        <p>But let me enlarge my self upon this discourse a little more: and because some have denied that the starres have any vertue at all, or that we ought to attribute no more power to them then to the signes at an Inne-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers post or tradesmans shop, I purpose to shew the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that errour as plainly as I can, both by Scripture, and also by daily experience.</p>
                        <p>And first for Scripture; Those oracles tell us that great
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18622:176"/>
is the force and dominion which the starres have; heaven being the admired instrument of the glorious God, whereby he governeth the frame of this corruptible world. For had the heavens and starres no force at all, the Scriptures would never distinguish between the sweet influences of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> and the binding ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Orion:</hi> but the Scripture makes such a distinction: therefore the starres have their power. The <hi>minor</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the book of Job, chap. 38. 31. where the words are these, <hi>Canst thou binde the sweet influences of Pleiades? or loose the bands of Orion?</hi> by which speech the Almighty doth not onely shew that the starres have their vertues, but also declare that their power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is such as no man on earth is able to restrain, unloose, or binde it: and here S. <hi>Austin</hi> also teacheth us, that God comprehendeth all the rest of the starres, by the figure <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> putting the part for the whole; which is an intimation that the rest have their severall vertues, as well as these. For further proof whereof see, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some of the other, in Deuteronomie, chap. 33. 14. <hi>Of Ioseph he said, Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, and for the precious things brought forth by the sunne, and for the precious things put forth by the moon:</hi> where we see that the sunne and moon have power to thrust forth the fruits of the earth. And again, <note n="*" place="margin">Hoses 2. 21.</note> 
                           <hi>I will heare the heavens, and the heavens shall heare the earth:</hi> where see last of all, that the vegetation of the fruits of the earth dependeth not upon one or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations, but upon the whole heavens.</p>
                        <p>Also were the starres and lights without power, the Scriptures would never tell us of their dominion over the earth: but the Scripture speaketh of their dominion: therefore they be not destitute of power and vertue. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved in Genesis, chap. 2. 1. and in the second
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:18622:177"/>
book of Kings, chap. 17. 16. and chap. 21. 3. and chap. 23. 5. and in Jeremie, chap. 19. 13. and in Zeph. chap. 1. 5. and in the Acts, chap. 7 42. For in all these places the holy Ghost calleth the starres, the <hi>host</hi> and <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of heaven;</hi> thereby amplifying the divine power of God by the force and power of these glorious creatures: and this also is further confirmed by that in the song of Deborah, Judg. 5. 20. where it is expressely testified that <hi>The starres fought from heaven, the starres in their courses fought against Sisera.</hi> Thus farre Scripture.</p>
                        <p>And now let experience also speak, that thereby they who will not frame their understandings to be taught by the one, but will seek for strange expositions, may be forced to yeeld and acknowledge the truth by compulsion of this other: in the front whereof, I cannot but remember the noble <note n="*" place="margin">Du Ban.</note> Poets saying,</p>

                        </q>
                        <p>1. As for example, when the sunne shifts his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how diversly are the seasons differing! insomuch that although the frostie beard of winter makes us trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and shiver through extremitie of cold, the warm lustre of the summers raies causeth us on the contrary to sweat and as it were pant through heat.</p>
                        <p>2. Also the terrible accidents that succeed eclipses may not be forgotten nor vilipended: for these testifie that the sunne, by his heat and light, quickeneth, after an admirable fashion, all earthly creatures, being as it were the sourse and conserver of vitall heat; and that the moon also hath a great power over inferiour bodies. For if it were otherwise, such lights coming to be hidden
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:18622:177"/>
from the earth, where there is a continuall revolution of generation and corruption, could not cause after their eclipses the nature of inferiour things to be so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and weakened as they are, both in the elements, and also in bodies composed of them.</p>
                        <p>3. And furthermore, who seeth not how orderly the tides keep their course with the moon? of which I have spoken in the third dayes work.</p>
                        <p>4. Also, it is an observation that seldome faileth, viz. that we have thunder and lightning in the summer time at the meeting of Mars with Jupiter, Sol, or Mercurie; and for the most part great windes, when Sol and Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Jupiter and Mercurie, or Mercurie and Sol, are in conjunction.</p>
                        <p>5. And again, the increase and decrease of bodies, or of marrow, bloud, and humours in the bodie, according to the increase and decrease of the moon, doth speak for that horned queen, and signifie that her vertue is not little. For as she fills with light, the marrow abounds in bones, the bloud in veins, the sap in trees, the meat and moisture in the oister, crab, and creafish.</p>
                        <p>6. Moreover, experience also teacheth, that all such wood as is cut for timber, if it be not cut after the full moon, will soon be rotten.</p>
                        <p>7. Also those pease which are sown in the increase, never leave blooming. And (as some report) the pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate will bear no fruit any longer then just so many yeares as the moon was dayes old when it was first set and planted. The <hi>Heliotropium,</hi> with certain other flowers and plants, we likewise see that they keep their course with the sunne. And <hi>Plinie</hi> reports in his 37 book at the 10 chapter, that the <hi>Selenite</hi> is a stone which hath the image of the moon in it, increasing and decreasing according to her course in the heavens. And doth not <hi>Cardan</hi> also report for certain (as Sir <hi>Christopher Heydon</hi>

it may be affirmed that the heavens in some sort do work upon mens mindes and dispositions. And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it comes to passe that Mars doth sometimes sow the seeds of warre by his working upon adult choler, and the like. Or the aire being greatly out of tune, causeth not onely many sicknesses, but strange disorders of the minde; and they breaking out into act, do many times disturb states, translate kingdomes, work unluckie disasters and the like: of which I spake before in the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 5.

                        <p>And now know that if the operation of the heavens in this, be but so farre forth as the soul depends upon the bodily instruments, all that is done to the soul is but an inclination: for there can be no compulsion where the cause is so remote. And therefore let it be observed that it is one thing to cause, another thing to occasion; or one thing to inferre a necessitie, another thing to give an inclination: The former we cannot averre to be in the power of the starres, forasmuch as mans will, which is the commandresse of his actions, is absolutely free from any compulsion, and not at all subject to any naturall necessitie or externall coaction.

                        <p>AS for the power which the starres can have in this kinde, I have, in the end of the former Article, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie declared. Howbeit, that I may leave as few scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples behinde me as I can, my purpose is to cleare this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion a little more. For it hath been the serious perswasion of not a few, that (according to the tenent of <hi>Basil,</hi> in his <hi>Hexameron,</hi> and some others) the dispositions of men may
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:18622:179"/>
not be imputed any whit to the starres, without wrong either to God or them. If (say they) vicious inclinations or evil actions be stirred up by the starres, then God should be the cause of humane outrages, wickednesse, and the like. Or again, if the moderation of our actions<note place="margin">Hyparius Method. Theol. lib. 2.</note> dependeth upon the stars, then many absurdities would follow. For first, those starres whose aspect is said to be evil, should either of themselves be created evil by their maker; or else it must be that in respect of their own wills they made themselves evil afterwards: neither of which may be affirmed. Not the first, because every thing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> God made was very good, Gen. 1. Not the second, because seeing the stars are inanimate &amp; creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life and soul, it were wickednesse to attribute a will unto them.</p>
                        <p>To all which objections and doubts it may be thus answered, viz. that the starres are no malicious agents, voluntarily striving to do mischief to the world; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such as do harmlesly send down their naturall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and powers into the universe: and had it been that man had not fallen, their inclinations in him had been no inclinations, nor their power in occasioning felt any jot at all: The evil proceeds from the nature of man, who lost his puritie and strength of will, in yeelding to that which was forbidden: it comes not from the starres, but from our selves. And so <note n="a" place="margin">Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <hi>Melancthon</hi> doth in effect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that of <hi>Basil,</hi> saying, that we ought in this to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what excellencie of condition our humane nature hath lost; and thereby observe how grievous and evil sinne is, by which our temperatures are become brutish; and not rashly condemne, or without consideration go throw the starres out of heaven. For in this present state of things (<hi>Nè nunc quidem stellas scelerum causas esse,</hi> they be his own words) we say not, that the starres are causes of our sinne; in regard, that though our inclinations
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:18622:179"/>
rise from them, yet they are not sole or chief causes of our actions, but our will is the principall cause thereof, which was first created in perfect libertie, by which it both had power to withstand, even as still it ought to refrain all inordinate inclinations. <hi>Non enim fatalem necessitatem constituimus, nec cogi Nero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem à stellis, &amp;c.</hi> For we do not constitute fatall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor affirm that Nero was compelled by the starres unto his so great and monstrous sinnes: but yeelding to his lusts he willingly entertained those rages, which the devil more and more instigated, and so became worse then his nature (though bad enough) had made him. Hitherto <hi>Melancthon</hi> to that of <hi>Basil.</hi> Wherefore when we fall into a due consideration of these things, and finde that it was the fall of our first parents which hath induced this disproportion between our natures and the influences of the starres, we shall soon see where the fault resteth, namely in our selves. For (as that worthy <note n="b" place="margin">Sir Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Hey don.</note> Knight observeth) we must consider, that the impression or operation of every agent is alwayes answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, not to the power of it self, but to the capacitie and aptnesse of the patient: according to which rule, the starres produce their effects, even as the subject or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, in which their influence doth work. Which is but as I said before, viz. that if man had not fallen, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations in him had been no inclinations, nor their power in occasioning felt any jot at all. For as the fire hurteth sore eyes, but warmeth cold hands; so the starres are <hi>formaliter bona,</hi> although <hi>effectivè</hi> (according to the unapt qualitie of the subject) they produce a sad effect. Or, to use again the words of the said authour, as we see the wine, which is healthfull and comfortable to some, how quickly it hurteth the constitution of another who hath but a weak brain; so the sunne doth soften and melt wax, but stiffen and make clay hard: yet no man for
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:18622:180"/>
this affirmeth either the wine to be drunk, or the sunne to be formally soft, or hard. Wherefore (saith he) by this I may boldly conclude, that although it be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the starres are efficient causes of our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet there is no consequence to conclude them such themselves as the effects are that they produce: for where the fault resteth, hath been declared. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, he also proveth against those who say the starres are tainted in being causes by accident, or occasions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times of ill, he proveth (I say) that every occasion to sinne is not to be accounted a provocation to sinne, or to be held unlawfull: for if this were admitted, we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so pollute God himself with sinne, because he hath made fair women, and sweet wine, by means whereof many men fall; yet neverthelesse none will denie them to be good: for they have their lawfull use and right end. Wherefore he doth here also excellently conclude, that as no man will say, that the Physician or his medicines do sinne, though, when they restore a spent and difeased bodie, accidentally they procure lust: no more are the starres to be accounted bad or to sinne, though in consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the temperature of our bodies, they may be truely confessed causes by accident, or occasions of sinne. The question is therefore resolved, that it is no derogation from the perfection of things created although we grant the starres to have a kinde of power over the actions of men: which power, both how and what it is, hath been declared.</p>

For concerning Noah, do not those authours storie, that soon after the floud he taught the Armenians and Scythians the secrets of these things? Whereupon they said, that he participated of a divine spirit.

Or thus, ♄ Saturn is cold and drie, stirres up and increaseth melancholy. ♃ Jupiter is temperately hot and moist, works most upon sanguine complexions, stirring up and increasing that humour. ♂ Mars, through his heat and immoderate drinesse, stirres up and increaseth choler; and so, often proves an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall cause of brawlings, fightings, warres, and the like, beside such sicknesses as may come by the supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundancie of that humour. ☉ Sol is moderately hot and drie, greatly cherishing all kinde of creatures. ♀ Venus is cold and moist, but it is in a temperate manner; and as for her operation it is seen most in flegmatick complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

☿ Mercurie is said to be drie in respect of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but joyned to any of the other Planets, he puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him their natures, and works as they work. Then followeth (the Moon, and she is well known to be the mistris of moisture. Neither can you truely say that it is impossible to finde their natures to be either thus or thus: for it is but 30 yeares that the longest of these did ever spend in his periodicall revolution: and but 72 yeares (as <hi>Tycho</hi> teacheth) can runne about whilest the fixed starres alter one degree in their longitude. Insomuch that Saturn (whose period is but 30 yeares) cometh twice to the same point of heaven before the eighth sphere is moved one degree: and Jupiter (whose revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is 12 yeares) cometh 6 times to the same place: and Mars (who accomplisheth his period in little lesse then 2 yeares) meets 36 times with the same starres in the same place: and as for the Sunne, Venus, Mercurie, and the Moon, their meetings with them be oftner. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is certain that the great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, is once every 20 yeares; and Mars and Saturn visit each other in lesse then every two yeares: by means whereof it is no hard thing, or as a thing impossible, to finde out the simple natures either of the Planets or fixed starres.</p>
                        <p>And from these natures thus known, and their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and places observed, it is that the effect is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen and the judgement given: which, if it be modestly, carefully, deeply, and deliberately done, by one well versed or conversant in these things, doth for the most part happen as is foretold: for the most part, I say, and not alwayes. For as the Physician knoweth that the same portion of either single or mixed simples, will not work upon all bodies alike; so neither can the like portion and power of qualities stirre up, or work alwayes <hi>ad idem,</hi> but may sometimes receive either intention or remission, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to the indisposed aptnesse of the subject, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or elementary bodies not alwayes admitting of their powers alike; or when they be overswayed by more potent and prevailing operations. For universall and particular causes do many times differ, and then the one hinders the operation of the other. As for example, particular causes (as the conjunction of Venus and the Moon, or some such like meeting) may promise rain, snow, or sleet, when universall causes (which are not so easily seen) do often turn it into more fair and warm weather. And so also particular influences may seem to work upon such or such humours, and thereupon make the bodie subject to this or that sicknesse, and the minde enclined to this or that kinde of action, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such other like things: howbeit it may so happen that nature may be at this time so abstrusely shut up, that what we see not may overpower and work beyond what we see.</p>
                        <p>A man had need therefore have <hi>Argus</hi> his eyes to pierce throughly into these causes, and examine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rashnesse either what may help or what may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; otherwise his judgement may fail him even in things wrought by the course of nature (for of other things he ought not to judge.) And indeed when there is a divers mixture of qualities, all in a manner of equall portions (as it may sometimes be) how hard a thing is it then to finde out (without a sound judgement) the true event! for there be many difficulties proceeding from the weaknesse of our judgements. And for that again which I said before of natures abstruse kinde of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although I be no Stoick to tie Gods mightie hand to second causes, yet I verily suppose that all things are not beyond the course of nature which seem to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie; but even many strange seeming things are wrought by the power of nature: as sometimes in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:18622:183"/>
storms, tempests, droughts, strange appearances, or other like accidents. And this again I also think, that one man may see the cause when another cannot: whereupon it comes to passe that there is such diversitie of judgements and thwarting of opinions many times about one and the same thing. Also I might adde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (which one or other will be readie to object) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the devils permission in raising unwonted windes, storms, and such like. Or I might speak, not onely of Gods power, but of his providence likewise in disposing his creatures to manifest their operation ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place then in another; which is an act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from his secret purpose and divine wisdome: as when the clouds (according to his decree) do disburden themselves of their wearie drops rather here then there, or there then here: For, saith he in the 4 chap. of Amos, at the 7 vers. <hi>I have caused it to rain upon one citie, and it hath not rained upon another, and the citie where it hath not rained was barren.</hi> But I shall not need to meddle further: For (notwithstanding these difficulties) it is manifest enough that the signes of heaven may be both sought into, and also in some ample measure under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                        <p>For it is true that God Almightie having both set and foreseen the course of nature long before, doth now uphold it by his providence, instrumentally to perform his will. Neither every day doth he make the windows of heaven to stand open, or the fountains of the great deep to be broken up; nor yet doth he every day make the sunne or moon to stand still, or the shadow to go back, or an Eclipse to be at a quite contrarie time, or the moon again to arise before her usuall course: but hath undoubtedly left his works to be <hi>sought out of all those who take pleasure therein;</hi> and, according to that portion of sound judgement which he hath given to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:18622:183"/>
every one, they may understand either more or lesse of these signes: For as one starre differeth from another in lustre and beautie; so one mans knowledge and better judgement transcends not seldome above the rest. Neither can the devil every day have it in his commission to go and blow down houses upon the heads of Jobs children. Nay (saith one) if these significations are not to be considered, why are they so divinely written and painted in the heavens? Surely it were impietie altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pluck or draw away our mindes from the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of these things. For if the heavens (as they do) declare the glorie of God, or the firmament shew forth his handie work, we may well beleeve that they expresse what God effecteth by them: for otherwise every thing which God created, doth declare his handie work as well as they. Eclipses, conjunctions, prodigious sights, flashings, comets, new starres, what are they but the Oracles of God? by which, changes, alterations, and sundrie calamities are threatned to the world: And these, if any one contemne them, what doth he but despise the admonitions of God? Also, how much these observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have profited the Commonwealth, let <hi>Thales</hi> teach us: For they that have <hi>Thales</hi> his skill, may by these signes judge of cheapnesse and plentie, of dearth and deernesse, with other like things whose knowledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be profitable to the life of man.</p>
                        <p>Onely beware that more be not attributed to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,<note place="margin">The signes of heaven must not be abused.</note> then to him that made the heavens; not more to the servants then to the Master, as they did who made them gods; or they who trust and rely upon them, not daring to take a journey, or begin a work, or speak with a friend about any businesse, without a needlesse consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                        <p>Also know that the observing of these signes must not be mixed with magicall spells, as charmers do, when in
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:18622:184"/>
stead of using, they come to abusing of herbs: For as the herbs on the ground were not made to be abused in such damned and forbidden practises; no more were the starres in the skie. Neither ought the observing of these signes to be mixed with charactericall practises, diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall or superstitious divinations, making of images un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such or such a constellation, dangerous elections of times, either to procure good or bring down ill from heaven, as they did who blasphemously maintained, that men are long-lived and their souls go to heaven when Saturn is in Leo: or they, who have not quaked to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that when the Moon is joyned with Jupiter in the head of the Dragon, whatsoever a man then asketh at the hands of God, he shall receive. Neither ought we to flie unto them for finding of things lost: for where you cannot argue from the cause to the effect, their use is unlawfull. Nor may we use them in the contingencie of things when the cause is unknown or indeterminate. Nor were they made to decide horarie questions, or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilegious demands. Nor yet may we erect figures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to answer to certain questions: as to know whether a man shall have the thing he hopeth or looketh for; to know what shall become of a mans secret enemies; to know of the speedie or slack return of him that taketh in hand any journey, and of such things as shall happen in the journey; or to know, by the eighth house, whether a man shall enjoy the goods and dowrie of his wife; or by the seventh, whether a man shall obtain that woman in marriage which he desireth; or by the sixth, to know whether a man shall keep or leave his servant; with other the like questions, of which can be given or known no cause, why the starres should ever be thought to effect them: in somuch that it is a kinde of wonder to think how it should come to passe, that ever any one could forge out such inquiries to be answered from the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:18622:184"/>
signes of heaven. For the starres were not made to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the dangerous practises of wicked impostours, nor to give answer to the causelesse curiosities of superstitious demanders; but made to be both signes and causes of such things as already I have mentioned: for when the state of the question is come beyond the course of the foure principall qualities of cold, heat, moisture, and drinesse, it will finde succour neither in sound philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, nor in the holy Word of written veritie.</p>
                        <p>Last of all, let this one thing be remembred, that the constellations (as is well known, and apparently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of Astronomers) by reason of a slow motion which the fixed starres hath, sliding from the equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all point about one degree in 72 yeares, are now remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into other signes of the divided Zodiack, causing those signes, by the qualitie of the starres which are now in them, to be of another nature: as Aries which was hot and drie in the dayes of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> is (by reason that the starres of Pisces are moved thither) cold and moist: and Taurus which was cold and drie, is now of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the starres of Aries, that is, hot and drie: and so of all the residue of the fixed starres, they are removed into new houses, or other mansions. Which if it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably considered, let any mean capacitie judge how grosse an errour may heedlessely be produced by an unskilfull artist.</p>

                        <p>IF we take seasons, dayes, and yeares together, it is no hard thing to see how the whole and parts are joyned. For <hi>Tempus</hi> is the whole: and <hi>Annus</hi> is <hi>pars temporis:</hi> and <hi>Dies</hi> is <hi>pars anni.</hi> Not that these are the onely parts of time; but because the other do chiefly consist of these. Howbeit, seeing they be laid down severally, it is fit they be explained sunderly. And first of Seasons.</p>
                        <p>We need not with the Jews understand here their feasts onely, and anniversarie dayes of solemnitie; for then this distinction of seasons had not been in use till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the coming out of Egypt: neither is it enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie them to the monethly revolution of the moon, or to the sunnes changing into a new signe or partition of the Zodiack. But by the name of <hi>Seasons,</hi> we ought rather to be led unto those <hi>Quatuor anni Cardines,</hi> or foure Quarters of the yeare, when the reviving sunne crosseth the Equinoctiall, and again toucheth upon either solstice: which last, is (as it were) <hi>solis statio,</hi> because the dayes seem to stand at a stay: and the two other have their names from equall day and night, because the dayes and nights are then of equall length, <hi>Sol</hi> cheerfully riding in his gold-like fierie chariot, just in the middest between the Artick and Antartick Poles. For these were those seasons which God again established for ever, when he
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:18622:185"/>
renewed that face upon the decayed world, which by the impartiall Floud was blemished: saying, (as it is in Gen. chap 8. 22.) <hi>While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter shall not cease.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as for us, we commonly call these times by the names of <hi>Spring, Summer, Autumne,</hi> and <hi>Winter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Spring is a time never unwelcome, nor unwished:<note place="margin">Spring.</note> for the weather begins then to appeare like a pitifull and truely kinde-hearted cherisher; and <hi>Sol</hi> ascending, disperseth the superfluous humours, stirreth up the bloud in our bodies, and sap in herbs and trees; clothing the earth with sweet new liveries, and plants with boughs and beauteous branches: nay the harmlesse choristers of the rebounding woods and echoing groves, do then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to tune again their sugred throats, and ravish revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mortalls with their melodious aires; bidding good morning to the day, and morrow to the morn. For no sooner can <hi>Aurora</hi> wake, and peep above the purple verges of the Eastern hills, but cheerfully they chaunt her out a mirthfull cantilene: whilest in the mean time, sweet-breathing <hi>Zephyrus</hi> playes with the wanton tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his late dead, and decayed, but now again revived mistris; and in comely hue doth beauteous <hi>Flora</hi> prank her self, cheerfully coming forth to meet her kinde sweet-causing lover.

                        <p>In Latine we call it <hi>Aestas;</hi> which is, because this season derives the name <hi>ab aestu,</hi> from the exceeding heat: and so also doth the English word <hi>Summer</hi> expresse it. For <hi>Summer</hi> is a word taken out of the Germane language; and in the Germane tongue it is said to be <hi>Sunne-mehr,</hi> that is, <hi>plus solis,</hi> or <hi>more sunne</hi> then at other times.</p>
                        <p>And now come to Autumne (for Autumne is the next<note place="margin">Autumne</note> Quarter) and this is a season which bringeth that to perfection, which the Spring and Summer hath but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. For now the barns are full, the presses and fats overflow with an abundance of wine and oyl, and men do now eat the late gathered labours of their hands, and joy in the surpassing plentie that the earth hath brought them. This time is indeed the yeares very barbour; or (if you will) it is like unto a kinde-hearted prodigall,

                        <p>1. The artificiall is from sunne-rising to sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting, agreeable to the words of our <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 11. 9.</note> Saviour, when he demanded if there were not twelve houres in the day.</p>
                        <p>Now this kinde of day is not alwayes equall, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries according to the sunnes unequall time of rising and setting: and thereupon the houres likewise are to be reckoned according to the dayes proportionable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; being (even as the dayes) longer in Summer then in Winter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="359" facs="tcp:18622:187"/>Also for this artificiall day, <hi>Ioannes de sacro Bosco</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it into foure quarters; calling the first <hi>rubens,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>splendens,</hi> the third <hi>urens,</hi> and the fourth <hi>tepens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. And as for that which is a day naturall, it evermore containeth the just number of 24 equall houres; in which space of time the sunne is carried by the motion of the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> from any one part of heaven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it comes to the same point again.</p>
                        <p>This kinde of day amongst divers nations hath divers beginnings.</p>
                        <p>England, the 17 Provinces, some part of Germanie,<note place="margin">Midnight.</note> the Mysians, and the Romanes, account from midnight untill midnight; because at that time (as is supposed) our Lord was born: and from hence, as <hi>Verstegan</hi> thinketh, came the word <hi>Seanight,</hi> being a week of dayes and nights, or a <hi>Sennight.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Babylonians, Persians, Norimbergians, &amp;c. begin<note place="margin">Sun-rising.</note> at sunne-rising, (and so do our <note n="†" place="margin">Which in them or all within the Parenthesis, though it be here inserted, is meant of the artificiall day.</note> lawyers in England, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again at sunne-setting: for he who hath a summe of money to pay on a set day by bond, neither before nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sunne need tender his money:) These, I say, begin at one sunne-rising, accounting untill the next; according to that of <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 77.</note> 
                           <hi>Plinie, Babylonii</hi> (saith he) <hi>inter duos solis exortus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as for the Umbrians, Arabians, and Astronomers,<note place="margin">Noon.</note> they reckon from noon untill noon again.</p>
                        <p>But the Athenians, Jews, Silesians, Italians, Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">Evening.</note> &amp;c. account alwayes from the evening or setting of the sun; beginning their day when the night approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and the sunne departeth, being as it were gone to his bed or western rest.</p>
                        <p>1. They who begin from midnight may seem to have this warrant, viz. that the sunne is then again returning towards our Hemisphere; and (as I said before) midnight is that time when the sunne of righteousnesse arose to the world. For it is supposed that Christ <note n="†" place="margin">Which is but an uncertain supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> was born about
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:18622:188"/>
the middle of the night, whilest the shepherds were keeping watch over their flocks. The day therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth from midnight.</p>
                        <p>2. Again, they who account from the time of sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising have this plea, saying that the day is fitly to take beginning, when the cause thereof, viz. the sunne, doth first appeare and shew himself to the inhabitants of the world, calling them out unto their daily labours, and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning them by his beauteous light to arise, and leave their sleepie beds. Therefore when the sunne ariseth, the day beginneth.</p>
                        <p>3. Also, they who reckon from noon, suppose that they ought to account from that time when the sunne is in the most <note n="*" place="margin">Which they suppose to be the place it was first let in when it was made.</note> eminent place of heaven, and hath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est number of eyes enlightned by it. And as for Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall calculations, this also is the fittest time, because it falleth alwayes at one and the same certaintie. The day therefore beginneth from noon.</p>
                        <p>4. Last of all, they who begin from the setting of the<note place="margin">The naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the day is from sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting. Gen. 1.</note> sunne have the truest and strongest plea. For this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is agreeable to the whole progresse of the worlds creation, and best fitteth the divine institution of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dayes; being in very deed a true <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of night and day, as of right it ought to be. For darknesse was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diurnall light: and <hi>God</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that light should shine out of darknesse.</hi> And so the evening, as well as the morning, was pertinent to one and the same day; of which see more in the first dayes work.</p>

                           <hi>Artic. 3.</hi> Of Yeares.</head>
                        <p>A Yeare, being the chief and most usuall part of time, whereby the ages of men, of the world, and other things are principally measured, is the periodicall revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:18622:188"/>
of the sunne through <hi>Mazzaroth,</hi> or the twelve signes of the Zodiack, Job 38. 32. For by the sunnes uncessant motion, a set number of dayes are as it were wheeled about to terminate one yeare, and to give each season his due period of time. And in a true measured yeare, there is not alwayes a set or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain equalitie: For there is either the great, or the lesser quantitie. In the greatest quantitie a yeare hath 365 dayes, 5 houres, 56 minutes, and 53 seconds; And in the least quantitie, 365 dayes, 5 houres, 44 minutes, and 38 seconds.</p>
                        <p>But if we reckon according to the course of the moon, then a yeare is that space of time wherein the moon, after some conjunctions with the sunne, is again in conjunction with him, not farre from that place where she first met him. Or if we reckon by the other starres, it is then that space of time which the sunne spendeth after his departure from any starre, untill he returneth to the said starre again.</p>
                        <p>And in all these, the sunne hath the chiefest prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, is the only guide, and most remarkable measurer. Whereupon I may not omit what I finde observed by Expositours, <hi>viz.</hi> that a yeare hath the name in Hebrew from <hi>Shanah,</hi> signifying a <hi>changing</hi> or <hi>iteration:</hi> which is in regard of the sunnes returning, after a yeares end, to the same point of heaven where it began. And as for the circuit of the moon, which we commonly tearm a moneth, it is derived from another word signifying <hi>to ronew;</hi> because in that space the moon is again renewed: neither is it found in any place of Scripture, that these names are perverted, or the one of them taken to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the other; but by the one (say they) is meant a yeare, and by the other a moneth. See <hi>Gib.</hi> on Gen. chap. 5.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quest. 2. and <hi>Ainsworth</hi> on Gen. 1. 14.</p>
                        <p>In Latine the yeare is called <hi>Annus,</hi> because we may
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:18622:189"/>
say of it, <hi>revolvitur ut annulus.</hi> For as in a ring the parts touch one another, circularly joyning each to other; so also the yeare rolleth it self back again by the same steps that it ever went; whereupon it came to passe that the Egyptians, amongst other their hieroglyphicks, used to paint out the yeare like a snake winding her self as round as a ring, holding her tail in her mouth: <hi>Et sic sua per vestigia volvitur annus.</hi> The name likewise <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which it hath from the Greek, is agreeable to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said derivation. And all this concerning naturall yeares.</p>
                        <p>But as for Politicall yeares, they be those which are diversly used by divers nations in their accounting of times: and they differ in lengths according as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatours fail in skill to regulate them to the motion of the heavens.</p>
                        <p>That which we now use is the Julian yeare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by <hi>Iulius Cesar,</hi> who, by the help of <hi>Sosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines</hi> an Egyptian, an expert Mathematician, amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old Romane yeare, and brought it to that form in which we now have it, making it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of 365 dayes, and 6 houres: which 6 houres are not reckoned every yeare, but once every fourth yeare, being then increased to the just length of a day, which is alwayes inserted or put in the next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 6 Calends of March, causing the said Calends to be twice repeated: from whence that yeare is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bissextile</hi> of <hi>bis</hi> and <hi>sex, twice six;</hi> or <hi>Leap-yeare,</hi> because by this adding of a day, from thenceforth the fixed holydayes and the like, do as it were skip or leap one day further into the week then they were the former yeare.</p>
                        <p>Now the mean length of the Tropicall yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defined to have no more then 365 dayes, 5 houres, and 49 minutes, sheweth that this Julian
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:18622:189"/>
yeare is somewhat greater then it should be, exceeding the exactest measure which can be had, by the quantitie of eleven minutes or there abouts; causing thereby by little and little to be an apparent anticipation of the Equinoctiall and Solstitiall points: insomuch that the Vernall equinox, whose place at the first Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> was upon the 21 day of March, is now come to be upon the 10 day of March. The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which errour hath been wished for by divers learned men; and in some sort performed by Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the 13 (using likewise in it the help of <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Clavius,</hi> and some others) who in the yeare 1582, brought back the Equinoctiall day to the same place it was at the said Nicene Councel, by cutting off 10 dayes in the moneth of October, writing in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender next after the fourth day the fifteenth day: by means whereof all their moneths begin ten dayes sooner then ours, as do also all those feasts whose place is fixed and not moveable.</p>
                        <p>Now in this reformation it was likewise ordered, that the yeare should consist of 365 dayes, 5 houres, and 49 minutes. And, that the Equinox might not be subject any more to anticipation in 400 yeares, they thought it fit to omit three Leap-yeares; The first whereof will fall into the yeare of Christ 1715; the second into the yeare 1848; and the third into the yeare 1982, if God suffer the frame of the world to stand so long.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit in thus doing, although the alteration will be very little, yet the reformation is not exactly true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is an inequalitie of anticipation in the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, as the great Masters in Astronomie teach us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as they say) in some ages more, and in some lesse. But seeing (as I said) the alteration will be very little, if it ever come to that, it is fit the Leap-year be then omitted.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow follow the works of the Fifth day: which when I consider, I cannot but admire the harmonious order which the Almightie observeth in the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of his creating. For as yet the world was but like an emptie house without inhabitants; a stately structure, having no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature with life and sense to be living in it; not so much as a poore flie, a fish, or a bird to taste the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of things created and made. But in this and the next day (the building thus framed, and cheer provided) he brought as it were his guests to participate of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates, alwayes provided that things inferiour should serve things superiour: making his best work last, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man, unto whom the other works were put in subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; to shew (me thinks) that the end is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of every thing.</p>
                  <p>And now see, the first day was for the matter: The second brought it into a better form, stretched out the heavens, and lifted up the waters which are above them. The third did not onely shew the face of the earth by
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:18622:190"/>
the gathering together of those waters under heaven, but also adorned it with herbs, trees, and plants. The fourth beautifies the vaulted roof of the sparkling fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament with funne, moon, and starres. In the fifth and sixth he makes all kindes of living creatures; furnishing first of all the waters and aire with their inhabitants; and last of all the earth.</p>
                  <p>And for those many creatures in the waters and aire, their creation was effected in this fifth dayes work; so that every kinde of fish, and all kinde of birds were now produced. God onely said it, and it was done; as by viewing the text of Moses will appeare: For in all his works <hi>he spake the word and they were made, he commanded and they were created.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed. We need divide the whole of this day into no more then two parts: The one of Fishes, the other of Birds.</p>
                  <p>That of fishes is the formost, and therefore the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of those creatures would be first admired.</p>
                  <p>And see how Moses ushers them. The greater ones are placed in the forefront: For <hi>God</hi> (saith he) <hi>made great whales.</hi> And then he proceedeth to adde something concerning the other <hi>species</hi> of smaller creatures living and moving in the water; saying, <hi>And every living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their kinde.</hi>

                     <hi>Porcus marinus,</hi> or the <hi>Sea-hog,</hi> is a strange kinde of<note place="margin">The Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hog.</note> fish, headed like an hog, with teeth and tusks like a boar, and a bending back like a creature begotten among swine: onely his tail and hinder parts is like to the tail of other fishes, and his foure legs are like to the legs of a dragon. Such a fish as this was taken up in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ocean, in the yeare of our Lord 1537, as <hi>Olaus</hi> witnesseth in his 21 book.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>Bermuda,</hi> or in the sea about the Summer islands, they have Sea-hogs of another kinde and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing so big nor terrible, without legs, good for food, and like to hogs in their heads.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Olaus</hi> again makes mention of another<note place="margin">The Swam-fisk.</note> fish, which they of <hi>Norvegia</hi> call a <hi>Swam-fisk:</hi> and this is the most greedie and gluttonous of all fishes. For it is
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:18622:197"/>
continually feeding and filling it self, even up to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mouth, untill he can hold no more; and his prey is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other the smaller fishes. This likewise is his qualitie and condition; when he is in fear of any danger, he will so winde up himself and cover his head with the skinne and substance of his own body, that he is then but like unto a piece of a dead fish, and nothing like himself. Which feat he seldome doth without hurt or damage: For still fearing that there be those about him who will prey upon him and devoure him, he is compelled for lack of meat to feed upon the substance of his own body; choosing rather to be devoured in part, then to be consumed by other more strong and powerfull fishes. These and such like are taken for their fat and oyl, rather then for any thing else which is usefull in them.</p>
                  <p>And unto this fish I cannot but liken all greedy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants<note place="margin">Covetous cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants like to the Swam-fisk.</note> and covetous devourers of other men, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver satisfied with the measure of their oppressions, but lay house to house, and field to field, untill there be no more place; as the prophet Esay speaketh, chap. 5. 8.

But at the last, when they must give an account for all the things that they have done, then being oppressed by fear, as they oppressed others with cruelty, they would be glad to hide their heads, and rather consume their own selves then be given up to the tormentours; saying with them in the Revelation, <hi>Let the hills fall upon us, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains cover us from the wrath of him who sits upon the throne.</hi> But it is madnesse to run from punishment, and not from sinne.

He hath an head like an horse, and will sometimes neigh; his feet are cloven like to the feet of a cow, and he seeks his repast as well on the land as in the sea: but his hinder parts are like to other fishes, and his tail like theirs. <hi>Ola. lib.</hi> 21.</p>

                     <hi>Plinie</hi> telleth us of <hi>Tritons,</hi> and <hi>Nereïdes,</hi> which were Mermen, or Men-fish of the sea. And in the yeare 1526 (as the authour of <hi>Du Bartas</hi> his summarie reporteth) there was taken in Norway, neare to a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port called <hi>Elpoch,</hi> a certain fish resembling a mitred Bishop, who was kept alive some few dayes after his taking. And (as the said authour writeth) there was one <hi>Ferdinand Alvares,</hi> secretarie to the store-house of the Indians, who faithfully witnesseth that he had seen not farre off from the Promontorie of the Moon, a young Sea-man coming out of the waters, who stole fishes from the fishermen, and eat them raw. Neither is <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> silent in these things: For in his 21 book, and first chapter, having mentioned fishes like to dogs, cows, calves, horses, asses, lions, eagles, dragons, and what not? he also saith, <hi>Sunt &amp; belluae in mari quasi hominis figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram imitantes, lugubres in cantu, ut Nereïdes: etiam marini homines, toto corpore absolutâ similitudine,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>There be monsters in the sea, as it were imitating the shape of a man, having a dolefull kinde of sound or singing, as the Nereïdes: There be also Sea-men of an absolute proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their whole body: these are sometimes seen to climbe up the ships in the night times, and suddenly to depresse that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>sinketh. Yea</hi> (saith he) <hi>this I adde from out the faithfull as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions of the Norway fishers, that when such are taken, if they be not presently let go again, there ariseth such a fierce tempest, with an horrid noise of those kinde of creatures, and other sea-monsters there assembled, that a man would think the very heaven were falling, and the vaulted roof of the world running to ruine; insomuch that the fishermen have much ado to escape with their lives: whereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it as a law amongst them, that if any chanced to hang such a fish upon his hook, he should suddenly cut the line and let him go.</hi> But these sudden tempests are very strange, and how they arise with such violent speed, exceeds the bounds of ordinary admiration. Whereupon it is again supposed that these monsters are very devils, and by their power such strange storms are raised. Howbeit for my part I think otherwise, and do much rather affirm that these storms (in my judgement) are thus raised, namely by the thickening and breaking of the aire; which the snortling, rushing, and howling of these beasts assembled in an innumerable companie, causeth. For it is certain that sounds will break and alter the aire (as I have heard it of a citie, freed from the plague by the thundering noise of cannons) and also I suppose that the violent rushing of these beasts causeth much water to flie up and thicken the aire, and by their howling and snortling under the waters, they do blow up and as it were attenuate the waves, and make them arise in a thinner substance then at other times; so that nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all these helps, in an instant worketh to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mariners, and often to the danger of their lives.</p>
                  <p>Besides, shall we think that spirits use to feed, and will be so foolish as go and hang themselves on an hook for a bait? They may have occult qualities (as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone hath) to work strange feats, and yet be neither
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:18622:200"/>
spirits nor devils: for experience likewise teacheth, that they die either sooner or later after their taking; neither can a spirit have flesh and bones as they have. But to conclude, <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro,</hi> in the third book of his geniall dayes, hath written one whole chapter (viz. the 8) concerning these sea-men, affirming that it is no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous report to say there be such: he describeth them to be fish in their lower parts, and like to men in their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts; affirming moreover that they be very venere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and desirous of women, loving them, or lusting after them. Whereupon he relates a storie of a certain woman who was taken up and carried to the sea by one of these Mermen, <hi>concubitûs causà,</hi> that he might couple him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with her. Which monster the inhabitants took soon after; but refusing meat, he died: and they then made this law, that no woman should adventure to come neare the sea, except her husband were with her. This happened in <hi>Epirus,</hi> a countrey of Greece.</p>
                  <p>In the kingdome of <hi>Congo,</hi> which lieth in the African<note place="margin">Another Hog-fish.</note> part of the world, there is in the river <hi>Zaire,</hi> another kinde of hog-fish differing from that already mentioned. It is called <hi>Ambize, Angulo,</hi> or <hi>Hog-fish.</hi> It hath as it were two hands, and a tail like a target, which eateth like pork, and whereof they make lard, and hath not the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or taste of fish.

At last it chanced that the boy, not carefull how he sat upon the fishes back, but unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laying his belly too close, was by the sharp pricks growing there, wounded to death. And now the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin perceiving by the weight of his bodie, and by the bloud which stained the waters, that the boy was dead, speedily swimmeth with all his force to the land, and there laying him down, for very sorrow died by him.

                  <p>Amongst the severall sorts of shell-fishes, the glister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">The Pearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish.</note> 
                     <hi>Pearl-fish</hi> deserves remembrance; not onely in respect of her self, but also in regard of the <hi>Prawn,</hi> another fish and her companion: for between these two there is a most firm league of friendship, much kindenesse, and such familiaritie as cannot but breed admiration in the reader. They have a subtill kinde of hunting, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, they divide their prey in loving manner: for seeing they one help the other in the getting of it, they likewise joyn in the equall sharing. And in few words, thus it is: (of which ye may reade in <hi>Plinie, Plutarch, Elian,</hi> &amp;c.) When the <hi>Pearl-fish</hi> gapeth wide, she hath a curious glistering within her shell, by which she allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the small fry to come swimming into her: which when her companion the <hi>Prawn</hi> perceiveth, he gives her a secret touch with one of his prickles; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon she shuts her gaping shell, and so incloseth her wished prey: then (as I said) they equally share<note place="margin">The Pearl and the Prawn em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes of cheating.</note> them out and feed themselves. And thus day by day they get their livings, like a combined knot of cheaters, who have no other trade then the cunning deceit of quaint cousenage; hooking in the simpler sort with such subtill tricks, that be their purses stuft with either more or lesse, they know a way to sound the bottome, and send them lighter home; lighter in purse, though heavier in heart.</p>
                  <p>The foresaid authours make mention of the <hi>Gilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Gilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> or <hi>Golden-eye,</hi> which helpeth the one the other out of a snare, or from off an hook: for if the insnared fish cannot help himself by loosing the snare with his tail, then will his companion put to his mouth, and set him free. Or if the one see the other hanged on a hook, it

may be easily observed how his free mate will skip at the line, and never leave till he have broke it off.<note place="margin">An embleme of friendship.</note> Which may serve well to teach us, that we ought not to leave our friends in danger, but do the best and utmost that we can to set them free.

                  <p>The <hi>Plaice,</hi> if it be well grown, and something<note place="margin">The Plaice</note> thick, is said to be a passing good fish: It takes the name from <hi>Placeo, to please,</hi> because it pleaseth the palate.</p>

                  <p>FRom fishes I must come to birds, from the water to the aire, and teach my pen to flie a while with the feathered fowls, as before it was swimming with the fearfull silent fish.</p>
                  <p>And now why God hath joyned the creation of fish and fowl together, may without curiositie be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; to wit, because he would in every work and part thereof continue an harmonious order. Great is the likenesse between fish and fowl, whether it be that we consider the naturall place wherein either of them live, or that we consider their resemblance in parts, or their manner of motion. For first, the place of fishes is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the place of fowls the aire: both which are diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, cleare, moist, and easie yeelding elements. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which finnes be to fishes, wings and feathers are to birds. And thirdly, that which swimming is to fishes
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:18622:206"/>
in the waters, flying is to birds in the aire. The one moves himself by his sinnes, the other by his wings. The one cuts and glideth through the liquid aire, the other shoots and darteth through the humid water. The one makes paths in that subtil concave between heaven and earth, the other draws furrows in the ploughed sea: and both tracts are indiscernible; either place again closing &amp; no longer open then their native dwellers flit through their yeelding gates.</p>
                  <p>And first of all me thinks I see the loftie <hi>Eagle,</hi> king<note place="margin">The Eagle</note> of birds, towring on high in the heaven-aspiring aire.</p>
                  <p>And amongst all fowls, the Eagle onely can move her self straight upward and downward, perpendicularly, without any collaterall declining. <hi>Munster.</hi> This bird is commended for her faithfulnesse towards other birds in some kinde, though sometimes she shew her self cruell. They all stand in awe of her: and when she hath gotten meat she useth to communicate it unto such fowls as do accompany with her; onely this some affirm, that when she hath no more to make distribution of, then she will attach some of her guests, and for lack of food, dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them. Her sight is sharp and quick, insomuch that being in the highest part of the aire, she can easily see what falleth on the land, and thereupon the sooner finde her prey. It is said that she can gaze upon the sunne and not be blinde, and will fight eagerly against the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon: for the Dragon greedily coveting the Eagles egges, causeth many conflicts to be between them.</p>
                  <p>The Poets have called her Joves bird, and Jupiters armour-bearer, because she is never hurt with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. She is a bird tenderly affected towards her young; insomuch that she will endanger her own bodie to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them, bearing her young ones on her back when she perceiveth them to be assaulted with arrows. Hares, Harts, Geese and Cranes, are such creatures as this bird
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:18622:206"/>
useth to prey upon. And for her practise in killing the Hart, thus it is: when she laboureth to drive the Hart headlong to ruine, she gathereth (saith <hi>Munster</hi>) much dust as she flieth, and sitting upon the Harts horns, shaketh it into his eyes, and with her wings beateth him about the mouth, untill at last the poore Hart is glad to fall fainting to the ground.</p>
                  <p>The Eagle buildeth her nest in the rocks and high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the propertie of the young Eagle is, when she findeth a dead carcase, first of all to pick out the eye. And so (saith one) do all seducing hereticks, first put out the right eye of knowledge, that thereby they may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leade along their seduced Proselites.</p>
                  <p>And note that although the Eagle be very tender over her young, yet when they be able to flie of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, she casteth them out of her nest; because she would have them shift and no longer depend upon their damme. Which is a good example, saith the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,<note place="margin">Parents ought not to bring up their children in idlenesse; by an example taken from the Eagle.</note> for domesticall discipline; namely, that parents should not bring up their children in idlenesse, but even from their youth exercise them in honest labour, train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to some vocation.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth, that when the Eagle waxeth old, the upper part of her bill so groweth over and increaseth, that in the end she dieth of famine. But <hi>Augustine</hi> observeth further that when the Eagle is thus overgrown, she beateth her bill upon a rock, and so by striking off her cumbersome part, she recovereth her strength and eating; to which the Psalmist alludeth, Psal. 103. 5. <hi>Which maketh thee young and lustie as an Eagle.</hi>

                  <p>This bird (if we may beleeve what is written) is about the bignesse of an Eagle, having a glittering brightnesse in the feathers of her neck, like unto gold; in other parts purple, with an azured tail, but so as in some places it is of a rose colour: her head hath on it a plume or tuft of feathers. Some say she liveth five hundred yeares; others give her six hundred and sixtie: and, as <hi>Plinie</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, this bird hath her setled habitation in <hi>Arabia Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix.</hi> When she waxeth old, she is said to make her a nest of Cassia, with branches of the frankincense tree, into which she putteth other odours, and so dieth upon them: and then, out of her bones and marrow, there spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth first a little worm, which afterwards comes to be a young Phenix.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit many think that all this is fabulous: for (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the differing reports which go of this bird) what <hi>species</hi> or kinde of any creature can be rehearsed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is never but one? and whereas the Lord said to all his creatures, <hi>Increase and multiplie,</hi> this benediction should take no place in the Phenix which multiplieth not. And again, seeing all creatures which came into the Ark, came by two and two, the male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, it must needs follow that the Phenix by this means
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:18622:207"/>
perished. And so saith one, <hi>As for the Phenix, I (and not I alone) think it a fable, because it agreeth neither to reason nor likelihood, but plainly disagreeth to the historie of the creation and of Noahs floud, in both which God made all male and female, and commanded them to increase and multiplie.</hi>

                     <hi>Aelianus,</hi> he is thus described; namely that he is a kinde of beast with foure feet, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most of all in <hi>India,</hi> being as mightie in strength as a lion: he hath wings and crooked talons, black on the back, and in the forepart purple. His wings be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what white, his bill and mouth like an eagles bill, his eyes fierie; he is hard to be taken except he be young, he maketh his nest in the high mountains, and fighteth with every kinde of beast, saving the lion and elephant: he diggeth up gold in desert places, and giveth repulse to those that come neare him. But (as I said) some doubt whether there be any such creature or no: which, for my part, shall be left to every mans li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>

Some say his head is covered with small hairs, his eyes be grosse and black, his neck is long, and (as I said) his bill is short and sharp like a sparrows bill, and his feet hath as it were a bipartite hoof. He is said to exceed the height of a man on horseback; and as for his wings they help him little: howbeit we make much use of his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as is well known. And in one thing he is like the woodcock; for hiding his head he never fears his bodie.

Job speaketh that he is forgetfull; for when this bird<note place="margin">Job 39. 14, 15.</note> hath laid her egges (which she hides in the sand, and are hatched by the sunne) she forgetteth them, untill the young come forth, and then the males are forced to feed and cherish them. So have I seen many mothers refusing<note place="margin">The Ostrich like women who will not nurse their children.</note> to nurse their children; and, if they could, would have others likewise bear them: but putting them forth, I beleeve many perish for want of care and due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: for it is not possible that a nurse should have that tender affection which belongs to a mother; and many times, with the nurses milk, the children suck the nurses vices. Necessitie therefore, and a prudent choice, should seek out nurses; as we see it Gen. 21. 7. Moreover it is said, that this bird is of such strong digestion that she will eat iron: and when she seeth that she cannot avoid taking, she casteth stones with her claws against her followers, by which she often hurteth them.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Kite</hi> is well known: she is a fowl which flieth<note place="margin">The Kite.</note> softly untill she espie her prey; she hath quick eyes, will flie high into the aire in hot cleare weather, and by the turning of her tail she directs her bodie, even as a great lazie ship is ordered by the helm. <hi>Aristotle</hi> observes that all such fowls as have talons, cannot devoure any meat but flesh: and if any other food be thrust into their mouthes, they cannot eat it.</p>
                  <p>There is great enmitie between the kite and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">Emblemes from the Kite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the covetous gripers of this world.</note> it being an usuall thing for the kite to robbe the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as being better in talons and flying.

another, the lesse mightie alwayes devoured by the<note place="margin">Envie shadowed forth.</note> stronger and more potent. And (me thinks) the kites feeding upon carrion, is a fit embleme of the envious person, who rejoyceth in the fall of others: for there be many in the world who care not what men fall, so they may rise; building their own houses out of the bloud and ruine of others.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, it is observed by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that the kite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ravenous bird, bringeth forth but two young ones at a time; wherein nature hath been very provident and carefull, to suffer such ravenous fowls to increase no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. And so (saith one) it is commonly seen in the world, that many rich cormorants (or corn-vorants ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) are either childlesse and have no children, or else they abound not in many; and yet we can see no end of their scraping, pinching, and oppressing. <hi>There is one alone</hi> (saith Solomon) <hi>and there is not a second, which hath neither sonne nor brother, and yet there is no end of all his travell,</hi> Eccles. 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Raven</hi> also is a fowl given to rapacitie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring<note place="margin">The Raven</note> of flesh, great of bodie, slow in slight, sharp in sight, frequenting much the countreys of <hi>Italie, Spain, Egypt,</hi> and about the Alps. But this (saith <hi>Munster</hi>) is to be understood of the great kinde of ravens.</p>
                  <p>This fowl doth greatly above all others covet mens carcases, and (as some think) by a singular instinct and naturall gift, it hath understanding of mans death, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saging it a few dayes before. But whether that be true or not, this is certain, that it haunteth places of battell, with solitarie ruines; and like to the young eagles, it picketh out the eye of a dead corps first of all, because (as some suppose) he seeth his own image in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the eye; and so like coveteth the like. The fox<note place="margin">An emblem from the Fox and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, concerning compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And so have I seen one man love another the better, for hating him whom he abhorreth: or one, like the fox, will sometimes plot anothers ruine, that the other, like the raven, may prey upon him.</p>

                  <p>The ancient Emperours of Rome, and other heathen Princes, had their Soothsayers, and beholders of birds: now these gave great heed to the ravens, and would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently look upon their eyes; marking, in time of warre, to what part they turned: for they supposed that the raven did presage which side should perish in battell; and would alwayes therefore have her eye fixed or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that way, or to that partie; as it were shewing her longing desire to be feeding on their carcases. Which is somewhat confirmed by that which <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth of the ravens flying out of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Peloponnesus;</hi> saying, <hi>Nam cùm Mediae hospites occisi sunt, omnes è Peloponneso &amp; Attica regione volaverunt.

For as the raven delighteth in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie or desert mansions, Isai. 34. 11. so doth the devil walk through desert places, as we see it, Matth. 12. 43.

It is therefore called by some a <hi>Flittermouse,</hi> and is no bird but a winged mouse; for she creeps with her wings, is without feathers, and flyeth with a kinde of skin, as bees and flies do; excepting that the Bats wing hath a farre thicker and stronger skin.

                  </p>
                  <p>This the said authour affirmeth with much confidence; and doth likewise say, that some young men have taken this masse, and by heating of it, the Swallows have been again disjoyned, beginning to fly: but they lived not long, because their time should have been a great while more to bring them to perfection.

                  <p>Neither doth the cock tread the hen, before he hath courteously saluted her with a kisse. For the hen will not have company with him, untill that first debt be duely paid. Some (who write of India) report that there be Pigeons in that countrey of a yellow colour. And as for
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:18622:215"/>
Stock-doves, they differ from Pigeons, because the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon is somewhat bigger, and not altogether so wilde. But the Ring-dove is much greater then any of them, and is thought to live about thirtie or fourtie yeares.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, Pigeons take great delight to sit by the banks of waters and crystall streams: which some think to be, in regard that (like women) they love to behold themselves, as in a mirrour or glasse. And if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath taught them that piece of pride, it brings them no small profit: for whilest they thus sit by the water side, they can soon perceive when the Hawk is coming towards them, because his shadow or image will appeare in the water; and so being fore-warned, they cannot but be fore-armed, and prepared against such mischief as that devouring bird intendeth to them.</p>

And as for the sustenance which keeps this fowl alive, although it be
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:18622:220"/>
hard to say upon what it is maintained, I do easily think that we may listen to them, who suppose that they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish themselves, and maintain their lives by the dew that falleth, and the flowers of the spices. See <hi>Gesner de Avibus, lib.</hi> 3.</p>

                     <hi>Pigafetta,</hi> who witnesseth that it is a bird having two feet as well as other birds; but as soon as they be taken, they are cut off, with a great part of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, where of a little is left with the head and neck, which being hardened and dryed in the sunne, seem to be so bred. And other authours witnesse that there was one of them sold to the Emperour in the yeare 1605, which had legs on it.</p>

                     <hi>Cardan</hi> likewise mentions this bird; but seeing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is differing from our modern writers and travellers, I forbear to rehearse it: Howbeit they who reade <hi>Gesner</hi> shall see it in his third book of birds, together with a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of this fowl.</p>
                  <p>But out of Asia look yet once again into America: and<note place="margin">The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuios.</note> then you shall see as strange a winged creature, as any we have heard of yet; I mean the New Spains <hi>Cucuios,</hi> which whether I may call it bird, or beetle, I cannot tell. He is very little, and of the thicknesse of a mans thumbe or there abouts; but amongst the works of God, he is a most admirable wonder. For he carrieth foure lights with him, which <note n="*" place="margin">

And as for his wings, he hath two very strong and hard, under which he hath two other little wings very thin, which appeare not but when he extendeth his other to fly. The Indians use them in stead of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and (saith my <note n="*" place="margin">See Purch. and Du Bart. summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, pag. 240.</note> authour) if a man tie five or six of them together, they yeeld as much light as a torch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:18622:221"/>And loe, just now, as if it were by the light of this<note place="margin">Bees.</note> creature, me thinks I see the painfull and industrious <hi>Bees</hi> fly flocking to their hives.</p>
                  <p>These be those winged workmen, which whether their profit or admiration be greater, I am scarce able to say. For they do not onely busily bestirre themselves to gather hony, which is very usefull in the life of man; but they do work it up in most strange manner, and keep it in their waxen cells so rarely built, that all the men which the world affords are not able to do the like. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this all; for they live so, as they may be true pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of needfull government, keeping themselves under the subjection of a king, and order of laws. They may well be likewise said to have the soveraignty and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence above all others of this kinde, because the rest come farre short of their perfections.</p>
                  <p>It is a creature having foure wings, and bloudlesse, the onely crafts-master of hony. Their eyes are somewhat of a horny substance, hid deep in their bodies, as is also their sting; which when they lose they die:
<q>—Vitam in vulnere ponunt;</q>
because their sting and entrails come away together. They want neither tongue nor teeth; and out of their short feet or stumps, there grow forth as it were two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, wherein they carry a littlestone, for the poysing their bodies in stormy, windie, tempestuous weather; it being a great means to keep them from blowing away and losing their home.</p>
                  <p>Neither can it be denied, but that by nature they are much different: for some (saith <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Topsel</hi> in his Hist. of Serpents.</note> one) are more domesticall and tam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, and others again are altogether wilde, upland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish and agrestiall. Those former are much delighted with the familiar friendship, custome, &amp; company of men; but the other can in no wise brook or endure them, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they keep their trade of hony-making in old trees, caves, and such like other holes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="421" facs="tcp:18622:221"/>As for their breathing, I do not beleeve it; howbeit they may pant, move, or stirre (as the heart or brain doth) and by transpiration be comforted and made live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for they be much refreshed by the aire which passeth through their divided places, insomuch that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes use great diligence and care to preserve them from being stopped: for as soon as they be stopped in those passages, they die; as we see if at any time they chance to fall into oyl, or the like liquour which may stop their pores.</p>
                  <p>Some make three kings amongst them, differing in colour, as black, red, and divers-coloured; but perhaps there is rather one king in a companie, the other like kings may be esteemed as viceroyes. In their breeding they actually couple together, after which they lay egs, sitting upon them for the space of five and fourtie dayes; then do they hatch their young ones, which at the first come forth much like to white worms, except the king, who onely is said to be hatched with wings. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is a kinde of Bee bred out of putrefaction, as authours write. A rotten horse breedeth Wasps; a dead calf Bees, if the West winde blow; from an asse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed Humble-bees; of a mule, Hornets, &amp;c. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bees, in Sampsons dead Lion, were bred any where else, no man knoweth.</p>
                  <p>They have a Commonweal, and are governed by a king, as before was mentioned: and him they reverence and honour, being alwayes readie to do according to his pleasure. He is of bodie farre bigger then the hony Bees, hath shorter wings, but a brighter and more good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly head then they. There is alwayes excellent discipline, and very good government among them: for at the mouthes of the hives there be some which stand like warders placed at the gates of a castle, to see who goes in and out. And having rested quietly all night, there is
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:18622:222"/>
one which with a humming noise doth call them up, whereupon they prepare to fly abroad about their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: but if they make no haste to look out, or go not farre from home, it is a certain signe of no good wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When they be busie at their work, the Bees which go abroad return home with laden thighs, full of the substance of the flowers; and this especially is said to be an office of the younger Bees: for some of the other do onely earrie water; and the elder ones remaining at home, do busily lay up, carefully dispose, and curiously dresse what the other bring in. Such as be sluggish among them, are diligently observed, and bitterly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: and as for the drones, they are supposed by some to be the female Bees, which they drive out of their hives when breeding time is past; and therefore they do ill who use to kill the drones before. Others again think that the female Bee is no drone, but rather bred among the Bees, and being idle, and unapt for work, is driven away either in the busiest time, or time of dearth. And yet perhaps it may be the female, which having done as much as can be naturally required from her, must not think much to be driven away, but leave her room to a succeding generation.</p>
                  <p>I said before, that in the morning there is one among them which calls them up, and so in like manner at night they leave their buzzing by degrees, at last hearing as it were a proclamation through their hive to go to rest: and so the watch being appointed, and all things set in order, they all make themselves readie to go to bed. So long as the king liveth, so long the whole swarm enjoyeth the benefit of peace; but he being dead, there is great disorder. The king keepeth his court by himself, in the highest room and largest part of the whole palace, his lodging being very curiously made. And if at any time any of them chance to die, they be carried out of the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:18622:222"/>
hive, as it were upon the shoulders of the other Bees, who will suffer nothing in their houses which may pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute them: but if they be onely sick, then have they a medicinall aliment of hony, drawn from annise, saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, and Hyacinths, by which they are cured. <hi>Topsell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when they be readie to swarm, they dare not take their flight untill their king leade the way; unto whose side they strive to flie, as neare as they can. Some<note place="margin">Tops. bist. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But when he dies through age, they carrie him forth in solemne manner, and behave themselves as at some sad funerall. Neither is he so tied to his home but that he may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times go abroad to refresh his aged bodie, whom they accompanie in a sweet obedientiall manner; and if it chance that he grow wearie and faint by the way, they bear him back again upon their wings, and with great commiseration pitie his decayed estate. Moreover they will not suffer a dead Bee to be in their hives, but carrie him forth as to his buriall, lest he should corrupt their pure and cleanly decked dwellings.</p>

The said authour writeth that their life is but short, never above two yeares: and as for their combes, they be wrought with greater cunning, more exquisite art, and curious conceit, then those either of Wasps or Bees; neither need we doubt (saith he) but that they bring forth young by the sides of their cells, and perform such other offices in their breeding as the Bees and Wasps do.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He just period of the fifth day being come to an end, the sixth approacheth; wherein God Almightie shutteth up the creation of every <hi>species:</hi> and after all, he resteth from his works, &amp; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by his providence over each part and parcell of the world which he had made.</p>
                  <p>And in this day he first produced the brute beasts li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon the face of the earth: then he comes to the creation of man, and makes him the <hi>Colophon,</hi> or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all things else; in whose nature he placed the greatest dignitie of any creature that is visible: for man
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:18622:225"/>
is of a middle between the beasts and Angels, transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one, and yet not worthy to equalize the other; as afterwards, when I come to that particular, shall be declared, with other things pertinent to his creation.</p>
                  <p>And now, that the terrestriall beasts and he should be made both in one day, is worth observing: for had he been to live in the aire, he might have seen the sunne with the flying fowls, and have been created when they were made: or had his habitation been in the waters, the fish and he might both at once have been produced. But being made, neither to swimme with the fishes, nor flie with the birds, but live upon the earth, it was most harmonious that the terrestriall beasts, and his creation, should in the same day the one succeed the other. And that the end might shew the perfection of the work, the prioritie of time is given to the beasts; but the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and prioritie of all appeares in man, who was made <hi>Lord of the creatures,</hi> and in whom God had placed a surpassing condition, and (by farre) a more noble nature. For whereas they are led by sense, he hath reason; whereas they look downwards and groveling from the skie, his countenance is erect, and his looks are mixt with majestie; whereas they are animate without an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall soul, he liveth when he dieth, and hath a soul which death it self knows not how to kill: and whereas their bodies fall and never rise again, his riseth when it is fallen, and is like seed sown, which sprouteth up when the time is come.</p>
                  <p>If this then be both the order and cause of such an<note place="margin">The creation of beasts.</note> order in this dayes work, I must leave the most excellent piece untill the last, and begin first to look and observe how the beasts, in their severall kindes and daintie squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, march up and down, and walk from out the shop of their Creatour; being brought to perfection even as soon as that powerfull word who spoke it, did onely say it, <hi>Let them be.</hi>

                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:18622:225"/>It would (I confesse) require no small volume to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of all. Howbeit even in a few, the glory of their Maker will well appeare: and with that thought let us name some, by which we may admire the rest.</p>
                  <p>And first consider what a strong vast creature the<note place="margin">The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</note> mighty <hi>Elephant</hi> is known to be. There is no creature (saith <note n="a" place="margin">Topsel.</note> one) among all the beasts of the world which hath so great and ample demonstration of the power and wisdome of Almighty God, as the <hi>Elephant;</hi> both for proportion of body, and disposition of spirit: and it is admirable to behold the industrie of our ancient forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and noble desire to benefit us their posteritie, by searching into the qualities of every beast, to discover what benefits or harms may come by them to mankinde: having never been afraid of the wildest, but they tamed them; and the greatest, but they also set upon them: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse this beast of which we now speak, being like a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mountain in quantitie and outward appearance, yet by them so handled, as no little dog could be made more serviceable, tame, or tractable.</p>
                  <p>They are usually bred in the <note n="b" place="margin">Plin. lib. 8. cap. 11</note> hot eastern countreys; for by reason they cannot well endure the cold, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light most in the East and South; as in India, and some places of Africa. And before the dayes of <hi>Alexander Magnus,</hi> there were never any in Europe: but when he fought against <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <p>These Indian <hi>Elephants</hi> are most commonly <note n="d" place="margin">Topsel.</note> nine cubits high, and five cubits broad; and in Africa they be about eleven foot high, and of bignesse proportionable to their height.</p>
                  <p>Their colour is for the most part mouse-coloured, or black; and yet there was <note n="*" place="margin">And in <hi>Pegu</hi> the King hath many; it being part of his royall title, <hi>King of the White Elephants.</hi> See Mr. <hi>Purch.</hi> in his Pilgr. of Asia, <hi>lib.</hi> 5.</note> once one in Ethiopia, all white,

as M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                     <hi>Topsell</hi> relateth. They have a skinne so hard (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting on their belly) that it is a very hard matter, and in a manner impossible, to pierce it with any sword, spear, or iron. It hath on it very few hairs, and is very full of chaps or crevises, in which there is such a savour as invites the flies to a continuall feast: howbeit they pay deerly for their cheer; for although the <hi>Elephant</hi> cannot make use of his tail to drive them away, yet by shrinking of himself close together, he incloseth the flies within the chaps, and so killeth them. He hath a long trunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nose, mighty teeth, foure whereof be within his mouth serving to grinde his meat, and two hang forth; as afterwards shall be shewed. He hath a tail slender and short, and legs of an infinite strength; his head is very great, so that a mans head may as easily be thrust into it, as his finger into the mouth of a dog: but yet his eares and eyes are not equivalent to the residue of his other parts: for his eares are small, and their matter like to the wings of a Bat or Dragon; and some (bred in some places) have no eares at all. Their eyes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise are like the eyes of swine, but very red. Two of their teeth (as I said) grow farre out of their mouthes, one of which they alwayes keep sharp to revenge injuries and defend themselves, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is lesse sharp, being often used to root up plants and trees for their meat; and commonly they grow out to the length of ten feet: this is that which we call Ivory, and of which many prettie things are cut by artists.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Munster</hi> reporteth how these beasts are taken; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the cunning cutting down of a tree, against which they use to lean and stay themselves. For this beast, <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Munst.</hi> cosmog.</note> saith he, having fed till he is full, betaketh himself to rest, and leaning to a tree he sleepeth, for he cannot bend his joynts as other beasts do; not because he wanteth joynts,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:18622:226"/>
but because his sinews are more strong, and closely knit his joynts together; or else because there is much flesh between the skinne and bones; or because his skinne is so crustie, like to armour, and unfit to bend. Now when<note place="margin">The way to catch Elephants.</note> the people perceive any such tree as is worn and made foul by the <hi>Elephants</hi> leaning against it, they come in the absence of the said beast, and cut it almost quite through, close by the ground; insomuch that being ready to fall, it cannot stand when the <hi>Elephant</hi> cometh to rest against it, but by giving way causeth him to fall together with it; and then he lieth helplesse upon the ground all the night with his belly upward, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to bend his legs and arise, he is caught in the morning by those who before had cut the tree with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to deceive him.</p>
                  <p>The said authour also mentions another way whereby they of India sometimes take and tame them. For there be <hi>Elephants</hi> (saith he) in India which be very wilde and fierce, but they are easily made tame; namely thus. The people intending to catch them, compasse some clean place with a deep ditch of about foure or five furlongs in compasse, and in one place onely they make a bridge ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strait and narrow, being the way to enter in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they set three or foure female <hi>Elephants</hi> which they have alreadie <note n="*" place="margin">These <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>ed with a certain oyl, which causeth the wilde Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant to follow them.</note> tamed, and they themselves lie watching pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily till the time that the wilde <hi>Elephants</hi> come and passe over the bridge: then on the sudden do they <note n="†" place="margin">Some say they are chased in, as is also the tame Elephant trained up on purpose for such huntings. <hi>Purch.</hi> of Asia, <hi>lib.</hi> 5.</note> stop the passage, and afterward bring some of their strongest tame <hi>Elephants</hi> to fight with these wilde ones thus inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: besides which, they do likewise punish them with hunger and lack of meat; and when they be wearied with fighting, they which are bold hardie fellows (by help of the tame <hi>Elephants</hi> to shelter them) will privily creep under their bellies and suddenly chain and fetter them. After this they move their tame <hi>Elephants</hi> again
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:18622:227"/>
to beat the wilde untill their fetters cast them to the ground, and then they yoke them to the necks of their tame ones, and lay chains upon them that thereby they may passe on quietly: and at last bringing them home, they fasten their legs and necks to a strong pillar, and so by hunger and societie tame them; teaching them at the last when they begin to feed them, to be obedient to their masters in such manner as best pleaseth them: and then they will grow so loving, gentle, milde, service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and docil, as is indeed a wonder. And if by chance any of them shall happen through fury to kill his keeper, he will shew so much sorrow, and take it so heavily, that he abstaineth from his meat, and sometimes even pineth to death; like unto that Dolphin, which in the former day I mentioned, who using to carry a boy upon his back, one day by meere accident hapned to kill him with one of his prickles, not closely couched, before the lad was mounted on his watery steed.</p>
                  <p>The little mouse is sometimes offensive to this beast,<note place="margin">The mouse is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to the Elephant.</note> and will strive to runne into the trunk of his nose; neither can he endure to eat more of his meat if he see but a mouse runne over it.</p>
                  <p>But above all, he hath two fierce enemies; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and the admired great <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> who coming to fight with the <hi>Elephant,</hi> first whetteth his horn grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his snout, and then grapling close, he wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Elephant</hi> into his belly; for elsewhere the force of his fury cannot enter. <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>And as for the <hi>Dragon,</hi> he likewise fighteth furiously, because his delight is to suck the bloud of the <hi>Elephant,</hi> which is cooling to his hot nature: but drinking too large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it, (as he will do if he can) down falls the <hi>Elephant</hi> for lack of bloud, and down likewise falls the <hi>Dragon,</hi> because he hath sucked too much: and so both die stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving together. <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 12. or, as <note place="margin">Munst.</note> some say, the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi>
                     <pb n="433" facs="tcp:18622:227"/>
dying falls upon the Dragon, and so kills his foe who killed him.</p>
                  <p>And in this fight the Dragon deals most cunningly: for first he sitteth watching upon a tree, and when the <hi>Elephant</hi> is come neare unto that place, he suddenly skips and cleaves round about him: and if then the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> begin to beat him off against a rock or tree, he claspeth close about his legges, and seldome doth the combate cease without the death of both the fighters.<note place="margin">An embleme from the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</note> A fit embleme this, of those who fall whilest they suck the bloud of others, and perish in such gains as are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the harms of those whom they strive to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the <hi>Elephants</hi> have such a kinde of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie<note place="margin">The marriage bed must not be abused.</note> and shamefastnesse, that the male never covereth the female but in secret; and this never but once in two yeares; and that, when the male is five yeares old, and the female ten. From whence, <note n="f" place="margin">Gemin. lib. 5. cap. 60.</note> 
                     <hi>Geminianus</hi> gathers this instruction. By this example (saith he) men are taught honestly to use the acts belonging to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall or matrimoniall estate, both according to the place and time. <hi>Arise and let us pray</hi> (saith young Tobias to<note place="margin">Tobit 8. 4, 7, 8.</note> his wife) <hi>that God would have pitie on us.</hi> And in praying he likewise said, <hi>I take her not for lust, but uprightly: therefore mercifully ordain, that we may become aged toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And she said with him, Amen.</hi> Of which carefull continence, <hi>Geminianus</hi> gives this reason why it ought to be in us; because we are children of the light, and may <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 8. 6. and 22. 10.

                     </note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that they commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie with their wives, who in the use of wedlock have neither regard of seemlinesse, nor honestie. And <hi>Hierome</hi> likewise makes this assertion, that nothing is more shamelesse then to make a strumpet of a wife: meaning when they turn the remedie into a disease, through a
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:18622:228"/>
lustfull, immodest, and immoderate use of the marriage bed.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the Elephants are long-lived, they have great pleasure in good water, are very impatient of cold, and many of them live <note n="h" place="margin">Munst.</note> almost 200 yeares.</p>
                  <p>Also there is one singular propertie yet more to be<note place="margin">A pattern for great men.</note> observed in them, <hi>viz.</hi> that even the wilde ones living in deserts will direct and defend strangers and travellers. For if an Elephant shall finde a man wandering in his way; first of all, that he may not be affrighted, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant goeth a little wide out of the path and standeth still: then by little and little going before him, he shews him the way; and if a Dragon chance to meet this man thus travelling, the Elephant then opposeth himself to the Dragon, and powerfully defendeth the helplesse<note place="margin">Gemin. lib. 5. cap. 96.</note> man, who is not able to defend himself. So ought it to be chiefly amongst great men, and those who are mightie; they should not injure strangers and travellers (as many do) when they come into their territories, but rather by themselves, or theirs, they should direct and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them from the hurts and harms of evil men.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> is a beast every way admirable, both<note place="margin">The Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceros.</note> for the outward shape, quantitie, and greatnesse, and also for the inward courage, disposition, and mildenesse. For this beast is next to the Elephant, every way as strange, and in a manner exceeding him, unlesse it be in his quantitie or height of stature: for although he may be as long, or perhaps longer then an Elephant, yet he is not so tall, neither are his legges so long; and for the length, it must be a large <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> which can measure with the Elephant, for ordinarily the Elephant exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, according to the testimonie of <hi>Strabo</hi> alledged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Moreover, upon the nose of this beast there groweth a hard and sharp horn, crooking a little towards the crown of his head, but not so high; it is flat and not round, and so sharp and strong that it will pierce through things of exceeding hardnesse: and from hence it is that he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> in the Greek; by which word is signified a <note n="k" place="margin">Topsell.</note>

                     <hi>Monoceros</hi> is a beast with one horn, called therefore by<note place="margin">The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn.</note> the name of an <hi>Unicorn:</hi> and albeit there be many horned beasts which may improperly be called Unicorns, yet that which is the right Unicorn indeed, is like unto a colt of two yeares &amp; a half old, which hath naturally but one horn, and that a very rich one, which groweth out of the middle of his forehead; being a horn of such vertue as is in no beasts horn besides: which whilest some have gone about to denie, they have secretly blinded the eyes of the world from their full view of the greatnesse of Gods great works. For were it not said that the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:18622:229"/>
horn were excellent and of surpassing power, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self it would never be doubted whether there were an Unicorn or no. But that there is such a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar<note place="margin">Deut. 33. 17. Isai. 34. 7. Job 39. 9. Psalm. 92. 10.</note> beast, the Scripture, both in Deuteronomie, Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Job, and the book of Psalmes, doth bear us witnesse: In all which places how do Expositours translate the originall word, but thus, <hi>Unicornis,</hi> or <hi>Monoceros,</hi> which in English is an <hi>Unicorn?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, it is the testimonie of <hi>Ludovicus Vertoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> alledged by <hi>Gesner, Topsell,</hi> and others, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self saw a couple of the true Unicorns at <hi>Mecha</hi> in Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia; one whereof had a horn of three cubits, being of the bignesse of a colt two yeares and an half old; the other was much lesse, and his horn shorter, about a spanne long, for he was but young: and both these were sent to the Sultan of <hi>Mecha,</hi> for a rare present, by the King of Ethiopia, who ever desireth to be in league with the said Sultan, thinking nothing too deare to maintain his ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And certainly he could not send him a gift more welcome, especially this being a beast so rare and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome seen; which may be, in regard that it is a creature delighting in nothing more then in a remote and solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie life.</p>
                  <p>The colour of these thus sent was like a weasel-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Horse; the head like the head of a Hart; the neck not very long, and the mane growing all on one side; their legges slender and lean, like the legs of an hinde; the hoofs on the forefeet cloven, and the hinder legges somewhat shaggie. The nearest (of any beast better known) is the Indian Asse, and Indian Horse; excepting that their hoofs are whole and not cloven, and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour somewhat differing: for there is a horn grows out between their two eyes, like to the true Unicorn. By which it appeareth that of Unicorns there is one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall kinde onely; the rest are lesse principall, and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:18622:229"/>
to him whose horn is the strongest, sharpest, and of the greatest vertue. For in granting more kindes then one, I do not understand every beast with one horn; but onely such <hi>Monocerots</hi> as have in their horns vertue against poison: like unto those horses of India mentioned but even now, and of which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Topsell</hi> writeth that they have Harts heads, and one horn, of which their Kings and Princes make cups to drink their drink against poison, finding a great preservative to be in the said horn. <hi>Munster</hi> saith that the King of Ethiopia hath some store of these beasts; and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Topsell</hi> nameth two kingdomes in India (the one called <hi>Niem,</hi> the other <hi>Lamber</hi>) which be likewise stored with them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover concerning the horn, it is neither light nor<note place="margin">A description of the Unicorns horn.</note> hollow, nor yet smooth like other horns, but hard as iron, rough as any file, revolved into many plaits, sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then any dart, straight and not crooked, and every where black, except at the top or point. It hath many soveraigne vertues, and with an admirable dexteritie expelleth poison: insomuch that being put upon a table furnished with many junkets and banqueting dishes, it will quickly descrie whether there be any poison or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime amongst them; for if there be, then presently the horn is covered with a kinde of sweat or dew. And (as it is reported) when this beast cometh to drink, he first dippeth his horn in the water, that thereby he may drive away the poison when venimous beasts have drunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                  <p>And again I finde it recorded that the Indian and<note place="margin">How hunters take them.</note> Ethiopian hunters catch of those Unicorns which be in their countrey, after this manner. They take a goodly strong and beautifull young man, whom they clothe in the apparell of a woman, besetting him with divers flowers and odoriferous spices, setting him where the Unicorns use to come; and when they see this young
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:18622:230"/>
man, whom they take to be a woman, they come very lovingly and lay their heads down in his lap: (for above all creatures they do great reverence to virgins and young maids) and then the hunters having notice given them, suddenly come, and finding him asleep, they will deal so with him, as that before he goeth, he must leave his horn behinde him.</p>
                  <p>These, and many other things more, concerning this beast may be read in the large writings of <hi>Gesner</hi> and <hi>Topsel,</hi> whither I would wish the more inquisitive to have recourse.</p>
                  <p>Africa breedeth many <hi>Lions,</hi> and the colder the place<note place="margin">The Lion.</note> is, the gentler they be: and in time of their coupling, eight or ten will follow one female, whereupon arise very terrible and bloudie battels among them. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender backward; and so doth the Camel, Elephant, Rhinoceros, Ounce, and Tiger. They spare women ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then men, and prey not at all on infants, except in case of much hunger: and albeit the Lion be a fierce and cruell beast, yet he is said to shew great clemencie to the humble and such as prostrate themselves submissively before him; which he will the sooner do when he hath lately filled his bellie with a former prey. The male useth not to feed with the female, but either of them apart by themselves. The Lionesse or She-lion is the fiercest, and alwayes the most cruell. Their tail is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their inward meaning: for if it stirreth not, he is gentle and peaceable; but moving, he is angry. These beasts will keep revenge in minde a long while, either against man or beast that hath hurt them. And in like<note place="margin">A storie of a Lion.</note> manner they will as long be mindefull of a benefit, and do their best to make requitall, as is famous by that storie of <hi>Androdus</hi> who was slave to a senatour of Rome; and one named <hi>Mentor,</hi> a man of <hi>Syracusa,</hi> upon whom a Lion fawned to have him help his diseased foot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:18622:230"/>For, concerning the first; when <hi>Androdus</hi> fled from his master by reason of some hard usage that he received at his hands, by chance he happened to take up his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a cave; which (unknown to him) was a Lions denne: where when he had been a while, not long before night the Lion came home from hunting, and having gotten an hurt upon his foot, he no sooner espied the trembling man in this fearfull place, but he cometh gently unto him, stretching forth his foot, and making mone as though he desired help. The poore slave at the first expected nothing but death, neither did he think of any thing more then to have his sepulchre in the Lions bellie; but at the last perceiving what the matter was, he took the Lion by his paw, searched the wound, pulled out a thorn, bound up his foot, and gave him ease: which kinde office being performed, was first of all requited with a daily portion of provision which the Lion would bring in for this his guest; and he poore helplesse man would rost it in the sunne as well as he could, and then eat it. But being wearie of this kinde of diet, and as wearie of his solitarie life, he went away; for whose ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the Lion (as himself could heare) made great mourning and lamentation. And see how it happened; this man did no sooner depart then he was taken by some whom his master sent to seek him: and then (alas) there is no way for him but one; die he must. Neither shall his death be other then a tearing in pieces by cruell beasts: for the Romanes had a custome to sit in their theaters and behold such bloudie games, and direfull pastimes; and therefore they would catch and keep beasts on purpose. But it fortuned that amongst other beasts taken this Lion was one, who being brought into the theater, greedily rent in pieces such as were thrown unto him: yet when his old guests turn came, he forgot his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and turned it into fawning, by which the poore slave
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:18622:231"/>
perceived what Lion it was, and thereupon gathered up his spirits, renewing again his old acquaintance with his former friend, even to the admiration of all the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And the matter being known and related to them, he had not onely pardon for his life, but the Lion also was bestowed on him to wait upon him. <hi>Aelianus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports this storie, and so doth <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> in his <hi>Attick nights. Hîc est Leo hospes hominis; hîc est homo medicus Leonis,</hi> was that which the people would say when they saw him leade along his Lion through the streets: <hi>Here goeth</hi> (say they) <hi>the Lion which was the mans hoast; and there is the man who was the Lions Physician.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to shew that the Lion delighteth not to kill his prey before he be readie to eat it, appeareth by another storie which I finde related by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Topsell,</hi> in his historie of foure-footed beasts.</p>
                  <p>A certain English man being turned Moor, and living<note place="margin">Another storie of a Lion.</note> in Barbarie, was told of a Lion which lay lurking not farre off; and he, to shew his valour, being half drunk, would needs undertake to go and kill him in the place where he was: whereupon he armed himself with a sword, dagger, and musket; having also a long large knife about him. And when he came to the place where the Lion was, that he might shew himself valorous, he would not kill him as he lay asleep, but toucheth him with the end of his musket that he might awake: which being performed, the beast suddenly mounted up and eagerly sets upon this fool-hardie champion, throwing him presently down to the ground: whereupon he could think of no other but a speedie execution. But seeing the Lions bellie was lately filled with a former prey, he forbeareth to kill him; onely he standeth over him and keeps him down with his paws, intending so to hold him untill he had a stomack to prey upon him. But in the mean time, this champion studying how to acquit
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:18622:231"/>
himself, between hope and fear, draws out his long barbarian knife (for he had his hands at libertie) and with it he wounds the Lion two or three times: but he, desirous to possesse his prey against his need, never regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from whence the wounds came, and thereupon he falls at the last fainting to the ground, and so dying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers his prisoner against his will, who now might tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in a conquest that was altogether beyond either hope or expectation.</p>

but sometimes they return to their former natures: but above all, in the time of their lust, or when they be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of their young, they are most raging and furious. <note n="m" place="margin">Plin. lib. 8. cap. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> hath described the manner how the hunters get away their whelps very commonly. They come upon horseback, and finding the old Tigers from home, they take up their young ones and poste away as fast as they can; and on the sudden they finde themselves pursued, wherefore when the old one cometh neare them, they let fall one of her whelps on purpose, that whilest she is carrying that to her nest, they may escape securely with the rest. And sometimes they make round spheres of <note n="n" place="margin">Munster, Topsell.</note> glasse which they cast before her when she cometh, and thinking (by reason of her own shadow) that she seeth her young ones there, she rolleth it to her denne, where she breaketh it with her claws, and finding her self deluded runneth after the hunters again, by which time they are gone too farre for her to finde.</p>
                  <p>There is an <note n="o" place="margin">Topsell.</note> herb neare the river <hi>Ganges,</hi> growing like <hi>Buglosse,</hi> the juice whereof is such that if it be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the mouth of their dennes, they dare not come forth, but will lie howling there till they die.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Panther</hi> is a beast little differing from a <hi>Leopard</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> or <hi>Libbard:</hi> 
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Plin. lib. 8. cap. 17.</note> some think they differ in nothing but in sex. In Greek the generall name is <hi>Panther;</hi> the speciall names, <hi>Pordalis</hi> and <hi>Pardalis. Pordalis</hi> is taken for the male, and <hi>Pardalis</hi> for the female. And in Latine it is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pardus</hi> and <hi>Panthera:</hi> where it must be again observed that <hi>Pardus</hi> signifieth the male Panther, and <hi>Panthera</hi> the female. Neither is the difference between the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard and Panther onely in sex, but rather in respect of a<note place="margin">How the Leopard is begotten.</note> mixt and simple generation: for there is no Leopard or Libbard, but such as is begotten between the Lion and the Panther, or the Panther and the Lionesse.</p>
                  <p>This is a beast which hath varietie of colours, a sweet
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:18622:232"/>
breath, and is very fierce and wilde, insomuch that some have therefore called him a <hi>Dog-wolf;</hi> and yet being full, he is gentle enough. He sleepeth three dayes (saith <hi>Munster</hi>) and after the third day he washeth himself and cryeth out, and with a sweet savour which cometh from his breath, he gathereth the wilde beasts together, being led by the smell: and then (saith <hi>Plinie</hi>) doth he hide his head very cunningly, lest his looks should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them; whereupon, whilest they gaze upon him, he catcheth his prey of which he pleaseth. So have I known<note place="margin">An embleme from the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, concerning fair tongues and false hearts.</note> some hide their ill meanings with fair and sweet-breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed words; having hony in their mouthes, but gall in their hearts; and a direfull intent cruelly to hurt when they seem most of all to please. For sugred speeches will catch the credulous; neither is all gold that fairly glisters.</p>
                  <p>Now the reason why these beasts have such a sweet breath, I take to be in regard that they are so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with all kinde of spices and daintie aromaticall trees: insomuch that (as <note n="q" place="margin">Topsell.</note> some affirm) they will go ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred miles in time of the yeare when these things are in season; and all for the love they bear to them. But above all, their chief delight is in the gumme of cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorie, watching that tree very carefully, to the end they may preserve it for their own use.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Camels</hi> there be chiefly three sorts: the first called<note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.</note> 
                     <hi>Hugiun,</hi> of great stature and strength, able to carrie a <note n="r" place="margin">Purch.</note> thousand pound weight: the second lesse, with two bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on the back, and sometimes one upon the breast; these are called <hi>Becheti,</hi> are found onely in Asia, &amp; are fit both for carriage, and to ride on. The third sort is meagre &amp; small, not used to burdens, yet able to travell above an hundred miles in one day: this kinde they call <hi>Raguahill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Arabian and Bactrian Camels, although they want horns, yet they have <note n="s" place="margin">Plin. lib. 8. cap. 18.</note> teeth but on one side. And of all the sorts, their necks are long &amp; nimble, by which the whole
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:18622:233"/>
bodie is much relieved, seeing it can reach to most parts; their heads are small, and feet fleshie, in which regard they use to be shod with leather for fear of graveling; I mean such as are tame and made service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. They love grasse, especially the blades of barley; and when they drink, the water must not be cleare but muddie. The surname therefore of the Camel, is <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-bank;</hi> for they will <note n="t" place="margin">Plin. ibid.</note> mud the water with their feet, otherwise they take no delight to drink it. So have I seen some, never better pleased then when they trouble the cleare fountains of justice and pure doctrine, with the muddie streams of injustice and errour. Or some, never better cheered then when they may drink<note place="margin">An embleme from the Camel, concerning those who preferre earth before heaven.</note> deeply of the dirtie puddles of worldly wealth, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the sweet taste of the water of life, which is a cleare river running from the throne of God and the Lambe, Rev. 22. And as for the bunch upon the Camels back, the Scripture doth thereby expresse the swelling pride and confidence of rich worldly men, who as hardly enter into the kingdome of God, as the Camel with his bunched back can go through the <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 19. 24.</note> eye of a needle.</p>
                  <p>The Horse and the Camel are great adversaries; and<note place="margin">The Horse and Camel great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> with his very sight and strong smell, the horse is terrified. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore being excelled by the Babylonians in horsemanship, used this stratagem of the Camels.</p>
                  <p>And as for our fine stuffes, as grogeram, and chamblet,<note place="margin">Stuffes made of Camels hair.</note> they be made of Camels hair, as some affirm: as also there is a courser hairie cloth to be made of the worst of this hair, such as was that garment worn by John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist in the wildernesse.</p>
                  <p>And of the Camels this one propertie more; when their<note place="margin">A lesson of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie taught by the Camel.</note> masters load them they will bowe themselves, and stoup down to the very ground with their knees, patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during to take up their burden. So have I seen some, as willingly humbled under the crosse, and as patiently
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:18622:233"/>
stouping to take it up, and follow their master Christ who went before them. For it is a true rule, that God can and doth love his children well, although he make no wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the <hi>Dromedarie</hi> is a kinde of Camel, but lesse,<note place="margin">The Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medarie.</note> and farre more swift.</p>
                  <p>And as for the <hi>Cameleopardus,</hi> he is begotten by a<note place="margin">The Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leopard.</note> mixt generation between the Camel, and Leopard or Panther.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hyaena,</hi> as it is described by <note n="u" place="margin">Lib. 8. cap. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>Plinie,</hi> is a beast<note place="margin">The Hyaena</note> whose neck hath no joynt, and therefore he stirres not his neck but with bending about his whole body.

His eyes have many colours; and the touch of his shadow makes a dog not able to bark. And (as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians would make us beleeve) this beast hath the power of incantation: they therefore tell many strange things which they be able to do.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this any other then the <note n="x" place="margin">Topsell.</note> common or vulgar <hi>Hyaena,</hi> which is likewise called <hi>Lupus vespertinus, a wolf of the night,</hi> being in quantitie of body very like a Wolf, but much more rough in his hair, and bristled all along his back like a horses mane, the middle whereof is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what crooked.

                  <p>Wolves have no societie but with beasts of their own kinde: and above all creatures, they and dogs are most subject to madnesse; the reason of which is, because their bodies are cholerick, and their brains increase and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease with the moon.</p>
                  <p>And as for their severall kindes, see more in <hi>Gesner, Topsell, Olaus Magnus,</hi> and such others.</p>

                     <hi>Vulpes,</hi> the <hi>Fox,</hi> is a subtill craftie creature. They dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<note place="margin">The Fox.</note> in colour according to the climate wherein they be bred, and sometimes also in quantitie. The urine of this beast falling upon any herb or grasse, drieth it up, and causeth it to wither. His fat or grease is good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the cramp or gout: and so also is his skinne, if it be wrapped about the grieved place; testified by <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> in the eighteenth book of his Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern historie.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, concerning the subtilties of this beast, they<note place="margin">The subtilties of the Fox.</note> be in a manner infinite. By putting his tail into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he will catch an abundance of crabs and lobsters at
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:18622:235"/>
his pleasure; for they take great delight to hang and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap themselves into such brushie stuffe, and he hath as great delight to fish them out.</p>
                  <p>And again, when cold, snow, and hunger shall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse him, coming neare some farm or mansion-house, he feigneth a kinde of barking like a dogge, that thereby the houshold beasts may more confidently keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without fear, being often used to the barking of a dogge: and so having gotten himself neare unto his prey, he will lie upon his back with his belly upwards, mouth open, tongue out, and every way seeming as if he were dead; then the hens, or geese, or what else is fit for him, are suddenly surprised and cunningly caught, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest they little dreamed of such a subtilty.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes again he will roll himself in red earth, and besmearing himself with it as if he were bloudie, he will again lie on the ground, verily seeming as if he were dead, by means whereof he inviteth the fowls to come and prey upon him: but he deceiveth them in his craftie wilinesse; and being deceived, they are taken.</p>
                  <p>Also, he sometimes escapeth the danger of dogges by a counterfeit barking, by which he feigneth himself to be one of their kinde. And by his subtiltie he escapeth from the snares, and that not seldome: for if he be taken by the foot &amp; cannot free himself, he will prostrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the ground, and shew no appearance either of life or breath: insomuch that when he cometh who set the snare, and findeth him in this posture, he will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to be no other then he seemeth; and then loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the snare without any thought that he should escape, he suddenly riseth and runnes away. The like was credibly reported to me of a Fox, creeping into a mans house at a little hole, who filling himself too full, knew not how to get out; whereupon in the morning he was found as dead: the man kicks him about the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:18622:236"/>
house, and at the last throws him out of doores on the dunghill; where he was no sooner with joy arrived, but up he starts, and findes his legges as readie to carrie him as he was willing to escape.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, being hunted he will sometimes runne among a flock of sheep or goats, and get upon the back of some one or other of them, forcing that sheep or goat to runne; the rest follow, insomuch that the hunters are unwillingly compelled to call in their dogges, for fear they should seize upon, or harm the flocks.</p>
                  <p>And to rid himself from fleas, he hath this device,<note place="margin">How the Fox catcheth fleas.</note> reported by <hi>Olaus Magnus.</hi> He takes in his mouth a little wisp of soft hay, with which he wrappeth a little hair; and coming to a river, he puts himself in, all but the head: then when the fleas are come up so high as his head, he sinketh lower, even till the hay in his mouth touch the water; by means whereof the fleas are driven thither: and being there, he lets the wisp go, and so cleares himself.</p>
                  <p>In like sort he <note n="d" place="margin">Topsell.</note> deceiveth the Hedge-hogge; for when the Hedge-hogge perceiveth the Fox coming to him, he rolleth himself together like a foot-ball, and so nothing appeareth outwards but his prickles, which the Fox cannot endure to take into his mouth, and therefore the craftie Fox, to compasse his desire, licketh gently the face and snout of the Hedge-hogge, by that means bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to unfold himself again, and to stand upon his legges; which being done, he instantly devoureth him by poysoning him with the urine that he maketh upon the Hedge-hogges face.</p>

with his pisse defile the Badgers denne: whereupon he is forced to forsake it and seek a new.</p>

                  <p>Moreover, the young whelps of the Fox, when they<note place="margin">An embleme from the Fox and her young, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning false friends.</note> can finde no more milk in the paps of their damme, will bite them with their teeth, and rend and teare them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting them as strangers.

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:18622:237"/>
And for the manner of catching their prey, most commonly it is thus; They will get up into trees, and there lie in wait for their bootie untill they espie it under the boughs, and then suddenly do they leap into the neck of it, whether it be <note n="g" place="margin">Idem ibid.</note> a man or great beast; wherein they fix their claws so fast, that no violence can shake them off: and then with the sharpnesse of their teeth, they first bite into the skull, and eat out the brains.</p>

                  <p>They love their young ones very entirely: and that some should think they are bred between a Wolf and a Hinde, is utterly without reason, seeing there is such hostilitie and adverse disposition in their natures.</p>

Wherefore nature hath taught her this prettie piece of policie; namely, to get upon a little piece of wood, which swimming<note place="margin">Olaus Mag. ibid.</note> wafts her securely over: and wanting a sail, her bushie tail set up and spread abroad, supplies the room of that defect.</p>

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:18622:238"/>
carrying her young ones upon her back, and covereth them with her broad tail. And the hunter, not daring to encounter with her but by treacherie, is forced to this project; namely to dig great holes in the ground and cover them over with boughs, sticks, and earth: which he doth so weakly, that if the beast chance at any time to come upon it, she and her young ones fall down into the pit, where they have no way but one, they must be taken. But this cruell, untameable, impatient, violent, ravening, and bloudy beast, perceiving that her naturall strength cannot deliver her, first of all, to save her young ones (as she supposeth) she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth them all with her own teeth, so that never any of them could be taken and tamed; and then howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and roareth at the hunters who come about her; but now they need not fear her, she is secure enough: whereupon they use means quickly to dispatch her, and by fatall blows to stop her mouth from bawling.

like a foot-ball, so that nothing appeareth but his thornie pricks: where at the Serpent biteth in vain, for the more she laboureth to annoy the Hedge-hog, the more she is wounded and harmeth her self; howbeit the height of her minde, and hate of her heart be such, that they will not suffer her to let him go, till one or both parties be destroyed: yea it sometimes so happeneth, that the least creature hath the best successe, and gets the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. So have I seen some provoke others to their<note place="margin">An embleme from the Serpent and Hedge hog, concerning mean estates.</note> own ruine: for if proud mindes and high spirits could alwayes have their wished ends, the low shrubs should never thrive, nor mean estates enjoy the sunne.</p>
                  <p>Moreover (as is reported) this beast altereth and<note place="margin">The Hedge-hog changeth his nest.

                  <p>The generall proportion of his bodie is like a Swines; and seldome is it that they be bigger then a pig of half a yeare old. But in the particular members there is some difference, as in his eares which are like to the eares of a Man, his mouth somewhat like to the mouth of a Hare, but with a longer slit, and with three of his

And of these quills men make wholesome tooth-picks; for it is said that if we scrape our teeth with these, they will never be loose. <hi>Topsell.</hi>

Howbeit they have sometimes proved dangerous about cities and castles by undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their walls: for (as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth in the 29 chapter

of his eighth book) there was a town in Spain over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the digging of conies; and one again in Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salie destroyed by the casting of moles.

                     </note> they use not to live very long, and chiefly they take delight in hard and sandie grounds which are drie; for they have no greater enemie then the wet: from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth that their greatest infirmitie is rottennesse.

And note, that in India there is a little beast called a <hi>Pig-conie,</hi> with short round eares, and a bodie somewhat rounder and fuller then our conies.</p>

                  <p>A great rich usurer, having purchased a mighty<note place="margin">A storie of an usurer.</note> estate, was at the last sent for by death to leave the

Then do his friends about him send for a Divine to come and comfort him; who willingly tells him of many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for his souls health, and amongst other things puts him in minde of this, viz. that he had been a great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser upon earth, but now he must studie for another purchase, which was the kingdome of heaven. Now the usurer turning upon the other side, at the hearing of the word <hi>purchase,</hi> answered, <hi>I will not give more then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to fifteen yeares for a purchase,</hi> and so died. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, this gentleman preaching at his funerall, in the conclusion of his sermon said onely thus; <hi>Brethren, it is now expected that I should speak something concerning our brother here deceased: I will end it in few words, namely these: How he lived, you know; how he died, I know; and where his soul now is, God Almightie knows.</hi>

<pb n="461" facs="tcp:18622:241"/>
this their action is an embleme (saith he) of folly and foolish men, which can keep no secrets but utter all that they heare: for there be many, who when they have heard tales with their eares, enlarge them with their tongues, and by adding to reports turn mole-hills into mountains, <hi>&amp; sic crescit eundo;</hi> because as many have itching eares, so some have scratching and augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tongues, desiring to be heard as the reporters of news.

                  <p>Moreover, amongst other things which the Mouse ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth great delight to eat, he useth to watch for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping oister, and seeing it open, he thrusts in his head; which when the oister feeleth, she presently closeth her shell again, and so crusheth the Mouses head in pieces.

Then the hunters depart a little from them; and the Apes, observing how they before had washed their face and eyes, come now presently down from the trees, and thinking to do as the men did, they daub and anoint their eyes and mouthes with birdlime, so and in such a manner, that neither knowing or fearing any thing, they are suddenly made a prey, and taken alive.</p>

They bring forth young within the space of thirtie dayes after their time of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, which at the first be shapelesse and void of form, without eyes, without hair, their nails onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and hanging out, each whelp being little bigger then a mouse; and these, by licking, are moulded into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, and day by day brought to perfection.</p>
                  <p>This beast can fast many dayes, and, by sucking his foremost feet, asswage or somewhat mitigate his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Some say that they can be without meat 40 dayes, and then when they come abroad they are filled beyond measure; which voracitie, and want of moderation, they help again by vomiting, and are provoked unto it by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ants. But above all other things, they love to feed on hony: whereupon they will fearlesly disturb the bees, and search into hollow trees for such repast; not altogether to fill their bellies, but most of all to help a dimnesse in their dull eyes. Moscovia hath many such breeding bees: and <hi>Munster</hi> tells a storie how a Bear seeking for hony, was the cause of delivering a man out of an hollow tree.

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:18622:249"/>
fast in a great heap of hony even to the breast and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to the throat: and having continued two dayes in this sweet prison, during which time he fed himself with hony, all hope of deliverance was quite gone; for it was impossible he should climbe up and get out, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could his voice be heard although he cried with an open mouth, especially in such a solitude and vast place of wood and trees: so that now being destitute of all help and consolation, he began utterly to despair; and yet by a marvellous, strange, and (as it were) an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible chance, he escaped: for it so fell out that he was delivered and drawn forth by the help and benefit of a great Bear, which seeking for hony, chanced to happen upon this tree: the Bear scaleth it, and letteth her self down into the hollownesse thereof, with her back-parts first, in manner and fashion of man when he climbeth. Now the man in the tree perceiving this, in a great fear and affrightment, he claspeth fast about the reins and loins of the Bear, who being thereupon terrified as much as the man, is forced to climbe up again, and violently to quit her self from the tree (the man in the mean time using great noises and many outcries) and so by this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, a wished, but hopeles libertie was procured: for the Bear being feared, drew up the man and knew not of it.</p>
                  <p>And note that in Bears their head is very weak, being contrary to the Lion, whose head is alwayes strong. And therefore when necessitie urgeth that the Bear must needs tumble down from some high rock, she tumbleth and rolleth with her head covered between her claws, and oftentimes by dusts and knocks, in gravel and sand, they are almost exanimate and without life.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it seldome that their tender heads catch deadly wounds, although they cannot quickly feel them, by reason of their ardent love to hony. For (as <note n="*" place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But let them know, that (although many live as if they came but into this world to make merry and away) ruine will follow riot: and it were well for such men, as they have lived like beasts, if they could likewise die like beasts, never to live again: but (alas) they cannot; here is their misery, that they onely leave their pleasures behinde them, and not their sinnes.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For when Esau sells his birthright for a messe of pottage, he may wish for a blessing and not finde it, although he seek with tears; or when Balthasar spends his time in damned quaffing, in stead of quenching his thirst he may drown his soul: for unlesse there were weight in vanitie, or substance in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving pleasure, these men put into the balance are found too light.

Now this is the King of serpents; not for his magnitude or greatnesse, but for his stately pace and magnanimous minde: for the head and half part of his body he alwayes carries upright, and hath a kinde of crest like a crown upon his head. This creature is in thicknesse as big as a mans wrist, and of length proportionable to that thicknesse: his eyes are red in a kinde of cloudy black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

God onely spake his powerfull word, and then the other creatures were produced: but now he calls a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and doth consult, not out of need, but rather to shew the excellencie of his work; or indeed, to shew himself: he speaks not therefore to the Angels but the Trinitie, saying, <hi>Let us make man.</hi> Wherein the Father, as the first in order, speaketh to the Sonne and holy Spirit: and the Sonne and Spirit, speak and decree it with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, all Three in One, and One in Three, create a creature to be the other creatures lord.

                  <p>Three worlds there are, and Mankinde is the fourth: The first is Elementarie; the second a Celestiall world; the third Angelicall; and the fourth is Man, the little world.

For first, as mans bodie is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Elements, he hath his share of that warm fire in him.

The arteries carrie the vitall spirits from the heart. The veins carrie the naturall spirits from the liver, giving nourishment to every part. And the nerves carrie the animall spirits from the brain, being spirits for sense and motion, and therefore called <hi>animall spirits:</hi> howbeit, the motive nerves spring from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the back; and the sensitive come from the brain. Also know, that under every vein is an arterie: for<note place="margin">The veins and the arteries go together.</note> wheresoever there goeth a vein to give nutriment, there goeth an arterie to bring the spirit of life. Neither is it but that the arteries lie deeper in the flesh then the veins, because they carrie and keep in them more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud then the veins keep; and are therefore, not onely further from outward dangers, but clothed also in two coats, whereas the veins have but one. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is no hard thing to distinguish between these two vessels of bloud, if we can but remember that the arterie is a vessel of bloud spirituall or vitall; and the vein, a vessel of bloud nutrimentall: for (as I said before) the veins have their beginning from the liver, bringing from thence nutritive bloud to nourish every member of the bodie.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, his heart is the seat of all the passions; as in<note place="margin">Passions have their seat in the heart.</note> one instance may suffice: for being transported with fear, we call back the bloud to the heart, as to the place where fear prevaileth, the bloud going thither (as it were) to comfort and cherish the heart. And whereas it
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:18622:260"/>
may seem that our anger is seated in the gall, love in the liver, and melancholie in the splene: it is answered, that those humours placed in the gall, liver, and splene, are<note place="margin">The humours stirre up the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> not the seat of the passions and affections; but they are the occasion whereby the passions are stirred up: as the abundance of bloud in the liver, stirreth up the passion of love, which neverthelesse is placed and seated in the heart; and so of the rest.</p>
                  <p>And again, seeing the vitall spirits proceed from the<note place="margin">The heart liveth first and dieth last</note> heart, it cannot be denied, but that this member liveth first, and dieth last.</p>
                  <p>And as the heart was the seat of all the passions, so<note place="margin">The head.</note> the head is a seat and place for all the senses, except the touch; for that is not onely in one place, but in all and every place, being spread quite through the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or isle of man.</p>

                  <p>And in this last piece, God stampt his image; for it<note place="margin">How man was made according to Gods image.</note> consisted not in the figure of the bodie any otherwise then as the organe of the soul, and in that regard being a

weapon with it unto righteousnesse, it had some shadow thereof. For, to put all out of doubt, the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how we are to understand the image of God in man; in one place speaking thus, <hi>Which after God is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse,</hi> Ephes. 4. 24. And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, <hi>Put on the new man, which is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, after the image of him who created him,</hi> Coloss. 3. 10. By which it appeareth that this image consisteth, not so much in any resemblance between the substance of the soul and the essence of God (though both be immortall) nor yet in the naturall faculties thereof, as of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, will, and memorie, taken as emblemes of the Trinitie; but in the knowledge and illumination, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and justice of the soul, which are now wrought in man by grace, and then were given by creation. For that image is now lost, and cannot be had till it be renewed: but the substance of the reasonable soul, with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faculties and powers thereof are not lost, therefore therein is not expressed this image according to which mankinde was made. Mankinde, and not man alone: for<note place="margin">Woman made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the image of God, as well as man.</note> Moses addeth, that <hi>male and female created he them;</hi> to shew, that woman as well as man, was partaker of the same image: the last that had it, and yet the first that lost it; for though she were the last in creation, yet the first in transgression, as the Scripture speaketh.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps you will think the Apostle denieth this, saying, <hi>The man is the image and glorie of God, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
