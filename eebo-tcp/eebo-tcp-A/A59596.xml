            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>SInce these Memoirs were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, both by the Writer and Translator of them, for the Reader's Instruction, 'tis hop'd he will do himself and us the Iustice, to make his Remarks only upon the different Characters of those Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men our Knight-Errand has met with, and (warned by his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings)
<pb facs="tcp:100189:3"/>
fortify his Heart against their Allurements who would serve him in the same kind, without cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticizing upon the Style or guessing at the real Actor, whom the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Author has disguis'd both as to Time and Place; not so much for his own sake, as to conceal the Names of those Ladies, who little merited so generous a Caution.</p>
            <p>Indeed the World is extreamly obliged to his good Nature, since he had rather expose his Discretion to our Censure, than let us want the pleasant Relation of so many divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Adventures; and that Person must be very nice, who, among these several Amours, cannot find one that will relish his Palate: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb facs="tcp:100189:3"/>
some being surpriz'd at the variety of these Intrigues, may think them Fictitious, or at least suspect they are not the performances of one Gallant; but we doubt not their Wonder will lessen, when they consider his sanguine Constitution and roving Temper, which run him into perpetual Temptations.</p>
            <p>I would not have the charming and best part of Mankind esteem this Narrative as a Libel upon their Fair Sex; for the Virtuous (who are much superior in number) are no ways concern'd in the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made upon the Infamous, for whom neither my Author, nor my self, have an over-great respect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100189:4"/>I never troubled the Press be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but if this meets with a kind Reception, it may incourage a young Beginner to higher Vndertakings.</p>
            <p>I must not omit to tell you, That the Book is at present imperfect; the <hi>Second Part,</hi> promis'd by the Author, being not yet come to our Hands: But we chose not to delay the Publication of this, being hasty to shew some of those Rocks and Quick-sands on which our powder'd <hi>Beaux</hi> do daily suffer Shipwrack.</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS OF THE Count de — Compiled by Monsieur <hi>SAINT E.</hi> BOOK I.</head>
            <p>I Am now entring into my Sixtieth Year, more weary of the World, for the Crosses I have met with in it, than because of my Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let me then endeavour to enjoy my self, during that little Time that is yet afforded me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by employing my Thoughts wholly on that, which may draw them off
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100189:5"/>
from worldly Concerns. But my Life being, as I may say, a Complication of all the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which the Conversation of Women exposes a Man to, I think it will be of no little Use, both to my self and others, if I run over all those Adventures of mine which they engaged me in. Whoso reads these Memoirs, will, perhaps, warned by my Follies, know how to avoid the like Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters; and I by writing them, and exposing the Ridiculous Errors all Admirers of the fair Sex are guilty of, will be encouraged to persist in the Resolution I have taken of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing that cursed Inclination, that in spight of my Age and Experience, might yet bear too great a Sway over my Judgment; so little is the Power we have over our selves, to follow that Good we approve of, and avoid that evil which we blame.</p>
            <p>Since my Design in writing these Memoirs is rather to leave the World an Instruction than an History, I hope I may be excused if I conceal my Name, as well as those of most Persons I shall speak of. My Aim in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not the making a Recital of my Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but by that Recital to direct my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he shall avoid those Inconveniencies I have lain under; and it would be unjust in him, to apply himself rather to guess at the Truth of this History, than to make his Advantage of what I write.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100189:5"/>I desire that such as find me out, will at least be so kind as not to divulge their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, and I discover to them as a Secret all I can not conceal from them.</p>
            <p>I was born in <hi>May,</hi> in the Year 1625. My Father, who was descended of one of the most Ancient Houses in the whole Kingdom, and had an Employment in the Army which allowed him little Leisure to look after his Family, had left that wholly to my Mother; which consisted in a Girl and Three Boys, the Girl being the Eldest, and I the youngest of all Four. He might be worth about Four hundred thousand Livers, and was the poorer because he had made considerable Settlements on my Mother, tho' she had brought him but a slender Fortune. We scarce knew any thing, but we were informed how small an Estate we must trust to. My Mother took Care not to be troubled with us too long, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bestowed her Daughter into a Nunnery, where she paid but little for her Board, she looked for Colleges, where her Sons might be educated at as cheap a rate. My elder Brother, tho' he was yet but Fifteen, had already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himself into the Army; and my second Brother and I were sent, under the Conduct of a Priest, to a little Country Town, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was a College, where the Priest carried us
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100189:6"/>
to follow our Studies. We were not a little looked upon, tho' our Expences were no ways extravagant; but besides that it was known what Family we were of, such Titles were bestowed on us as might occasion that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction. My Brother was called a Count, and I a Knight; for it was not then, as it is now the Fashion, to entitle Children to the Name of Abbot, who have no other Call to an Ecclesiastical Life than that of being youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brothers.</p>
            <p>The Count, my Brother was no ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined nor fit to study, and all his Occupation from Morning till Night was to vex the poor Man, who was entrusted with us. As for me, I was something more tractable, and tho' I was no Enemy to Sports, yet I made a Shift to please my Tutor. The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that was observ'd in our Characters, procured me some Praise; which being a Mortification to my Brother, occasion'd that Hatred he has always bore me, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that Parents ought never to send Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren out together, whose Inclinations are different. The Reprimands an elder Brother, who is outdone by his Junior, is subject to, must always be paid for, by him who is the innocent Cause thereof. My Brother was already Fifteen and I Fourteen Years old, when a Company of Strowlers came into that Town.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100189:6"/>I had as yet felt but loose and uncertain Impressions of that Passion which inclines one Sex to the other. It was at the Play that it began to unfold it self, and make me feel it's Rage: And I must own it, to my Shame, or to that of the graver Authors of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Scene, that at the Acting of the <hi>Cid</hi> I began to love in earnest. The Actress, who represented <hi>Chimena,</hi> charmed me, with her Beauty, and the Tenderness express'd in her Part. I was mov'd with Compassion at her Sufferings; and was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought something concern'd that she should be so vertuous as the Author had made her: But that Care was presently over. I soon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood how that Woman, who on the Stage expressed such Vertue, had as little in another Place. This it was that put my poor Brain quite out of order. What, thought I, were it then so easie for me to be belov'd by that <hi>Chimena</hi> who is so cruel to <hi>Roderiguo?</hi> These and such like Reflexions wholly employed my Thoughts, and thus I unwittingly suck'd in the Poison of Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
            <p>What I experienc'd in that tender Age, has since hindred my being surpriz'd, when I have seen Actresses, tho' never so infamous, be courted with a stronger Passion than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and vertuous Women. The Part they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100189:7"/>
act on the Stage seeming to give, as it were Relish to that which they act elswhere.</p>
            <p>However, I was not old enough to apply my self to the <hi>Chimena,</hi> who had pleased me so well, in acting the <hi>Cid.</hi> Besides, she was always engag'd with Sparks, not so young as my self, and whose Pockets were better furnish'd than mine at that Time; and foreseeing that if I presumed to make Love to her without presenting her with something, I should be received but as a School-boy, I sought for easier Amours and Mistresses not so hard to be come at. But to whom should I proffer my Service? I saw not one Woman who was indifferent to me. Every She was my <hi>Chimena,</hi> but I, alas! was no Body's <hi>Rodriguo</hi>; and the greatest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement I had from those I bestowed most upon, was, That I was a pretty Boy. This was worse than Death to me, who would have been looked on as a Man, since I so well felt my self to be such.</p>
            <p>There was a Nunnery in that same Town, the Abbess whereof was something a kin to us: I visited her pretty often, and by that means had got acquainted with most of the young Ladies she boarded. There was one among the rest, who was much about my Age, and pleased me above them all; and having all Liberty of seeing her, I thought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100189:7"/>
I could not do better than to make my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to her. She was then the Person pitch'd upon, to whom I should express those Desires that had newly taken Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Heart. I did it in some Verses I had remembred out of a Play, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to her with all the Passion and Softness imaginable. Miss was already a far greater Scholar in that Science than my self, and I was amaz'd to hear her answer my Verse in very intelligible Prose. She ridiculed the manner wherein I had made my Declaration, and told me, She had learned in her Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to speak in another Tone. I found her well read in Books of Gallantry, and learned enough, not only to answer my Love, but also to instruct and encourage me in it. She swore, however, That she never had felt, but on my account, that Passion which she discover'd, and that she never would feel it for any one else; but she told me, That if I really lov'd her, we must lose no Time, but must seek out the Means frequently to enjoy each other's Company.</p>
            <p>One may easily imagine how ravish'd I was, to find so charming a Person filled with Love for me. I was easily perswaded my own Desert had occasioned that Passion in her, and the Letters she began to send me dayly, confirmed me in this vain Opinion; for I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100189:8"/>
thought it impossible to write with more Wit and Passion than she did.</p>
            <p>Her Love began to be the only Object of my Thoughts. We wrote to one another ev'ry Day, constantly, and one of my School-fellows, who was Son to a Servant of the Abbesses, delivered me her Letters, when he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to School, and took my Answers back with him, as he returned home.</p>
            <p>It was a Month since this Intreague had begun, when my Brother, who, it seems, was fond of a Nun of the same Abby, and was not over-given to Secrecy, shewed me the Letters he had received from her. How was I amaz'd, when I saw they were almost Word for Word, the same as those my Boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sent me, and that they must have all been composed by the Nun! I took no Notice of it to my Brother, but having left him I went and packed up all the Letters I had, and sent them back to her whom I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from, acquainting her by a Note, That I would neither love nor see her any more, since she had been capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving me.</p>
            <p>She returned an Answer yet more disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging than my Note; and as my Love was real and sincere, I was concerned to see her angry. I sent her a very submissive Letter, begging a thousand Pardons; but having
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100189:8"/>
no Answer, I waited on her my self, to sue for a Reprieve.</p>
            <p>She received me in such a manner that I was persuaded she never had loved me. She made a Sport of the Grief I was in, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I would have made a formal Complaint of her Cruelty, she said, I was a fine Lad indeed to pretend to such a Person as she was. This confounded me quite, for she was not much older than my self, and I was inraged to be used like a Child by a Child, not knowning at that Time, That Women are sooner ripe than Men.</p>
            <p>The ill Success of this my first Attempt began to give me an Insight into the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Female Sex, which would have been a Happiness to me, had I taken Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it; but I thought the Levity of Youth was the only Cause she had serv'd me so, and resolv'd to apply my self to more solid Mistresses.</p>
            <p>We were often invited to the Deputy Governour of the Town we liv'd in. He was married to a Woman not unhandsome, and who was pretty much talked of. She was about Thirty Years old, and I wanted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Fifteen, yet I never saw her but I gave her some Tokens of my Passion. I thought <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Man must pretend Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">

               </gap> he conversed with,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100189:9"/>
and in my Applications I really spoke my Mind, for in the general Desire I had to make Love, I found my Heart ready for any who would accept it.</p>
            <p>I had read several Romances, for it was then that they began to be cryed up, and did not think it lawful to make Love other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than their Heroes. I fancied my self sometimes <hi>Alexander,</hi> sometimes <hi>Orondates,</hi> and I took the Governour's Lady for no less a Mistress than <hi>Cassandra</hi> or <hi>Statira.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was not at all suspected by the Husband, being almost the only one whom he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to converse withal. Besides our frequent being alone at her House, we often went abroad, only she and I, into a Garden she had in one of the Suburbs.</p>
            <p>One Day she told me, she would try whether I was sincere in my Addresses, and if she could trust me. I promised her an Inviolable Discretion; and then she told me, She had some Business with a Relation of hers, whom we should find in the Garden, but that it must be done with all Secrecy, because she were undone should her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band come to the Knowledge of it, he having expresly forbid her ever to see that Man. She assur'd me, It was about Business that she desir'd to discourse with him, and I promised her, I would be faithful, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100189:9"/>
enquiring what Reason she had to do it.</p>
            <p>We went to the Garden, and were scarce there, but the Spark, she waited for, got in over the Wall, and came towards us. <hi>There he is,</hi> said she; <hi>stay here while I speak with him in that Summer-House, and watch if any Body comes: And if there does, you'll come and give me Notice.</hi> I told her, She might rely upon me; and she went into the Summer-house with that Man, while I lay Perdue at the End of the Walk that led to it, she having charged me not to stir from that Place.</p>
            <p>No sooner was she in, but I forgot the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise I had made her not to leave my Post, and creeping softly to the Door of the Arbor, I was unlucky enough to knock at it pretty hard, crying out, <hi>Madam, Your Husband is coming.</hi> Whereupon she came to the Door, and without opening of it, desired me to carry her Husband into another Walk, while her Friend should make his Escape.</p>
            <p>I walked aside to give him that Leisure, and my Spark returned by the same way, tho' with a little more haste than he came. She came to me, and seeing me all alone, asked where her Husband was? It was in vain for me to tell her, he was gone out again; she perceived what I had done was but to fright
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100189:10"/>
her, and expressed so much Resentment as to give me ill Language.</p>
            <p>I thought, that having Knowledge of her Intreague, she would be afraid to disoblige me; but it happened quite otherwise; she carried me home again, without saying a Word, and having left me, went and told her Husband, I was an impudent young Fellow, who had been so bold as to make Love to her, and that she desired him that I might come no more to her House.</p>
            <p>I came there the next Day, and the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band told me, in a deriding manner, that I was a lewd Debauchee, and that were it not for the Respect he had for my Family, he would have me whipt.</p>
            <p>This Affront touched me to the Quick, and instead of answering him as I might have done, that his Wife made a Fool and a Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old of him; I only reflecting on the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner he had threatned me in, flew in his Face, and had I been strong enough, would have done him more Mischief. His Spouse ran in, allarm'd at the Noise, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Husband's Part, called me a thousand Rogues. <hi>See,</hi> said she, <hi>what Impudence! How brisk this little Rogue is for his Age, and if he dares use my Husband thus, what would he not say of me, if he might be <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>?</hi> I was taken off of the Husband, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100189:10"/>
to avoid his House; on which I went out, exclaiming against both Husband and Wife as they deserv'd.</p>
            <p>When I was got Home, I reflected with Admiration on the Impudence of that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who knowing it was in my Power to ruin her Reputation, by divulging what I knew of her, had yet carryed her self so strangely towards me; but I knew not as yet all a lewd Woman can do, and what happened to me then, was but a Sample of what I have experienced since in those of that Character.</p>
            <p>This Adventure made no little Noise: Our Tutor, at whose House we boarded, wrote to my Mother about it, and prayed her to send for us back, because we were grown too big to be govern'd by him. She would have had little Respect for his Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, were she not that Year, which was 1640. become a Widow, my Father being killed in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in the Battle wherein the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> got the better of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> She sent for us to <hi>Paris,</hi> where we found my eldest Brother, who was come there after my Father's Death, to beg for his Place, and to endeavour to get Two Commissions for my Brother, the Count, and my self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100189:11"/>We had a Friend whose Interest was very great, with whom my eldest Brother had been educated, and who had also been a great Acquaintance of ours, in our Childhood. It was Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars,</hi> Son to the Mareschal <hi>d'Effiat.</hi> He being at that Time at the highest Period of his Favour, we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily obtained what we sued for. My eldest Brother was preferred to the Post my Father had been in; my Brother, the Count, was placed with the Duke <hi>de Breze,</hi> to serve at Sea, and the former, who had a Kindness for me, kept me with him, to make my first Campaign in <hi>Piedmont</hi> the next Summer. I remained with him, at <hi>Paris,</hi> for that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being a sharer in almost all his Pleasures, and it was then I had an Opportunity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring more particularly into the Manners of Women of Pleasure.</p>
            <p>We were almost perpetually at Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi>'s; and here I cannot forbear mentioning the Amasement I was in, and the Reflexions I used to make whenever I saw him. Never any Man seemed to me more happy than he did at that Time. He was at the Age of 20 Years the King's chief Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and that in such a degree as never any one was before him; ador'd by all the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and caressed by all the Ladies he was pleased to court. Yet I never saw him contented, and as often as he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100189:11"/>
alone with my Brother and me, he would say he was the unhappiest Man in the World. He mused, sighed, and would spend whole Hours in walking about the Room, without speaking a Word. My Brother was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Confident of the Causes of his Affliction, and they would often whisper together. As for me, I was not desirous of meddling with their Concerns, but could not cease admiring how much those Men are imposed upon, who think that Places of great Trust and great Honour are an essential Part of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
            <p>I had no Knowledge of Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi>'s Secrets as to Matters of State, and I know not whether he revealed them to my Brother, but I was entrusted with most of those that related to his Gallantry; for many may be met with who have Command enough over themselves, to conceal what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects their Fortune, but few that can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear bragging of what flatters their Vanity in Love Affairs.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> was extraordinary handsom and very generous. However, the Women he applyed himself to, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to him. Being obliged to attend the King almost all Day long, he had but little Time left to Converse with his Mistresses, and they deceived him with all the Ease ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100189:12"/>He kept one who had beeen very expensive to him: He had given her a sumptuous House, richly and magnificently furnished, and seldom made her an empty Visit. He often carried me and my Brother thither, and sometimes left us there, being obliged to go to Court. Whether my Brother was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged elswhere, or that he was unwilling to Court his Friend's Mistress, he expressed little Kindness for her, and when Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> was gone out, he commonly fell asleep, and left me free Leave to talk what I would to her.</p>
            <p>I had not yet lost the Habit I had got, to fancy that a Man must not see a Woman without making Love to her. The Lady was Handsom, and, it may be easily imagined, that, having Liberty to say what I would, I told her I loved her.</p>
            <p>Being, however, desirous to do things handsomely, I told her, I was sorry to see Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> so fond of her, and that she should be under such Obligations to him, because I would else have taken the Freedom to make my Addresses to her. <hi>You think,</hi> said she, <hi>he has a Kindness for me, and that I am obliged to him; but you are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he does not love me at all, and gives me no Tokens of his Passion. How!</hi> replied I, not without Amasement, <hi>then I am very ill
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100189:12"/>
informed, for the World talks as tho' he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bestowed above Fifty thousand Crowns upon you. Well,</hi> answered she, <hi>and Fifty thousand Crowns; there's a mighty Business for such a Person as I am. If I would oblige others as far as I have done him, I should already have received three times as much Mony, and be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter settled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess this Discourse seemed to me to be so singular that I could scarce forbear tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her for so high an Ingratitude; for I knew not then that a bought Mistress still thinks she is worth more than is laid out for her.</p>
            <p>I would not however let her perceive the Surprize I was in. <hi>It is true,</hi> continued I, <hi>that in respect to your Desert Fifty thousand Crowns are a small Matter. But what must he expect then, who has nothing; and how will you accept of the Tender I design to make you of my Heart, I who cannot give you a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Do you think then,</hi> said she, <hi>that I am Mercenary, and would buy my Lovers? If you did love, and that you are in earnest, I would have more Kindness for you than for Monsieur</hi> de Cinq Mars, <hi>with his Fifty thousand Crowns; for,</hi> continued she, <hi>Whores only make a Trade of Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Words won my very Heart, and hindred the Reflexion I should have, how ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and extravagant it was that a Person
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100189:13"/>
should be so covetous as not to be satisfied with Fifty thousand Crowns, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Generosity; but I was charmed with it as tho' she had been sincere in what she spoke. I fancy'd my self a Man of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Merit than Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars,</hi> and carryed my Folly so far as to think, that a Girl so well equipp'd, as she was, might not only love me without any Interest, but might give me some more substantial Proofs of her Affection: For I was then very bare of Mony, and found that I should love that Woman most whom there was most to be got by.</p>
            <p>I told her, That I was wonderfully taken with her generous Temper, and that she ought not to doubt of my Sincerity. The Answer she made me persuaded me I was beloved by her, and she assured me, That I should be Welcom when ever I should visit her, and that no Body should disturb us. I desired a Meeting the next Day, at Ten in the Morning, and she gave her Consent thereto.</p>
            <p>I left her, so transported with my good Fortune, that I could scarce forbear acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Brother with it. I could not, as we returned home, leave off talking of her to him, and that with such an Earnestness as made him laugh. <hi>I think,</hi> said he, <hi>you are in Love with her. I should,</hi> answered I, <hi>be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100189:13"/>
rich enough to gratifie her, before I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that.</hi> This made my Brother laugh extravagantly; and especially when I told him, That none but Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> must attempt to gain her Affection; and I have thought since, that he must have known her for what she was.</p>
            <p>I expected with Impatience that the Clock should strike the appointed Hour, when I received a Note from her, wherein she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me, That an unexpected Business was fallen out, which obliged her to go forth early; and that wanting a Watch, all her's being at the Watch-maker's, she desir'd me to send her one, she had seen in my Hands the Day before. I had one indeed which was tolerably pretty, which I sent her, with a most passionate Letter, begging, She would remember her Promise against that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. I was eager to be with her, and found her undrest, and saw no Sign of her going out that Day. She had Two of her Friends with her, who, she told me, had kept her at Home till then; adding, She must go out within a quarter of an Hour, to procure Ten Pistols, having lost as much at Play.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do not ask you for them,</hi> said she, <hi>since you have told me, You had no Mony.</hi> She spoke those last Words so dry, that I thought she meant to upbraid me with it. That struck me to the Heart, and I resolved to get her
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100189:14"/>
Ten Pistols, whatever it cost me. I left her, and went and sold a small Diamond I had, and brought her the Mony. She expressed an excessive Joy thereat, and told me, What she did was rather to try me than any need she had of them. She promised to meet me the next Day; but when the Time was come, I had a Message, That she was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily vexed she could not see me, Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> having sent her Word, he was coming to her.</p>
            <p>I was mad at these Disappointments. The next Day was not more favourable to me, and she fooled me thus for a Fortnight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, finding still some new Excuse to disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her self. That Time being expired, she sent me Word, to meet her at a certain Church, to which she came, and where I went to speak with her. She expressed much concern that she could not contrive it so, that I should see her at her House; but said, My frequent Visits had been taken notice of, and that we must of necessity meet at some other Place. But she said, That was not her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Pain; for what troubled her most, was, That Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars,</hi> having given her Fifty Pistols to buy her a Gown, she had no more Wit than to engage her self at Play; that she dar'd not tell him she had lost them, and must make 'em up some way or other. <hi>Do you think,</hi> said she, <hi>that if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100189:14"/>
you pretended you wanted that Mony, and should ask Monsieur</hi> de Cinq Mars <hi>for it, he would deny you?</hi> I told her, I dared not propose any such thing to him, not only because I was averse to borrowing of any one, but also that for some Reasons of great concern to me, I must not lose Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi>'s good Opinion. She reply'd angrily, That this was but a Sham, and that she was a Fool to think I ever lov'd her. She left me after that, and would not hear my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
            <p>I had all imaginable Cause to think she Jilted me. She had my Watch, which she hastened not to return: I had given her Ten Pistols, and she again asked me for Fifty more: But yet I was blind enough not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on her Ber Behaviour. She is too rich, thought I, to desire more than she has, and her Addressing her self to me, must be an Effect of Confidence she has in me.</p>
            <p>I resolved then to beg the Fifty Pistols from Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars.</hi> We were at her House when I proposed this to him. I took him aside into another Room, and told him trembling, That I had an urgent occasion for Fifty Pistols, by reason my Friends allowed me short. He reply'd, he would give me a Hundred, and presently calling the Lady, at whose House we were; <hi>What Mony,</hi> said he, <hi>did I leave you, Madam, the last Time I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100189:15"/>
was here? Was it not Three hundred Pistols? Fetch me a Hundred, pray, which I have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion for.</hi> She blushed, and not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to return any Answer, brought him the Hundred Pistols; which he gave me. I scrupled taking them, saying; That perhaps she wanted them. No, no, said he, she has enough, and I will have her, when you want any thing, to supply you; and calling her, he bad her give me all I should ask her for. I went away, keeping the Hundred Pistols, in the Resolution of letting Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> know, That I had borrowed them only for that Person of whom he had them, and left him with her.</p>
            <p>I was at a loss what to make of her, who pretended Want of Fifty Pistols, when Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> had so lately given her Three hundred: Yet I found it pleasant enough, supposing she trick'd me, to see her thus punished for her Covetousness; and that instead of asking her for Mony, she was now to give me some as often as I should require it.</p>
            <p>I could not forbear acquainting my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therewith, who was angry that I should have borrow'd any thing of Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars,</hi> and would have the Hundred Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols, to send them back to him. He told me then, That she was us'd to play such Pranks, and let Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> give
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100189:15"/>
her never so much Mony, she would be still asking some of all that pretended to her. <hi>I have attempted,</hi> continued he, <hi>to convince Monsieur de Cinq Mars</hi> of it; <hi>but Love blinds him; and he has not Leisure to study his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses Characters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Brother returned the Hundred Pistols, which Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but on condition that I would ask her for more, whenever I had need of them. My Brother, who had already found how blind he was on her account, thought not fitting to let him know, That it was she who had obliged me to ask him for that Sum: But as I had resolv'd to get my Watch and my Ten Pistols again, I was also deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to make use of the Order Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> had given me, and to lack for nothing.</p>
            <p>I went then to see her, and was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle astonished, when receiving me with a smiling Countenance; <hi>Well,</hi> said she, <hi>and where are the Hundred Pistols Monsieur</hi> de Cinq Mars <hi>has given you; are not they for me? For you?</hi> said I, <hi>Why, Faith I have spent them; and, far from that, I must beg of you, that you would supply me with Twenty more, on the account of an urgent Necessity. What then,</hi> reply'd she, <hi>you think the Three hundred Pistols Monsieur</hi> de Cinq Mars <hi>spoke of, were mine? You are mistaken, he had given
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100189:16"/>
me them to keep for him, and he is so covetous that he would be as mad as the Devil, if I should touch a Farthing of it. Alas,</hi> added she, <hi>with Tears in her Eyes, I am an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Woman: Monsieur</hi> de Cinq Mars <hi>scarce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows me what is necessary, and I never ask him for any thing but he upbraids me with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What my Brother had told me, secured me against this Artifice. I told her, she misrepresented Monsieur <hi>de Cinque Mars,</hi> and that I would speak to him my self, to know the Truth of the Matter: Then I prayed her to return me my Watch, and my Ten Pistols, since I had now no more Cause to doubt but the Love she Feigned was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence she made use of to Chouse me. Here she wept afresh; begging, That for God's sake, I would not tell Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> of it: Which I promised I would not. But it was in vain for me to insist upon my Watch and my Ten Pistols; she positively deny'd them, telling me she would keep them for my sake.</p>
            <p>As Angry as I was, I could not forbear laughing at the Complement. The more I laugh'd the more she cry'd; but I had the Courage not to be mov'd with her Tears, and to despise her as much as I had ever lov'd her. She was indeed such as my Brother had told me; tho Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd an incredible Sum of Mony on her, she
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100189:16"/>
would be asking every Body for more. She was worth Four hundred thousand Livers when Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> died, and we shall see anon what was her Fate.</p>
            <p>I avoided her House, except when I was forc'd to accompany my Brother thither, where he went often to meet with Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi>; and looking for another Amour, I pitcht on—House, because the Duchess of—was our Cousin, and was always very obliging to me. She had a very pretty Niece, whose Education she took care of, for she had no Child as yet. She was a Maid about Sixteen or seventeen; and it will easily be judg'd, that a Youth of my Complexion did not see her often without telling her she was Handsome. She answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Love in such a manner as made me distracted; she did nothing but laugh at it, and I could not guess whether she loved me or no. One Day, that she was gone out with the Duchess, I went to see her, and found no Body there but a young Woman, that waited on her, who was about Twenty and very passable: I used to be civil to her as often as I saw her; but finding her alone, was more free of my Complements than usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. She spoke to me of her Mistress, who, she said, was passionately in Love with me, but dar'd not tell me so her self. She told me, That if I really lov'd her, she would
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100189:17"/>
endeavour to rid her of those Fears, and to contrive how we should converse privately together. I made her all the Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations she desired; and she assured me, I should shortly see her Mistress, provided I would be discreet. Then she gave me that Caution, That I should not take any Notice of it to the young Lady till she had prepared her thereto.</p>
            <p>This Conversation was scarce ended, when the Duchess came back with her Niece. With what an Eye did I look on that charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Person, having just before heard how well inclined she should be on my Account! I took that Opportunity of assuring her, That I lov'd her even to Madness; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I never was more passionate. I found then, that nothing is more capable of increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Passion, than the thought of an equal Return.</p>
            <p>The Waiting Woman was afraid I should grow impatient. The very next Morning she sent me Word, She had something to say to me: And I went to her in a neighbouring Church. She told me, She had discoursed with her Mistress, and that if I would come that Night to their House, I might see her. You may think, I did not put it off, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my self to her Directions.</p>
            <p>I waited that Evening on the Duchess, who kept me to Supper: And when I thought
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100189:17"/>
it was time to withdraw, I took my Leave; but instead of going out, I went up into a Garret, where they laid their Lumber, into which the Waiting Woman lock'd me. It was extream cold, and I was freezing there for the space of Two Hours. When that Time was expir'd, which was about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, I heard the Door open, and perceived it was the Maid; who, taking me by the Hand, whispered to me, That I should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her. I did, and after many Turnings, I found my self in a Chamber, wherein was a Fire, half out, which gave not Light enough in the Room to let me see where I was. She bid me warm my self, and that my Mistress was coming. Half a quarter of an Hour afterwards, I heard one come in, who, without saying any thing, came near to me. <hi>It is you?</hi> said I, taking her for the Duchess's Niece. I might repeat the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on often enough, no answer was made: This made me think that her Modesty was the cause of her Silence; I therefore resolved to spend no more Time in talk. In that very Moment the Door was open'd, and I saw the Shape of a Man come in. The Person, who was come near me, pushed me into the Ruel, and went to him who had disturbed us. I heard that Man speak very familiarly to her, and she desired him very civilly to go out; which he refused, and answered
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100189:18"/>
with an Oath, That he would see what was the Reason he might not be admitted. With that, in he comes to the Bed-side, where I was, and falling on me in a furious manner, was very free of his Blows. I returned the Complement, endeavouring to get from him, which occasioned some Noise. Immediately I heard a great stirring in the Room over head, and presently a Light enters, which discover'd the Duchess her self, followed by her Waiting Woman. She was no sooner come into the Room, but I knew him who beat me unmercifully to be a Footman that belonged to the House. The Waiting Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shewed me to the Duchess, saying, with Tears in her Eyes, <hi>You see, Madam, I did not tell you a Lye, and that the Knight hid himself in my Chamber with a design to ravish me; I was loath to let you know it, and went and desired</hi> Tom <hi>to turn him out: But it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for him, so that I was forced to call you up.</hi> The Duchess could not forbear laughing, tho' she was very angry, and directing her Words to me, she told me, These were fine Doings, and that I was a pretty Fellow. I was so ashamed that I could not speak one Word. The Duchess sent some of her Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to wait on me to the Door, and I went out, guessing in part the Business.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, That the Waiting Woman had never spoke to her Lady in my behalf,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100189:18"/>
and that she had only made use of her Name to have a Meeting with me her self. She it was that came into the Room, and did not dare to answer when I asked, <hi>Is it you?</hi> Whether the Footman, who came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, had seen me, or that he had used to come to that young Woman, he was resolved to stay there; and she finding her self in that Dilemma, thought the best way to get out of it, was to tell the Dutchess, I was hid in the Room. This had the Effect she desired; she was taken for a chast Vestal, and I for a Debauchee. Neither did I dare to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Duchess presently, because it would have prejudiced her Niece; so all the Shame of that Adventure fell to my share, and no one doubted but I was in Love with the Waiting Woman. The Niece taxed me with it, and it was in vain for me to protest I was innocent, and to tell her what Hopes the Maid had given me. All was to no purpose, and she still believed what was most likely, and took the Truths I told her for sham Excuses.</p>
            <p>I was resolved not to be bubbled, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Niece her self was against me, I told the Dutchess the whole Truth of the Business. This made her suspect the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Woman's Honesty; she watched her, and found she had Intrigues not only with that Footman but also with several others.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100189:19"/>
She was turned out of Doors, and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess and her Niece had no other Complaint to make against me, but that I should har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour such ill Thought of that young Lady, as to expect what Mrs <hi>Abigal</hi> had promised me.</p>
            <p>When all the Truth was out, I found the Duchess and her Niece more obliging than I had done hitherto, and whether they had pitied the ill Success of my Adventure, or that Women have a natural Tendency to love those who have the Courage to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take something for them, I could not doubt but both had a Kindness for me. But, alas! even that served but to give me a farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight into Female Inconstancy.</p>
            <p>The Duchess was the first who open'd her self to me; she told me plainly, That having look'd upon me hitherto but as a Child, she had not dar'd to let me know the secret Inclination she had for me; but that after the Courage and Discretion I had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Adventure with the Waiting Woman, she saw I might be relyed on, and that she would have me love her: <hi>But,</hi> said she, <hi>we must patch up your Reputation, for you have the Name of a Lewd young Man, and it would be ill looked upon if I should admit your frequent Visits, unless you appear quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man than what there is cause to believe you
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100189:19"/>
are. You are the youngest of your Family, and if you will be advised by me, enter into Orders; I will see you shall not want Preferment. Get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Seminary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told her I was ready to obey her; and indeed I was at that Time so pleased with the Thoughts of being courted by a Duchess, that neither the natural Aversion I had for that Profession, nor the Melancholy Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I might make on the Life that is led in a Seminary, could deter me from it.</p>
            <p>I promised her to get some body to speak to my Mother, and that very Day told my Brother of it; and I found my Family very willing to let me take that Condition upon me, which seemed to rid them of all Care of me, better than any other.</p>
            <p>I pretended then a great unconcernedness for worldly Affairs, and made all things ready to enter the Seminary, and to apply my self to Divinity. When this Resolution of mine was given out, the Duchess's Niece, to whom I had not spoke a Word of it, was amazed and much concerned. She told me, I was mad, and that she should never have expected this from me; <hi>For,</hi> added she, <hi>I must confess I have lov'd you ever since I saw you. If I did not presently let you know my Mind, it was because I was desirous to know you first; however, I look'd upon you as the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100189:20"/>
only Man I could fancy, and was in Hopes of being your Wife one Day or other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ah, Madam!</hi> I replyed, <hi>why did you not speak sooner? For what will People say of me, to see me alter my Resolution after the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have made? However, it shall be as you please, and I assure you I will let it alone, if you will have me.</hi> She told me, I must by no means be a Clergyman, and that if I was it would be a sensible Affliction to her; on which I assured her, I would not: and the next Day I told the Duchess, I could not find in my Heart to embrace an Ecclesiastical Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I see,</hi> said she, <hi>you have been with my Niece, I know she loves you, and gives way to the idle Fancies her Passion supplies her with, but she is very wide of her Mark: She is a Fool I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of; and I'le tell you that we intend to marry her within these Two Days.</hi> Thereupon she told me, the Duke, her Husband, and she had taken secret Measures to marry her to a Man of Fortune, who sought for some Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by that Alliance.</p>
            <p>Indeed at this News I found I was really in Love. I was possessed with a deep Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to hear they were going to marry a young Lady, I had a Kindness for, and that to a Man, who deserved her no other way than by his Estate. I told the Duchess, I was ready to do what she would, and would
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100189:20"/>
enter into the Seminary the very next Day, but that it was an unconscionable thing to marry her Niece in that manner. <hi>Do what I desire you,</hi> answered she, <hi>and you shall have no Reason to complain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I gave the Niece an account of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course we had had; and told her, That her Aunt was jealous of the Kindness I had for her, and would marry her if I did not put on a Gown. How was I amazed, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the News that she was to be married, she cried out, as transported with Joy; <hi>Lord! is it possible? Yes,</hi> said I. <hi>But hear to whom; 'tis to such a one. What to him?</hi> said she, in a redoubled extasie. <hi>Oh! I know him, he is an extraordinary Rich Man, and I cannot be better matched. Then I am turned off,</hi> said I, in a serious manner. <hi>You</hi>; said she, <hi>Do Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple use to marry Clergymen?</hi> This was no sooner said, but she ran and called one of her Women, and embracing her; <hi>Ah! my Dear,</hi> said she, <hi>do you know I am going to be married?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remain'd motionless, so great was my Amazement at so unexpected a Change; and I had almost determined my self to become not only an Abbot, but even an Hermit, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women were guilty of so much Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy. She took little heed of the Pain I was in, and I went out with a firm Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to do what the Duchess expected of me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100189:21"/>I remained at <hi>Paris</hi> while my Brother went into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where his Regiment still made a part of the Count of <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Army, and I put on the narrow Band. What I obtained from my Duchess was, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of shutting my self up into a Seminary, I should board my self out somewhere near the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and study Divinity there.</p>
            <p>The first Day that I drest my self as an Abbot, I came to see her, and she instructed me how I should behave my self in that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; How I must look demure, and take a modest Phiz and an honest Countenance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was a great Proof I gave her of my Affection, for besides the natural Aversion I have already said I had for that kind of Life, I was an Enemy to all Affectation: But my Ambition was so flatter'd with my being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by that Woman, that tho' I had not then for her all the Kindness I have since had, yet I thought I must yield a blindfold Obedience to all her Commands.</p>
            <p>She was extreamly taken with me when she saw me an Abbot, and took all possible care to spread a Report, That I was grown a Saint, and that an extraordinary Devotion had induced me to become a Clergyman.</p>
            <p>Indeed, tho it was with great Dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that I played a Part so contrary to my Inclination, yet I was wonderfully pleased that a Lady of such Quality, and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unspotted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100189:21"/>
Reputation, should have so favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Thoughts of me as she seemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press. The Duke, tho' elder than her self, entertained no Suspicion of her Conduct, and she deserved that Trust from him, by Two or Three convincing Proofs she had given him of her Affection, which I shall mention, to shew what a Woman is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
            <p>A Person of the first Quality and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary well accomplished, had courted her, with the most endearing Tokens of a sincere Love, and that in a more respectful and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive manner than those of his Rank are used to do. The Lady had at first answered his Passion; but perceiving it gave her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band some Jealousie, she told her Lover, That she must admit no longer of his Addresses. This almost distracted him, and he fell sick upon it: The only Comfort he had, was, that of Writing to her, and I never saw any thing more soft than his Letters: but she shewed them all to her Husband; who himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed her Answers, which, it may be thought, were not over obliging, since he was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them. I admired how it was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble she could be so cruel to him, who was so obliging to her; and this made me secretly despise her. Certainly, said I, once to her, you must hate that Man unmercifully, to use
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100189:22"/>
him in this barbarous manner. <hi>Hate him?</hi> reply'd she, <hi>not at all; I rather love him, and should I follow my Inclination I would take pity of him: But I love my own Quiet better, and in the present Posture of my Affairs, I must not give my Husband the least Ground to mistrust me.</hi> As young as I was, I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thence, That I must expect the same Fate, if her Husband came to suspect me. However, I kept my Thoughts to my self, and seemed to applaud what my Heart could not but disapprove.</p>
            <p>This Lover of hers knowing that my Visits were freely admitted of, had found the Means to be acquainted with me, that he might have the Pleasure to discourse of her, and I could scarce forbear undeceiving him, when I saw him persuaded that his Mistress's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain proceeded from an excessive Vertue. At last I took so much Compassion on him, and that Woman seemed to me so undeserving his passionate Affection, that I resolved to free him from his Error. I wrote a Letter to him, as unknown, and in a Counterfeited Hand, whereby I gave him Notice, That the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess was not the Woman she appeared to be, and that if he would watch her at such Time as a young Abbot used to visit her, he might be convinced of her Falshood. Being my self the Abbot, I was indeed very inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, to make that Discovery which might
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100189:22"/>
have proved of a fatal Consequence to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I was young and conceited, and I found a secret Pleasure in shewing him that I was more happy than himself; So that, in Truth my Vanity had more share in that Action than either my Generosity or the Pity I took of him.</p>
            <p>My Letter came safe to his Hands, and tho' he gave little Credit to it, yet he resolv'd to make use of the Advice. He took his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get into the Apartment where I used to see the Duchess, and hid himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Tapistry, in a Corner, where he had room enough to stand unseen, and whence he might easily hear all we said. Neither the Duchess nor I knew any thing of his being there, and it was about Three in the Afternoon, the Hour we usually met at: Scarce had we been a quarter of an Hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether but we heard some Noise behind the Hangings. The Duchess ran to see what it was, and found him in a Swound, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most breathless; so great had been his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masement at what had passed.</p>
            <p>I admired the Resolution and Presence of Mind she shewed on that occasion. <hi>Get you gone,</hi> said she, <hi>and let me alone to manage this Business.</hi> I did not give her the Trouble of repeating it a second Time, but was very glad to get out of a place where I thought it not safe for me to remain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100189:23"/>I was no sooner gone but the Duchess cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one of her Women to her, and shewing her the Man behind the Hangings, bid her, Turn him out of the House: Adding, He was a Madman, and that Love had turned his Brain. Her Husband came in that very Minute; and asked, What was the Matter; <hi>It is,</hi> answered she, without the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, <hi>that fool —who was come to see me, and had the good Nature to drop down because I would not hear his Impertinence. Come, my Dear, it is not so proper for you to stay here, let's walk off, and leave to her the Care of sending him home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke led off his Spouse, fondly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressing her, and praising her unparallell'd Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; while our Lover came to himself, and went out without speaking a Word. I did not doubt but he would be revenged on the Duchess and my self, and repented at Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for the Pains I had taken to undeceive him, but I soon perceived his Resentment was not at all prejudicial to me. He resolved to despise her as much as he had ever loved her, and in that he shewed more Wisdom and Discretion than I have since done in the like occasion. Being a very generous Person, he took no notice of this Adventure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways spoke well of the Duchess. I took great Care not to be in his Way, and seldom saw him since, for he dyed a few Months
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100189:23"/>
after, of a Wound he received at the Taking of the City of <hi>Salses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was not the only Hint I had of the Duchess's good Nature, she gave her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band another Instance of it, and that in a manner yet more cruel than what we last mentioned, and which made me begin to fear in earnest. Before she had received my Addresses she had pitch'd upon a Gallant, not quite so young as I was, who was Son to her Nurse, and had persuaded the Duke to prefer him to be her Page, for in those Days they made Pages of riper Years than now. That young Man was still in her Family, when she took a Fancy to me. He was very rash and addle-headed, which made her Son see there was not much to be expected from him; and it was to that Consideration I ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my good Fortune. She judging the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency she had for me might make him jealous, resolved to put it out of his Reach to hurt her, if he should resent it. To effect this, she made him suspicious to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; telling him, He was so audacious as to make a Declaration of Love to her. The Duke immediately took Fire, and without any further Examination, called the Page, threatning to cut his Throat for his Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if he did not immediately quit his Service. The Youth, without being fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100189:24"/>
thereat, answered, That if he had made Love to his Lady, she made the first Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and, as a Proof of it, produced a Note of her's, he had yet in his Possession. The Husband having shewed it to his Lady, she told him with the greatest Confidence, That it was her Hand, but she knew not how he came by it, for it was a Note she had sent to a Lady of her Acquaintance: And indeed unfortunately for the Page, the Note was wrote in such a manner that it was hard to discover whether it was to a Man or to a Woman. The Duke was easily persuaded the business was as his Lady had represented it, and the poor young Man appeared to be guilty of a double Insolence, his Crime seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much height'ned by that aggravating Circumstance. This was not all, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess had presented him with several rich Jewels, which she knew he had kept; so she accused him to her Husband, not only of that Arrogancy but also of Thievery, saying, She missed a thousand things of Value, which she could tax no body else with. The poor young Man's Trunk was searched, and the Jewels found in it; whereupon the Duke would have prosecuted him, but his Lady, a mild, good-natured thing, interceeded with her Husband, That he would only discharge him his Service. The Page, presently after, got a Commission, but was unfortunately
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100189:24"/>
killed in the first Engagement he was in.</p>
            <p>It may well be guessed I was very uneasie at my being so far engaged with a Woman, who, I saw, was so ready to sacrifice her Lovers to her Husband's Jealousie; but I knew not how to break with her; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, my Ambition fast'ned me to her, whom my Reason enclined me to abhor. In the mean while, I applyed my self to my Studies, and began to be in some Reputation among my Fellow-students, tho' I had as yet no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment in the Church, neither, indeed, did I look on the Profession I had undertaken as a lasting one, since I well foresaw the Duchess's Kindness would come to an End in a short Time, and then my Reverence would end with it.</p>
            <p>A Woman came to me one Morning, to acquaint me, That there was a Person who had a Fat Benefice in his Disposal, that would gladly bestow it upon me, and that thro' her Means I might, when I would, come to the Speech of him. I presently imagin'd she was used to make such Bargains, and she frankly owned, that she had put it into that Person's Head, in Hopes I would not forget her Kindness. I heark'ned to her Proposal, more out of Curiosity than for any Fondness I had for the Benefice, and she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100189:25"/>
me at S. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Gate, the next Day. I came thither, and was carried into an ill-look'd House, where being climb'd up to the second Story, I found a Girl of about Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, very ugly, but extraordinary well drest; who addressing her self to me in a familiar way, said, Her Mother was coming, who would inform me further of the Benefice I had been told of, and that in the mean time she was glad to have an occasion to converse with an old Acquaintance. Never was I more puzzled in my Life, for I could not call to mind that I ever had seen her before, tho' she would have perswaded me that I knew her very well. It came in my Head to tell her, That I supposed she designed to try me by that Civility, and that she knew well-enough that a Churchman ought not to be acquainted with Ladies. She appeared to be satisfied with this Answer, saying, She was very glad to see she was not mistaken in me, and that her Mother had indeed looked upon me as a Man whose extraordinary Sanctity might entitle me to Church-preferments. With that she made me a long Sermon, at which I was amazed, to hear a Girl talk so well of Piety, who by the beginning of her Discourse seemed rather to have been inclined to speak to another purpose. By that time the Mother came in, who began with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing me, and then told me a long Story,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100189:25"/>
the burthen of which was, That I should, before a Month were over, see my self, through her means, one of the richest Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen in <hi>France.</hi> I thanked her for her good Will, and was going to take my Leave, when a Lady came in with a Purse, saying, She made a Gathering for a Person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who was fallen under an extream Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. <hi>Ah! my Dear,</hi> said the Mother, <hi>we must remember the Poor</hi>; and put Three Pistols into the Purse: The Daughter gave Two, admonishing me that I should be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable; and I pulled out a Crown, saying, When I should enjoy the Benefice I might afford more liberal Alms. I grew Jealous at these Proceedings, and feared I had Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to deal withal: However, I dissembled my Thoughts, and told them, I should be very glad to hear from them as soon as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I did not tarry long, for the Mother having, in the Discourse we had together, told me, That she had another Daughter in a Nunnery, I was surpriz'd to see her at my Lodging the next Day, with that pretended Daughter of hers, who might be about Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or Sixteen Years old, and seemed very Melancholy. The Sight of that pretty Maid engaged me to feign an Agreement to the Proposal about the Benefice, that I might have a Pretence to see her, in visiting the Mother; which I did Two Days after. I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100189:26"/>
was received by that young Woman, who appeared yet more sad than when she was at my Lodgings; and I could not forbear asking her the Cause of her Grief. She looked first about her, and seeing no person near, told me with Tears in her Eyes, That the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the House was no Mother of hers, but had stole her from her Friends while she was a Child, so that she knew not whom to call Father. These Words were attended with a Shower of Tears; which so moved me with Compassion that I promised her I would take her out of that House. She seemed revived at this Answer, and said, If I had that Charity for her, I should take her away immediately. <hi>I am ordered,</hi> said she, <hi>to entertain you alone, in hopes you may be rude to me; which if you were, there are Rogues ready to hector you, with a Design to bubble you out of your Mony.</hi> I found then what Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I was exposed to in remaining there, and began indeed to fear, lest I should not go out as brisk as I came in: So I rose, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be gone, and telling her, She should not trouble her self, and that I would not suffer her to remain long in such a House: But she, not content therewith, would needs follow me out, fearing, if I went without her, I should forget my Promise. While I was making fresh Protestations, That I would be true to my Word, in came Two Men
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100189:26"/>
with drawn Swords in their Hands, who accosted me in a very rude manner, crying, <hi>So, so Monsieur l'Abbe; what! you love the Ladies, it seems.</hi> I answered them as civilly as I could, telling them, more than once, I was their humble Servant. The Mother, without more ado, said, She must send for a Commissary, and that she would have Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the Wrong I would have done her Daughter. I protested to her, That I had no ill Design, desiring her to enquire of her Daughter. The Girl cried and spoke not a Word: As for me, I was at a great Loss what to do; however, I resolved to brazen it out, saying, I was not unwilling the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary should be sent for. In that very Minute there was great Knocking at the Chamber Door, and the young Woman, under Pretence of seeing who it was, open'd the Door, and rushing out, signed to me, that I should follow her. The new Visitors, whose coming was very seasonable to me, were two other Bullies, who drawing upon those that had assaulted me, cryed out, <hi>Are you there, you Rascals, we are glad we have met with you.</hi> I did not stay to see how those would answer the Complement, but got away as fast as I could, left my Company should have been Troublesome to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who, I saw were upon Business, and got down Stairs; where I found the Maid,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100189:27"/>
who taking me by the Arm, hurried me into the Street. So I went out with the poor Girl, who was all in Tears, while the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was at her Window, crying out, <hi>Help, Thieves, Murther.</hi> The Neighbours got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and I was in a moment surrounded with above One hundred Persons, who were questioning me what was the Matter. My Companion praid me, for God's sake, to get away: I was so giddy, and out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that I could not tell what to do; but, she being more resolute, made Way through the Crowd, and along we went, attended by a numerous but troublesome Train, till we got to a Broker's, who harbour'd us and sent away the Mob. I had lost my Hat and my short Cloak and Band were all to pieces, and the young Woman was in as bad a pickle. The Broker could not tell what to make of us, nor I what account to give him, so he concluded it must be some Fortune I had stole, and very civilly offer'd me his Service, which I readily accepted, and we remained in that House the rest of that Day. She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed a great Joy, to see her self out of that Woman's Hands, at whose House I had found her, and calling me her Deliverer, earnestly begged of me that I would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake her. I sent the Man of the House to the Duchess, with a Letter; wherein I gave her Notice of my Adventure, desiring her
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100189:27"/>
to send me a Coach: She came by her self at Night, and would take me away with her. Then I made her a full Relation of what had passed, and how I found my self entrusted with the young Woman. Her Beauty mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duchess's Compassion, and she car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her home, assuring me that she would keep her, till she could find a Nunnery wherein to place her. This being done, I went to my Lodging, where I was told it was noised about, That I was fallen in Love with a young Woman, and had run away with her. This Report was so strong that it was impossible for me to overcome it, and without being guilty of any other Crime, than of having ventured into a strange House, and of taking a young Woman from the ill People she was with, I went under the Scandal of a Rape, and was looked on as a Debauchee; so little Credit is to be given to outward Appearances, for all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances made against me, insomuch that had any one undertook to vindicate my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would have made himself ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. What I then experienced, to my cost, has ever since prevented my giving too spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a Credit to the Aspersions cast on other People, and whenever I had heard any one ill spoken of, I have thought there might be as little Ground for it as for those laid upon my self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:100189:28"/>This Accident made me determin to throw off the Narrow Band, foreseeing, that after the Noise it had made, it would be hard for me to thrive in a Condition, wherein a Man can never be easie whose Reputation is once tainted. Besides, my Inclination still turn'd the Scale, and tho' I was but very young, yet I apprehended how Troublesome that State must needs be, which obliging Men to be of a more rigid and austere Life, exposes them to be scorned and ridiculed for that which is an Accomplishment in other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I was too brisk for an Hypocrite, my Conversation was sprightly, and I had a natural Tendency to the fair Sex. This often procur'd me sharp Reprimands from my Superiors, and I thought, that to set my self off to the best Advantage I must quit a Habit which prescribed me too narrow Bounds. For, indeed, true Merit lies in knowing how to place ones self aright, and I have seen a thousand Persons, who by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Profession upon them, which they were not fit for, could never attain to the Esteem which might have been paid them, if they had apply'd themselves to what was most proper for them.</p>
            <p>I acquainted the Duchess with my Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, who gave her Consent thereto, the more freely, because she began to grow
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100189:28"/>
weary of me. I took notice of it, but what surprized me was, that she should make use of the Adventure I had had, as a Pretence for her Indifferency. No Body knew better than she did, that I no ways deserved the Scandal I went under. I had at first told her all the Truth; yet through a sudden Alteration of her Mind, she said, that after what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, it were imprudent in her to suffer me to visit her often, since she could not persuade the World I was a sober Man, whilst it was so strongly bent to believe the contrary. This made me take Notice of what I have since had a Thousand Instances of, that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is but small who are generous enough to justifie an absent Friend.</p>
            <p>I was very easie at the Duchess's change; but the Maid's Ungratefulness, whom I had saved from certain Ruin, gave me no small Trouble. The Duke was at first Sight so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with her, that he grew stark mad for her, and expressed so much Passion that the Damsel, who was not so great a Child as she appeared to be, resolved to make her Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it. She seem'd to resist him, which so increased his Passion that every Body took Notice of it. The Duchess was, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be jealous thereat; and being desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to send her away as speedily as possible, made use of me to persuade her to suffer her
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100189:29"/>
self to be carry'd into a Nunnery, unknown to the Duke. I not doubting in the least but she had a great Respect for me, after the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Service I had done her, proposed the thing to her, telling her, of how great a concern it was to her, to keep in Favour with her Lady. She ask'd me why I troubled my self? Which, indeed, put me into a great Passion: I could not forbear taxing her with Ingratitude; which she answered by affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me: And desired me, Not to concern my self with her Business, denying, with the utmost Confidence, that I had ever laid any Obligation upon her. Good Gods! how was I amaz'd at her Impudence? and how often did I cry out, <hi>What Creatures Women are?</hi> Having left her, I went and desired the Duchess to dispose of her as she pleased, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her an account of the Discourse we had had. The Duchess found she had a cunning Jilt to deal withal, and resolv'd to send her back to the Place whence I had brought her. Enquiry was made for the Woman, who went for her Mother, but she was not to be found; and we understood the pretended Mother, the other Daughter, and the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that had affronted me, were all pack'd off.</p>
            <p>The Duchess, not knowing what to do with her, and being resolv'd to get rid of her, did not stick to put her out of Doors;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100189:29"/>
and one Night that wretched Creature was forced from her Chamber and carry'd into an Hospital without the Suburbs, to the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of which she was recommended as a poor friendless Maid, whom they would do a Deed of Charity to receive into that House.</p>
            <p>The Duke was in the Country, and I knew nothing of all this; but it was not long e're I understood it: For the Duke came Home, and not finding her there, ask'd what was become of her? The Duchess answered, She had not heard of her since one Morning, that she went out unknown to any Body, and that she supposed he best knew where she was. The Duke fretted, swore and threat'ned, and came presently to me, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I might inform him; which it were strange if I should, being ignorant of the matter. While I protested to him, That I could give him no account of the Girl, a Servant came to tell me, That there was a Gown-man that wanted to speak with me. I answered, I could not leave my Lord Duke, and that I desired him to call another Time. But he was urgent to speak with me, and, with the Duke's Leave he was call'd in; then taking me aside, <hi>Sir,</hi> said he, <hi>it is unconsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable in you, after you have debauched a poor Girl, to send her into an Hospital; I must tell you we can keep her no longer, and that we desire
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100189:30"/>
you to take her away.</hi> I pray'd him to explain his meaning, and understood he was one of the Directors of the Hospital, and that the Slut had inform'd them, I had sent her thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Duke took notice that we spoke with a great deal of Heat, and asked, What was the Matter? whereupon the Priest told him what we were discoursing about. The Duke grew extream angry, and calling me a Rogue and a Rascal, said, He would take Care of her; and leaving me, took the Clergyman into the Coach with him, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to direct his Coachman to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital. I vow'd to him, I had no Hand in the Business, earnestly begg'd I might go with him, and offer'd to convince him out of the Girl's own Mouth, That I had no Share in what passed. But the Duke would by no means permit me, and was accompanied by none but the Clergyman, swearing he would be revenged on me. Away they went, and I ran to the Duchess's, to give her an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how matters stood, at which she was much surpriz'd; but taking the Hint from the Opinion she understood her Husband was prepossess'd with, That I had sent the Girl into the Hospital, she secretly resolved not to undeceive him, but to let the Weight of the Duke's Anger fall upon me: So all the ill of this second Adventure fell to my Share. The Duke took his Mistress home again, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100189:30"/>
has never since had any Kindness for me; the Duchess, on the other Hand, protested to him, she was ignorant where the Maid was gone, and, to regain his Favour, winkt at the Kindness he had for her, which lasted three or Four Years; after which he marry'd her to a Captain, who has since raised her to a considerable Fortune, insomuch that she was reckon'd one of the richest Ladies at Court, and was in no small Esteem: It is not long since she dyed.</p>
            <p>Being fixt in my Design, of leaving the Clergy, I wrote to my eldest Brother about it; who very well approv'd of my Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and sent me some Mony, that I might come to him. He was then in the <hi>Roussillon,</hi> but order'd me to wait for him at <hi>Lyons,</hi> where he intended suddenly to be; in Hopes of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars,</hi> who had been so good to him; and was to be brought there, after his Condemnation, in order, as it was reported, to suffer a shameful Death.</p>
            <p>I then clap'd on a Sword, and taking my Leave of my Brethren, Abbots (some of whom have since attain'd to considerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in the Church; which has often made me repent that I did not stay among them) I arrived at <hi>Lyons,</hi> where I met my Brother, who had disguised himself, that he might the easier find an Opportunity to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100189:31"/>
see his dear Friend, and receive his last Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>I had hitherto met with Instances of the Female Sex's Inconstancy, but I now found stronger Proofs of the little Trust that is to be reposed <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">

               </gap> 
               <hi>de Cinq Mars,</hi> who was brought to <hi>Lyons</hi> the next day after my arrival. My Brother and I went, dress'd like Serving-men, near to the Town-Hall-Gate, that he might see us, as he came out of his Coach. He took Notice of us, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from our Habit that we were there <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> desired he might be permitted to speak with us, alledging we had been Servants of his. It was pretty hard for him to obtain that Favour, but we acting our parts well-enough, and neither our Cloaths nor our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour betraying us, were, a Moment after, admitted into his Chamber. We could not forbear breaking out into Floods of Tears, as we embrac'd him, but he, smiling on us, <hi>What, my dear Friends,</hi> said he, <hi>could you then think all this were real, and that the King would ever suffer me to be put to Death?</hi> My Brother, who was better inform'd than I that his Condition was <hi>hopeless,</hi> redoubled his Grief, seeing him so confident, and embracing him with a more fervent Zeal, expressed so deep a Sorrow, that Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100189:31"/>
changed Colour, and starting back, <hi>What then,</hi> cry'd he, <hi>are they in earnest?</hi> My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued embracing him, and shedding abundance of Tears, but had not Power to speak a Word; and Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Wars,</hi> seeing he could not get any Answer from him, turns to me, saying, <hi>What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all this?</hi> He had no sooner spoke, but I saw so great an Alteration in his Face that I thought he would have swounded, and my Brother, throwing his Arms about his Friend's Neck; <hi>Ah! dear Sir,</hi> said he, <hi>your Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is but too certain.</hi> Here he remained speechless, and Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> falling on a sudden from deep Sadness into an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Passion: <hi>What,</hi> said he, <hi>must I be trick'd thus!</hi> This was followed by a torrent of Oaths and Imprecations, which my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stopp'd, by saying, That he thought it his Duty, as his real Friend and Servant, to advise him to forgive his Enemies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Death. <hi>Ah! As for Death,</hi> reply'd Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars, it is not that troubles me, but I never can forgive the Procurers of it:</hi> And then he told us, How the King had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given him frequent Assurances, That he would dye rather than forsake him. My Brother heard them without Interruptions, and when he had done, inform'd him, in a few Words, How there was no Favour to be expected from his Majesty. Monsieur <hi>de
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100189:32"/>
Cinq Mars</hi> continued his Discourse, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cursing the Court, sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving his Escape, and then desir'd my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lend him a Dagger, to stab himself withal; and having no Answer, he fell down in his Chair, saying, <hi>I see, dear Friend, that I am lost: What shall I do?</hi> Then growing a little more sedate; <hi>'Tis true,</hi> said he, <hi>I find I must prepare for a Future State: Well, I am resolved to do it, and since I have been so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly deceived in this World, I must prevent my being so in the next.</hi> He wept while he spoke these last Words; and my Brother exhorted him not to dwell upon the Thoughts of what had past, but to prepare himself for his ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death. This Conversation lasted about Two Hours, and we had the Consolation to behold him very calm, tho' without any Hope or Thoughts of a Pardon. He begged we would excuse his Weakness and want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and gave some Commissions for my Brother to execute; desiring him not to quit <hi>Lyons</hi> till he had seen what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him. We departed, glad to leave him in so good a Disposition. There was no possibility for us to see him any more, for his Execution came on presently after, at which we were present, getting as near to the Scaffold as we could, where he appeared with an undaunted Courage, and was as resolute as when we left him. When first
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100189:32"/>
he mounted the Scaffold, he looked about him, with a Design (as we thought) to spy us out; and I know not whether he did or no, but he bowed towards us. Indeed, I could not bear that doleful Sight, but cast down my Eyes, which I lifted not up, till I had heard the fatal Blow. Then I saw his Trunk, out of which issued a Stream of Blood; Upon which my Brother said, <hi>Let us be gone, the Business is over.</hi> We, rather dead than living, were no sooner at home but we got to Bed, where my Brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a longer Time than I did, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fallen sick upon it. I had all the Reason imaginable to love my dear Brother, who had been so kind to me, but the Instance he then gave me of his good Nature, increased the Affection I bore him. He often told me, Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi>'s Misfortune proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Passion he had for some Women, who were the cause of his ill Conduct. This and the Experience I had of the Falshood of that Sex, while at <hi>Paris,</hi> made me firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve never to engage my self any more with them. But, alas, there is little heed to be given to such kind of Resoutions; the Love of Women is a dangerous Rock, on which, tho' warn'd by numberless Shipwracks, yet the Spring-Tide of our Inclination will still hurry us. But, if I had no reason to speak well of them in my younger
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100189:33"/>
Days, it grew ten times worse when a riper Age gave Place to a more refined and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Passion.</p>
            <p>I follow'd my Brother into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where my first Campaign made me an Eye-witness of the taking of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and the Conquest of all the <hi>Roussillon.</hi> I served then in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and in some occasions convinc'd him I was no Coward, for I was more daring than usual in the first Engagements; a Military Life began to please me, and being well read in History, I fancy'd my self to tread in the Steps of <hi>Cesar</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> which animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Soul with an Heroick Courage.</p>
            <p>About the latter End of <hi>October</hi> we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Paris,</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Lerida,</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Mareschal <hi>de la Mothe.</hi> He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented me to the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> giving me all the Praise that can well be bestow'd on a young Man. The Cardinal, who knew my Brother, and was not ignorant of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars,</hi> told me, (which I understood not in what Sense to take) That I had a very discreet Brother, and that I should do well to follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. My Brother, who was present, making no reply, he repeated over-again, That I had a very discreet Brother; adding, That he knew him to be so: And promised us
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100189:33"/>
all possible Favour, provided we would stick to our Duty.</p>
            <p>This Visit being ended, I asked my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Why the Cardinal had insisted so much on his Discretion; and he inform'd me, That the Cardinal had, two Days before, sent for him, to discourse with him about Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars:</hi> That he seemed to him to be very much concerned on his account, and had ask'd him several Questions, especially For what Reason Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi> had such an Aversion for him. To which, he told me, he had answered, That he had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Designs or secret Inclinations of Monsieur <hi>de Cinq Mars</hi>; and the Cardinal not having appear'd satisfied with this Reply, he suppos'd what he had said was by way of Reflexion. This made us think the Cardinal would rather be an Enemy than a Friend to us: But the Death of that Prelate, which happen'd the Fourth Day of <hi>December</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, soon rid us of those Fears.</p>
            <p>I was then Eighteen Years old, we lived with my Mother, who allowed us Meat, Drink and Lodging; but we could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her to do more for us, by reason she had made a Shift, what by her Settlement and other Pretensions, to get from us the little Estate my Father had left. My Brother, the Count, was also with us, and she had taken
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100189:34"/>
home my Sister, who was near Thirty, and had constantly refused to remain in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent as a Nun. My Mother had a Design to marry her to a young Officer, whom she had the entire Management of. It was an ill Match for her Daughter, but she, who had no greater Desire than to get rid of her, thought it good enough, provided he would but agree to it. Fearing, however, it might sound ill that she should consent to so unequal a Marriage, she endeavour'd to vindicate her self, by bringing things about in such a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that she might seem to have been forced to it; and there I had an Instance how basely Parents seek rather their own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction than their Children's Happiness, may act to their Prejudice. The Way she made use of was, to make People believe he had debauch'd her; and to compass her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, she left them alone as long as they pleased. By this means the Officer fell in Love with my Sister, and endeavoured all he could to do what my Mother intended; but she resisted him, either out of Vertue or a want of Kindness for him. Her Coyness added fresh Fuel to the Fire, for he grew more Passionate, and through my Mother's secret Assistance (tho' not appearing in the Matter) easily got into my Sister's Chamber, while she was asleep. My Mother having quickly Intelligence, made us all be called
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100189:34"/>
up, to surprize them together; whereupon we went into the Room, when my Mother, without admitting any Excuses, made the Officer promise, He would marry her the next Day: Which was done, tho' my Sister swore there had nothing passed between them that might any way prejudice her Honour. But she was forc'd to comply, and fearing, lest a Mother, who was so unworthy as to expose her thus, should punish her worse some other way, she consented to marry a Man whom she had never any Respect for; but all my Mother got by their Wedding was, that she coupled two Persons together, who soon became a Charge to her.</p>
            <p>My Brother, tho' he had no Estate besides his Commission, had long since thought of getting him a Wife; he lov'd and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by a Person of the first Quality. The Match would have been very equal, had her Parents given their Consent; for tho' my Brother bore not so high a Title, yet his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was more Ancient, and his own perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Merit, with the honourable Post he had in the Army, made him be not a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected; but he had not as yet attained to the pitch of Preferment he arrived to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and they judged of him then but by the smallness of his Estate. That Lady was deny'd him, and he resolving to be marry'd,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100189:35"/>
espous'd a rich <hi>Partizan</hi>'s Daughter, who brought him near Four hundred thousand Livers. This Marriage was the making of him, and he was in the Right, to consider, that how great soever his Desert might be, he could never put himself forward, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Estate to support it.</p>
            <p>The Lady whom he had courted, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd at it, tho' he had taken no little Pains to make her sensible, That it was a Folly in him to persist in loving her. She was not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with his Arguments, for she was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate and opinionated, and affected to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn Wealth and Honour as much as my Brother seem'd to respect both. In a Word, she would have made a fine Character in a Novel.</p>
            <p>My Brother, who had a great Affection for me, kept nothing of all this from my Knowledge, and I was informed by him how he had disobliged her. My Head being full of Romances, I admired his Mistress's Humor, and blam'd my Brother for having marry'd against her Will; nay, I found my self inclin'd to affect so Romantick a Person, and would gladly have been in her Favour: But the Count, my Brother, had prevented me, having already engaged her. I do not know whether she lov'd him, or whether it was to spite my eldest Brother, that she seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to admit of his Addresses, but I perceiv'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100189:35"/>
they were pretty familiar, when I design'd to make my Applications to her. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being a Brute, who kept no Measures with any one, I thought fit to put off my Courtship to another Time. All I did was to tell my eldest Brother of it; who foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what might follow, and having yet some Respect for the Lady, seriously advised my Brother to desist. He presently acquainted his Mistress with it; who, thinking my eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Brother had done it out of Jealousie, and resolving to provoke him as far as she could, propos'd his running away with her: Which, suiting with his Temper, he readily embrac'd, for he was vain and rash enough to have attempted the stealing of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
            <p>They put all things in readiness to effect their Purpose, but a Person whom the Lady entrusted with it, and who dreaded the Event, acquainted her Father with it; who sent her immediately into a Nunnery, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Brother ever to come near her. The Fool sent him a Challenge, which the other slighting, obtain'd an express Order for his Imprisonment, and he remain'd Two Years in the <hi>Bastile,</hi> wherein the Lady's Father caused him to be confin'd.</p>
            <p>We were not sorry for our being rid of him, seeing he was always full of Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, which occasioned no small Trouble
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100189:36"/>
to us; besides, I had still a Secret Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Young Lady, and all she had done on that Score did but inhance my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. I was heartily vexed that she should not have pitch'd upon me sooner than on that giddy Cockscomb. My Vanity was offended at it, and I wished for an Opportunity of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her heart; so unaccountable are the means wherby the several Passions creep into our Breast; for, to speak the Truth, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of my Love should rather have been a Reason for my Contempt. My Thoughts ran wholly upon that beautiful Person, and I long'd to see her in the Convent where she was For which end, I represented to my Brother, That what she had done, being but through a fit of Anger, he ought not to desert her; this I did so effectually, that he resolved to make her a Visit, and carry'd me with him. He would not appear in it at first, but sent me to her in a Footman's Disguise, as tho' I had come from her Father. She came to me, and having known me, expressed no little Joy; and I forgetting that my Errand was but to give her Notice of my Brother's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I mention'd not a Word of him, but spoke only of my self. I upbraided her with her Intriegue with my Brother, the Count, as an Injustice she had done me, who was her most passionate Adorer. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was answered in a very obliging
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100189:36"/>
manner, for she desir'd me to write to her daily, and see her often, and assured me she would be wholly at my Devotion. Our Conversation lasted so long, that my Brother growing impatient, came in to see what staid me there all that while, and desired me to withdraw. I was not over-well satisfied at it, but fearing to disoblige him, I went out, and stood close to the Door, list'ning to their Discourse.</p>
            <p>I heard, that after the shedding of several Tears, she said, She was unhappy in having settled her Love on that Brother of the three who had the least Affection for her, and thereupon she gave him an account of all I had said to her. I could scarce forbear inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her in her Treachery; however, I did not, but heard my Brother admonish her not to hearken to young Men, who only sought her Ruine, but by a sober and modest behaviour to regain her Father's Good Will, and then to think of a Husband that might deserve her; as for him, he would remain her sure and constant Friend. She answer'd these wholesome Admonitions by a fresh Shower of Tears and new Reproaches, swearing his Inconstancy should not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punish'd, but that her self would revenge it by his Blood. My Brother having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd, in vain, to appease her, left her, and we came back. He told me, by the way,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100189:37"/>
That he was happy not to have marry'd her, and that she was of a dangerous violent Temper, and one who would not stick at any thing to compass her Ends; an Instance of which was, That she had pretended to him that I had courted her. I cry'd out, <hi>Oh, the Iilt!</hi> I had not Power to say any more, but the Tears came in my Eyes. My Brother fell a laughing, and by the Exhortations he made me, To be very wary in my Addresses, and take Care what Women I had to deal withal, made me suspect he did believe her. I was vexed to the Heart, at what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and charm'd at the same Time with my Brother's Goodness and Moderation, who did not express any Dissatisfaction with me, but only advised me, for my own sake, not to concern my self with her. I follow'd his Counsel, tho' something unwillingly, and, I think, I should have went on my own way, had not two things happen'd; one, that she marry'd a Person of Quality in the Country, and the other, that my Brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order'd away to the Army, I was oblig'd to accompany him thither.</p>
            <p>We went into <hi>Champaigne,</hi> which was that Year become the Seat of the War, and my Brother's Regiment, with some other Troops of Reserves, were order'd to stay under the Walls of <hi>Charleville.</hi> My Brother,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100189:37"/>
who had been made a Brigadier General, follow'd the Duke <hi>d'Anguin,</hi> leaving me to look after his Regiment, during the Battle at <hi>Rocroy.</hi> I was not a little troubled that I could not be there, and tho' I had that Year obtain'd a Company in my Brother's Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that all the Officers paid me a great Respect, yet I should have been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solable, had I not met with a handsom Maid, who employ'd my Thoughts another way. She was Daughter to a Citizen of that Town; but besides her Beauty, her Carriage raised her above her Birth, and both together kindled a Passion in me, which she answer'd with an equal Flame: She was going to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a young Man of that Town, when I first grew acquainted with her, but her Aversion to a Citizen's Life was so great that she own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, She had rather be my Mistress all her Life, than to be marry'd to that Man. <hi>For,</hi> said she, <hi>I cannot pretend that you should mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me; I weigh too well the Difference between your Quality and mine, and should never require it of you: But I will trust to your Honour, and leave my self to your Disposal, too happy in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying your Love and Conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I was so transported to hear her talk thus, that I thought I had never lov'd till then; so great was the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what I felt for her, and what I had felt for others. I answer'd, Her Heart was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100189:38"/>
all I could covet; and that if I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to her Bliss, I would marry her that very moment. <hi>No, no,</hi> said she, <hi>do not think of that, only contrive to place me where we may freely give and receive Tokens of each other's Love.</hi> We agreed, that after the Campaign was over, I should send for her to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that she would, the whilst, make her Friends believe she had a mind to enter into a Religious House. She was wholly guided by me; but I, at last, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with a strong Desire of enjoying her, resolv'd to marry; and having made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and got a Priest and some Witnesses, we went into the Country, where we made a Wedding; to which the most essential Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were wanting, and which seem'd as good as any to us Two, who understood not what was requisite for it's Validity. No Body knew of it but such Persons as must needs be entrusted with it, and, about a Fortnight after, finding a Necessity for me to be gone, she went into a Nunnery, declaring to her Friends, That she had renounc'd all Thoughts of a Husband, and had made a Vow to lead a Holy Life. They, who had already begun to be jealous at my frequent Visits, were glad to see her so well dispos'd, and readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to what she had a mind to impose on their Belief; and she, the better to cover her Design, took a Nun's Habit. I also gave
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100189:38"/>
over visiting her, as soon as she had taken it, but I was present at that Ceremony, wherein I just got a Minute to bid her adieu; for towards the latter end of <hi>Iuly</hi> our Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was order'd for the Siege of <hi>Thionville.</hi> Her <hi>Noviciat</hi> being to last a Year, I pro<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ised her, That before that Time were <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I would take her from that Nunnery, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her to <hi>Paris.</hi> She told me, She thought her self with Child, and begged I would not let her stay too long there. I swore with all possible Sincerity, That I would be as good as my Word, so soon as the Forces should be in their Winter-Quarters, and left her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing possessed with all the Love and Grief my Heart was capable of. We had taken our Measures for Writing to each other, but our Letters were intercepted, and she did not hear from me all the while the Campaign lasted. There was no possibility of my leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Army to fetch her out of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or of being inform'd of the Cause of her Silence; for after the taking of <hi>Thion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> we were sent into <hi>Germany,</hi> to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Mareschal <hi>de Guebrant</hi>'s Army. I never could obtain Leave to be absent, but remain'd most part of the Winter there; all I could do was to order some Soldiers, that went for <hi>France,</hi> to call at <hi>Charleville,</hi> but I never heard from them since. About the latter end of <hi>March</hi> I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100189:39"/>
the very next Day rid Post for <hi>Charleville,</hi> for I was almost distracted through the Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Anguish I had, not to have heard, for Ten Months together, from a Person, whom I was so tender of, and for whom my Flame was increased by my Uneasiness at the Ignorance I remain'd in of her Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Being arrived at <hi>Charleville</hi> about Three in the Afternoon, I saw a Multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple got together; and having ask'd what was the matter, I was informed that they were going to hang a young Woman, who had murther'd her unlawful Issue. I presently saw the Prisoner coming along, attended by a Confessor and a Hangman; but, good Gods! How great was my Amazement, when fixing my Eyes on that unfortunate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I found her to be the same I had so great a Desire to see! There was such an Alteration in her Face, that none but a Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could have known her; and as often as I think on the sad Estate she was in, I cannot forbear weeping at the melancholy Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>I ador'd her, with the utmost Passion, my Esteem for her was not inferior to my Love, and I never had known any thing of her but what deserv'd my Admiration; then let it be judged how these Impressions could affect my Soul at such a Sight: I was ready
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100189:39"/>
to drop down with Grief and astonishment; but having some Presence of Mind, I made way through the Crowd, crying out, as loud as I could, <hi>Grace, Grace.</hi> The People hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, thought I really brought a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve, and began to flock about me. I saw the Signs of a general Joy appear in every Countenance, and was thereby encouraged to cry out louder yet, that every one should assist me in saving her. With this, part of them began to pull down the Gallows, while the boldest followed me, and having routed the Officers of Justice, she was left to our Management. They took her, and gave her into my Arms, as I sate on Horseback; and I, embracing her, spurr'd on, and got without the Walls. The Catch-Poles made a shew of following me, but my kind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates shut the City-Gates upon me, and I found my self in one of the Suburbs, where I met with no Opposition; far from that, a Man, who let Horses out to hire, seeing mine could scarce gallop, gave me a fresh one; on which I mounted, without aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning my Prey. And more than all this, Four Horsemen, well equipp'd, came, of their own good Will, to offer me their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; so easily is the People mov'd to save from Punishment, such as are convicted of certain Crimes, occasion'd by Despair. I got out then, with my Four Companions,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100189:40"/>
and having gallop'd for about a League, went into a Wood to take a little Breath, and endeavouring to set my Mistress up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, being not able to hold her in my Arms any longer: She was in a Swound, and had so little Breath, that having laid her down, I thought she had been really dead. One of the Men that were with me, who was stronger and less tired than my self, told me, It was not safe staying where we were, and that he would undertake to carry her thus till Night. We got up on Horseback, and at Two the next Morning arrived at a Town Twelve League distant from <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>; so great was the Speed we had made. There we rested Two Hours, and the first thing we did was to put the poor Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into a very hot Bed, where she began to give some Signs of Life. I was near her all the while, and the Joy I conceived at her Deliverance was not great enough to stifle the Vexation I was in, at the Thoughts of what she had endured, and of her present Condition. At length she open'd her Eyes, and having fixed them on me, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing any Knowledge of me, I grasp'd her very tenderly, and with Tears in my Eyes; <hi>Ah!</hi> said I, <hi>do you not then know me?</hi> She chang'd Colour, and raising her self up, ask'd me, in a Fright, <hi>What, Sir, are you dead?</hi> I answered, No. I was living; and,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100189:40"/>
at length, by often telling her who I was, she came to her self again, and I had the Comfort of seeing her Fit had left no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Symptoms.</p>
            <p>Who can express the Extasie I was in, when I saw her alive again; and the Joy, the Tenderness and Love I was possessed with, when her Eyes discover'd, that she was as sensible to the Pleasure of seeing me, as I to that, of once more possessing her! Those (if any) are happy Moments. We embrac'd each other, without uttering one Word, for our Tears and Sighs would have stopt our Speech, had the Transport we were in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted us to talk. But our Joys were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd by the necessity of pursuing our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and, by good Fortune, we found there a kind of Horse-Litter, wherein we placed her; and thus we came to <hi>Reims</hi> by break of Day. We hid our selves in a private House, where my obliging Company re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd with me all Day, and then taking their Leave they promised me they would not betray us, but would pretend they had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued us, and could not overtake us.</p>
            <p>I remain'd alone with that charming Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who informed me how she had been involv'd in the fatal Danger I had relieved her from. <hi>Seeing,</hi> said she, <hi>that I could not hear from you, I doubted not but you had proved false to me, and that made me resolve
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100189:41"/>
to turn Nun, in earnest; but I was in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Trouble, when I felt too certain Signs of my being with Child, and my Care in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased as my Time drew near. I know not what kept me from destroying my self, for Death was the only thing I wished for, being depressed with the sorrow I was in, to see you had deceived me; and, with the Extremity of my Circumstances, I revealed my condition to an old Maid, which belong'd to the Convent, wherein she had served a long time, and she was the only one who had any Knowledge of my being delivered, for I had the Courage not to cry out. This wicked Woman took the Child, without saying anything to me, save That she would dispose of it, and going out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was Day, threw it into a Rivulet that runs through the Nunnery. By a Mischance, or rather by the Direction of Divine Iustice, the Child being carry'd down the Stream, stuck to a Grate, which divided part of the Convent from a Street that is very much frequented. It was seen, and the Iustices sent for; who came to the Nunnery, very much scandalized. Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being given to the Abbess, she easily found out I was the Mother; and I took little Pains to justifie my self, so great was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire I had to be rid of a Life that was grown irksome and tedious to me. So, I accused not her who had done the Fact, and every body thought me the only Criminal. None of the Nuns took any Pity of me, but all, on the contrary, did, with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100189:41"/>
the utmost Severity, say, There was no Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bad enough for me. Thus was I delivered into the Hands of Secular Iustice, and all my Friends Interest could not obtain the putting a Stop to my Sentence. I was removed to</hi> Paris, <hi>where my dreadful Doom was confirmed: And, while I was there, I wrote a Letter to you (which you will perhaps find in the Hands of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Porter) wherein I bad you farewel, and told you what Thoughts I retained for you, and that I died entirely yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, inclining her Head in my Bosom, a Flood of Tears hindred her farther Discourse. As for me, I could not forbear weeping, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the sad Relation; which at last she end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, telling me, That when I came in, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>Grace,</hi> she knew me; but that since that Moment she had been wholly depriv'd of that little Sense, which the Dread of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Death had left her. This Disaster pierced me to the Quick, that I should have been the occasion of her Misery.</p>
            <p>Having recovered her Health, I asked her, What she thought of going to <hi>Paris</hi> with me? She had no reason to doubt of the Sincerity of my Affection, nevertheless, through a Generosity, which shew'd her Soul greater yet than I could have thought it. <hi>No,</hi> said she, <hi>my Dear, I cannot flatter my self with the Thoughts that you love me still: The Crime I have appeared guilty of, and the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100189:42"/>
Sentence I lye under make me for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy your Esteem; all I expect from you is, That you would have so much Compassion on me as to procure me a Confinement, where I may spend the residue of my Life in an unfeigned and austere Penance. Ah!</hi> replied I, <hi>for God's sake, do not cherish such Fancies, I am the Criminal, you are Innocent. Nothing of this redounds to your Shame, but will rather inhance my Love and Admiration.</hi> All Arguments were fruitless, and she being persuaded that our Marriage could not stand good, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately bent to turn Nun, which I promis'd I would not oppose, so soon as we should arrive at <hi>Paris.</hi> She suffer'd me to carry her thither, and I took a Lodging for her near to the Fathers <hi>Recollets,</hi> in S. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, where I left, and returned Home. There I found the Letter she had spoken of, which I have ever since kept by me, and will insert here, in confirmation of her Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Date my Letter from a doleful Prison, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned to dye, for a Crime that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but from the too great Affection I bore you; for the melancholy occasion of my Iourney hither was, to hear the Confirmation of the dreadful Sentence I lye under. Who would have thought, alas! that I should have seen <hi>Paris,</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:100189:42"/>
on this account, when it was there I once proposed to have been made for ever happy, by enjoying you! You will abhor the Thoughts of me, when you know through what kind of Death my Days are at an end: Nevertheless, I assure you, That how shameful soever it be, I imbrace it with Pleasure, as ridding me of a Life grown tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to me, since you have forgot me. If you go to <hi>Charleville</hi> you will there be informed of my Guilt, without your being suspected to be any ways concerned; for I have never mentioned your Name, desiring to preserve your Honour and Reputation, which I value above my own Safety. The only Favour I beg of you is, That you would cause some Masses to be said for my Soul; and that you would believe, if Heaven has Mercy on me, I shall continually interceed for your Prosperity.</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>I cannot express how I was moved at the Reading of this Letter: I ran to her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, more determined than ever not to suffer her to part from me; there I found her not, and understood that a <hi>Father Recollet</hi> had been
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100189:43"/>
with her. I went to him to enquire what was become of that lovely Creature, but he would not satisfie me; and, after a Week's Search I understood she was at the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> with a design to embrace a Religious Life. Thither I ran, and with much Difficulty got Leave to see her. I never was so transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I fell at her Feet, and swore I would stab my self, if she would not hearken to me. My Despair moved her Compassion, and she said, with Tears in her Eyes; <hi>What would you do Sir? You cannot marry me and keep your Reputation, and it would be an eternal Shame to you to espouse a Woman whom you have taken from the Gallows. That is not the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> answered I, <hi>I will not marry you, since you thus refuse me, but if you must be a Nun, pray chuse some other House. O! Sir,</hi> reply'd that charming Person, <hi>I will not be a Charge to you; I came hither because my Admittance would cost me nothing, and I cannot enter into another Convent, without putting you to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which I know you cannot well bear, Ah!</hi> said I, <hi>my Life and Fortune are devoted to you, and whatsoever it cost, I will certainly place you, where you shall not be liable to such Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</hi> To this I added a thousand more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Expressions, but could obtain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from her; then she left me, with an <hi>Adieu,</hi> so moving, it wounded my very Soul. Not prevailing with her, I ask'd for the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100189:43"/>
and opposed her entertaining that young Woman, acquainting her, She was my Wife, and that I demanded her as such. She thereupon, sending for her, told her, She could not receive her, and so I had her again; but overcome, by her pressing Intreaties, I carried her to a little Convent, the Superior of which was my very good Friend, to whom I recommended her, as being a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of near concern to me.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, what I had done at <hi>Charleville,</hi> made no small Noyse in the World, and I heard Informations were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd against me. All my Friends had heard the Story, and I found by publick Discourse, that indeed I could not marry her with Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. I shall not relate all the several Designs that came into my Head, for I thought it very hard that I should be so great a Slave to other Men's Opinions, as not to have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of spending my Life with a Person, whose Reputation was only tainted by the Misfortune of loving me. If she would have consented to it, my Resolution was to go into <hi>England,</hi> but she was still persuaded, that I ought, for my own Credit, to let her take a Nun's Habit. My eldest Brother, to whom I related the Particulars of this Accident, told me, He pitied me, but that I was happy, however, to have met with a Person, who was of her self inclined to do
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100189:44"/>
what I should have persuaded her to. This he confirmed with so many good Reasons, that I saw it was necessary for me to comply with her Desires. I obtained her Pardon and my own, and then we placed her into a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery of the <hi>Carmelites.</hi> My eldest Brother generously presented her with Two thousand Crowns; and I obliged her to accept of a small Annuity, which I freely gave to the Convent. We changed her Name, and concealing what had happen'd to her, she was admitted with a great deal of Respect, and no body has ever known who she was. She has since led a very Holy Life, and my Brother and I have for ever after had in her a sincere and assured Friend, to whom we had always recourse, when we wanted Advice or Consolation. It was with all imaginable Difficulty that I brought my self to consider her as a Person secluded from the World, and had not my Brother ever afforded me a kind Assistance, I should, no doubt, have lost my Wits. Indeed I never had so violent a Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for any one; so that by the odd Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Fate, that only Woman, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served my Esteem, was one whom my Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our obliged me not to marry.</p>
            <p>This Adventure put me very much back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the World, for it was a whole Year before I would see any Body, having taken a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100189:44"/>
retir'd Lodging, near the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> whence I never stirr'd, and where I lived privately; for I went under the Notion of a Man that had withdrawn himself from Conversation, and minded nothing but the way to Heaven. My Brother, however, kept my Company indisposed of, having given out that I was ill, and obliged to drink the Waters of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> which were absolutely necessary for the Recovery of my Health.</p>
            <p>I shall forbear giving an account of the Life I led in that kind of Hermitage, and how agreeable it was to me to discern my <hi>Carmelite</hi>'s Voice from that of her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, while they were singing Mass. For that was the only Bliss I enjoyed, since she had, during that time, denyed me her Sight; only she wrote to me sometimes, advising me to think of her no longer, and either wholly to forsake the World, or follow a Life more suitable to my Birth.</p>
            <p>My Brother's Desires, joyn'd with her Admonitions, prevailed with me to return to the Army; which I did in the Year 1645. I was then but Twenty; but I thought that after the Experience I had had, it would be impossible for any Woman to delude me again. I made the Art of War my only Study, and found that the Trouble which the loss of a Woman, I loved so dearly, had
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100189:45"/>
given me, did not a little contribute to raise my Name; by occasioning me to seek for an Opportunity of dying with Honour, since I could no longer live with Pleasure. I fought in the Battle at <hi>Northingues,</hi> and thence went into the Mareschal <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Army, where I was at the taking of <hi>Dunkespink</hi>; I may without Vanity say, That none was more bold than my self in either of these Occasions. Let men be naturally never so brave, they must be carried on by some external Motives, to attain a certain Pitch of Valour; and that which provoked me to act as I did, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Despair than Ambition.</p>
            <p>I returned not to <hi>Paris</hi> till <hi>Landaw</hi> had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to Monsieur <hi>de Turenne</hi>; and there I found that my Nun's Neighbourhood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased my Melancholy Humour, for I could not forbear going to Prayers at the <hi>Carmelites.</hi> This Weakness of mine I disclosed to my Brother; who being persuaded that nothing but a long absence could perfectly cure me, proposed to me a Voyage, which I had an Opportunity to make, into <hi>Poland.</hi> The Princess <hi>Mary</hi> was to go thither about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> and the Relation she knew we had to a Prince, whom she had loved till Death, made her desire that I would accompany her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:100189:45"/>I accepted of this Offer, and (to my Shame be it spoken) found in me a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret desire of pleasing the Princess, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to gain her Affection. I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on what I was going to undertake; but as soon as I found I was to make that Journey, and that I should have an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of freely Conversing with her, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to forget my Nun, and was obliged to acknowledge, That a new Mistress is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Consolation for the Loss of an old one than either Ambition or War.</p>
            <p>The Princess was, on the account of her Love to the deceased Prince, much in the same Condition as I had been on that of my <hi>Carmelite.</hi> His Death was an eternal Grief to her, and she made him the Subject of our daily Discourse. I, on the other hand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to her what had happen'd to me at <hi>Charleville</hi>; and she was glad to hear I was capable of as tender and constant an Affection as her self, and we would often dispute which of us was the most unhappy, she in her Lover's Death or I in my Mistress's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>
            <p>If this was a Romance, I might here bring in the Conversations we had on that Theme, which, I dare say would equal those in <hi>Clelia</hi> or the <hi>Grand Cyrus.</hi> But, I omit all such Digressions, to stick only
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100189:46"/>
to my Purpose; which is, To expose, as much as I can, in these MEMOIRS, the Characters of some Women, and the dismal Consequences of engaging with them.</p>

            <p>THE Princess, at length, seemed to be resolved to find an Antidote against the Grief she conceived at the Loss of her dear Lover, in the Honours which waited for her in <hi>Poland,</hi> and it was in vain that I would persuade her to drive out that Passion by another, her
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100189:47"/>
Mind being wholly taken up with her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and the Grandeur she expected; she perceived, however, that I spoke through Self-Interest, and would often tell me, That had she had an Inclination for me, she would not have encouraged my Falshood to so lovely a Person as to my Nun; but I was grown weary of that nice Fidelity, and the Princess's Discourse on that Subject was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie to me. At last, I told her plainly, That I loved her, which she seemed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe; but seeing I was in earnest, she grew serious upon the Matter, and said, If I talked any more so presumptuously she would send me back to <hi>France:</hi> Which Words were uttered with so scornful an Accent, that I highly resented it, and resolved not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forbear speaking for the future, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any Thoughts of Passion for her; so I continued silent the greatest part of the Voyage. This displeased her, and she advised me, That, since I could not be in a good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor without an Amour, I should make my Addresses to one of her Maids, which was not unhandsom; adding, That she would take care the Jest should not be carry'd on too far, only to make the Journey more diverting. I was not well pleased at this raillery, and resolv'd to court, not the young Woman she men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, but the first <hi>Polander</hi> I should like. This Intention, which I did not inform her
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100189:47"/>
with, made me as gay as ever, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, who had been dissatisfied at my being chagrine, seemed not over-well contented with my Mirth. I took all possible Care not to speak the least Word she might interpret as an Expression of my Love to her, which I the more easily effected, because I really had none. How great soever she might be, her Pride and disobliging Reflexions still stuck in my Mind, and I had Sense enough to consider, That it was impossible for me to prevail with a Princess, who besides much Ambition and Haughtiness, had also a great Stock of Vertue.</p>
            <p>Our Journey at last grew towards an end, and we arrived in <hi>Poland.</hi> King <hi>Ladislaus</hi> came to receive his new espoused Queen, who presented me to him in a very obliging manner: Among the Retinue his Majesty gave the Queen, there was a Lady who pleased me well enough, to make me think she was the Person whose Chains I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to wear. She was about Eighteen or nineteen, and Daughter to one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Lords of that Kingdom: I happened to be near her when she was presented to the Queen, who, whether she took notice of it or not, smiled, as I thought, to see me view her with great Attention, and I perceived since, that of all those which had been placed about her, she had the first share of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100189:48"/>
Favour. The Queen's Kindness for her gave me frequent Opportunities of seeing her, and I grew very passionate, which I soon informed her of; that Lady understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>French</hi> well enough to converse in that Tongue. I was something surpriz'd that she should be equally fond of me, but more to hear her express it in so frank a manner; but she carry'd her Ingenuity something too far, for the Queen having ask'd her, What Discourse we had together? she not only told her what I had said, but also what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer she had returned; confessing freely, That she was very much inclin'd to love me The Queen made her sensible of the Inconveniencies such a Passion might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with, and order'd her never to speak to me in private. Her Majesty laid the same Commands also upon me, threatning to send me back into <hi>France</hi> if I disobeyed her. It was by no means my Interest to disoblige the Queen, and leave her on such an account, but I also loved that Maid, and the free and natural manner wherein she had expressed her Thoughts to me, made me dote the more on her. I found my self then in a great Dilemma, from which I was shortly after delivered, but it was to fall into a worse. I had for Eight or ten Days carefully avoided my Mistress's Company, according to the Queen's Order; when her Majesty took an
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100189:48"/>
Opportunity to tell me, I was easily discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; but, however, since I had been so obedient, she would have some Regard to my Passion, and that she gave me free Leave to visit the young Lady when I would.</p>
            <p>I could not imagine whence proceeded this sudden Change; the Reason of which was, That her Majesty had perceived the King had a Kindness for her, and whether through Policy or Jealousie, she intended to put him out of Conceit with her, by letting him see she admitted my Courtship. I was not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lose any time in making Reflexions, but my chief Care was to seek for an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of speaking to my Mistress. Now she (which I thought stranger) avoided me, as I had before done her; and having asked her the Reason, she owned to me, with her usual Openness of Heart, That the King courted her, and that it was so great an Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, she durst not receive any other Addresses; but when she was marry'd she would return my Love. I understood then that the first thing the Grandees of <hi>Poland</hi> do, when they have a mind to debauch a Woman, is to get her a Husband; and, accordingly, there was much talk at Court, a few days after, of a Match between her and a great Lord in <hi>Lithuania.</hi> The Queen was not at all satisfied with it, since she knew that the King's Design in Marrying of her, was to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100189:49"/>
make her his Mistress, and see her with more Liberty. So she would still be persuading me to marry her, not doubting but if that were done, I would certainly carry her away into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I apprehended that a great many Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences might accrue to me from this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: For since (as her Majesty had told me) she was to be marry'd but to facilitate the King's Amours, I thought it impossible for me to carry her away without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; which, had he granted, I knew I had not wherewithal to maintain a Lady there, whose whole Estate remained in <hi>Poland.</hi> I represented to her Majesty, why I could not obey her Commands, and she seemed satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Arguments I gave her; and made me an open Confession, That being desirous to have the absolute Management of her Husband, it was her Interest to get her match'd to one who would give her Majesty a good account of her; and she agreed with me, That I was very unfit for such an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. So we parted, without taking any other Measures.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Lord dyed in the mean while, and the King being obstinately bent to give her a Husband, desired her to name whom she would; who, swayed by her Love, she pitch'd upon me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100189:49"/>The King readily yielded to it, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for me, made me that Proposal. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly told him, That I had no Estate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a younger Brother, expected but little, so that I was in very ill Circumstances to maintain a Wife. His Majesty answered, That she whom he designed me, was rich enough for us both; and that, besides, he would make me so considerable in <hi>Poland,</hi> that I should not miss the Little I had left in <hi>France.</hi> I would have accepted this Offer with no little Joy, had it been made on any other account; for I had an Opportunity of raising my self, by marrying a Woman whom I had a great Kindness for; but all my Philosophy would not persuade me to take her on such reproachful Terms. Not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what other Reasons to give, I told the King that his Majesty's Favour loaded me with Honour, but I was naturally very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and should make a very severe Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. The King smiled at this Excuse, and told me, If that was all, He would take care to prevent it, and would give me such Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments as would not permit me often to be with my Wife, and too narrowly to pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Behaviour.</p>
            <p>This I took as a great Affront, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing my Thoughts, I told his Majesty, That I could not renounce my Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that I would never consent to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100189:50"/>
but on Condition I might go thither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after. <hi>No,</hi> said the King, <hi>I will not yield to you in that Point, for your Spouse shall never leave</hi> Poland <hi>while I live. If it be so, Sir,</hi> I reply'd, <hi>I humbly thank your Majesty, and beg, as a farther Favour, That instead of marrying me you would be pleased to grant me Leave to return home.</hi> Upon this the King left me, telling me; I might be gone, and that I was a Madman.</p>
            <p>Then I presently waited on the Queen, to give her an Account of what had passed; who begged, with Tears in her Eyes, That I would comply with the King's Desires: And that, to satisfie my nice Jealousie, she would keep her so much in her presence, that the King should never find an Opportunity of being private with her; that she should be responsible to me for her Conduct, and that I might rest my self satisfied as to that.</p>
            <p>Her Majesty used so many convincing Arguments, that at last I desired her to tell the King, I was ready to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. He was glad to hear it, but my Mistress transported at the Thoughts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming my Wife, and that in so violent a manner, as persuaded me she never had loved the King; which gave me Hopes, that being the only Possessor of her Heart, and seconded by the Queen's Vigilancy, I might easily
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100189:50"/>
avoid the Shame I dreaded. In a Word, I was so taken up with the Prospect of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing my Fortune, and satisfying my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, that I was deaf to all other Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, insomuch that I wondered how I had ever scrupled the Matter. So irresolute are our Minds, and so easily do we prefer what may promote our Interest and Pleasure, to what secures our Honour.</p>
            <p>I marry'd that Lady, and therefore chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Name, for being thereby grown the owner of a Considerable County, I was for ever after called by that Title.</p>
            <p>The Queen was as good as her Word, and her Jealousie and Vertue, with the Care I took, kept my Wife under such a Constraint, that it was impossible for the King to be alone with her. He was at last tired with Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Endeavours, and began to Court a Lady who was more her own Mistress. I was overjoy'd at his Change, hoping I might now, without Disturbance, possess my own Right; but that, alas! was prevented by a Hand I least expected it from. My Wife was inrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the King should quit her for another, and the great Affection she had expressed for me, turned to an implacable Hatred. Being averse to all Dissimulation, she openly told me, I was the occasion that she had lost her Lover. It was to no purpose that I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to make her sensible of her Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100189:51"/>
all the Arguments I brought prov'd but greater Provocations; and whether she had a Mind to be rid of me, or that she tho' moving the King's Compassion was the best way to regain him, she complained to his Majesty that I treated her very ill. This false Accusation the King the sooner believed, because he remembred I told him, That I was inclined to be extream Jealous. My good natur'd Spouse's Malice went farther, for she gave the King to understand that I was in Love with the Queen; and he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sceptible of both these Impressions, did, without farther Examination, resolve I should be murther'd, which he saw might be the easier effected, because my Preferment had excited the Envy of most of the <hi>Polish</hi> Nobility. The King wanted not Persons who would readily have taken that Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to express their Zeal to him and their Malice to me.</p>
            <p>The Queen's Intelligence was quicker than mine, and seeing her Honour was concern'd, she did not think fit to acquaint me with it, concluding I would have absconded my self, which might confirm the King in his Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Her first Care was to undeceive the King, to which end she took no notice of the Advice she had received, but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting some Letters from <hi>France,</hi> wherein she was acquainted, That my Brother was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100189:51"/>
dead; she shewed them to his Majesty, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that it would much prejudice me to be kept in <hi>Poland.</hi> The Unconcernedness she spoke with on my account, and her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, to have me sent back, made him think her falsly accused. He own'd to her the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicions he had had of an Intreague between us, and begging her Pardon a thousand times for entertaining an Opinion so injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to her Vertue, he confess'd, Those Thoughts, joyn'd with my Wife's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, made him resolve I should dye; and that he knew not whether I was then alive, some Persons being appointed to assassinate me that Day. Her Majesty having blamed his Rashness, intreated him, without Delay, to recal his Orders, lest his Mercy came too late.</p>
            <p>A Fruitless Enquiry was made after me, for I had Notice of my Danger; and the Person who had done me that Courtesie had also found me a Place of Refuge. She was one of the best reputed Ladies at Court, who had often professed herself my Friend, but I did not imagine her Kindness extended so far. She made use of that Opportunity to give me at once a Declaration and convincing Proof of her Love; being a Widow, and consequently Mistress of her own Actions: She did not stick to conceal me in her own
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100189:52"/>
House, which I thought was an Obligation highly to be valued, since I saw my Ruin was unavoidable if I appeared abroad. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Week, that I lay hid, she proposed to me the several Means which her Passion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired her with, to provide for my Safety. That which she insisted on, as the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, was, to poyson my Wife, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which she offered to take upon her self. I entertain'd not her Proposal with that Horrour which I should have done at another Time, believing her to love me, had drowned both Religion and Reason; only representing to her the ill Consequences it might produce. She would never let me write to the Queen, to inform her where I was; and that Princess conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was either fled or murthered, it made her very uneasie: But, to prevent the ill Constructions People might frame of my Absence, she caused it to be reported, That, upon the News of my Brother's Death, I was returned into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last I heard of it, and believing that my Brother was really dead, I grew impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to know the Truth of it, and positively told the Lady, That I would attend the Queen, to be better informed. She upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with allowing my Brother a Share in that Affection which she would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100189:52"/>
wholly to her self. From these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches she came to Affronts, and those led her to Indifferency. She threat'ned to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me to my Murtherers; nay, and could not forbear telling me, that since I was so firmly resolv'd to leave her, she would take Care to prevent it, and would poyson me first. What she had propos'd to me on my Wife's account, made me the more fearful as to my self, and this Apprehension kept me from eating. Never did any Couple pass so suddenly from the warmest Love to the most inveterate Hatred as we did, for we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready grown intolerable to each other; wherefore I plainly told her, She was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my Adversary, and intreated her to let me retire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes, you shall go,</hi> said she, <hi>but it shall be out of this World:</hi> On saying which, she flew at me with a Dagger. I strove to wrest it from her, but (by I know not what Accident) she receiv'd a Wound in her Breast. I well foresaw my Danger, and that I could not escape should any of her Servants know what had happen'd; which made me leave her with the Dagger by her. By good Fortune I found all the Doors open, and went out unseen by any. Having gone through a Street or two, I came to the House of a <hi>Polander</hi> of my Acquaintance, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Assistance, telling him some earnest
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100189:53"/>
Business, occasion'd by my Brother's Death, obliged me to go to <hi>France,</hi> which I must do <hi>incognito,</hi> because my Wife was averse to my Journey. This Man Offer'd to serve me to the utmost of his Power, and the very next Night procur'd me some Horses, which carried me to <hi>Dantzick</hi>; where I was no sooner arrived, but I wrote to the Queen a Relation of my Adventure.</p>
            <p>She receiv'd my Letter, in a Time when every one was crying out against me, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so base as to murder a Lady who had been so obliging to me. She had indeed been found all Bloody by her Servants, and taxed me with the Villany: And tho her Wound proved but very slight, she still persisted to say, I had a Design to have killed her. No Body question'd the Truth of what she spoke, and great Search was making for me, when the Queen received my Letter. She present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry'd it to the King; who pray'd her to command me, That if I were Innocent, I should not delay coming to confront my Accusers.</p>
            <p>It was not so much a Principle of doing Justice moved this Prince to have me recall'd, as the Trouble which my Wife created him, who was become a continual Plague to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he wished for my Return, to rid him of so violent a Woman. The Queen wrote to me, That my Brother's Death was a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100189:53"/>
and that I must return to <hi>Warsaw,</hi> to clear my self from the Assassination which was laid to my Charge. Her Letter came safe to my Hands, and the Joy I conceiv'd at the News of my Brother's being alive so transported me, that I willingly obey'd her Commands, tho' I was not unsensible of the Hazard I expos'd my self to.</p>
            <p>As soon as I was arrived, I did, through the Queen's Advice, surrender my self, and was carry'd to Prison. The Lady that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd me was in a great Surprize at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but affecting a Generosity which she was wholly a Stranger to, she was the most earnest in suing for my Pardon. For my part, I had rather she would have let her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession alone, that the Truth might have appear'd, upon a fair Tryal: But seeing this was generally look'd upon but as a Quarrel between two Lovers, I did not insist on a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Enquiry into the Matter, but accepted of my Grace, and was set at Liberty. The King also obliged me to return Thanks to the Lady, my Adversary; which I did, tho' much against my Will.</p>
            <p>The Business wholly ruin'd her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for in <hi>Poland</hi> they do not easily relish Gallantry of so deep a dye as that seemed to be. There was no other way for her to clear her Honour than Marrying me, and that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100189:54"/>
has fully persuaded me, that she poyson'd my Wife, who dy'd suddenly some time after.</p>
            <p>My Spouse was a little before delivered of Two Children, a Boy and a Girl, and I heard at once of her Sickness and Death; for her Conduct had so highly disobliged me, that we seldom saw each other. However, I was sorry for her, not so much remembring the Reasons I had to hate her, as those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by she once had gain'd my Love.</p>
            <p>She was no sooner dead, but the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self told me, That I was under an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Obligation to marry the Lady, who had preserv'd my Life, at the Loss of her own Honour. I begg'd of his Majesty not to precipitate this Marriage, but to allow me a little Time to mourn for the Loss of my late Wife, which deeply afflicted me, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this Delay to find some means of breaking the intended Match, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging the King, tho' I was resolv'd to hazard all rather than comply.</p>
            <p>The Lady was neither Handsom nor Young; and, on the other Hand, her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Acquaintance with Daggers and Poysons made me look upon her with great Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station: But I dissembled my Thoughts, and carry'd my self to her as a Woman I was shortly to espouse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100189:54"/>Imagining she had made sure of me, she took no Care to pleasure me, treating me ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an affected Scorn, and openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing a Kindness for others. I, who desir'd nothing more than to break with her, tax'd her with Coquetry; she laugh'd at me, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, she would not constrain her self for my Humour, since I must marry her whether I would or no. I thought, if I could surprize her in some Gallantry, it would free me from this pretended Obligation; which I easily did, for she carry'd on her Intrigues so openly that none need be ignorant of them; and one Day I was inform'd she was in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate with a <hi>Palatine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon I made my Complaint to the King, saying withal, That I now thought my self fairly discharg'd. His Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, It must first be known whether or no that Lord would marry her, because if he refus'd it she still fell to my Lot, as having the first Claim to her. This Answer I took for a Jest, and could not forbear smiling, till the King very seriously told me, it was the Custom of the Land.</p>
            <p>I did not much trouble my self with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting the <hi>Polish</hi> Lawyers about it, for from that very Minute I resolv'd for <hi>France,</hi> and took all the necessary Measures for a speedy Departure; being weary of living in a strange Country, wherein I had met with a Chain
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100189:55"/>
of Misfortunes, and stood in daily Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of worse.</p>
            <p>I acquainted the Queen with my Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, beseeching her to take my Children under her Care and Protection; and having privately sold all the Estate I had there which I might dispose of, I stole away with one only Servant. The great Fortune I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make by my Journey, was reduced to poor Twenty thousand Crowns, for which I took some Bills of Exchange, and went, leaving my Children rich enough with their Mother's Estate. Then was the latter End of the Year 1647. I had lived Two Years in <hi>Poland,</hi> and was about Twenty Three Years of Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but appear'd as Thirty, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tall and grown something corpulent, which made me seem older than I really was.</p>
            <p>Once more I thought it impossible for any Woman to deceive me. My Journey afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me Leisure enough to reflect on the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters they had procur'd me, I consider'd it was on their Account that I had left <hi>Franee,</hi> in a Season when I might have made my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune there, and that they also had occasion'd my coming from <hi>Poland,</hi> when I seem'd to be well settled in that Country. On these Reflections I resolv'd to make the best Use of my Experience, and to court <hi>Mars</hi> instead of <hi>Venus.</hi> I had wrote to my Brother, to let
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100189:55"/>
him know of my Return from <hi>Poland,</hi> who was not well satisfied with my having Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in that Kingdom, and was glad I had a Pretence to forsake it. The Letters I receiv'd from him, obliged me to take <hi>Venice</hi> in my Way, where he wrote I should find a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Friend of his, who, having fought a Duel, had been forced to fly for it, and was then in that City.</p>
            <p>I arriv'd at <hi>Venice</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> and they were then preparing for the ensuing Carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. I met with my Brother's Friend, who prevail'd with me to tarry there for a Time; during which, I forgot all my fine Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the Female Sex, notwithstanding the fresh Items I had to remember them; for I was no sooner at <hi>Venice</hi> but the first News I heard was, that I had been oblig'd to fly out of <hi>Poland,</hi> for having poyson'd my Wife and stabb'd my Mistress. I too well knew the occasion of that Report, and took no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pains to undeceive those who seem'd to credit it, but I found it difficult, and have several Years since met with some Persons, who were prepossessed with this Opinion, which has done me no small Injury.</p>
            <p>How earnest soever my Friends Instances might be, to persuade my tasting the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Carnaval, I should scarce have comply'd with them, had it not been my
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100189:56"/>
Misfortune again to fall up to the Ears in Love. 'Tis true, I had felt but weak im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of that Passion while in <hi>Poland</hi>; which made me the easier engage in a new Amour with a Person, who, I thought, would not be over cruel.</p>
            <p>She was Daughter to a <hi>Venetian</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, at whose House, I, on my first arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, grew very well acquainted, through the means of my Brother's Friend, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known this Nobleman's Son at <hi>Paris,</hi> had there renew'd his Acquaintance, and encreas'd it to a great Intimacy. I often saw the Father and Son, but it was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had a view of the Daughter, only in a Picture. This Piece seem'd to me so charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I could not forbear crying out in an Extasie, I never had seen such Beauty before. The Lady was then in an adjoyning Room, where, unknown to me, she saw and heard me. I was no sooner in the Street but a Man follow'd me, who, without saying one Word, put an unseal'd Note in my Hand, which was wrote in <hi>Italian</hi> to this purpose.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>THE Person whose Picture you so much Admir'd, has as high an Esteem for you. If it be true that the Sight of Painting has afforded you some Pleasure, you shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that of the Original. Be discreet and leave the rest to me.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:100189:56"/>I read the Note above twenty times over; and tho' I could scarce imagin that it really came from the Person whose Picture I had seen; yet I thought my safest Way was to use the Discretion which was enjoyn'd me.</p>
            <p>It may easily be guess'd how impatient I was to return to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobleman's Palace: The very next Day I made him a Visit, and took my Opportunity, by way of Discourse, to express the great Desire I had to see the Person whom that Picture represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but no Body offer'd to give me that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; only a Mask was propos'd and the Habits agreed on.</p>
            <p>I was scarce got home, but the same Man came into my Chamber, who had given me the Note I just mention'd, and observing a deep Silence, presented me with a Box, and immediately withdrew. I pressed him to stay, and he answer'd me but in dumb Shew, and went off. Then, opening the Box, I found it full of rich Jewels, and, under them, this Note, which was written in the same Hand as the former.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>YOur Reputation being of a near concern to me, I was willing to contribute to your Magnificence. Make use of these Iewels to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like your self in the intended Mask,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100189:57"/>
and when you have done with them, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them to the Bearer, whom I shall send for them.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Then, I thought I had no reason to doubt of the Reality of this Adventure, which gave me at once a great Pleasure and no little Disquiet.</p>
            <p>I put on the Jewels she sent me, which were so rich and fair none made a better Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure than my self.</p>
            <p>Several ask'd me, Where I had got them? And having answered, That I hir'd them; the Lady's Brother whisper'd in my Ear, He knew the Person had lent them, and what the Hire of them came to. This made me think he was his Sister's Confident; at which I blushed, and made no Reply.</p>
            <p>As I was returning home from the Mask, I was attack'd by Six armed Men, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven off my Companions, in spight of all the Resistance I could make, disarm'd and robb'd me.</p>
            <p>This Accident gave me no little Trouble; but my Comfort was, that I had yet a Bill of Exchange for Twelve thousand Crowns, which I thought would procure the same number of fine Jewels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:100189:57"/>When the Man, who had brought them me, came for them again, I inform'd him of my Misfortune, and offer'd the Bill of Exchange in lieu thereof; but he refus'd it by Signs (which made me believe he was dumb) and the next Day came to me very early, with this following Note.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>BE not concern'd at the Loss of the Iewels. When I lent them, I willingly expos'd my self to all the Inconveniences that might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; the Blame lies wholly on me, therefore it is my part to pay for them. I wish I might, by more considerable Losses convince you your Heart is the only Riches I covet. Do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of it, till you may judge whether I deserve it or no.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether she deserves it!</hi> cry'd I, <hi>Can there be a Woman more deserving?</hi> Thus charm'd, with her Generosity, I abandon'd my self to the Transports I was in, at my seeming good Fortune. I earnestly intreated the Dumb Messenger to carry her the Bill of Exchange, or at least an Answer to her obliging Billet; but he would do neither, and so left me.</p>
            <p>The next Day her Brother told me, She had hir'd them of a Jeweller, whom he dealt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100189:58"/>
with; informing me withal, That his Sister had reveal'd to him the great Passion she had for me, wherein he serv'd her willingly, because she had laid the like Obligation upon him, in an Amour he had with a young Lady of her Acquaintance; and he also assur'd me, That it should be my Fault, if I was not as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his Sister as he in his Mistress.</p>
            <p>The Reader will, no doubt, be astonish'd to understand, That all this was only an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice to chouse me of my Mony; yet so it was, for this Brother of hers had caused me to be robb'd, and had the Jewels in his Possession. The Rascal made me believe, That his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's Generosity had brought her into a great Trouble, for she knew not how to pay for them; and that if she still refused to accept my Bill of Exchange, the whole business might break out, and come to her Father's Knowledge; to prevent which, he offer'd to carry me to the Merchants who had lent them. I was overjoy'd at this Opportunity, of shewing my Gratitude, in saving her Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and paid the Jeweller Eight thousand Crowns, with more pleasure than I ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd any other Debt. This Man, who was Confederate with my pretended Friend, receiv'd some small part of the Purchase, and the Brother and Sister shar'd the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:100189:58"/>I suspected not the Cheat, but still flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with the vain Thought of being belov'd by a Person whom I was so charm'd with, I consider'd not the Loss of my Money, which was at it's last ebb; and my only Desire was that of seeing the beautiful Unknown.</p>
            <p>I often sollicited the Brother, That he would procure me the so much long'd for Interview, which he as often promised me, but still found an Excuse for his Delay. I only sometimes receiv'd a Letter from the fair Deceiver, which was no more deliver'd by the dumb Man, but by himself, and he also undertook to be the Bearer of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers. Our Billets were all very passionate, and the continual Theme was, deploring our hard Fate, which kept us thus asunder.</p>
            <p>This continu'd till about the middle of <hi>February,</hi> when I receiv'd Letters from my Brother, who much blam'd me for staying so long at <hi>Venice,</hi> saying, I endanger'd my losing the Employment he had procur'd me in the Prince's Army, which was to take the Field and besiege <hi>Ypres</hi> in <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I little regarded my Brother's kind Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, nor the Injury I did my self in tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying there any longer; but full of Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to see my Mistress, I sent him Word I was Sick, and that as soon as my Health should permit, I would ride Post for <hi>France.</hi> But he, being better inform'd of my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100189:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than I imagin'd, renewed his Instances for my return, which I was so mad as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, for I would sooner have parted with my Life than left <hi>Venice,</hi> till I had at least seen the Lady.</p>
            <p>His Letters had this only effect, That I was more urgent with her Brother, not to keep me in Pain any longer; and at last, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I threat'ned to be gone, if he did not give me that Satisfaction, he promised to comply with my Request. I was order'd to put on a <hi>Spanish</hi> Habit, and to take with me as many Jewels, and as much Mony as I could, his Sister having pretended to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, at whose House we were to meet, that her Lover was a rich <hi>Spanish</hi> Lord. I made no Reflexions upon the Matter, but yielded a blind Obedience to his Directions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accoutred as a <hi>Castillan</hi> (not forgetting the Mony and Jewels,) I was introduced into the Lo<gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dgings of a most notorious Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan. Indeed I was somewhat scandaliz'd at my being carry'd to such a Place (for I both knew the House and her who kept it) yet my Impatience to see my Mistress soon stifled that Scruple.</p>
            <p>At my first Entrance I was lock'd up in a Room, into which, after some Minutes waiting, the Object of my Wishes was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. She did not seem to me so handsom as her flattering Picture represented her, tho'
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100189:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was so like, that I had not the least reason to think my self imposed on. This Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment something cool'd my Passion, when the Lady, who observ'd it, used such Means to reflame me, as made me imagine this was not the first Rendezvous she had had. This gave me a Disturbance which I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, and being unwilling to discover the true Occasion, I pretended it was at her coming into such a House. She told me, She should not have expected such a Reprimand from me; however, she seem'd not to take it ill at first; but seeing I continued preaching to her, she left me, saying, The next Time I met her I might make an end of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>Then I fully experienced the Weakness of my Heart: For tho' I had all the Reason in the World to be convinc'd of her Dishonesty, yet she was no sooner retir'd but I longed more than ever to see her again. All my Scruples vanish'd, and I heartily repented the ill use I had made of that Opportunity. Her Brother, thereupon, coming in with an Angry Look, drew his Sword, telling me, I was a Base Man; that my Sister had complained to him of my rude Treatment, and that he would have Satisfaction. Said I, <hi>Can I affront your Sister! For Heaven's sake, dear Friend, procure me one Meeting more, and you shall see what Esteem I have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100189:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for her.</hi> He seem'd more calm at these Words; and withdrew, promising he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to persuade her to return; I waited Two Hours, but instead of either, in came the <hi>Curtezan</hi>; who ask'd me in <hi>Italian, How now, Signior</hi> Don John, <hi>what ails you to Day, that your Mistress is not so well satisfied with you as she uses to be?</hi> With this she look'd earnestly at me, and seem'd very much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd. I inquir'd into the Reason of it, and why she call'd me <hi>Don Iohn?</hi> She would not satisfie me then, but told me, The next Time I came thither I should know farther. This was all I could get from her, so I left her.</p>
            <p>My first Care, when I came home, was, to lay up my Mony and Jewels, but I found neither. The only Person I could tax with stealing them, was the Lady I had been with, for no Body else had come near enough to me, to pick my Pocket; and this gave me very ill Thoughts of her. I remembred there was one <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who liv'd then in <hi>Venice,</hi> and I concluded the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan had mistaken me for him, and that my Mistress us'd to entertain him in that Place. The very next Morning I went to the Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan's to be resolv'd; who told me more than I was willing to hear: For, I understood, this Lady, for whose sake I had so highly disoblig'd my Brother and my self, was us'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100189:60"/>
to this pretty Trade, and had for Six Months Time kept a Correspondence with this young <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While I was meditating on my Revenge, I received a Letter from my Brother, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he acquainted me, That he had notice what Life I led at <hi>Venice,</hi> and how I had been made a Cully both by the Brother and Sister; but he advised me to pass it over, and leave that City as speedily as possible.</p>
            <p>Imagining his Friend was the only Person that could have sent this Intelligence, I went to him, telling him, It had been much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to have given me Warning of my dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Acquaintance than to have informed my Brother. He was loath to own it, but, at last, imbracing me, <hi>What could I have done, dear Friend?</hi> said he, <hi>You was so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd, that if I had attempted to undeceive you, I should not have been credited.</hi> It was with much difficulty that I forgave him, but, seeing there was no Remedy, I told him, That I was resolv'd to have my Mony again, or to cut the Villain's Throat who had thus bubbled me.</p>
            <p>Tho' this Gentleman was exiled from his Native Country for a Duel, yet that Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did not deter him from venturing on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but he freely offer'd me his Service; So I sent the Rogue a Challenge, which he slighted. Mad at such Cowardice, I resolv'd
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100189:61"/>
to provoke him to Fight whether he would or no; and having pitch'd on a Day to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him, I put on my former <hi>Spanish</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, and caused my Second and all our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to be equipp'd in the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.</p>
            <p>Thus we waited for him, in a certain Street through which he was to pass: When he came I bid him Draw, but he refusing it, I gave him Two or Three Blows over the Face with the flat side of my Sword, by which, being oblig'd to defend himself, he did it, but so faintly, that he received a home Thrust, and dropp'd down. We had the good luck, tho' this was done in the open Street, to escape to a <hi>Gondalo,</hi> which lay ready for us, and carry'd us to a Vessel we had prepar'd.</p>
            <p>To compleat my Revenge, I left a Letter for the Lady's Father, pretending my self a Friend of <hi>Don Iohn</hi>'s, and that, on my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at <hi>Venice</hi> I had discover'd an Intriegue between that young Lord and his Daughter, which was chiefly promoted by her Brother, and gave him a full Narrative of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; concluding, that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> having been affronted by his Son, I was resolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my Friend's Quarrel, so that if any thing happen'd amiss in his Family, he need look no farther for the procurer of his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:100189:61"/>The Nobleman having received this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Informations were prefer'd against <hi>Don Iohn</hi>; for all those who had been Witnesses of the Rencounter, agreed the Assaulter was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had immediately made his Escape, with several Persons of the same Nation; which confirmed the Contents of my Letter.</p>
            <p>We heard at <hi>Padua</hi> the good Success of our Enterprize; for the Lady's Brother dyed without being able to speak; <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> affraid of the Informations exhibited against him, was fled for it, and every one was fully persuaded that he had killed him.</p>
            <p>The Pleasure this News afforded me, was some Consolation for the Loss of my Mony, and the Tricks which they had put upon me, but I now resolved more firmly than ever, to avoid Womankind.</p>
            <p>My Brother's Friend, who had accompany'd me to <hi>Padua,</hi> not daring to return into <hi>France,</hi> nor thinking it safe for him to go back to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> ask'd my Advice about a Journey, he designed for <hi>Poland</hi>; which I encouraged, for my own Advantage, in having a Friend there, who might inform me of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Condition, and the Posture of Affairs in that Kingdom. I knew that King <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dislaus</hi> was desperately ill. It was the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Report, That he was dead, and that the Queen would espouse Prince <hi>Casimir,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100189:62"/>
to the deceased King, and I doubted not but her Majesty would shew my Friend all possible Favour.</p>
            <p>It being then the latter End of <hi>May,</hi> and the Campaign something advanc'd in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> I thought I should get no credit by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there so late, and therefore resolv'd to get into <hi>Naples,</hi> in hopes to find Opportunities of signalizing my self, under the Command of the Duke <hi>de Guise,</hi> who had render'd himself Master of that City, which made no little Noise in <hi>Italy.</hi> I wrote to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to acquaint him with my Intentions, and keeping my <hi>Spanish</hi> Habit, I set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for <hi>Naples,</hi> thinking that Disguise might facilitate my Entrance; but I arrived there a Month after the Duke's Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so ill had I been informed of those Transactions.</p>
            <p>I heard he was confin'd at <hi>Gayetta,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be transported to <hi>Spain</hi>; and thought it my Duty to offer him my Service, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Interest all our Family had with him, especially my Brother.</p>
            <p>It was certainly my ill Genius led me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for this occasion'd my engaging into a fresh Amour, which prov'd as Troublesome and vexatious to me as my last at <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke took my Visit very kindly, and when I told him the occasion of my Journey
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100189:62"/>
to <hi>Naples,</hi> he said, I might do him a more signal Service there, and with less Danger to my self; whereupon he shew'd me a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lady, who had been his Mistress while he remain'd in the City: She expressed a great Despair for the Duke's Imprisonment, and threat'ned to stab her her self, if he would not yield to her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to <hi>Spain. She is stark mad,</hi> said he, <hi>and will do some extravagant Action or other, if not prevented. Oblige me so far, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to</hi> Naples, <hi>and carry a Letter from me, which cannot be sent by a better Hand.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd an exact Performance of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and having attended him till his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval thence, I immediately set forward to execute his Orders.</p>
            <p>I could not, during the Journey, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on my fantastical Destiny, for while I endeavoured to forget the Female Sex, and think of nothing but War, it engag'd me into a necessary Occasion of Conversing with them, and made me the Confident of an Amour. However, I very willingly obey'd the Duke, mov'd by a secret Inclination for a Woman, who was capable of so much Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Wit as her Letters express'd. Here my curs'd Propensity to Love again confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Reason, which would have led me to <hi>France</hi> much rather than <hi>Naples</hi>; whereby I was convinc'd, that let a Heart be never so
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100189:63"/>
covetous of Glory, it soon degenerates from that Heroick Temper, when once it yields it self up to Effeminacy.</p>
            <p>I still wore my Spanish Habit, that I might the better conceal my Country; and being arriv'd at <hi>Pozzolo Castello,</hi> while it was Day, I staid there a little, not designing to enter <hi>Naples</hi> till Night. To divert my self in the mean while, I walk'd abroad in a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and solitary Place, where I thought I should not be observ'd: But I had not gone far e're I spy'd a Gentleman with a Lady, and another at a little distance from them, which seem'd to have withdrawn only to leave them more at Liberty.</p>
            <p>This looking like an Assignation, I crept as near as I could, and having hid my self behind some Trees, over-heard part of their Conversation. All I could make of it was, That the Cavalier complain'd of her former Affection to another; and that she assur'd him, he was the only Man she had ever lov'd. Having remain'd there about half an Hour, I thought of retiring; which I maliciously did, with Noise enough to make them take notice of me. The Lady, who was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Gallant, no sooner perceived me, but she chang'd Colour, crying out, <hi>Ah! what do I see? 'Tis himself.</hi> She seem'd to me very handsome, and imagining she might take me for her Husband, or some other
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100189:63"/>
Troublesome Person, whom she had no mind to entrust with her Amour; I made her a very low Bow, and walked slowly off. Looking back sometimes, I saw the other Lady follow'd me, upon which I stopp'd, that she might overtake me. She did, and having view'd me attentively, told me in <hi>Spanish,</hi> I look'd so like the Duke <hi>de Guise,</hi> that I had been taken for him. I smiling at the Fancy (for besides the Shape, Colour of Hair and Skin, I had not one Feature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling his) reply'd, they were mistaken, and ask'd, What Relation the Duke had to them. She said, That each true <hi>Neapolitan</hi> ought to fear, lest the Duke should still be plotting to render himself Master of that City, which was happily reduc'd under the Obedience of her lawful Sovereign. I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily guess'd she spoke after that manner, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me for a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> for I knew the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> was very well belov'd in <hi>Naples.</hi> However, I did not discover my self, tho' I had an itching Desire to know the Company, being already charm'd with the other Lady: But not thinking it proper to ask any more Questions, I came back to <hi>Pozzolo Castello,</hi> and went to <hi>Naples,</hi> the Sky being already darken'd.</p>
            <p>I apply'd my self, next Morning, to a Person the Duke had directed me to, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to my waiting on the Lady, for whom
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100189:64"/>
I had his Letter; but I was inform'd she was in the Country: And having ask'd whether that Country was so far off that I could not go to see her? It was answer'd me, That I had best be cautious, since her Intimacy with the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> had rendred her suspicious, especially to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who mistrusted the Correspondency they held together was more for Affairs of State than Gallantry.</p>
            <p>I remain'd then a whole Week at <hi>Naples,</hi> which grew very Tiresome to me, for I scarce durst appear, because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were very strict in seizing any of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, whose Misfortune it was to fall into their Hands. That Time being expir'd, I understood the Lady was return'd, and was, by the Duke's Correspondent, introduc'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Presence. I presently knew her to be the same I had seen at <hi>Pozzolo Castello,</hi> and she also knew me again: So I deliver'd my Message, but spoke not a Word of her stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing her self or going into <hi>Spain,</hi> since, by what I had seen, I judged she was pretty well recover'd of those Melancholy Fits. But I found she had need of more than one Comforter; for before we parted she told me very intelligibly, I had so much of the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi>'s Air, that she felt the same Inclination for me as she formerly had for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:100189:64"/>It will, no doubt, appear a Wonder that I should trust to these Advances, which I must needs imagine were not sincere, or that I would betray the Confidence the Duke had repos'd in me; but our Reason is easily stifl'd by the Vanity of being belov'd by a fine Woman. Not the Thoughts of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I was going to commit against my Friend, nor of that she had already been guilty of to him, by favouring the Gentleman I had surpriz'd her with, could deter me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passionately in Love with her. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested my Affection for her was greater than the Kindness she had express'd for me; and made her sensible I was concern'd at her being engag'd with more than the Duke and my self. She answer'd, The Man I had seen at <hi>Pozzolo Castello,</hi> was the Object of her Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and that I should not have any occasion to be jealous on his score. I believed her, or at least I pretended so, and made it my Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to free my self from any thing that might have hindred my relishing the Pleasure of a new Amour.</p>
            <p>I wrote to the Duke, That his Mistress was inconstant; and tho' she had blinded me to that degree, yet I could set her forth to him in her true Colours. It had been happy for me if I had made use of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I gave him, Not to think of her any more: But I could not fancy her under the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100189:65"/>
Shape I had represented her in, which, I knew was so like her, it being the common Fate of Lovers to overlook those Faults in their Mistresses, which themselves can make others take notice of.</p>
            <p>My present Rival soon perceiv'd our new Commerce, and was very much displeas'd, so was I, to find, that instead of Breaking with him she entertain'd us both.</p>
            <p>This Jilt had acquainted him, That I was no <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> whom the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> had sent to her: Which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret was no sooner reveal'd to him, but he thought of a quick Remedy for his Jealousie, for he discover'd me to the Magistrates, and I was immediately clapt into a Jail. My only recourse was, to write to the Lady, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring her to use her Interest in procuring my Liberty, but I understood, that far from that, she boasted her self to be the Author of my Confinement, giving as a Reason, That I was come from the Duke to make her a Proposal of going into <hi>France.</hi> From this she expected a double Advantage; first, to persuade her other Lover, That she had not been intimate with me, and besides, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Favour of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Party, who (as I have said) were no good Friends of hers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:100189:65"/>When I understood the Trick she play'd me, I awak'd as out of a Lethargy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd that I had but my Desert. Good Gods! What Imprecations I made against Women! What Desires I had to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd! But I was oblig'd to quell my Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and apply my Thoughts only to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the regaining of my Freedom. I durst not venture to own my self, for fear of a closer Imprisonment, but pretended I was a Servant of the Duke <hi>de Guise,</hi> whom he had sent with some Letters to his Mistress. I was believ'd, and about a Week after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd, with some poor <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who had been my Companions in this Habitation, and were not thought strong enough for the Gallies; where I should have been sent, had I not fallen sick in the Prison.</p>
            <p>As soon as I was at Liberty, I went to the Lady, to whom I was so much oblig'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting she would, at least, procure me the means to return Home, for I had but an old ragged Coat on, and not a Farthing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, all being rifled from me when I was seiz'd on. She could not forbear laughing to see me in that Pickle, and when I would have tax'd her with her Perfidiousness, she interrupted me, saying; <hi>What would you have, poor Fellow? All I can do is to bestow some Alms on you, to help you in your Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Here,</hi> continued she, addressing her
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100189:66"/>
self to one of her Women, <hi>Give him Three Pistols and send him away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Heavens! How is it possible for a Man to bear up under such Afflictions?</hi> However, I took Patience, in good Hopes one Day or other to revenge my self; and refusing her Mony, went to the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi>'s Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent, expecting he would procure me enough to bear my Charges to <hi>France</hi>; but he deny'd himself to me, and my Servant that came thither with me, who was a <hi>Polander,</hi> being run away (as soon as he saw me ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested) with all the Officers of Justice had not robb'd me of, I was left to the wide World, without Friends, without Mony, and in a strange Country.</p>
            <p>I judged it my best way, (if possible) to get to <hi>Rome,</hi> hoping to find there some <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Acquaintance, who would treat me better than they had done at <hi>Naples.</hi> I made a shift to reach <hi>Terracina,</hi> where I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately met with the Duchess of — bound for <hi>Rome,</hi> whom I inform'd of my Circumstances, telling her, I had fallen among the <hi>Banditties</hi>; and she did me the Favour to take me with her. I was not long at <hi>Rome,</hi> e're I met with a Friend, who fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd me with the Mony I wanted; and presently after I took Post. The Speed I made was such, that I arrived in <hi>Flanders</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:100189:66"/>
the 18th of <hi>August,</hi> Two Days before the Battle of <hi>Lens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I apprehended the best Way for me to get into Favour again with my Brother, and to regain my lost Credit, was to begin with some generous Action, which might efface all the ill Reports spread of me, during my Absence. That was the Motive which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to go directly for <hi>Flanders,</hi> where I heard they were preparing for an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I was unwilling to appear before my Brother, who was there, and had the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of being one of the best Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Army; and only discovered my self to another General Officer, who was my Relation, with whom I remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed till the Day of Battle, in which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to put me into a Post of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>My Caution, in writing these Memoirs, of keeping my self undiscovered, shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me, if I do not give the Reader a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Relation of an Action I performed, which raised my Fame even above my Wishes. That Engagement has been so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten described, that did I here make a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Share I had in it, I should betray my self to every ones Knowledge; and I think it enough for my purpose, to let the Reader understand, that the Prince <hi>d'Anguien</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:100189:67"/>
gave out, he stood indebted to me for the Victory, having had the good Fortune to to hinder a considerable Body from being routed, whose Flight would have occasioned that of the whole Army. This Exploit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured me a Regiment, having obtained a Colonel's Commission, by my General's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation. I found my Brother as kind as ever; and was inform'd by him, That the Count my other Brother, was fled to <hi>Poland,</hi> a Duel having put him to the Choice of undergoing either a Voluntary Banishment or an Involuntary Death; and that my Sister was separated from her Husband, and liv'd with my Mother.</p>
            <p>The Reputation I had gained in the Fight at <hi>Lens,</hi> had so animated me, that I did a Work of Supererogation, in desiring I might stay with the Mareschal <hi>de Rantzan,</hi> in whose Army I serv'd, in the Siege of <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>; and, the Campaign ended, I return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>October</hi>: And there found all things in a great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, occasion'd by the Hatred which the <hi>Parisians</hi> bore to the Cardinal <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more I reflected on what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to me (especially the Two Years last past) the more I fancy'd my Life to be Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick: And, in spight of so many odd Adventures, I yet trusted with so much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100189:67"/>
to my good Stars, that I neglected the Pursuit of my further Preferment, and arming my self against the Snares of Beauty. But I visited the Ladies with the less Fear, because I thought my Heart secur'd from their Allurements, and I was resolv'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Passion to all, but fix on none. The ridiculous manner wherein my Mother ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed her self might have confirm'd me in those Intentions, since it was an undeniable Proof that neither Age nor Reason can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige a Coquet to Modesty.</p>
            <p>My Mother, who had liv'd without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering either Children or Estate, took care, however, never to want a Lover. She had been courted a long Time by a Widower, much about her Age, who was so assiduous in his Visits, that there was no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the Aspersions which might be thrown upon her for it, but that they were as good as marry'd. All the Family was persuaded that he was her Husband, and that Match not being too agreeable to us, we expressed our Discontent by a very cold behaviour to her, tho without coming to an open Breach.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman had a Son newly come from the University, whom my Mother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into her House, she having given out, That he was to continue there, but till such
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100189:68"/>
Time as they might send him to the Academy. My eldst Brother did not seem to take notice of it, nor so much as complain of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Expences she put her self to on his account; but the Servants soon acquainted us, That her kindness for him went farther yet, and that something had pass'd between them which they knew not how to interpret to her Advantage. His Father was inform'd of it also; and his Displeasure was so great, that forcing his Son from her, he sent him to <hi>S. Lazarus.</hi> But, to compleat his Vexation and ours, my Mother shew'd him a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and the Certificate of a Marriage, made above a Month before. So, what the Father had courted during Fifteen or Sixteen Years, with the most engaging Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and endearing Tokens of Love, his Son, tho yet a School-Boy, obtain'd in less than Three Months Time. This Business, which became at once the publick Discourse and Jest of the Town, gave us no little Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. His Father would have had us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute in order to annul the Marriage, and produc'd a former Engagement from her to himself; but we being indifferent as to the Person, since she was resolv'd to have a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, thought it not worth our while to meddle with it, and left him to manage the Affair alone; which prov'd his Ruin: For after losing several Law-Suits, and his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100189:68"/>
into the Bargain, his Trouble was so great that he sicken'd upon it, and dyed; having first disinherited his Son, whom my Mother took out of the unpleasant Lodging he was in, having prov'd her Marriage good: But People never would be so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant as to call her by her New Husband's Name.</p>
            <p>I thought all these Experiments had wholly withdrawn me from that perfidious Sex: But even those induc'd me to seek for new Amours. I had an earnest Desire to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Discreet Virtuous Woman; and it may well be imagin'd that it was impossible for my Heart to remain free, when I thought I had found her.</p>
            <p>I often visited my poor <hi>Carmelite,</hi> I cannot say I saw her (for she was very exact in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Rules of her Order, one of which is not to unveil themselves) but I spoke with her, and her Friendship made her concern'd in all my Adventures, especially in my last (I mean what happen'd to me in the Battle at <hi>Lens</hi>;) I was beholding to her good Counsels, for my avoiding the Snares which the Coquets at Court laid to entrap me: Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not taken with any thing so much as with the Reputation of a War-like and Gallant Man, and I had the Name of being both. But I contented my self with bare
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100189:69"/>
Conversation, without any particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, laughing at those Friends who were caught in the Mouse-trap, sharing in their Pleasures and Debauches, and turning all to my own Diversion.</p>
            <p>Thus I liv'd, when my dear <hi>Carmelite</hi> told me, That since I had wholly forsaken <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I must think of getting a Wife in <hi>France</hi>; and that she would help me to one, whom she nam'd; adding, The Lady was an intimate Friend of hers, and, to her Knowledge, had a good Opinion of me. I had seen her, and lik'd her well, but the flattering Thoughts, that she was charm'd with me, gave her Accomplishments such a Lustre, that I fell desperately in Love from that very Minute. I ask'd my Nun, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she could swear that so well-deserving a Lady were not given to Coquetry? <hi>Oh!</hi> reply'd she, <hi>She is a Model of Modesty and Virtue, and the only Fault that can be found with her is, That she runs into an Excess of Preciseness.</hi> I desir'd her to bring us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted immediately; and accordingly we appointed a Day, when we should meet in the Parlor, as by chance. I was punctual, so was she, and after a Conversation on indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Matters, I waited on the Lady home. We were no sooner arrived there, but she said, in a very free and open manner: <hi>Sir, I will not detain you with Expectation, my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100189:69"/>
being, once more, to marry, I look for a Man that may make me happy, and the good Character I have heard of you gives me Hopes you will procure me that Felicity.</hi> I answer'd her with the most convincing Expressions of Love and Gratitude I could invent: Then she gave me a List of my Rivals, who were all Men of Quality and Merit; and concluded with an Assurance, that I should ever have the Preference.</p>
            <p>This engag'd me more than I ever had been in my whole Life-time; insomuch, that transported with the Prospect of possess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Lady of so high a Rank and Fortune, I wholly abandon'd my self to the deepest Passion, and was not one Day without visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. Some Disputes, which arose about her Estate, were the usual Themes of her Discourse, and I saw she design'd me the Office of Solliciter, before that of a Husband. Tho' I had an Aversion to Business, yet for her sake, I gladly undertook to manage those Concerns, and the earnestness wherewith I apply'd my self to it, soon made me a good Lawyer. Her entrusting me in all her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and our being constantly together, occasion'd a Report that we were already marry'd: This I acquainted her with, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it might oblige her to hasten the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of my Happiness; but she, on the contrary, reply'd, That since my fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100189:70"/>
Visits were so much taken notice of, I must not see her so often: That her Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances would not permit her to marry so soon, but by waiting her Leisure, I should give her an undeniable Proof of my Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I was mad at this Delay, yet to shew how much I lov'd, I told her; That tho' it was a great piece of Self-Denyal, I would submit to her Directions. She seem'd over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd to find me so tractable, and having settled our Meetings at thrice a Week, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miss'd one, and, in the Intervals ply'd her with <hi>Billets Deux.</hi> Her Answers were very obliging, giving fresh Proofs of her Affection, and renew'd Assurances she would marry none but me. In the mean while the Campaign drew near, and consequently the Time approach'd when I must leave my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress. She vow'd to me, that she would espouse me at my Return; and, indeed, I had not, during my Absence, any reason to doubt of her Sincerity, her Letters, which I never fail'd of every Post, being an evident Argument of it.</p>
            <p>We did little Execution that <hi>Summer,</hi> the Enemy retook <hi>Ipres,</hi> and we ballanc'd our Fortune by taking <hi>Conde. Winter</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I found my Mistress in the same Sentiments I had left her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:100189:70"/>My Duty often call'd me to <hi>S. Germains,</hi> where the Court was then. One Day being oblig'd to attend his Majesty at his <hi>Couchee</hi>; I waited first on that Lady. Having paid my Devoirs to her, I was going, when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me back from the Stair-Head; <hi>Heark ye,</hi> said she, <hi>What do you with all the Letters you receive from me? Would you oblige me so far, as to return them me?</hi> I assur'd her, That I kept them with all imaginable Care, as a Treasure I valued more than all the World besides. <hi>However,</hi> continued she, <hi>Let me have them again, for my own Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; pray send them me before you go for</hi> S. Germains. I very unwilling comply'd; but, fearing to disoblige her, I obey'd. Two Days after my arrival at <hi>S. Germains,</hi> it was said in the Queen's Presence, That a Prince of the Blood was going to marry, and that the Match was wholly concluded. My Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity led me to enquire who the Lady was, and heard, with no little Surprize, that it was my intended Spouse. My Astonishment was yet greater, when they would have perswaded me, That I had been the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it; I confess there was some seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ground, the Prince being my intimate Friend, and every one imagining the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy never did any thing without consulting me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:100189:71"/>I could not be persuaded at first of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the Report; but calling to mind the Assiduity wherewith the Prince had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visited her, and how earnestly she had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Return of her Letters, I began to believe it too true.</p>
            <p>That Prince was then at <hi>S. Germains,</hi> and I thought the only way to know the Truth was to wait on him, without taking any Notice of what I had heard. I did so, and he no sooner saw me, but he came and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd me, saying; <hi>There is the dear Friend to whom I owe my Happiness, since my Mistress yields only upon his Recommendations.</hi> My Blood boyl'd at these Words, and I whisper'd him softly, That <hi>his Marriage was not so sure but he might meet with Opposition.</hi> I told him, a Person waited for him in a Garden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Pallace, who had something of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to impart; whither I intreated him to walk immediately. He wondred at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my Delivery, for the Fury I was in had strangely alter'd my Countenance: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he had the Complaisance to go with me, still asking me, What was the Matter, and what had happen'd.</p>
            <p>I reply'd not a Word till we were at the Place; then I ask'd him very seriously, If he was really to marry the Lady he spoke of. <hi>Why do you ask such a Question,</hi> said he, <hi>since you know it as well as my self?</hi> I assur'd
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100189:71"/>
him he was mightily mistaken, for she was engag'd to me. The Prince look'd on me with a Smile, and seeing I still maintain'd my Gravity; <hi>Are you mad, my poor Count?</hi> said he, <hi>How long have you lost your Wits? Did not you make the Match? I am sure the Lady told me so; I am your real Friend, and the Devil take me if I ever thought of her while I imagin'd you pretended to her. But, prithee, What Tyes are between you?</hi> I answer'd, <hi>They are such, that it is but Three Days since she swore solemnly, She would marry none but me; and I have brought you hither to dispute my Right. Not so,</hi> continued he, <hi>I'le yield her, if what you say be true.</hi> Then I propos'd to adjourn the Controversie till she could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide it.</p>
            <p>I had not Patience till my Time of Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was over, but pretending some Business, ask'd Leave to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> which was granted me. At my Arrival I presently ran to the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> to acquaint my Nun with what had happen'd at <hi>S. Germains</hi>; but she had Notice of it already, the Lady having wrote to her the Day before, telling her, That my frequent Visits had rais'd a Scandal, reflecting upon her Honour, which she would not confirm by marrying me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she had entertain'd the Prince's Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals. Her Letter was much to this Purpose, but her Arguments were not satisfactory,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100189:72"/>
since it but too plainly appear'd, That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy and Interest were the only Motives of her Change.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Carmelite</hi> advis'd me, finding her of so fickle a Temper, not to pursue my Claim, assuring me, such Qualifications would be worse in a Wife than a Mistress; but I would not hearken to her Reasons, and was resolv'd not to be bafl'd.</p>
            <p>From the Nunnery I went to the Lady's, and taking no notice of what had pass'd, I ask'd her, When she would compleat our Marriage? She ask'd me, If I had heard any thing at <hi>S. Germains?</hi> And having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd <hi>No: Then,</hi> continued she, <hi>your Friend at the</hi> Carmelites <hi>will acquaint you with what I dare not tell you my self.</hi> Seeing, then, that there was no more dissembling, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd to her, That I had understood she was to be marry'd to the Prince <hi>de— Well,</hi> said she, <hi>and why do you deny it? I hate a Liar, and for that very reason would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card you.</hi> I was inrag'd at this Reply, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to see her do it with such Assurance and Indifferency. <hi>Proteus</hi> never put on his various Shapes more suddenly than I did mine, for I Swore, Threat'ned, Cry'd and Pray'd all in a Breath, and all to no purpose: So I left her, protesting I would use my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Industry, to confirm the ill Reports which had been spread of her on my account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:100189:72"/>It was, indeed, my first Resolution, by that means to ruin her in the Prince's Esteem; but since, after all, it would have been a base Slander, for our Conversation had been very innocent, I only gave him a Relation of all the Promises she had made: Whether the Prince dislik'd her for her Inconstancy, or suspected her Vertue, he assur'd me, That he would never think of her any more; and in performance of his Word, did presently disingage himself.</p>
            <p>The Lady finding I forbore my visits also, three Days after sent for me, and having up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided me with what she suppos'd I had given out against her Honour, to occasion the breaking off of the Princes Match: She, in the conclusion, told me, She was now reduc'd to a Necessity of Marrying of me, which she would perform as soon as I pleas'd.</p>
            <p>I never had so little inclination to it as when I saw the thing so near being finish'd, for her Coquetry had something abated my Esteem; however, the real Opinion I had of her Chastity made me consent; for at least, I concluded, I should be sure of a good Fortune and a virtuous Wife.</p>
            <p>Yet I was not so well resolv'd but my Heart fail'd me, and that made me yield to a Delay for a Fortnight or Three Weeks, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lady's Request; she having pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100189:73"/>
some Indisposition. Tho I saw no Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of any, I told her she might take her own Time, and look'd upon my Wedding as a thing so certain, that I really made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it.</p>
            <p>Going to see her one Night, I was told she was in Bed; on which I offer'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, when her Woman proffer'd to conceal me in a Closet, next to her Lady's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where I should discover strange things, yet necessary for me to know. I enquir'd, what it was? She answer'd me, Her Lady was with Child, and actually then in Labor. I was astonish'd, and she seem'd in as great a Disorder, but added, If I would go with her, she would convince me of the Truth.</p>
            <p>This was of too great a concern to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: I went with her, and in a short Time I heard the Lady's Groans. All the Servants were sent out of the Way, only the Midwife and that Woman remain'd at Home. Heavens! How great was my surprize! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what can be describ'd. I slipt into her Bed-Chamber privately, hiding my self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Hangings, where I beheld all that pass'd. My Rage was like to have made me commit some Extravagance, when my Intelligencer approach'd, saying, Her Lady had perceiv'd me, and desir'd to speak with me. This Message did (if possible) increase my Amazement. <hi>Is she,</hi> said I, <hi>in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100189:73"/>
to see me, and does she desire I should treat her according to her Deserts?</hi> However, a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of knowing what she could say for her self, made me draw near to her Bed: When she told me, in a languishing Tone; <hi>Sir, It was by my Order you came hither, to let you see, that had not your Obstinacy hindred my Marriage with the Prince, you had not received this Trouble. Now you find how despicable a Creature you have made your Applications to, and how little worthy of your Kindness.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd dumb for a long time, after which, <hi>At least, Madam,</hi> said I, <hi>let me know the happy Father. That,</hi> she reply'd, <hi>will be no great Advantage to you: It is sufficient, you see, I am unwilling to deceive you; I had not been so scrupulous, had you been of another Character, but your Behaviour has been so honourable and respectful that I could never have the Heart to abuse you: Farewel, and consider now whether I am a fit Bride for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner wherein she spoke mov'd my Compassion, which made me loath to leave her. However, I return'd Home, and threw my self upon the Bed, scarcely believing the Adventure real, but that it was a Dream; for I had strictly observ'd that Lady's Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and never had any ground for the least Suspicion. I was distracted with a thousand Thoughts, but with none so much as the Desire of knowing by whom she had that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100189:74"/>
Child. To satisfie my Curiosity, I waited on her, as soon as I thought she might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of my Visits, not doubting in the least, after what I was already acquainted with, she dar'd conceal any thing from me.</p>
            <p>She spoke first, telling me, I had a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Share in her Misfortune than I imagin'd, and that the only occasion of it, was her too great Love for me. This appear'd to me very odd, and I fancy'd the whole Story would be a Riddle. I desir'd her to proceed; then she inform'd me, She had lov'd me with the deepest Passion; and, to her Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, my Respects had kept me at too great a Distance, since she earnestly wish'd I would have forc'd that Favour from her which she was but too inclinable to grant. That, one Day, being in this amorous Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, my Page brought her a Letter.</p>
            <p>There she stopp'd, and left it to me to guess the rest. Truly the Task was not very difficult, and I now began to find some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in the thing, especially when I call'd to mind, That I had observ'd my Page shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her an extraordinary Respect, which I had imputed to his Desire of pleasing me. I question'd not but he had enjoy'd her often, for when once a Woman yields, she scruples not a Repetition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:100189:74"/>Now I began to have a very mean Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her; and taking no notice of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Kindness for me, I told her, She had extreamly undervalu'd her self; and the best advice I could give her, was, To marry the Page. Which said, I left her.</p>
            <p>Two or Three Hours after, I receiv'd a Letter; wherein she made great Complaints, That I should use her so ill, who was my self the chief Cause of her Affliction: And, in the Conclusion, earnestly begg'd me never to discover her Folly. I return'd no answer, but have faithfully kept the Secret. I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd my Page, who was big enough to serve his Prince and Country, and resolv'd never to think of my Mistress more. Her Looseness was not so much the Cause of my Aversion, as her want of Conduct; for I could never pardon her Simplicity, in disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to me a Secret, from whom, of all Men living, she ought to have conceal'd it. She, on the contrary, thought she had done an heroick Action, and had oblig'd me high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I leave it to the Reader to determine which of us was in the Right, but, for my part, I shall never advise a Lady to own her Amours either to her Husband or Lover.</p>
            <p>When it was known that I forbore visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, the World imagin'd it to be a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Dissatisfaction I had at her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to marry the Prince, and suffer'd
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100189:75"/>
that Opinion to prevail. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she continu'd her Intriegue with the Page, but, about a Twelve month after, a great Favourite made a Match between her and one of his Relations; who was eldest Son to a Noble and Ancient Family, from whom she has since been separated, and is grown the most lewd and infamous Woman at Court.</p>
            <p>It was certainly my evil Planet that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd in this last Amour, for instead of the Fortune I expected, it put me to great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Trouble, which made me once more damn the Female Sex.</p>
            <p>I resolv'd to court them no more, but in railery, and the first attempt I made of that kind, was with one, who had been Mistress to a great Lord at Court, wherein her Reputation had suffer'd, and whose Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits she was oblig'd to shun, to avoid a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Censure. She endeavour'd to persuade me, That she had wholly left him for my sake, which, I only pretended at first to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. But who can resist the Artifices of a deceitful Woman? She seem'd so indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent not only as to that Lord, but to all the World besides my self, that I thought she had a sincere Affection for me. The Lady being extreamly beautiful, and very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I was pleas'd at having fix'd on a Person
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100189:75"/>
of that Character, and found, that inspight of all my Resolutions, I was running into a Relapse. My first Endeavour was to inspire her with a more nice and refin'd Passion than she had till then been sensible of; and she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd so tractable, that I thought my Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had wrought an unfeign'd Conversion in her.</p>
            <p>A neighbouring exil'd Prince was then at the <hi>French</hi> Court, and being a great admirer of the fair Sex, it was thought he wanted not for Mistresses. I had a great Interest in him, having often been a Sharer in his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. One of my Friends, who also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accompany'd him, told me; That an unknown Woman had address'd her self to him, about a very pleasant Business; which was, That a great Lady at Court was willing to present any Person with Four hundred Pistols, that would procure her a private Meeting with that Prince. I reply'd, Four hundred Pistols were worth the looking after, and bid him assure the Woman, That I would speak to the King; which I did the next day, and he readily embrac'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal. My Friend follow'd my Directions, and it was agreed the interveiw should be in a House near <hi>Paris,</hi> where that Prince should go <hi>Incognito.</hi> She thereupon paid him down one half of the Mony, promising he should have the rest, when the Business was over.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100189:76"/>
The King accordingly came to the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, attended by none but a Lord of his own Nation, my Friend, and my self. As soon as we were arriv'd, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was entrusted with this Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, entreated his Majesty to take no Body with him, because the Lady desir'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her self: He only permitted the Lord to follow him, and bid my Friend and I wait for him at some distance. A little while after the King came to us, and told us, That the Lady knowing we were there, would not be persuaded to stay, but was already gone, giving as a Reason, that she knew me to be the most talkative Man in the World, and that I could not keep a Secret. I wondred any Lady in <hi>France</hi> should have such a Thought of me, since my Character was quite otherwise; and therefore ask'd his Majesty, What manner of Person she was? To which he answer'd, He would shew her me, for he knew she went often to Court, and that this was not the first time he had seen her Face.</p>
            <p>Three or four Days after, being at the Fair of <hi>S. Germains,</hi> with my Mistress, who I believ'd, lov'd me with all imaginable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; I met that King, who, smiling, whisper'd in my Ear, That the Lady I led was the aforesaid Party. Observing that she had taken notice of our whispering, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100189:76"/>
her with what that Prince had said; at which she seemed not much surpriz'd, but ask'd me: <hi>Why? Did you not know it? I could not think of a more fit Revenge, for your baseness in selling your Mistress; I am very well satisfied, and so you ought to be, since the Mony has been paid you punctually. Oh! Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious,</hi> I reply'd, <hi>who could have suspected you capable of such an Action? Take my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> said she, <hi>and be silent, we are even as to that Point; and if it was mean in me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute my self to a Prince I lov'd, it is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reproach to you, that you should have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd up your Mistress for Four Hundred Pistols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wondred at her Temper and Presence of Mind, while Passion almost provok'd me to affront her in the open Street. But Women endure a Conviction of Falshood with more Courage and less Shame than Men can do.</p>
            <p>I broke off wholly with her, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King with her Treachery. He seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be concern'd that I should lose my Mistress on his account; but, however he proceeded in his Amour, I look'd on it with a great Unconcernedness, and this Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency persuaded me that I did not love her. While I us'd to visit her, I often saw one of her Friends with her, who had a Daughter
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100189:77"/>
about Sixteen or Seventeen Years old, whom she still boarded in a Nunnery, but sent for home some times. This Maid was really Handsom, and had a great Stock of Wit. I often convers'd with her, but she was so young that I never ventur'd to tell her seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously of my Inclination for her: Neither did I guess at her's for me, till she discover'd it in a Letter, wherein she express'd her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern most tenderly for a slight Indisposition I had. Hoping, that after all the Tricks Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had play'd me, I might now safely rely on a young Creature, who seem'd to follow the Dictates of her Heart. I return'd a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate and grateful Answer; and Two or Three Days after receiv'd a Reply; by which I was desir'd to stay at Home till Ten the next Morning. I could not imagine to what end she made me that Request, and did not in the least expect she would have come to see me. Yet she did, telling me, She had given the Slip to one of her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who had fetch'd her from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. It may well be imagin'd I was charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Action, and that my Flame was not a little augmented by it; she tarry'd not long, that her Couzin, who was in a Church hard by, might not miss her. The next Morning I receiv'd a very endearing Letter from her, and for a Month afterwards I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail'd of one every Day, in the same
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100189:77"/>
strain, and I answer'd them with all the Love I could express. Tho' I had great Reason to be fond of her, and believe she was so of me, yet I durst not visit her in her Nunnery, for she had enjoyn'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, telling me, It would bring her into a great deal of Trouble; and that she was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous our Correspondence should be a secret; so that sending and receiving Letters was all the Courtship I could make.</p>
            <p>This had lasted a Month when she wrote to me, That she was oblig'd to give it over, being persuaded that it was a great Sin. Her Letter almost distracted me, and fearing it was not sufficient for me to write, I own'd my Love to an Acquaintance of her's and mine, whom I conjur'd to assist me.</p>
            <p>The Lady having been with her, told me the Scruple she seem'd to have, was but a Pretence, and that the true Reason (as much as she could apprehend by her Discourse) was, That she had a new Gallant. I easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it; however, I entreated her to return once more, and endeavour to reclaim her; but the young Minx would not own any thing of it, only she wrote to me, That there had been a great Struggle between her Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and her Love, but that the former had prevail'd: And, besides, she could no longer doat on a Man whom she could not see, and who, besides, had a Thousand more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100189:78"/>
The Style of this Letter was a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Proof that she had forsaken me, than her telling me so; for let all possible Care be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to make a <hi>Billet Doux</hi> soft and amorous, it is no longer so than while the Heart directs the Hand. This confirm'd my Thoughts of her Falshood: But how it humbled me, when I understood it was her Father's <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> whom she had prefer'd before me!</p>
            <p>However, I was so great a Dotard, that I endeavour'd to find Excuses for her Frailty; and imagining the free Access he had to her, as Parent's Messenger, was the occasion of her Change, I resolv'd to procure my self the Advantage of seeing her as often. I confess it was not over honourable to persist in loving one, whose sordid Soul could stoop to such a Man's Addresses; but I had no occasion to be very jealous, since his Visits could reach no farther than the Grate; nor did I think it so great a Wonder for a Maid of her Age to be wavering in her Lover's Absence, but rather blam'd my own Negligence, since I might have found out a Thousand Ways of being admitted to her.</p>
            <p>Immediately I thought of one, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disguis'd my self like a Footman, enquir'd for her, as if sent from her Mother. She presently knew me, and expressed so much Joy for having given her that Proof of my
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100189:78"/>
Affection, that I expected the Transport she was in, would have depriv'd her of her Senses. How often did she repeat, <hi>Alas! is it possible you should love me still? I could never have thought it. How happy am I! Well, I shall dye with Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Raptures, which seem'd very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, did so bewitch me, that I was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger angry at her Falshood, only tenderly mentioned it, and she acknowledg'd her Civility had encourag'd that Man's Boldness, but vow'd she would never have endur'd his Insolence, had she not been provok'd to it by the Indifferency she fancy'd I had for her; and that, as a Confirmation of her Aversion to him, she would cause him to be kill'd, or stab him her self, if I desir'd it. I told her, I expected not so barbarous an Assurance, and that I should be satisfied with her avoiding his Conversation; on which she made me a Thousand Protestations of her future Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>This gave me an unexpressible Pleasure, and I was extasied at the Thoughts of being the only Possessor of her Heart.</p>
            <p>Before I left her, I gave her a Lecture about Constant Love: But having spoke never a Word of Matrimony, she ask'd me, If I did not think her a Match good enough? I reply'd, I did not believe her Friends would marry her so young; and, besides, I fear'd
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100189:79"/>
her Fortune being much above mine, I should certainly be deny'd, if I pretended to ask their Consent. <hi>Well! and what need have we of Friends?</hi> said she, <hi>I'le get out of the Convent, and meet you when and where you please: Then they must comply.</hi> I represented to her, It was safer to wait a little, and in the mean while I would procure some Person to insinuate the Matter to her Mother, at a distance, in order to try her Pulse. She seem'd better satisfied at these Words, but would not let me go till I had solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to make her my Wife.</p>
            <p>She was, indeed, so great a Fortune, that there was a Match concluding between her and one of the first Quality, and all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Preparations being ready, she was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Nunnery, and it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reported, she was going to marry the Duke <hi>de</hi> —But she plainly told her Mother, that she would never have him, because she was engaged to me.</p>
            <p>This surpriz'd her, for our Intriegue had been kept very secret: But the Match in Hand being already agreed on, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations on both Sides, her Mother command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her never to think more of me, which if she did, she should lead the remainder of her Life in a Cloister. This Threat was a great shock to her Resolution; but what more induc'd her to comply with her Parents De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100189:79"/>
was the Sight of her intended Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; whom she fell desperately in Love withal at the first View, and marry'd him the next Day.</p>
            <p>She had before inform'd me by a Letter of what her Mother had said, and that the only means I had left was to steal her, as she was going to Church, assigning me the Time and Place. It was not without some Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy that I undertook it, but the Prospect of a good Fortune, and an affectionate Wife, made me wave all my Scruples, and having taken all necessary Measures, I came to the Church-Door in a Coach. Just as I arriv'd, the Ceremony was beginning, so that I took her Project of running away with me for a meer Banter, since I thought it impossible her Mind should alter so suddenly. This I so highly resented, that I was not sorry for losing her, and remain'd present during all the Service; which was taken as a great Affront by her Friends, who have ever since appear'd my Enemies on all Occasions; for I could never come to a right Understanding with them, nor with my Unfaithful Mistress, who seem'd not to have seen me; and indeed, I believe, did not, her whole Mind being possessed with her Bridegroom.</p>
            <p>Some will wonder, perhaps, that I should not seek to Revenge my self for her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; but Love being, in my Opinion, the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100189:80"/>
freest thing in the World, I never thought a Gentleman ought to resent those Injuries. I must confess, I have not always been so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate on that account, as will be seen by the sequel of my Life.</p>
            <p>Being thus jilted by this last Mistress, I believ'd it now impossible for me to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the Sweets of a real and sincere Amour, and that made me very morose to a Sex I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan both to hate and despise. But what sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd me, was, the more I affronted them, the more complaisant and obliging they were to me.</p>
            <p>I did by this Carriage gain the Esteem of a Lady, my Acquaintance with whom was occasion'd by a very odd Accident. This Lady had so henpeck'd her Husband, that she had reduc'd him to a meer Changling, through her imperious Treatment. Being very handsom, and absolute Mistress of her Conduct, most young Courtiers had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegues with her, and she was famous for changing her Lovers every Quarter. I could not forbear letting fly a scurrilous Jest or two against her; which she hearing of, made great Complaints, insomuch that one Day, being by chance in her Company, she abus'd me in a most affronting manner, which I return'd with Interest. This made a great Noise, and every one blam'd my Rudeness,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100189:80"/>
which indeed I could not excuse. I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to give her some Satisfaction, but my Resentment was too great, and, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I us'd all the means I could to express my Contempt of her.</p>
            <p>The Issue was far from what I should have expected, for instead of her Hatred I gain'd her Friendship. A Lady, who knew us both, desir'd me to meet her at her House, assuring me I should not repent it. I could but expect a second Scene of <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> which made me unwillingly consent.</p>
            <p>She came there, and began to weep, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, She was an unhappy Woman to be thus hated by the only Man she loved. This somewhat mollified me, and before we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we were made such good Friends, that I became an assiduous Visitant. She discarded all her Lovers, but seeing she paid a blind Obedience to all I required of her, I began, to treat her with more Complacency. This was an occasion of her admitting more Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, and my Passion began at last to cool, especially when I understood she represented me as too good natur'd, and one whose easie Temper made me unhappy with my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses.</p>
            <p>While I had this Intriegue, the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imprison'd the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Interest my Brother and I had in him, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100189:81"/>
rais'd a Suspicion of us, he advis'd me to retire to <hi>Poland,</hi> where my Children and Estate might need my Presence. I took his Counsel, leaving him at <hi>Paris,</hi> much puzl'd how to discharge, at once, his Duty to the Queen and his Obligation to the Prince; and began my Journey, imagining I had too much Experience ever to be over-reach'd by a Woman, but I was still the same Man, and more expos'd than ever to their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, as we shall see in the following part of these Memoirs.</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS OF THE Count de — Compiled by Monsieur <hi>SAINT E.</hi> BOOK III.</head>
            <p>I Passed through <hi>Germany,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> about the latter End of <hi>April.</hi> It was Two or Three Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prince <hi>Charles Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s having been restor'd to his Electorate. His Amours are so well known, that the Reader may easily judge, Gallantry was no Stranger
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100189:82"/>
to his Court; and that I could scarce avoid there the Dangers from which I design'd to keep my self free. But indeed those I met with, were such as I could never have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, and which I therefore escap'd with the more Difficulty.</p>
            <p>Among her Electoral Highness's Retinue, was a very handsome Frenchwoman, who neither knew what part of <hi>France</hi> she was born in, nor who were her Parents. All the Account she could give of her self was, That one of her Country-women had brought her into <hi>Germany</hi> when she was yet but Ten Years old; who for a long Time was taken for her Mother, but on her Death-Bed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that she had only been entrusted with her, and did not so much as know who she belong'd to. For this Reason they called her the Lady Errant; a Name which she had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a good Title to, as we shall see anon.</p>
            <p>The great Character I had of her Wit and Beauty, made me desire to know her; whom, accordingly, I sought an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to see, and we presently grew acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I perceiv'd she stood much upon her Quality, for having the Liberty to chuse what Friends she would, she had pitch'd on very considerable ones, and confidently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd, that she was Daughter to a Prince and Princess, who, for certain Reasons best
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100189:82"/>
known to her self, had conceal'd her in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> I thought it was in Jest that she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to so illustrious a Pedigree, but at my Third or Fourth Visit found she was in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; and she also inform'd me, That her Nativity had been calculated, and that the Astrologer had assur'd her, she should go into <hi>Poland,</hi> where she would meet with her Friends, and a Husband suitable to her Birth. In these Hopes she liv'd, expecting kind Heaven would give her an Opportunity of accomplishing her Destiny, by affording her the means to make a Voyage to <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hearing I was bound thither, she fancy'd the happy Hour was come, and offer'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me. At first I thought she rally'd, but seeing her very serious upon it, I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to her, That the Electress treated her so kindly that it were Folly and Ingratitude to leave her; that I was oblig'd to ride Post, and therefore she could not keep Pace with me; and that both her Reputation and mine would suffer by such an Action: But she would not be dissuaded from it, and reply'd, She was resolv'd to follow me.</p>
            <p>Then I found my Error, in having too rashly engag'd my self with that Woman; for I must confess, that entic'd by the easie access I had to her, and the Beauty she was Mistress of, I had warmly courted her. She,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100189:83"/>
thinking my Love real, had rely'd on the Addresses I made to her, only for my Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and did not imagine I could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd her any thing.</p>
            <p>How to get rid of her I knew not: At last I thought I might do it, by finding out some real Lover of hers, who would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear her Absence. This was soon done, and I understood that a raw <hi>German</hi> Lord had a sincere Affection for her, and would have marry'd her, had not the Electoress op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his being match'd to one so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. I resolv'd to make him jealous, and to that end seem'd more assiduous than before; and fearing that was not enough for his dull Apprehension, I caus'd him to be warn'd by a Friend of mine, that I was as likely as any one to rob him of his Mistress, and he had best not only watch her himself, but also desire the Electoress to have her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd. I knew not whether this would take, for my <hi>German</hi> did not seem the more diligent for it, only he open'd wide a pair of heavy gogling Eyes upon me, whenever it was our Fortune to be together. In the mean while it grew time for me to be gone, and having, as I thought, dissuaded her from it, I set forwards, for my intended Journey; but was scarce Two Leagues off, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oblig'd to stay for the Shoeing of one of my Horses, I was overtaken by Two Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100189:83"/>
It was no little Surprize to me, to see that one of them was the Lady Errant in Man's Cloaths; but more, that the other should be her <hi>German</hi> Gallant. He said no more to me than he us'd to do, only star'd at me with all his Might, while she told me, That upon my scrupling to take her with me, she had persuaded him to attend her, that she hop'd I would not refuse them my Company during the rest of the Journey.</p>
            <p>I fear'd lest my having been one of her Adorers, while at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> should make People think I had run away with her; and besides, I could not but foresee that she would have been a very troublesome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. I was, on the other Hand astonish'd to see her Lover, who was a Man of the first Quality, in such a Dress, and without Attendance, and (which increas'd my Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) ready to wait on her into so far distant a Country, while she would have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of a Man whom he must needs look on as a Rival. Growing impatient to know the meaning of it, I took him aside, and ask'd what was his Design, and how I might be serviceable to him. He made me a very low Bow, and answer'd me with great Respect, That my Highness did him too great an Honour, in chusing him for an Husband to the Princess my Sister. It may well be imagin'd I was struck with amase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100189:84"/>
at his Discourse; but it was soon over, for, by what I knew of his Mistress, I soon guess'd at the Trick she put upon him.</p>
            <p>However, to be better inform'd, I desir'd him to unriddle himself, and understood she had made him believe, That I was her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Prince <hi>de</hi>—, who had been oblig'd to go under a wrong Name at <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberg,</hi> for the same Reasons as had also put her under a Necessity of concealing her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and had promis'd, If she would come with me into <hi>Poland,</hi> to marry them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and carry her into <hi>France,</hi> with an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance suitable to her Quality. One may easily guess by what I have said, that my <hi>German</hi> Lord was no Conjurer; However, when I had undeceiv'd him, the Shame of having been such an Idiot, so animated him, that he acted like a Man of Sense tho' not like a Man of Honour, and brought me into farther Trouble.</p>
            <p>His Resentment got the better of his Love, and posting back to the City, he left me in Charge with the Lady Errant; who was more obstinate than ever to give me the Trouble of her Company, tho' I absolutely refus'd it; telling her, If she tarry'd there any longer, I would return to <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> and make her Folly known to all the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:100189:84"/>She was not one that would easily quit her Hold, but seeing Intreaties could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, she begg'd of me with Tears, That I would assist her in the fulfilling her Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I hope the Reader will excuse my Weakness, considering the Force of those, when trickling down a beautiful Face. I confess, my Heart began to relent, and I should certainly have comply'd with her, had I not been prevented; which shews, that let a Woman be never so great a Fool, she still has Wit enough to make one of a Man.</p>
            <p>While this Dispute lasted, in which the Victory began to incline of her side, we saw a Company of Horsemen, who, coming up to us, seiz'd on her, and told me, That his Electoral Highness would willingly have an account of the Reasons I had to run away with her. This was as much as to say, That they arrested me in his Name; so I went along with them, without putting them to the Trouble of a more rough Complement, and came to <hi>Heydelberg</hi>; where every one look'd on me as the Author of her Flight: For the <hi>German,</hi> asham'd of having given Credit to the Extravagancies she had told him, was the most forward in publishing, That I had persuaded her, thus disguis'd, to accompany me, thinking thereby to save his own Credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he was return'd before
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100189:85"/>
his Absence had been taken Notice of.</p>
            <p>I sure had Reason to curse my ill Fortune, on this account, it being now the Third or Fourth Time in my Life, that I had been, tho' innocent, suspected of stealing Women. A Man must take great Care how he engages himself with Strangers, for it often happens that by being too officious to them he hazards his own Quiet and Safety.</p>
            <p>I gave the Elector a faithful account of what had pass'd, and he readily believ'd me, and laughing heartily at the <hi>German</hi> Lord's Simplicity, assur'd me, That he would do his Endeavours to help him to the Wife he had so great a Mind to.</p>
            <p>Then I had leave to depart, but fell sick by the way, and spent above Six Weeks in my Journey. I understood, before my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at <hi>Warsaw,</hi> That the only Person I fear'd, was dead some Days since. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Memory may soon suggest to him, That it was the Poysoning and Daggering Lady that I stood in such awe of. She had, since my leaving her, marry'd the Lord I had surpriz'd her with, and (as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported) being weary of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, design'd to have poyson'd him, but he was too hard for her at her own Weapons, and prevented her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:100189:85"/>King <hi>Ladislaus</hi> had been dead ever since the Year 1648. and his Brother Prince <hi>Casi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi> had succeeded him, as well in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his Queen as in that of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I found her Majesty with Child, and ready to lye in; she told me, I came in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Time, for Two Reasons: One, to deliver my Brother out of the Trouble he had brought himself into, and then, to comfort a poor afflicted Gentlewoman, who had had recourse to her, and made great Complaints of me.</p>
            <p>I was acquainted in the whole, that my Brother had procur'd himself many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by his Rash and Inconsiderate Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, especially in his Amours, insomuch that he was forbid coming to Court. And, as for the Lady, I understood, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription was given of her, thas it was my <hi>Heidelberg</hi> Mistress, who was arriv'd into <hi>Poland</hi> almost a Fortnight before.</p>
            <p>The Queen inform'd me, That she had given out, I had promis'd to marry her, and having obtain'd my Desire, had ungratefully forsaken her. I satisfied her Majesty in that particular, and gave her a true account of all I knew of her; then her Majesty let me know further, That the King began to be in Love with her; at which I was glad, hoping so potent a Rival might deliver me from her Impertinence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:100189:86"/>The Story of her leaving <hi>Heydelberg</hi> runs thus. After her Return, the Elector endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to marry her to her stupid <hi>German</hi> Lover; but having less Wit than he, and still fondly persuaded that her Stars directed her to <hi>Poland,</hi> she refus'd so good an Offer. The Blockhead, eager in his Pursuit, and assisted by his Prince, caus'd her to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, thinking by that means to make her comply; but she found a way to escape, and, having put on Man's Cloaths, came to <hi>Warsaw,</hi> with a Woman whom she had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to accompany her under the same Disguise. Being arriv'd there, she enquir'd for me, whom not finding, she thought of the fine Story she had told the Queen. But the King's Affection for her, gave her other Thoughts, and she look'd upon it as the Forerunner to her future Glory.</p>
            <p>We chanc'd to meet not long after, but with the same Indifferency as tho' we had never seen one another, and the feign'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, nor the Adventures at <hi>Heydelberg</hi> were not once mention'd in our Conversation. I found her free from all those Extravagancies; she was now grown as sensible as she was fair, and I must confess I never saw a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more charming. She made me the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of her Intriegue with the King, which brought me into fresh Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:100189:86"/>The Queen being as jealous of this, as she had been of her former Husband, would have had me acquaint her with all I knew of their Amour; but I, loath to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, and fearing to displease her, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to obey her Commands, pretended I had an Intriegue with her my self, and that the King had wholly forsaken her. The Confidence her Majesty repos'd in me, made her give more Credit to what I said, than to the Advices she had of the King's Falshood; and she could not forbear acquainting him with this Report, saying, She wondred how People could have such mean Thoughts of him, as to imagine he could love a Woman I entertain'd.</p>
            <p>The effect of this was, that he suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, order'd his Mistress to forbear seeing me. When the Queen understood that I durst not visit her, she was convinc'd I had deceiv'd her, and resented it so highly that she began to hate me, as much as she did her Rival.</p>
            <p>My Brother's wild Conduct had, on the other Hand, made our Name odious to the <hi>Polanders.</hi> Having, as I have already said, been oblig'd to quit <hi>France,</hi> about a Year and a half before, he came to <hi>Warsaw,</hi> thinking to find me there, where he met with the Gentleman, who had been my Second at <hi>Venice,</hi> who was but just arriv'd. The
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100189:87"/>
Queen made them a very kind Reception, and Prince <hi>Cazimir</hi>'s Election and Marriage, having given an occasion to all sorts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes, the Court was so much taken up with those Divertisements, that War had for some time been wholly laid a side; so they had not an occasion of serving his <hi>Polish</hi> Majesty against the <hi>Swedes,</hi> to which end they said they were come, and for want of other Employment wholly spent their time in the Ladies Conversation. All the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars I could hear were, That they had fought several Duels, and that their rude Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to every Woman they lik'd, had at last oblig'd the Queen to command them to come no more to Court; so that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd the Opinion Foreigners had then, That what the <hi>French</hi> are most famous for (I mean Politeness) is what they least practise in their Amours; which Prejudice, I do not see that those who have travelled since have effac'd, for it is look'd on as a Miracle to see a young <hi>French</hi> Gentleman behave himself with Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            <p>Tho' I had highly disoblig'd the Queen, yet she made a great Distinction between my Brother and me; and if she seem'd not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire me Stay in <hi>Poland,</hi> it was because she did not think I could be serviceable to her there, being out of Favour with the King. So when I had settled my Affairs, I resolv'd to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100189:87"/>
be gone, and first endeavour'd to persuade my Brother and his Friend to a more decent Carriage; but thinking their Credit wholly lost there, they went into <hi>Swedeland,</hi> where they thought they might sooner meet with an Opportunity of shewing their Valour, for they were already outlaw'd in <hi>France,</hi> whither they durst not return.</p>
            <p>I once more left <hi>Poland,</hi> much in the same Posture as I had done the Time before, out of Favour with the Court, and still for a Woman's sake; for my <hi>Heidelberg</hi> Lady was the Cause of all this, and had not that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Accident fell out, I should have had a great Share in King <hi>Casimir</hi>'s Affection. That Prince was much of the same Genius as his Brother, a Foe to Business, and a Friend, nay, I may say, a Slave to his Pleasures, but Master of infinitely more Bravery. He was not, naturally, daring enough for great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, which had given the Queen an absolute Command over his Mind; but when once he had resolv'd upon a thing, he wanted not Courage to put it in execution. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Vice was the Love of Women, and Constancy was what he was little guilty of. His natural Levity was encourag'd by frequent Remorses and a Dread, lest God should bring some Punishment on him for his Lewdness: But it is observable, that his Devotion increas'd but as his Love-Fits began
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100189:88"/>
to decrease, and that he took Religion up but when he grew weary of an old Mistress, which he would as easily lay down again when a new one pleas'd him better; thus was his whole Life a mixture of Piety and Gallantry. As for his Conversation, he was frank and very Complaisant; his only Fault was too little a Thirst for Glory; and had not the King of <hi>Suedeland</hi> and <note place="margin">A <hi>Polander,</hi> who excited a Rebellion which lasted Fifteen Years.</note> 
               <hi>Lubomirski</hi> disturb'd his quiet, he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the Ease of a Private Man to the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a great Monarch.</p>
            <p>The Queen had an absolute Power over him, tho' she was still mistrustful of her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; not that she wanted Wit, or thought her self a Fool, but she fear'd the King, being of so easie a Temper, might be wrought upon by others; and seeing he must have Mistresses, she took all possible Care to give him a distate for those, who, she thought might be cunning enough to outwit and supplant her.</p>
            <p>Such was then the Posture of Affairs in <hi>Poland,</hi> which I had taken especial notice of; for being grown in Age, and consequently more serious, I began to observe the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and Intriegues of those I conversed with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:100189:88"/>Before I was quite out of that Country I met with a new Adventure, wherein I run great Hazard of my Life, and was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the most barbarous Sight Eyes ever beheld, the very Thought of which strikes my Soul with Horror. Altho my Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the fair Sex was the occasion of the share I had in it, yet I cannot herein condemn my self, since any one who had the least Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity or Generosity would have acted as I did.</p>
            <p>I was about Two Days Journey from <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw,</hi> when resting in a little Town, while fresh Horses were providing for me, I spy'd a Woman in a great Disorder, who running towards me, made Signs that I should meet her, being almost spent, and not able to reach the Place where I was. Being gone to her, she threw her self into my Arms, and, before she could speak fainted away. She was little, as are most of the <hi>Polish</hi> Women, and, in spight of the Confusion she was in, it was easily perceived she was as handsome as any that Country affords. Her Beauty and Distress mov'd my Pity; I carry'd her into a little House, where my Servants wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and having laid her down, she reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:100189:89"/>She told us, That she was born at <hi>Breslau,</hi> and that her Friends had marry'd her to a <hi>Tartar,</hi> who was so rude to her, that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to bear any longer with his ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, she had left him, and was going to <hi>Warsaw,</hi> where she had some Relations, who would protect her against her severe Husband. That was all she told us at first; but at last she own'd, that the Reason of her running away was, That she had given him an Occasion to suspect her Virtue; that her Lover had accompany'd her in her Flight, and being fallen into an Ambuscade of <hi>Cossaks,</hi> they had murther'd him before her Eyes, and that having made her escape from them also, she was still in great Fear of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who, to her Knowledge, was in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of her.</p>
            <p>Indeed my Heart bled to see her in that wretched condition; but how to help her I knew not, unless I carry'd her to <hi>Warsaw,</hi> which would have been a considerable Stop to my Journey. However, I thought my self oblig'd in Honour and Conscience to do it, and accordigly order'd one of my Men to take her up behind him, and to follow me. But we had scarce rid half a Day, before we met with her Husband, who with Ten or Twelve <hi>Tartars</hi> more, was in Quest after her. He presently knew her again, and having drawn his Scymeter, came to him
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100189:89"/>
who had her up behind him, threat'ning to take away his Life. I ran to his Relief with my Pistol cock'd, but the superior Number soon overpower'd us, and we were robb'd of our Charge. I know not whether in the Passion he was in, he took me for his Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old-maker, but having order'd his Men to seize me, I was forc'd into a Stable he had already caus'd her to be shut into, where I beheld his barbarous Revenge. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Four of his Servants to grasp her tender Limbs, while himself began to flea her. The miserable Creature lookt some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on me, and amidst the woful Cries that dreadful Pain forc'd from her, did now and then put forth some Ejaculations, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Divine Mercy. At last her inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Husband, seeing her dead, threw in my Face what he had of her Skin, whence I expected to have been us'd in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which to prevent, I told him in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> That I would have him take care of what he did; That I was a Stranger, wholly unacquainted with his Wife, and whom he could have no quarrel against. This made him look very earnestly on me; and, as I suppose, finding his Mistake, he did me the Favour, having set my Men and Baggage at Liberty, to turn me out of Doors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:100189:90"/>Indeed I never was seiz'd with so much Dread and Horror; it was above Ten Days before I could destroy the frightful Idea of her Punishment; and I had so great an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration for the <hi>Tartar,</hi> that I often had, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Time, a violent Desire, to seek out the Villain, and kill him with mine own Hand: But these Thoughts did at last wear off, and gave Way to the Reflexions I made on the fatal Consequences which usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attend an unequal Match, and on the Misery Women procure themselves by their loose Behaviour.</p>
            <p>I arriv'd at <hi>Paris</hi> about the latter End of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> having spent near Ten Months in my Journey. About a Fortnight after my arrival, the Prince was set at Liberty, and my Brother and I thought we might express our Gratitude and Respects to him, without disobliging the Court: But we soon found it otherwise, and the very first Time we waited on him, perceiv'd he was contrving a a Rebellion. He was of too great a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not to discover the Queen design'd to to recal the Cardinal, who was then, I think, at <hi>Sedan,</hi> and openly protested, That if he return'd into <hi>France,</hi> he would send him out faster than he came in. We well foresaw what would be the Event, and waited not long for a Confirmation of our Fears. My
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100189:90"/>
Brother did not think fit to follow the Prince, but because I was more Master of my own Actions, he not only consented to my attending him out of the Kingdom, but also advis'd me to share in his Fortune; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he saw it impossible for him to advance my Preferment with the Queen, or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous to see the Prince in Favour with his Majesty, he was glad to have a Friend with his Royal Highness, who should give him good Advice.</p>
            <p>Whatever my Brother's Design might be, I am sure I would never have comply'd with his Desires, had I not been glad to leave <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> that I might divert my Melancholy, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd by the Affliction I had, through the Perfidiousness of a new Mistress, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready engag'd with, since my Return from <hi>Poland.</hi> This was a troublesome Intriegue; and since that with my <hi>Carmelite,</hi> none had ever prov'd so vexatious to me. Indeed it afforded me an Opportunity of discovering new Characters in the Sex, which I had not till then been aware of, as may be judged from the following Story.</p>
            <p>Near my Lodgings there liv'd a Woman, whose Husband was lately dead, but who had been separated from him a few Years after her Marriage. Every one would have it that her Gallantry had been the only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100189:91"/>
of their Divorce, and I was for some Time of the same Opinion; but being grown better acquainted with her, I perceiv'd there might other Reasons and very substantial ones, be given. She was the most fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Woman in the World; and I think that the ill Humour of a Wife is as insupportable as her want of Chastity; for tho' she does less expose her Husband in Publick, she is a greater Plague to him in private.</p>
            <p>She had a Daughter, who shar'd the same Fate with her; for they had made it their Bargain at parting, That the Father should provide for the Boys, and the Daughter should be left to her Mother's Care. She was certainly the worst Tutor that young Maid could have, not only because of her bad Repute, but also for the unaccountable Sentiments she had on her Daughter's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which till then it never had enter'd my Thoughts a Mother could have been guilty of. This Woman, who was, no doubt, well inform'd of the Aspersions that were cast upon her Honour, was jealous at the Praise her Daughter might have won, by not following her Example; and her greatest Care was to engage her into some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegue, which might expose her to a like Censure; but through another unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Nicety, she was desirous that her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might lye under the Scandal of Folly as
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100189:91"/>
well as Debauchery, and to that purpose was very diligent in keeping her from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ingenious Men, whose Conversation might be a Credit to her, and in admitting Blockheads.</p>
            <p>Such was this Gentlewoman's Humour, which I did not at first discover, thinking her encouraging the Addresses some Fools made to her Daughter might be grounded on the Opinion, That they are less danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than others.</p>
            <p>The young Lady was very lovely, had a brisk flashy Wit, but very little Judgment, and was of a very violent Temper, and a great Indulger of her Passions.</p>
            <p>I was at first wholly unacquainted with either of their Characters, and only visited them, as being agreeable Neighbours, whose Conversation might prove diverting; but I had not seen the Daughter twice, e're I fell deep in Love. She receiv'd my Declaration in such a manner as increas'd my Flame, and we presently grew as Intimate as if we had known each other all our Life-Time.</p>
            <p>She told me, I must not give any Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to her Mother; and that the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman should not suspect me, I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd the frequent Visits I made to her Daughter: First, That I did it, to increase her Knowledge, by giving her a Narration
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100189:92"/>
of my Travels, and then to make a Match between her and a Relation of mine, who was very rich, and was wholly guided by me. But this was just the Counter-part of what I should have done, for her Mother was unwilling she should have any Merit or be well match'd; and her only wish was, That she might be thought to want both Sense and Modesty.</p>
            <p>I soon found I was not welcome, and the most disobliging Methods in the World were us'd to make me understand it: But while I was so ill treated, all possible Favour was shewn to a Man who possessed, in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, all the ill Qualities requisite to render his Acquaintance scandalous on all accounts, and was therefore sovereignly accomplish'd for what the Mother design'd him.</p>
            <p>He was Five and Fifty, and had spent his Life under so universal a Contempt, that I never heard any one speak well of him. The only good Quality he was famous for, was, that he was a very peaceable and quiet Man, an Enemy to Quarrels, and willing to put up all manner of Affronts rather than draw his Sword, which had not hitherto seen the Light, tho' he was an Officer. Another va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Qualification was, That he was an eternal Visitant, where he once grew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, especially if it was a House of good Eating, and where it might be thought

he had some Intriegue, for he unwillingly parted with his Mony, and was very ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of being thought in Favour with the Ladies.</p>
            <p>Being an old Acquaintance of theirs, I wondred not at first to see him so assiduous; but the Daughter, who seem'd to repose an entire Confidence in me, inform'd me, That he was vehemently in Love with her. I, not in the least mistrusting, that one, I thought so deserving could ever stoop to have a Kindness for such a Fop, turn'd his Passion into ridicule, and only advised her to avoid being in private with him, lest she should thereby encourage the Vanity of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Ass.</p>
            <p>I question'd not but her own Inclination would have made her hearken to my Advice; but was soon soon acquainted with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that she was with him Day and Night, and that when the old Woman was gone to Bed they sate up together till Two or Three in the Morning. I tax'd her with it, which she deny'd in part, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what she did was only out of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance to her Mother. Then I found what Mettle the old Gentlewoman was made of, and by this and several other Passages easily guessed at the Character I have given of her. I imparted my Conjectures to her Daughter, whom I counsell'd, as well as I could, how
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100189:93"/>
she should behave her self under those griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Circumstances: But my Admonitions came too late; for the Freedom she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd with my old Rival, had so increas'd their Intimacy that I was clean forgotten. Use makes all things familiar, and an amor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Woman, like an hungry Clown, greedily devours all she meets in her Dish.</p>
            <p>Tho' I was vex'd beyond Measure to see how matters stood, I could not be heartily angry at my Mistress, and accus'd her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, but I soon understood she was as much to blame.</p>
            <p>Being insensibly fallen in Love with the old Officer, she was afraid I might represent to her Mother the ill Consequences of their frequent Meetings, and by that means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her of the Pleasure of seeing him, with the same freedom as formerly. To prevent this she resolv'd to complain first, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly told her Mother, That I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally persecuted her with Declarations of a Love she could not receive. I dare say my Affection for her did not so much displease her Mother, as the good Opinion that old Gentlewoman had of me, for she could not endure a Gentleman should court her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, desiring, as I have already said, she should appear ridiculous in the Choice of her Gallants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:100189:93"/>The Mother, thereupon, affronted me down-right, which I, not in the least su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting my Mistresses Treachery, attributed to her usual Fantasticalness. In the mean while she obtain'd her Ends, for the old Officer's too frequent Visits afforded matter for ev'ry one's Discourse. The Servants spoke very ill things, and, in short, it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd a very great Scandal.</p>
            <p>I found my Case very hard for a Man that lov'd Sincerely. Tho' I did not think her as base as the Town-Talk represented her, yet I could not wholly disbelieve what was said; however, out of an increedible Fondness, I everywhere took her part, and strove to efface a Report, which I knew was but too well grounded.</p>
            <p>It was impossible she should be ignorant of the Zeal I express'd for her; yet whether she was asham'd of her Perfidiousness, or that she fear'd a troublesome Advice, she did not design to follow, she shunn'd me with so much Care, that I never could speak with her.</p>
            <p>I knew not what to think of it, for I could never imagine that she should be in Love with so disagreeable a Person as my Rival; and, besides, I had not Courage enough to hate her, were it true. In the mean while, the Scandal increas'd, and it was whisper'd about she was with Child. The Proofs of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100189:94"/>
her Shame were but too convincing, and I found my self in a most intricate Dilemma, not knowing what to believe, and whether to love or hate her. At last, I thought it my best way to make no farther Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Matter, but by Absence to seek a Cure for my Folly. By this Motive was I induc'd to follow my Brother's Counsels; and, I may say, this Intriegue gave me more pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Griefs and more sensible Afflictions than I had till then received.</p>
            <p>In Obedience to my Brother's Commands, I attended the Prince, whom I found very chagreene, and much dissatisfied with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Loss of <hi>Monrond</hi> was a great Vexation to him, and taking me aside, he ask'd me what People said of him at <hi>Paris,</hi> and whether my Brother would not follow my Example? I answer'd, that both the Court and City were wholly devoted to him, especially my Brother, who as a Token of his Respect for him, had sent me to serve him. He ask'd me further, Whether my Brother design'd to stay? And how he could agree with the Cardinal. I reply'd, My Brother made his Court to the King only, and had nothing to do with that Minister in particular. <hi>Then write to him,</hi> said he, <hi>that I would have him be either White or Black, and that unless he can can be content to cringe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100189:94"/>
to the Cardinal it is his best way to come hither.</hi> I told him, I thought he was fix'd in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and that he would keep where he was. <hi>I see,</hi> reply'd the Prince, <hi>that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs for a Mareschal's Staff. Indeed he is in the Right, and were I in his Place I should not stop in so fair a Course; but a Prince is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in an unhappy Station.</hi> Thereupon he unbosom'd himself to me, and confess'd, That he was sorry for having engag'd into such a Business. I laid hold of this Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to persuade him to make his Peace with the King: But, he answer'd, it was too late, and that now the Dice were cast he must be content with his Chance. We had afterwards several other Conferences, and whether he repos'd more Trust in me than in the rest of those who were with him, or that having once unfolded his Secrets to me, it was become habitual to him, he made me the Confident of all the Mortifications he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and had each Day some new Discovery to impart to me, of the little Fidelity was to be expected from them. This occasion'd his giving me a Commission I thought very disagreeable, being rather desirous to be employ'd in the Army. The Prince, who ever since the Battle at <hi>Lens</hi> knew me to be a good Soldier; would of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self have been enclin'd to give me that Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but seeing nothing was acted in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100189:95"/>
               <hi>Flanders,</hi> without express Orders from the Council at <hi>Madrid,</hi> he thought it would not be amiss to send into <hi>Spain</hi> a Person he might trust to, who should manage his Affairs with <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> First Minister of that Court. He told me, He had at first pitch'd on the Abbot <hi>de</hi> —thinking I might have done him more Service, as an Officer, but that the Abbot was too rash and giddy, and, he fear'd, would spoil all; then he obligingly told me, My good Parts ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me more fit than any one to ingratiate my self with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers; that this Employment, which would not expose me to publick View, would be more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for me than bearing Arms against <hi>France,</hi> where my Brother might perhaps be the Object of their malitious Revenge; that seeing my Brother adher'd to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Party, he would, questionless, use his Endeavours to recal me, and that if my Mind alter'd, I might return with more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not having appear'd in the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
            <p>I yielded to these Reasons, and, besides, I found there was a good one he kept to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to wit, the Jealousie, which the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est I had in him, gave to those who had some Share in his Favour: So I acquainted the Prince, That I was ready to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100189:95"/>
and having received my Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, went for <hi>Madrid, incognito,</hi> as a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who made that Journey on his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Occasions; for the Prince had not thought fit to give me a Publick Character, thinking my Negotiations, by being more private, would be more secure, and kept my Departure so very secret, that none knew but himself what was become of me.</p>
            <p>I spent near Two Years in <hi>Madrid,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing him any other Piece of service than representing the Wrongs he receiv'd from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and answering the Complaints which they made against him; for, as one might judge from their Letters, they never could agree: And I discover'd better there than the Prince could do in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> how wretched a Rebel's Condition is, who is forc'd to depend upon Strangers. They found him too extravagant in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and too slow in his Progresses, for they would have had him conquer all <hi>France</hi> in a Quarter of a Year's Time, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to a Farthing Expence. 'Tis true, they did all possible Justice to his Merit, but still the Mony was wanting, and some thought <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> was of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and had been brib'd by the Queen-Mother, to leave the Prince destitute both of Men and Mony.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100189:96"/>
Whatever the Reason might be, all my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances prevail'd little, and only procur'd him unperform'd Promises and empty Praise,</p>
            <p>Having then but little to do, during the Two Years I remain'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> it was no wonder if I spent some part of my Time in Gallantry, especially in a Country so fruitful in Adventures and Intriegues; and there I obtain'd a farther Insight into the Female Sex's Character, which I have made it my Business in these Memoirs to describe.</p>
            <p>I lodged at a <hi>Frenchman</hi>'s House, who by his Pride and Self-Conceit might have been taken for a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but there is little Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Natives of <hi>Gascony,</hi> at least I found it so by him. He bragg'd much of his Quality, but still did not disdain Trade, Pictures and Pieces of Tapestry.</p>
            <p>Here, tho' it is not much to our Purpose, I cannot forbear relating the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he bought some of them, which will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps seem odd and unlikely, but is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing very true.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whom he dealt with, carry'd him one Day into the King's Palace, and having led him into the finest Apartment, where they took a View of the Pictures and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100189:96"/>
Tapestry, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ask'd him, What he lik'd best of all the Furniture? and the other having told him, He fancy'd a certain Picture and Piece of Hangings he shew'd him; <hi>Well,</hi> quoth my <hi>Spaniard, and what will you give me, if I procure them?</hi> The <hi>Frenchman,</hi> not thinking they were at his disposal, took this as a Jest; but his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion having assur'd him he was in earnest, and that this was not the first Time he had sold the King's Goods, they made a Bargain, and accordingly the Picture was sent, having been cut out of its Frame, and some Days after the Tapestry, which the Receiver spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily convey'd to <hi>Bayonne.</hi> Himself told me this Story, saying; It was a very usual thing at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where they would in that manner sell the Goods of most of the Palaces, having first agreed of the Price before they stole them.</p>
            <p>I did not much like the Company of a Man, who was capable of countenancing such a Villany; but I meddled not with his Concerns, nor he with mine, and all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse we had together was only concerning the Intriegues of the Town.</p>
            <p>The first I had at <hi>Madrid</hi> was with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose Husband was a great Favourite of <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi>'s. My Employment occasion'd an Intimacy between us, for it was often through his means that I obtain'd
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100189:97"/>
Audience from his Patron. I never had seen his Lady, nor so much as heard that he was marry'd, till one Day that she spoke to me, in a Church where we chanc'd to meet. I found she knew me, and was willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove an Acquaintance, which her Youth and Beauty made me but too desirous of. These Desires I expressed to her, to which she answer'd, If I was sincere, the Week should not be at an End before I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Frenchman,</hi> at whose House I lodg'd, was then at the same Church, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of our Conversation, tho' it had been but very short: We were no sooner at home but he ask'd me whether I knew that Lady, and had seen her before? I ask'd him the Reason of his Question. <hi>'Tis, reply'd he, of some small concern to me, having been her Gallant for above this half Year; and, when you please I will shew you some Twenty Letters of hers I have by me.</hi> Then he told me, That he was scarce arriv'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> when he first contracted a Familiarity with her, having had an Opportunity at a Publick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment the King had given, and that ever since he met her thrice a Week, at a certain Place, where he offer'd to carry me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:100189:97"/>I was not a little nettl'd at his Discourse, being vex'd to see that a Lady, whom I had a Kindness for, should be already ingag'd; and what was worse, that so undeserving a Man (for indeed his Merit was but small) should have the preference before me. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I conceal'd my Thoughts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Curiosity, desir'd to see some of those Letters, which he promis'd me: But he delay'd me Two Days, and then shew'd me Six or Seven anonimous Billets, which he assur'd me, came from her, and all express'd a great Passion, and very little Wit.</p>
            <p>This gave me such ill Thoughts of the Lady that I resolv'd never to think of her more; but having some Business with her Husband, I went to his House, where I was inform'd he was out of Town, and one of her Servants whisper'd me, That his Lady desir'd to speak with me. I could not tell at first what I had best to do: However, the Desire of knowing what she had to say, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, and I went up to her, with a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to tax her Baseness.</p>
            <p>I did, and she protested it was all false; vowing she knew no <hi>Frenchman</hi> but my self, and that no Man could ever boast of having receiv'd a Love-Letter from her. The Confidence with which she spoke to me, made me begin to suspect my Landlord, upon which I told the Lady, That I
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100189:98"/>
would produce some of them, by which she reply'd, I should oblige her; then I left her possess'd with a Passion which nothing but a Confirmation of her Infamy could extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish.</p>
            <p>I took no Notice to my Landlord that I had visited the Lady, but pretending I had found the Letters very ingenious, I desir'd him to let me see them once more; and he accordingly drew one out of his Pocket, he said he had but just receiv'd, which I read and put into mine, and he did not seem over-earnest to have it again.</p>
            <p>Then I presently waited on the Lady, whom I found ready to send me one, which, she told me, she had wrote, that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Characters I might be convinc'd of her Innocence. I was, and it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd that this was all a Contrivance of his, whether out of a Vain Glory of being thought to have had a good Fortune, or a Desire to perplex me, for he never had so much as spoke to her.</p>
            <p>Nothing could then have hindred my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seriously in Love with her, but the od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Fancy, I think, any Woman could ever have. The scandalous Story he had made of her must naturally have have procur'd him her Scorn and Aversion. But how strange are a Woman's Appetites! His Lyes had a quite contrary effect, and she desir'd
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100189:98"/>
me to bring him to her, saying, It was with a Design to be reveng'd on him, for having abus'd her thus; but it seems that Man had unawares gain'd her Favour, and indeed at the very first Sight they became very good Friends.</p>
            <p>Let the most accurate Moralists tell me now, What could be the Motive of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charm'd with that which would have made him Contemptible in any other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Eyes? As for me, I can assign none, but the flattering Thoughts, that since he had pretended himself one of her Adorers, he must needs think her adorable: Perhaps too, did she find the Letters just such as she would have sent, and could not help admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man who had so good a Guess.</p>
            <p>Whatever the Reason might be, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd their Acquaintance, and my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord might since have shewn me as many true Letters as he had done fictitious ones, but he grew discreet when his Intriegue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came real. I should have disputed him the Conquest of a Heart he had so bad a Title to, had I not then met with a Lady whom I thought more worth my Care.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> was still at <hi>Madrid,</hi> having the City for a Prison. I waited on him, and gave him an account of what I had suffer'd at <hi>Naples</hi> for his Service, as also
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100189:99"/>
of his Mistress's Treachery, except that part of it wherein I was concern'd. He said, He was sorry he should have occasion'd me all that Trouble, and to make me some Amends, he would introduce me to a Lady who, he was sure, would not receive me ill, and was worth my Acquaintance, being as considerable for her Quality and Fortune as for her great Beauty.</p>
            <p>This was a strong Temptation, and being of my self very frail, I was easily won to make an Appointment, according to which he carry'd me Two Days after, into a House, where he promis'd me I should see her. From the Freedom with which the Duke enter'd, I judg'd he was no Stranger there: It was then about Five in the Evening, and not so dark but I perceiv'd the Furniture was extraordinary rich, which confirm'd part of what the Duke had said, and I began to have a strange Passion for the unknown Lady.</p>
            <p>I was left alone in a Closet, till very late at Night, while the Duke was gone, as he told me, to acquaint the Lady with my being there. I had all the Reason in the World to imagine that she was one of his Mistresses, and that being weary of her, he had a mind to make her over to me; yet my Weakness was such that I wav'd these Reflexions, to dwell on the Thoughts of my future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100189:99"/>
But how great was my Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Lady coming into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, I saw it was the same from whom I had receiv'd so ill Treatment at <hi>Naples.</hi> The Duke usher'd her in, and told me, smiling, That she came to expiate her former Faults. I was possess'd with Anger and Indignation at the unexpected Sight, but the Duke's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence commanding my Respect, I put a good Face on the Matter, and seeing they both laugh'd heartily, I laugh'd too for Company, tho' I had little mind to it.</p>
            <p>I could not imagine whether his Design in surprizing me, was only to make himself Sport, or to reconcile me to the Lady; but whatever his Intention might be, I thought I had Reason to be offended at it; and out of Revenge resolv'd once more to be his Rival. There indeed my Passion prov'd stronger than my Honour, which would have led me rather to abhor than court so perfidious a Woman. Besides, what Madness was it in me to think of depriving him of a Mistress, in whose Favour he seem'd to be, and who having left her Native Country, was come as far as <hi>Spain</hi> to enjoy his Conversation. But I ventur'd through all, and, before I left her, whisper'd in her Ear, that I ador'd her more than ever, and was a dead Man if she did not answer my Love. She squeezed my Hand at these Words, which gave me
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100189:100"/>
Hopes I labour'd not in vain. The very next Day she sent for me, and her Beauty and Conversation made me feel in earnest a Flame I design'd but to pretend.</p>
            <p>She at first begg'd my Pardon for what had pass'd at <hi>Naples,</hi> alledging several bad Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which being varnished over with a few Tears, I readily accepted. Then the Duke was the next Theme we went upon, and she made great Complaints of him, telling me, That tho' she had come so far from Home for his sake, and had made him very rich Presents, he car'd little for her, and was in Love with one of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Mistresses.</p>
            <p>It will easily be thought that I did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to clear him, but made use of his Falshood as an Argument to persuade her to pay him in his kind. But she told me, That she would bear with it a little longer, and that the Duke's Departure being so near, she would not fall out with him now, but would manage him so, that I should have no cause to be jealous. I took all this for Current Coyn, and left her as full of Love as if she had been the chastest Woman in the World; but it was all a Plot she and the Duke had contrived, to make Sport with me, as will appear by the sequel of the Story.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:100189:100"/>I had already heard that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was a very amorous Prince, and his Intrigues were so many that all <hi>Madrid</hi> talk'd of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else. I was also inform'd that he kept a Strange Lady, whom he us'd to meet at the Count <hi>de</hi>—, and that to that Amour the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> owed his Liberty. The Duke himself had also often mention'd her, in my Hearing, but without naming her, and I durst not ask him who she was. But the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> with whom I liv'd, who was a very inquisitive busie Fellow, said, He was acquainted at the House where the King us'd to visit his Mistress, whither, if I pleas'd, he would carry me, to see his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, as he was going to her. I accepted of the Proposal, and we hid our selves in a dark Passage, through which the King was to come, whom presently after we saw in a Civilian's Habit; which so disguis'd him, that had I not been told beforehand it was himself, I should never have known him. He tarry'd there but half an Hour; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was retir'd, we were going down Stairs, when a Servant bid us make Room, and looking up I saw the Lady, to whom my Companion said the Visit had been made. Her Face was cover'd with a Veil, and pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by me, she pull'd me by the Sleeve, and told me in <hi>Italian,</hi> she would gladly meet me in another Place, and walk'd by so
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100189:101"/>
fast that I had not the leisure to reply.</p>
            <p>I did not doubt but she was taken with my Phiz; and flatter'd with the Thoughts that she should fancy me above a Monarch, my next Care was to find out who she was, and how I might speak with her.</p>
            <p>I thought no Body could inform me better than the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lady, who had made me believe she was her Rival, and therefore waited on her, and ask'd her, Which of the King's Mistresses it was the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> had an Inclination for? She smil'd at my Question, and desir'd to know why I ask'd it. I reply'd it was only out of Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity; upon which she often renew'd her Enquiry, and having still return'd the same Answer; <hi>Come,</hi> said she, <hi>you do not deal ingenuously with me, I am better acquainted with your Thoughts than you imagine; the Lady whose Acquaintance you so much long for is the best Friend I have; I know that she loves, and has spoken to you, but if you are wise you will let her alone, and I dare hope, that as things stand between us, you would not be false to me.</hi> I at first deny'd she had ever spoke to me, but hearing her repeat the very Words, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Truth, promising I would not think of her any more.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> also told me of it, seeming as well inform'd as his Mistress, and advised me to improve the Opportunity, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100189:101"/>
me that he would not traverse my Designs, but, since he must shortly leave <hi>Spain,</hi> would freely resign her. I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but too great an Inclination to follow the Duke's Counsel, but fearing to discover it to my Rival, I seem'd to believe he rally'd, and did not express any Desire of knowing her, fearing he would have told the <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> Lady of it, whose Favour I was not willing to lose. So I remain'd in my Ignorance, and by the Chimera's I fram'd to my self of my Fair unknown, was depriv'd of the Sweets I might have enjoy'd with my known Mistress, whose Charms I thought much inferior to hers.</p>
            <p>I never knew till then how fantastical a Passion Love is; for tho' I had never seen her Face, I doted on her more than I yet had done on any Woman I ever courted, and my Desire was so much the fiercer, because I knew not what it was I wish'd for. My own Experience convinc'd me then, That your Knight Errants running up and down the World after invisible Ladies, is not the most unlikely Part of Romances, since I my self little differ'd from those fabulous Heroes, being wholly taken up with a Lady whose Charms I was wholly a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:100189:102"/>To make this a true Romantick Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the unknown Object of my Wishes sent me some Letters, by which she promis'd in a short Time to rid me of my Doubts, and admonish'd me in the mean while to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main constant and discreet. It was very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for me to obey her, for whenever I had receiv'd a <hi>Billet Doux,</hi> my Mistress told me of it, and seem'd not to be ignorant of the Contents. I remain'd a quarter of a Year in this uncertainty, when at last a Note was deliver'd to me, to let me know that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now design'd to disclose her self, and that she would be that Day at the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lady's.</p>
            <p>Tho' I was heartily vexed at her chusing that House for our Interview, yet I was punctual to a Minute, and then understood, that the King's Mistress, who had spoken to me, was no other Person than my old Acquaintance. Having left <hi>Naples</hi> to follow the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> she no sooner appear'd at Court but the King fell deep in Love with her; the Duke <hi>de Guise,</hi> who was not over-nice in that Point, had promoted their Amour, and the Service he had done his Majesty therein, was recompensed with his Liberty.</p>
            <p>I was asham'd to own my self deceived, but pretended I had discover'd the Design long ago, and only conniv'd at it, to see
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100189:102"/>
how far they would carry on the Jest. But tho' the Lady had believ'd me, the Increase of my Fondness would have undeceiv'd her; for adding to the Charms she really possess'd, those I had attributed to my unknown Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, I grew more passionate than ever I had been. This shews that Love must still have Fancy to support it, and is at the same Time a Proof, that our Hearts are strangely deluded, when once they yield themselves up to it.</p>
            <p>I began to adore my <hi>Neapolitan</hi> afresh, as if I had never courted her before; and the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi>'s sudden Departure deliver'd me from a dangerous Rival. I was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at the Indifferency with which they parted. The Joy of returning to his native Country drown'd the Grief he should have felt at leaving a Woman, who had given him such Demonstrations of her Love; and she, on the other hand, was not sorry for the Loss of him, being wholly taken up with the Glory of the illustrious Conquest she had made. But what I most wonder'd at, was to see how unconcernedly they talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Separation; for the Duke plainly told her, That being oblig'd to quit her, he could not yield up his Pretences to a more worthy Person than my self, who had besides an unquestionable Title to her Affection, from what I had suffer'd for her sake, which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100189:103"/>
she heard with a Temper I never thought Parting Lovers could have been Masters of. It is, no doubt, a great Felicity to enjoy such a Tranquillity of Mind: But my Sincerity has always rendred my Amours unfortunate, and I should certainly have been happy, had I lived in those blessed Times, when in Love there was more Truth and less Artifice.</p>
            <p>The little good Nature she expressed in that Occasion, joyn'd to the Memory of my having been so often choused by her, should certainly have cur'd me of my Dotage; but, on the other Hand, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Women live very much retir'd, and I had a free Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to her; besides, I was very idle at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> and wanted Occupation: But, as for the great Leisure I had, she soon procured me Employment, by the Troubles she brought me into.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> was scarce gone, when she began to Grieve for his Absence. While this Humour lasted I never had a good Word from her, for she accus'd me as the Cause of his going, and of her Consenting to it.</p>
            <p>When I saw this, I began to be angry too, and made the Intriegue she had with the King, a Pretext to my Displeasure, saying, I would have all her Heart or none. So we were continually quarrelling for Three Weeks together, after which she became more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100189:103"/>
and gave over speaking of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Duke, as I also did teazing her about the King.</p>
            <p>But this Truce lasted not long, for visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her one Evening, I found her in a great Fury, and having enquir'd into the Reason, she reply'd, She was jealous at one of her Rivals, whom the King affected better than her self. It was a Surprize to me to see this Fit on her, for she had hitherto seem'd very well contented on that account; so I ask'd her, What new Accident had happened? she told me, She had no fresh Reason to hate her, but that, upon several Considerations, she had concluded it was a Shame to her to have but a Share in the King's Favor. Tho this Scruple came, me thoughts, a little too late, I would not let slip so fair an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of persuading her not to settle her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection on a Prince who was so general a Lover, since she was rich enough not to need his Assistance. She did not relish this Doctrin, but told me, That, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, she would use her utmost Endeavours to drive her from a Post she could suffer no Body in but her self, and to grow the sole Possessor of his Heart; upon which I represented to her, that it was impossible, seeing he was of so fickle a Temper, that he each Day added a new Mistress to the many old ones he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: But was answer'd, That she would
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100189:104"/>
not desist, and that I must help her in it too.</p>
            <p>I was willing to know how I could assist her in her Design? She told me, I must court her Rival; that she would make the King take notice of it, who would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less grow jealous, and that her Plot was so contriv'd that her Antagonist must bear alone the Weight of the King's Anger, and I should receive no Damage. I did not like her Proposal, and answer'd, I durst not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon it; to which she reply'd angrily, That if I did not, she would acquaint the King with my Love to her self, and undo me that way.</p>
            <p>I was extreamly perplexed, not knowing which to do; but at last I chose to comply with her, thinking that would be the safest, because it required more Time, during which her Mind might alter, whereas by denyal I expos'd my self to suddain Ruin. So I told her, I was ready to obey, if she would but put me in the Way. She answered, That was not Difficult, and she would bring me acquainted with her Enemy, who often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited her.</p>
            <p>She was as good as her Word, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was executed as she had laid it, only I did not pretend Courtship to her Rival, but fell in Love with her in good earnest. Here the Reader will give me leave to call <hi>Eleonor,</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:100189:104"/>
who was a young Maid, between Eighteen and Twenty; she could not boast of her Quality, having been brought to Court du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Rebellion in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> by a Lady, whose Husband being Governour of that Province, had been murther'd by the Rebels. But what she wanted that way was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd by an incomparable Beauty, the best Nature in the World and the strictest Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which had won the King's Esteem, who had a real Passion for no other but her, he only knew her to be chaste, for every Body else thought nothing could be refus'd a Monarch.</p>
            <p>Being the most beautiful of the King's Mistresses, she was therefore the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Neapolitan Lady</hi>'s Jealousie; and one Day, as she reproach'd the King with his Kindness for <hi>Eleonor,</hi> he confess'd to her, That he never could obtain the least Favour from her, and that he began to be tir'd with Fruitless Endeavours. This it was that put her so out of Humor, and fearing her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty might gain her his Respect, she resolv'd to ruin her, by making him believe she was chaste only to him: For that is the Way of such Women, to cry down and hate those whose Vertues make their Vices more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:100189:105"/>I was charm'd with her Beauty, at the first Sight, and being weary of my Mistresses insupportable Humors, my Heart readily embrac'd a Change. I declar'd my Love to <hi>Eleonor,</hi> who answer'd, That if I were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere she would return it. Then we appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Meeting in the same Place the next day, when the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Lady, whose Interest it was to promote our Amour, made some Excuse and withdrew. <hi>Eleonor,</hi> seeing we were alone, unbosom'd her self to me, and having protested that she never had granted the King any Favour Modesty would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, assur'd me she would behave her self in the same manner to any Man who should court her, unless it were with a Design to marry.</p>
            <p>These Principles increas'd my Passion, and I answer'd, That I could wish my self wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that Honour, but must own to her my Estate in <hi>France</hi> was but small, and what I had in <hi>Poland</hi> belong'd to my Children, so that my being her Husband would prove her Ruin. She reply'd, Riches was not what she desir'd, and that she could be content with Necessaries. I told her, She must have more aspiring Thoughts, and that all I could do for her Service was, to advise her to match her self to Advantage. She said, It was only with that Design she had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the King's Addresses, tho' she knew
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100189:105"/>
her Reputation suffer'd by it, but being Friendless, and being not conscious of any Guilt she had committed, she hop'd Heaven would forgive, and not forsake her.</p>
            <p>This made me call my <hi>Carmelite</hi> to mind, and I found their Sentiments so conformable, that I wept at the sad Remembrance of that unfortunate Amour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleonor</hi> was surpriz'd at it, and having ask'd the Reason, I told her, It was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of Esteem I had for her, and the Trouble I was in, to see my self uncapable of possessing so Generous and Vertuous a Wife. This Reply pleas'd her, and she told me, That since I was willing to counsel her, she would accept my Offer, provided I would advise her how she should obtain of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he would make her rich enough to espouse me, without being a Charge to me; <hi>For,</hi> said she, <hi>I must confess I fancy you more than any Man I know; I have a great Desire to live in</hi> France, <hi>and wish for no greater Satisfaction than to spend my Life there with you.</hi> I answer'd, I saw little like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of our being marry'd; which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated so often, that she was offended at it. <hi>Do not think,</hi> said she, <hi>my being so willing to have you proceeds from a want of Lovers, I might find enough who would not deny me, and one, among the rest, whose Quality would dazle the Eyes of any one but my self.</hi> Then she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100189:106"/>
me, That the eldest Son to the Duke <hi>de</hi>—laid close Siege to her, and, had she consented, would have stole her, but that she had still refus'd it.</p>
            <p>By the concern I was in at hearing this, I found I had but too great an Inclination for her; yet I was Master of my self to that degree, as to tell her, That such an Offer was not to be slighted, and that I would use my Endeavours to promote the Match.</p>
            <p>There, I think, this Visit and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ended; and the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lady having ask'd me, How Matters went? I reply'd; there was nothing to be done with her. This increas'd her Rage, and confirmed her in the Resolution she had taken to undo her; to which end she went, and told the King, That Maid, who was so proud to him, could stoop to other People, and that I boasted of some Favours I had obtain'd from her.</p>
            <p>The King, who had a real Esteem for <hi>Eleonor,</hi> inform'd her of what he had heard, and she, believing I had done her that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, vow'd it was all false, and begg'd his Majesty to avenge her; which he promis'd. Not thinking she had done enough, she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Lover, she had told me of, against me: Who promis'd he would make me recant, or would cut out my Tongue. I, the while, did not in the least suspect my Danger, and was fill'd with Love and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100189:106"/>
for a Lady, who was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving my Ruin.</p>
            <p>One Night, as I was retiring homewards, I was set upon by Six Men, who, having struck up my Heels, bound me, and carry'd me into a House; where the first Person I saw was <hi>Eleonor,</hi> who coming to me in an unexpressible Rage, bid me, Repair her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or expect to be hewn in pieces. Upon that, in came the Duke <hi>de</hi>—'s Son, with a Dagger in his Hand, who seemed unwilling to hear me speak, and desirous to have dispatch'd me immediately. All I could do in the Danger I was in, was to cast a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Eye upon <hi>Eleonor</hi>; and I know not whether my Looks mov'd her Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but holding my Adversary's Arm; <hi>Speak then, Wretch,</hi> said she, <hi>How have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd that Slander from you?</hi> This brought me to my self again, and judging some Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy must have misrepresented me to her, I began not to be so much afraid, but looking tenderly on her; <hi>Who I, Madam!</hi> answer'd I, <hi>that I should have injur'd your Reputation! For Heaven's sake forbear such Thoughts. All the Crime I am conscious of, is having a greater Esteem for you than some People will, perhaps, allow; and having been too free in speaking your Praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:100189:107"/>I spok these Words with such an honest Assurance as inclin'd <hi>Eleonor</hi> to believe me. But I forgot I was in his presence who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to marry her, and I continued my Discourse with so much Passion, that by clearing my self in the Lady's Opinion, I grew guilty in that of her Lover, who would still be interrupting me, saying; I must dye. She answered, It was fit I should be heard, and acquainted me with what the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lady had told the King; and I vowed to her, That it was an Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her own, occasion'd by her Malice and Jealousie. This undeceived her quite, and being asked by her; Whether I would maintain what I said before the King? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, I would stand to my Words, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Majesty's Presence, but before all the the World.</p>
            <p>All this confirm'd her Lover's Suspicion, who looking spitefully on her, <hi>What then, Madam,</hi> said he, <hi>you have sent for this Man hither, only to let me know that he is my happy Rival? Why,</hi> reply'd she, <hi>do you not see he is besides himself, and that he caresses me only in Hopes I would save his Life?</hi> I perceived not my Imprudence, and reflecting only on the Affront was given me, in saying, I was afraid of Death, <hi>No, no,</hi> answered I, <hi>I am not afraid of dying; I know what I say, and were I unbound,</hi> addressing my self to my
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100189:107"/>
Rival, <hi>we should soon see which of us had the better Heart.</hi> At these Words the Coward ran at me, to stabbed me, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have done it, had not the generous <hi>Eleonor</hi> stopp'd him, and plac'd her self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> seeing she took my Part, went away threatning her, and carry'd with him those who had seiz'd me. She did what she could to call him back, but in vain, and so we were left alone. Then she unty'd me, and blam'd me very much for having declar'd my Love in so unfit a Season.</p>
            <p>I comforted her as well as I could, and desir'd her to excuse my Error, since the Vexation I was in, to think she should have thought me guilty of so great a Baseness, had quite distracted me. I promis'd her I would let the King know the whole Truth, and would revenge her Quarrel with the <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> Lady. But she said, We must let that alone for the present, and only think of Means to sacrifice her Suitor. I assur'd her, I would obey all her Commands: The first of which, she told me, should be, Not to see her any more. It was indeed the hardest she could have laid upon me, yet I submitted to it, promising to observe her Orders, tho with the Forfeit of my Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:100189:108"/>In the mean while, the Duke <hi>de</hi>—'s Son had quitted her in such a Passion (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she had not suffer'd him to stab me) that he gave out, He had undeniable Proofs that what I had bragg'd was true. The King came to hear of it, and this having confirm'd my <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Mistress's Slander, he easily believ'd her guilty. So she was every where defam'd, and I became the innocent Cause of the Wrong she suffer'd. I was sore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at it, and tho' I had promised never to see her more, yet I made several vain At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to do it, designing, if I could, to have offer'd my Service to her, in vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Honour, or taking Vengeance of her Enemies.</p>
            <p>The King being fully persuaded I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd her, thought, that having had that Weakness she was not impossible to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and redoubled his Applications to her. Thus it is that a vicious Love is increas'd by that which would extinguish an honourable Flame. Whether his Majesty prevailed or not I cannot tell, but she was marry'd a Fortnight or Three Weeks after, to a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Lord, and the Wedding was scarce over, when the King gave him the Government of <hi>M</hi>—, ordering him to his Post, while his Lady remain'd at Court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:100189:108"/>I had then broke off with my <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Mistress, and vowed never to see her more; but she us'd such means to entice me back again, that I was once more wrought upon, and renew'd my old Acquaintance with her.</p>
            <p>The King having of late been very cold to her, she told me, She was resolv'd to refuse his Pension, and return to <hi>Naples.</hi> The first of these I confirmed her in, but dissuaded her from the last; for I could not quit <hi>Madrid,</hi> and fear'd that she being gone I should want an Amusement, and it was impossible to me to live without an Amour, so great is a Man's Misfortune who has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted these ill Habits, which I would advise every one to avoid, who has any Respect for his Ease and Quiet.</p>
            <p>She yielded to stay at <hi>Madrid,</hi> but I soon repented my being the occasion of it: For she renew'd her Jealousies against <hi>Eleonor,</hi> and told me, I must lend a helping Hand to her undoing. It was in vain that I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to her, How Odious and Unjust was her Design. The more I would persuade her, the more obstinate she grew, so we fell out again, for I would never comply with her Desires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:100189:109"/>Seeing I had left her, she found means to charm the young Lord, who would have kill'd me. His Love to his former Mistress turn'd to an implacable Hatred, upon her preventing his murthering me, which was improv'd, by her being marry'd, and the Complacency she had for the King, all which rendred him the fittest Person in the World, to promote the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lady's Designs.</p>
            <p>Being both of a mean Spirit and cruel Temper, they resolv'd on no less than stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing her. I was inform'd of this by one of her Servants, who having been the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of our former Amours, had still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Kindness for me, and thought it my Duty to oppose it; first, because I stood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for my life to her, then on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Esteem I still retain'd for that generous Lady: And besides, I was of my self enough a Gentleman, to have hazarded my Person for the Prevention of an ill Design, had I been led to it, by neither of the foremention'd Motives.</p>
            <p>The first thing I did in order to it, was to acquaint <hi>Eleonor</hi> with the Plot, and to counsel her to give the King immediate No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. She did, but having own'd to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty whence she had it, he fancy'd I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd visiting her, and this Jealousie made
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100189:109"/>
him believe I had done it only to make her value me the more, and therefore gave no great heed to the Advice. However, he spoke of it to the Duke <hi>de</hi>—, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told his Son, I had discover'd his Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; that young Lord assur'd him, it was a groundless Imagination, adding, He hop'd, he had not so ill an Opinion of him, as to think he could be guilty of so base an Action as murthering a Woman.</p>
            <p>Thus my Honesty had no other Reward than Hatred on all Hands; the one believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me guilty of Slander, and the others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, through my Death, to make a Way to that of <hi>Eleonor.</hi> She sent me a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to bid me take Care of my self, because his Majesty had given Orders to have me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, but I conceal'd my self so well, that I avoided both those who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to seize me, and those who watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take away my Life.</p>
            <p>Any one but my self would have made his Escape, but being persuaded I was the only Person that could prevent the intended Assassination; the Desire of preserving a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I lov'd, prevail'd more with me than the Care of my own Safety. I remain'd at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> having caus'd a Report that I was fled; so the Duke <hi>de</hi>—'s Son and his Mistress, seeing no body stood in their Way, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100189:110"/>
afresh on the Execution of their Project.</p>
            <p>It will, perhaps be wondred at, that they should be so strongly bent on it, since the Advices I had given, must needs have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd them to be the Authors, had it succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but their Passion so blinded them, that they did not foresee their Danger.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, I was depriv'd of the means to avert the Fatal Blow, for not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be seen, I could not hear from the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lady's Servant. I thought at last of disguising my self like an <hi>Algerine</hi>-Slave, and accordingly put on a false Beard, and black'd my Face, which, with my Cloaths, so alter'd my Countenance, that I scarce knew my self again. In that Dress I went to <hi>Eleonor,</hi> to whom I said, I could not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don her in the Peril she was in; that I desir'd her never to go abroad without good Company, and to conceal me in her House, for I knew her Life was aim'd at, and would either save her or dye in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. She did not doubt but her Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was real, and pretended her self ill, to have a Pretext for staying at Home; she also told her Servants that I was a Slave, who had brought her a Message from her Husband; and before a Week
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100189:110"/>
was over she felt the good Effect of her Precaution.</p>
            <p>Some arm'd Men, in the Evening, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted her Servants, and pursu'd them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very Doors, of which having made themselves Masters, they soon were so of the whole House. The first thing they did, was to come up to the Room where she lay; and I alone oppos'd their Violence, which I did with so much Vigour, that the rest of the Family, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated thereby, seconded me, and after a sharp Dispute, in which Two of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains were killed, the rest run away. We made after them into the Street, where the first I met was the Duke <hi>de</hi>—'s Son, who waited for his Companions, being himself their Leader in this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Enterprize. At that Sight, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I was no longer my own Master, but with one Blow of my Cymeter laid him down at my Feet. The Watch hearing the Noise, came immediately to us, and taking me and one of the Lady's Servants, carry'd us to Prison. We were presently examin'd, and I had the good Fortune not to be known. All the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses justified what I had done, and I was set at Liberty, to the great Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Duke <hi>de</hi>—who was desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100189:111"/>
to revenge his Son's Death; but he was advis'd not to make the Story pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which was so Injurious to his Son's Memory. I the while had the Pleasure to hear those blam'd who had neglected my Advice, and my self pity'd, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been forc'd to fly, for being too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. As for the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lady, she had disappear'd as soon as she heard her Lover was kill'd, and was, I suppose, return'd to <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Algerine</hi>-Slave's Bravery was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Town-Talk, and I was taken no more Notice of than if I had been in <hi>France,</hi> where every Body thought me to be, so well was I disguis'd. <hi>Eleonor,</hi> who alone knew me, could not tell how to express her Gratitude. She forc'd me to accept of a Golden Cabinet, wherein she had put a great Quantity of Gold and Jewels, which amounted to a considerable Sum, and not content therewith, she said, She would acquaint the King with it, that he might Recompence me according to my Deserts; but I bid her have a Care what she did, since that Prince would certainly be extream jealous, should he hear what I had done for her, and thus she would ruin me, by endeavouring to do me Service. She took my Advice,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100189:111"/>
and hearing me talk of returning to <hi>France,</hi> she conjur'd me not to leave her, alledging, That the Danger was over, and that I might now, without any Hazard leave off my Disguise, and appear as I had done before. I comply'd with her, only desiring she would permit me sometimes to put it on, that I might with more Safety wait on her, to which she readily consented, my important Services having procur'd me her Love. So I remain'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> under Two different Shapes, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd me to several new Adventures.</p>

            <p>THE Recital of my Adventures may have given more than one Instance, that Men sometimes really have as strange ones, as the most fantastical Authors can have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: But this has not as yet appear'd so visibly, as it will do in the sequel of my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100189:113"/>
especially in the Accidents that befel me, while at <hi>Madrid,</hi> I play'd the double part, of a Gentleman and an <hi>Algerine</hi>-Slave. The Reader will, no doubt, be apt to take it all for an agreeable Fiction, but having promis'd to give him a sincere Relation of all my Amours, I must write as well those which do not exceed his Belief, as those which may seem less probable, and I must beg of him to give an equal Faith to all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all equally true.</p>
            <p>Being resolv'd, or rather forc'd, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at <hi>Madrid,</hi> because I had not yet acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my self of the Prince's Commission, the Business about the Duke <hi>de</hi>—'s Son was no sooner ended, but I appear'd in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and having obtain'd Audience from <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> and then from the King himself, I told his Majesty I had been forc'd to abscond, to avoid the dangerous Effects of his Anger, at the Advices I had formerly given. The King made me a very good Reception, and, out of a pretended Kindness, counsell'd me not to have any thing more to do with <hi>Eleonor,</hi> whose Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance had involv'd me into so many Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; <hi>Besides,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>the Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Woman will soon or late prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, her Husband, tho absent, being extream jealous of her.</hi> I knew well enough whence proceeded the King's Care of my Safety, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100189:113"/>
assur'd his Majesty, I would never see her any more; I meant, while I remain'd in that Dress.</p>
            <p>I appear'd all Day in <hi>French</hi> Habit, and and sometimes at Night put on my <hi>Algerine</hi> Disguise when I would see <hi>Eleonor.</hi> That lasted some time, but the King hearing of it grew jealous, and told her, he wondred the Slave should tarry so long at <hi>Madrid,</hi> since his Liberty had been the first Reward he had receiv'd. She said, the occasion of his Stay was a little Traffick he made with the Mony her Gratitude had induc'd her to give him. The King resolv'd to be rid of his suppos'd Rival, told her, He would send her Two thousand Ducats more, to present him with, and that he desir'd her to send him away. The next Time, I saw her, she gave me the Two thousand Ducats, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with what the King had said, begg'd me not to visit her, nor put on my <hi>Algerine</hi> Habit any more, which I promis'd, and she made the King believe the Slave was gone.</p>
            <p>Indeed it was with no little Sorrow, that I saw my self wholly depriv'd of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. She shar'd in my Grief; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, since I still remain'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> we were comforted with the Hopes of another Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But she made me swear, That as long as the King should forbid it, I would not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100189:114"/>
bring her into Trouble, by endeavouring to speak with her.</p>
            <p>Thus did I again relapse into an Idleness, which had been the occasion of all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Engagements, but soon found fresh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in a new Amour. I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted some Familiarity with a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whose Quality I shall conceal, and call him <hi>Don Anthonio Manrique,</hi> that these Memoirs, meerly design'd for the Publick Good, may not give Offence to any one. He was willing I should see his Wife, whom we shall name <hi>Dona Isabella,</hi> and frequently convers'd with her, but never in Private, her Husband or some Servant being always present. Among other things, she talk'd much of the <hi>Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> Slave, saying, She had seen him once, and that his Air and Presence, as well as the glorious Action he had done, shew'd him to be no mean Person.</p>
            <p>I imagin'd by this, that she knew of my having been thus disguis'd; and, the better to clear my Doubt, reply'd, I had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intimate with him, while he was at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid. What then,</hi> said she, <hi>is he gone?</hi> She spoke these Words with some Concern, which (still supposing she was not ignorant who he was) I took to be affected. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, He was gone, and would never be seen in <hi>Spain</hi> any more, at which she felt a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100189:114"/>
visible Grief, and told me, she would gladly have had the Conversation of so extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a Man. I knew not what to think of the Sorrow she was in, at the Slave's Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but having still the same Thoughts as before, believ'd she had a Mind to be better acquainted with me, and design'd, by that Feint, to inform me of her Intentions. But I soon found out my Mistake, for having taken an Opportunity, as I was taking my leave, to tell her, That I was oblig'd to her on my Friend's Score, and if she would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Time and Place, would send him to her, she pull'd me back, asking me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he really was still at <hi>Madrid.</hi> This Action was so natural, that I was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd she had taken a Fancy to the Slave, having no Knowledge that I was the Person, who had appear'd under that Disguise. I was confirm'd in these second Thoughts, when having told her, That I knew where he liv'd, and would bring him to her when she pleas'd; she answer'd, I might spare my self that Trouble, by letting her know his Lodging. I reply'd, he liv'd at a Merchant's, whom I nam'd to her; to whom I present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went, and pray'd him, If any one came to enquire for an <hi>Algerine,</hi> to answer he was not at Home, and bid them come again the next Night, when he would certainly be within.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:100189:115"/>Two Days after I visited my Merchant, who told me, No Body had come as yet. This made me once more think, that she meant to my self the Passion she express'd for the Slave; and I waited on her, in hopes of a fuller Discovery. It fell out there was no Body by, and to make Use of that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, I took no notice of what she had said concerning the <hi>Algerine,</hi> but declar'd my Passion to her. She entertain'd my Love with an unsupportable Pride, assuring me, She would acquaint her Husband with my Insolence; and that if ever I presum'd to set my Foot within her Doors, I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it. Then, without giving me the Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to reply, she rose up, and pusht me out of the Room, as tho' I would have done her Violence. Her Husband entring in that very Moment, she told him, That I would have debauch'd her; on which he swore, That were it not in respect to the Prince I serv'd, he would have my Throat cut. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, my Guilt was not so great as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd; that what I had said to his Lady was only such Complements as us'd in <hi>France</hi> to be bestow'd on all Women, and had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at all to what she spoke of; and as a Proof that I meant honestly, I would never return to his House. <hi>Manrique</hi> seem'd satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with these Excuses, and I took my Leave of him, inrag'd at his Wife's Behaviour,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100189:115"/>
and resolv'd to be more wary for the future, being in a Country where Love-Intriegues are very perilous. Yet, methought, I was the more charm'd with her for it; I had fancy'd her that Day fairer than she us'd to seem, and I found that Love is increas'd by nothing so much as Opposition.</p>
            <p>Thus was I wrack'd with Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, when the aforesaid Merchant gave me notice, That a Woman was come to speak with the <hi>Algerine,</hi> and, according to my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he had desir'd her to call again the next Evening. I could not doubt but <hi>Isabella</hi> had sent this Message, and went the next Day to the Merchants, where I remain'd under my Disguise, waiting for the Messenger's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and accordingly a <hi>Duena</hi> came, and assur'd me, That if I pleas'd she would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me to a beautiful Lady, who had an earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Desire to see me. I answer'd I would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily submit to her Directions; and she, without replying, beck'd to me that I should follow her. I did, and having gone through many By-Alleys, we stopp'd under a low Balcony, out of which, the <hi>Duena</hi> having cough'd once or twice, a Rope-Ladder was thrown down; I was bid to get up, and obey'd hastily, being spurr'd on by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience I had to know if it really was <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:100189:116"/>I enter'd into the Room, and by the means of a dim Light knew her to be the same. She told me, That tho' she had never seen me but once, as I passed along the Street, she had been extreamly taken with my good Mien, and that the Heroick Action I had done, persuaded her she might entrust me with her Reputation. I could scarce be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded but she knew me; yet speaking in a feign'd Voice, as I had always done while I wore that Habit, I reply'd I was very much oblig'd to her, for the good Opinion she had of me, but yet I could not but resent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury she had done to the dearest Friend I had, nameing my self. <hi>What then,</hi> answer'd she, <hi>did he tell you of it? Yes, Madam,</hi> reply'd I, <hi>and that has something abated the Esteem I had for you. Ha!</hi> said she, <hi>do you then know me?</hi> I told her, I did, and that my Friend had shew'd her to me, one Day, as she was coming out of Church. <hi>And where were you then,</hi> cry'd she, <hi>that I did not see you?</hi> I reply'd, she went by in such haste, that she took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of her Admirers. <hi>But,</hi> continu'd she, <hi>I was told you was gone. It is true,</hi> answer'd I, <hi>that it is thought so, some Reasons having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd me to abscond, but through the Desire of knowing the Woman who had disoblig'd my Friend, I ventur'd abroad under a Disguise.</hi> She ask'd me, If I had found her so despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Person. I assur'd her, I had done Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100189:116"/>
to her Beauty, and was very sorry that so handsom a Lady should be so cruel. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuse me not of Cruelty,</hi> said she, <hi>you see what Hazard I run for your sake, and I were un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>done, did you inform your Friend of all this. Never mistrust me, Madam, reply'd I, but if you would oblige me, let me know what reason you had to use him so ill.</hi> She answer'd, I was my self the Occasion of it, and that ever since she had seen me, she had taken an Aversion for all other Men, and having no Inclination for my Friend, had been glad, at once to get rid of him, and give her Husband a good Opinion of her Vertue. I enquir'd into the Cause of her Hatred to him, and she reply'd, She could not fancy him, that she could not tell why, but she hated him as much as she lov'd me.</p>
            <p>This Discourse indeed surpriz'd me, to see that the same Woman, who found me so unworthy of her Esteem, while I was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited like a Gentleman, should have such a Fondness for me, under the nasty Garb of a despicable Slave. But our Passions are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unaccountable, especially those of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. My Displeasure was so great to hear my self thus despis'd, that I was tempted to discover who I was, and tho' I forbore it at the present, I could not keep from contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her bad Opinion of me, being as jealous
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100189:117"/>
of the Slave's Happiness, as if it had been another. This hindred me from answering <hi>Isabella</hi>'s Passion as I should have done, and she soon perceiv'd that my chiefest Care was to give her better Thoughts of my Friend. She was so dissatisfied at it, that she told me, I did not deserve the Honour she did me, since my Zeal was greater for my Friend than for her. I perceiv'd my Error, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to repair my Fault; but she said, She dar'd not trust me, and if I desir'd to regain her Favour, I must conceal this Adventure from my Friend, and not once name him in her Presence. I promis'd I would obey her, and she said, We must put off our farther Conversation to another Time, and that I should hear from her the next Day. It was very unwillingly that I parted, but being forc'd to comply, I return'd to my Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's.</p>
            <p>The Reader will wonder at what I am going to relate, if he considers not that Self-love and Self-conceit, are still our predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Passions. I was asham'd of standing indebted to my Disguise for the Enjoyment of my Mistress, and resolv'd, if I was sent for any more, to return in my own Cloaths. In this Humour I remain'd all Day at the Merchants, and the <hi>Duena</hi> being come at Night, I put on my false Beard and a Vest, which cover'd my other Cloaths, and thus
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100189:117"/>
habited, I follow'd her, but before I got up the Ladder I left them in the Street. <hi>Isabella</hi> came with eagerness to receive me, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me again, scream'd out, saying, she was undone and betray'd. I conjur'd her not to make any Noise, and she came to her self again. <hi>I see,</hi> said she then, <hi>that the Villain has a greater Kindness for you than me, since he has reveal'd this secret to you; but if you love me you will assist me in being reveng'd of that perfidious Wretch, and that is the only way for you to gain my Esteem. I will,</hi> answer'd I, <hi>when ever you please. I love you above all that can be dear to me, and had he a thousand Lives I would sacrifice them all to your Resentment; only let me know how so base a Man can have merited a Heart you refuse me. Go,</hi> reply'd she, <hi>and fetch me his Head, and you shall see what I will do for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I smil'd at her Mistake, which I thought it now Time to bring to a Conclusion, and assur'd her, I could not bring his Head other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than on my own Shoulders, that I was the same who came to her the Night before, and who alone deserv'd her Kindness. At which she was so astonish'd that she scarce heard what I said. Her Surprize being at last over, she told me, It was impossible, and that before she could believe me, she must see me in the same Habit I had then. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, It was no very hard Task, and that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100189:118"/>
I had left it under the Balcony. She desir'd me to fetch it, but I was scarce down, e're she pull'd up the Ladder, and withdrew. I was surpriz'd at it, and believ'd she still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in the Opinion that the Slave and I were two different Persons, and that I had made use of the Passion she had for him, to deceive her.</p>
            <p>It was so dark I could not tell where I was, and being desirous to know the House, I resolv'd to remain there till it was Day, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first put on my false Beard and Vest; but I had not waited long before I heard a Noise, and saw some Men with drawn Swords in their Hands, just upon me. I threw off my Disguise, which was troublesome to me, and drawing my Sword, run at the foremost of them, and before the rest could come about me, made the best of my Way home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manrique</hi> was the Man I had wounded; for I was no sooner down, but his Wife, enrag'd to be thus impos'd on, went to him, saying, I had attempted to climb into the Balcony; and was, she believ'd, still in the Street, with the same Design. He immediately took Fire, and attended by some of his Servants, was come out to murther me; but the Care they took of their wounded Master, had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd my Escape.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:100189:118"/>They took up the Beard and Vest, which they carry'd to <hi>Isabella,</hi> who remembring that was the very Habit she had seen her <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerine</hi> in, and comparing his Shape and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with mine, began to believe what I had said might be true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manrique,</hi> through what Design I know not, conceal'd my being concern'd in that Accident, and it was soon reported, That the same <hi>Algerine</hi> who had kill'd the Duke <hi>de</hi>—'s Son at <hi>Eleonor</hi>'s, had wounded him. But every Body thinking him gone, took all this to be a Fancy of <hi>Manrique</hi>'s, who was content with owing me a secret Grudge, tho' his Wound had prov'd but very slight. Fearing the fatal Consequences of a <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>'s Resentment, I still kept on my Guard; but I was freed from that Care, by a Person I should least have expected it from, where I had another Instance of the capaciousness of a Woman's Temper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isabella,</hi> in the mean while, being now convinc'd I was the same with the Slave she doted on, felt for me the raging Passion she formerly had for him, and heartily griev'd at having rendred her Husband jealous of me. She then thought of several Ways to correct her Error, and at last pitch'd upon a very strange one; which being resolv'd on, her next Care was how she should see me, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100189:119"/>
me at once with her Plot, and the Love she had for me.</p>
            <p>She easily obtain'd her Desire, and having understood I was at the Merchants, came there, to my great Wonder, habited like a <hi>Duegna.</hi> She began by protesting she was unacquainted with her Husband's Intentions to murther me; but being better inform'd, I would not let her go on, till she had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd the Truth, which at last she did, as I have just related it; and then continu'd her Discourse in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is true, I took a Fancy to that Slave, not knowing it was you; but forgive that one Fault, and you shall henceforth be the only Object of my Love. I have rendred you suspicious to my Husband, but I know a certain Means whereby you may regain his Confidence, if you will but follow my Advice. You must endeavour to meet him at some of your common Acquaintances. There you shall wholly disown to him that you ever had any Design upon my Honour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test that it is a false Accusation I charg'd you with, finding you were acquainted with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegue I had with the</hi> Algerine. <hi>You may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him, for his greater Satisfaction, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the</hi> Duena, <hi>whose Name is</hi> Beatrix, <hi>and I will instruct her how she shall answer him and justifie you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:100189:119"/>The Project seem'd to me something Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and I ask'd her, Whether she had well weigh'd all the ill Consequences that might attend it. She desir'd me to do what she would have me, and assur'd me I should not receive any Injury by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I told her I would consider of it, but could not take my Resolution so suddenly, and so we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>This gave my thinking Faculty no little Exercise, for I could not comprehend how this Woman could be willing that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band should think her false to him, as he must naturally do if her Design took effect; and besides, I fear'd, that did I succeed, it would but make him the more jealous, and thus I should be depriv'd of the Advantage I expected by it. But after all, I thought I might trust her, since she ought to know her Husband better than I did, and I judged it worth my while to venture something in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to free my self from the continual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions I lay under. But, to speak the Truth, my Love was the chief Motive that induc'd me to it, and flatter'd with the Esteem she had for me, while she took me for an <hi>Algerine,</hi> I was impatient of confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it under my true Shape.</p>
            <p>I sought for an Opportunity of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Manrique,</hi> which having found, I told him, I had something of Moment to impart
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100189:120"/>
to him. Then, seing he was willing to hear me, I did, according to his Wife's Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, assure him, That, as for my part, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Engagement with her, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Man who was acquainted with her Intriegue with the <hi>Algerine,</hi> the Slave having own'd it to me, she had charg'd me with this false Accusation, on purpose that he should not give any Credit to the Notice I might have given him of her ill Conduct. <hi>Manrique,</hi> upon hearing this, embrac'd me with all imaginable Kindness, saying, he was now no longer at a loss, to know why he who had wounded him, had let fall a Vest; but that besides, a false Beard had been found, which made him mistrust that some Body else was come to see his Wife un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Disguise. Then he ask'd me, How long it was since the Slave had absented himself? I answer'd, He had left <hi>Madrid</hi> the next Day after his being wounded, and that as for the false Beard, he must not wonder at that, the <hi>Algerine</hi> using them sometimes when he desir'd not to be known. <hi>Manrique</hi> seem'd now to be fully satisfied, but said, If I would oblige him throughly, I must contrive the Slave's Return to <hi>Madrid,</hi> that he might be reveng'd of him. I promis'd to use my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and he begged me to remain his Friend, and visit him with the same Freedom I formerly had done, assuring me he would
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100189:120"/>
not speak of this to his Wife, till he could produce the Slave to confront her.</p>
            <p>The easiness with which he seem'd to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit what I said, made me suspect his Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and it was some time before I dar'd trust either him or his Spouse; but my eager Love did at last overcome my Jealousies. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd my Visits, being free from Suspicion, had the Liberty of conversing with his Wife, and thus we enjoy'd for some time the Fruits of our Artifice. But <hi>Manrique</hi> at length grew impatient of the Slave's Absence: I told him, I could not help it, and that let me write to <hi>Algier</hi> never so often, I had no answer, which made me believe he was dead. But this did not content him, and he told me, That since I could not hear from him, I must help him to get rid of his Wife; that he would tax her with what I had inform'd him of, and that I must stand to what I had said.</p>
            <p>I conjur'd him not to carry things to that Extremity; but he was inexorable, and all I could do was to acquaint <hi>Isabella</hi> with it. She heard me without the least Concern, her Plot being so contriv'd, that I was to be the Object of her Husband's Revenge. Her Answer was, That she neither fear'd me nor her Husband, and knew well enough how to disappoint our Designs. I was astonish'd at this Reply, and thinking she had mistaken
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100189:121"/>
me, repeated over-again what I had been saying to her, vowing I would rather dye than assist her Husband to her Prejudice. She seem'd well pleas'd at it, and answer'd, If I did not bear Witness against her, she had nothing to fear. I reply'd, I wondred how she could suppose I should ever think of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her any Injury; and thus we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>But this Woman was more mischievous than I could ever have imagin'd. I was no sooner gone e're she went to her Husband, and told him, shedding abundance of Tears, she found her self bound in Duty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to acquaint him, That he entertain'd a Man whose whole Study was to contrive his Shame. <hi>I know,</hi> continu'd she, <hi>what he has made you believe, to gain your good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; he has own'd it to me himself, thinking me so mad as to love him. He was the only</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerine <hi>that ever came to me, for it was under that Disguise that he would have got up into my Chamber. From his Hand you receiv'd your Wound. All this I knew, and if I have since endur'd his Company, the Reason was, because you were so infatuated with him, that I could do no otherwise; but his Impudence is at length grown to such a Pitch, that I can bear with it no longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:100189:121"/>All the Lies she impos'd on his Belief, seem'd to him so probable, that he wondred how he ever had suspected her Vertue, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she ever had given him notice of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to cuckold him; and being now fully persuaded of what she said, he tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrac'd her, vowing he would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on me. I, in the mean while, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected nothing of all this; yet fearing <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique</hi> would execute the Design he had made me acquainted with, I kept from his House; and it was above a Week since the last Visit I paid him, when I receiv'd a Note from <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onor,</hi> to give me Notice, That my Death was decreed, and that I had best quit <hi>Spain</hi> with all possible Diligence.</p>
            <p>Tho' it was very Pressing, I could not trust to it, but resolv'd to speak with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that sent it me. I had not seen her since the Promise I had made not to visit her; but upon the Receipt of her Letter, I put on my <hi>Algerine</hi> Habit, and waited on her, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I came from her Husband. Hearing I was there, she ran down to me, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in a few Words, That <hi>Manrique</hi> had given out, I was the Person who under the Disguise of an <hi>Algerine</hi> Slave had kill'd the Duke <hi>de</hi>—'s Son; that the King was acquainted with it, and grew extream jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thereupon; that he had quarrell'd with her, accusing her of having harbour'd me
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100189:122"/>
under that Disguise, and had not seen her since, so that she thought her self wholly out of Favour; and that as for me, the King, the Duke <hi>de</hi>— and <hi>Manrique,</hi> had agreed I should be murther'd, so that my Ruin was unavoidable if I did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fly out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>By the manner of her Delivery, I judged I had no Time to lose, and that it was my best way to take her Counsel and be gone; but my Sorrow at leaving her, and at my being the innocent Cause of all the Trouble she had receiv'd, made me very loath to part, which she perceiving grew angry with me; telling me, She saw I did not care what became of her, since I would remain there, tho' I knew she were lost if it reach'd the King's Ears that she had spoke with me; which said, she retir'd, ordering me to be gone.</p>
            <p>I was vexed at heart to see my self thus sever'd from a Person, for whom I still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an unfeign'd Passion, and from whom I had some Reason to expect an equal return; and the Desire of seeing her once more, and bidding her a more tender Adieu, prevail'd with me above the Dread of my Danger. I had not the Power to go out of Town, and my Love blinded me to that degree, that I endeavour'd to find out some plausible Excuse for my Stay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:100189:122"/>The Prince's Business were a Pretext suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to satisfie my self; and however useless I might be to him, yet my fond Imagination made me fancy he could not be without me, whenever my Dotage would not suffer me to think of a Retreat. Here I again experienc'd, That Love soon grows stronger than all our other Passions, when we yield our selves up to it; and those who once suffer it to gain Ground, must expect it will make them deaf to all other Considerations.</p>
            <p>But tho' the Hope of giving <hi>Eleonor</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Visit were the chief Motive of my remaining there; yet that of being reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Isabella</hi> did not a little conduce to it, and, after all, that was my greatest Care; so unsteady was I in my Wishes and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I had indeed several substantial Reasons to hate that Woman, yet I resented nothing so much as her preferring the <hi>Algerine</hi> before me.</p>
            <p>Thinking she was not fully satisfied that the <hi>Algerine</hi> and I were the same Person, I attempted, by deceiving her once more, to work my Ends, and to that purpose sent her the following Letter.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                     <salute>Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOV will perhaps be surpriz'd at receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this. But tho' the Hand may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, the Person I hope is not; I am <hi>Acma-Hamet,</hi> once happy in your Love, and who have been oblig'd to abscond through the Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of one, I, (though undeservedly) call'd my Friend. However, I have now put it out of his Power to injure me, since he is ignorant of my being here; which I have taken all possible Care to conceal from every one, save the Person for whose sake I have ventur'd hither. I lodge with <hi>Alonso Riberos,</hi> and (if you can still love me) expect shortly to hear from you. My Landlord thinks I come from <hi>Morocco,</hi> and am call'd <hi>Muley Asan.</hi> Vnder that Name it is I must be enquir'd for.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>This being safely deliver'd, I went and lay at <hi>Alonso Riberos,</hi> whom I made believe that I was a <hi>Morocco</hi> Merchant, and was come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> about some Business relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Trade. Thus under this new Disguise, I was safe from my Persecutors; I satisfied the Fancy I had to remain there, and fed the Hopes of compassing my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:100189:123"/>When I reflect on my Madness, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that any one Passion is sufficient to make a young Man venture on the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Undertakings; for the more perilous my Projects were, the more eager was I to put them in Execution; and certainly Age and Wisdom can alone reclaim a Man from this ridiculous Romantick undauntedness.</p>
            <p>I was not long at <hi>Riberos</hi>'s before I had an Answer to my Letter. It came safe to <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>'s Hands, and it is not to be wondred at, if having formerly thought the <hi>Algerine</hi> Slave and I to be two different Persons, she was confirm'd in that Opinion by the Receipt of this Letter. She rejoiced doubly that her Plot against me had so well succeeded, since her Husband being now fully persuaded I was the <hi>Algerine</hi> who had been so much talk'd on, would never suspect her Intriegue, and that she might quietly enjoy the Man, for whom alone she ever had a real Love.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duena Beatrix</hi> was sent to <hi>Alonzo Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beros,</hi> and I was carry'd, as at other Times, to the low Balcony. <hi>Isabella,</hi> taking me for the Slave she had formerly seen, receiv'd me with all possible Demonstrations of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and related to me all that had happen'd during my Absence, and how she would have procur'd the <hi>French</hi> Count's Death, by making her Husband believe that it was he who had disguis'd himself under the Habit of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100189:124"/>
an <hi>Algerine</hi> Slave. Then she blam'd me for my Indiscretion, in having acquainted that <hi>French</hi> Lord with our first Interview, and thus given him the means to come to the Rendezvous she had design'd to none but my self.</p>
            <p>My Love was so well extinguish'd that her Discourse prov'd but a Diversion to me, and being no longer jealous of my self, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to see how far her Blindness and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence would go. I begg'd a thousand Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons for having been so talkative. <hi>But after all, Madam,</hi> continued I, <hi>you have no great Reason to be angry with me, for having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd your Acquaintance with that</hi> Frenchman; <hi>since, as I have been told, he did not wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please you, and you have been pretty intimate together,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She deny'd she ever had lov'd him, assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, her admitting him, was only with a Design to undo him, of which she had at last found an Opportunity. I grew very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie at hearing her tell so many Lies, and so openly confess her Perfidiousness, yet I did not discover my self, but at last took my Leave, she not in the least suspecting me.</p>
            <p>I thought things were now in a fair way for my intended Revenge, and began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how I should make use of my Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. <hi>Alonzo Riberos</hi> traded much in Foreign Countries, so that several Strangers usually
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100189:124"/>
resorted thither, which had made me chuse his House, the better to deceive <hi>Isabella.</hi> Among others, a certain <hi>Algerine</hi> visited him frequently, whose dull Look made me judge him most fit for my Purpose.</p>
            <p>I had a very understanding Man to my <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> whom I wholly confided in. Him I inform'd of my Intentions, and accordingly he fell into Discourse with the <hi>Algerine,</hi> telling him; That one of the greatest Beauties in <hi>Spain</hi> look'd for a Man of <hi>Algier,</hi> having a great Appetite for a Gallant of that Country. This Proposition was not so great a Temptation to him, as a small Present my Man made him, with a Promise of as much more, if he would do what should be desir'd of him, and be discreet.</p>
            <p>The <hi>African</hi> promis'd an exact Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and my Man order'd him to wait at <hi>Alonzo Riberos</hi>'s, having first told him what he should do. Then he acquainted me with the Success of his Negotiation, and <hi>Beatrix</hi> being come at her usual Hour, which was always in the Dusk of the Evening, I sent the true <hi>Algerine</hi> in my stead; who was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the House, and, as he had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, climb'd up the Rope-Ladder into the Balcony, and thence went into <hi>Isabella</hi>'s Chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:100189:125"/>My Servant, who had dogg'd him, no sooner saw him safe, but he carry'd a Note I had given him for <hi>Manrique</hi>; by which I gave him advice, That the famous <hi>Algerine</hi> Slave was then actually with his Wife. The Cuckold was in Bed, but my Man, having told his Servants that it was about Matters of great concern, they wak'd him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd it. The Hopes he had of surprizing me rendred him more diligent. He order'd part of his Servants to wait under the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony, while himself, with Two or Three of them, went into his Lady's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>While things were in that Posture on his side, let us see a little what happen'd on <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>'s. She did not at first suspect the Cheat, but finding that Man was neither in Shape nor Voice like her dear Slave, she fetch'd a Candle, and at first Sight discover'd his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake. Her Surprizal was not so great as it would have been, had she been less accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd to these kind of Intriegues. She ask'd him how he came there? And he confess'd that one <hi>Muley-Asan,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi> had, through the means of one of his Servants, engag'd him in that Enterprize.</p>
            <p>What a Grief was it to <hi>Isabella,</hi> that the only Man she doated on, should be so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to expose her thus! But she conceal'd her Affliction from the <hi>Algerine,</hi> and telling
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100189:125"/>
him, That those who had persuaded him to what he did, only sought his Ruin, order'd him to be gone. His Danger made him more quick of Apprehension than he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appear'd to be, and without giving her the Trouble of repeating it a second Time, he soon found the Way down the Rope-Ladder, which <hi>Isabella</hi> immediately drew up.</p>
            <p>He was just setting his Foot on the Ground, and she shutting her Balcony-Door, when <hi>Manrique</hi>'s Men seiz'd on him, and their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster entred into her Chamber. He found her in a Disorder which confirm'd his Jealousies, and was going to examine her, when his Men brought up him they had seiz'd in the Street. It is not possible to express the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize he was in, to see it was not I: He doubted not but those who had assur'd him, the <hi>Algerine</hi> Slave was no other than my self under that Disguise, had impos'd on his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and this aggravating Circumstance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd his Wife's Guilt more than he had thought her. He resolv'd to carry his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to the utmost, and having fast'n'd her Chamber-Door upon her, kept the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerine</hi> closely confin'd.</p>
            <p>The next Day it was reported, That the noted <hi>Algerine</hi> Slave, who had kill'd the Duke <hi>de</hi>—'s Son, had been caught in Bed with <hi>Manrique</hi>'s Wife, and was then in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100189:126"/>
at his House. This made a great Noise, and <hi>Eleonor,</hi> who heard of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it to be me, who not having follow'd her Advice, had imbroil'd my self into fresh Troubles. It came also to the King, and gave him new Suspicions against <hi>Eleonor,</hi> who, he fancy'd, still conceal'd me in her House.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de</hi>—no sooner heard of it, but desirous to vent his Spleen against his Son's Murtherer, he came to <hi>Manrique,</hi> and having both examin'd the Innocent Prisoner, they discover'd their Error. As for <hi>Isabella,</hi> she was under a continual Fear, lest he should have declar'd who had sent him, and her false Lover, being seiz'd, should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd the whole Truth.</p>
            <p>What she dreaded came to pass, but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreseen it, I had remov'd my Lodging; and soon after was inform'd, It was the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Discourse, That I had personated one <hi>Muley-Asan,</hi> and had taken a Lodging at <hi>Riberos,</hi> on purpose to act this Tragedy. By this I judg'd it high Time for me to be gone, and having sent my Servants before, I left <hi>Madrid</hi> the next Day, accompany'd only by my <hi>Valet de Chambre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I arriv'd at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> designing thence to go for <hi>Guienna,</hi> where I expected to meet with the Prince, who, with his Army made
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100189:126"/>
Head against the Duke <hi>de Vendosme. Berg</hi> was then besieg'd, which was in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1653. But I was forc'd to continue there some Time, being fallen ill, and wrote to the Prince to represent to him part of the Reasons which had oblig'd me to quit <hi>Madrid.</hi> The Answer I had from him was, That I might either go to <hi>Paris</hi> or the Duke <hi>de Vendosme</hi>'s Army, and that he would not be the occasion of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a different Party from my Brother; whence I judg'd he was not over-wel satisfied with my Negotiation.</p>
            <p>It may well be thought I was vex'd that I should have displeas'd him, and often curs'd those Adventures which had occasion'd my Negligence. Then I resolv'd to use my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavours to regain his Favour: And in order to it, to return to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where, by a great Application to Business, I might make some Amends for my former Errors. But, to my Shame be it spoken, my Love for <hi>Eleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> was indeed the true Motive which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd me to it. The Care she had taken of my Safety, oblig'd me to a grateful Return, and the dangerous Circumstances I had left her in, did, (I imagin'd) require my Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. I fancy'd that the King having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken her, her Husband's Jealousie and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment might provoke him to a Fatal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and accus'd my self of Baseness, in leaving her as I had done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:100189:127"/>How wretched is their Condition who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave themselves to the most unruly Passion! It not only blinds them, but also puffs them up, with a Conceit that none are so quick-sighted as themselves; for had all the World told me I was mad, to dream of returning to <hi>Madrid,</hi> I should have thought my self wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than all the World, so clear and convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did those Reasons seem, which induc'd me to it. Not but I, sometimes, made slight Reflexions on the Temerity of my Design, but the more rash it seem'd to me, the more desirous I was to go about it, fancying it a Heroick Action, thus to venture my Life for the sake of my Mistress. I hope none of my Readers will be of the same Opinion I was then of, in commending an Amorous Generosity, which would have expos'd me to greater Hazards than any I had yet run, had not Sickness prevented my unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Folly.</p>
            <p>Being fully bent on it, I sent the Prince a Letter, to acquaint him, That preferring his Service before any other Considerations, I was returning into <hi>Spain,</hi> and hop'd he would do me the Honour, by writing more oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, to let me know, I had regain'd his Favour; which being sent, I set out for <hi>Madrid,</hi> in spight of my Indisposition; but the very first Day's Journey spent me quite, so that I was forc'd to stop at <hi>Fontarabia,</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:100189:127"/>
where I kept my Bed near Six Weeks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so violent a Disease that my Life was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten despair'd of.</p>
            <p>I had, upon my falling sick, sent a Letter to <hi>Eleonor,</hi> to acquaint her, That it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for me to leave her, and that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to see her, as soon as my Health would permit, to offer her my Service and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in a Time when I fear'd she had need of them. I had also order'd the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger to enquire what People said of me there; and especially concerning <hi>Manrique</hi> and his Wife.</p>
            <p>He deliver'd my Letter to <hi>Eleonor,</hi> who reply'd by Word of Mouth, That I had best keep away, and that she had no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to give him. As for <hi>Manrique,</hi> he was told, That Lord made strict Search after me, that his Wife had inform'd him, I was <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-Asan,</hi> who after several unsuccessful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon her Chastity, had out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, contriv'd what had happen'd; that the <hi>Algerine</hi> had been set at Liberty, after a sharp Reprimand; and that I must never think of returning to <hi>Madrid</hi> any more. He brought me this Answer at a Time when I began to grow better, and I think that had my Recovery been more perfect, I would have ventur'd through all these Dangers, so much was I displeas'd at <hi>Eleonor</hi>'s not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, and so great was my Desire of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100189:128"/>
seeing her. But, happily for me, I was too weak to undertake such a Journey, and found I had nothing else to do but to forget her, and use all possible means to regain my Health.</p>
            <p>Thus I quite laid aside the Thoughts of Returning. But before I proceed any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will not, I hope, be unacceptable to my Reader, if I inform him of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd at <hi>Madrid</hi> since my being gone, which tho' I heard it but long since, does, I think, naturally belong to this Place, having some Relation to what I have lately been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
            <p>I left there my two Mistresses, <hi>Eleonor</hi> and <hi>Isabella,</hi> having lov'd them both, tho' in a very different manner; for I esteem'd the former, and the latter I fear'd. The one had charm'd me thro' her seeming Vertue and Generosity; and the other, on the contrary, by her Forwardness and the Undauntedness with which she satisfied her unruly Passions; but we shall find their Characters to be much alike, when their Circumstances were the same: And from what I am going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, the Reader may know what an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he ought to have of those Women whose greatest Care is to get many Lovers, not being contented with one Husband or Gallant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:100189:128"/>It being <hi>Isabella</hi>'s Temper ever to give way to her Inclinations, she shew'd her self in all her Intriegues as Fantastical, as when being enamour'd with me, while under the Slave's Disguise, she could not suffer me, when in my own Habit. So most of the Men she was concern'd with, were but of an ordinary Condition and such as she might easily sacrifice to her Husband's Jealousie: Not but that she often met with Admirers of a higher Rank, as the following Story will testifie.</p>
            <p>Scarce was she marry'd and had appear'd at Court, when her Beauty ensnar'd most young Lords there; but the most sincere and passionate of her Lovers was the Prince <hi>de</hi>—the handsomest Man certainly in all <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the best Presence. He was just upon marrying the Marquis <hi>de</hi>—'s Daughter, who was reckon'd the greatest Fortune in that Kingdom, and by whom he was tenderly belov'd, when he grew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Isabella.</hi>

            <p>He was certainly rather bewitch'd than in Love, for his Dotage was such, that to break off, or at least defer his Marriage, he pretended a Desire of entring into Orders, and offer'd to resign his Birth-Right and his Spouse to his younger Brother; his Father was almost persuaded to it, and the thing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100189:129"/>
would have been done, had he not been cur'd of his Folly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isabella</hi> return'd his Passion with an unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Pride, and according to her usual Custom, inform'd her Husband of it, who was as kind to him, on that Score, as he had been to me: So that the Prince, what thro' her Scorn, and the impossibility of seeing her, fell sick with Despair.</p>
            <p>He had a very cunning Fellow to his <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let de Chambre,</hi> whom he had sometimes sent with Letters to <hi>Isabella.</hi> This Man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cause of his Distemper, told him, He pity'd him, and the more because his Mistress was chaste only to him, having, to his Knowledge, an Intriegue with one of her Servants; which he could have told him before, had he not fear'd his Displeasure.</p>
            <p>The Prince was like to have kill'd him for talking so injuriously of his Mistress; and he, seeing his Lord's Blindness was so great, resolv'd to open his Eyes. He got acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Manrique</hi>'s Man, and by the Promise of a considerable Sum, intic'd him to make the Prince a Confession of the whole Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. His Highness gave as litle Credit to <hi>Manrique</hi>'s Servant as he had done to his own, and would scarce hear them, till they had offer'd to procure him a Sight of what he doubted. Accordingly they took their Measures, which having succeeded, the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100189:129"/>
Prince was an Eye-Witness to her Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>But his Flame could not be extinguish'd by so convincing a Proof of her Infamy, and he resolv'd to let her know what he had seen, with a Design (so mean and weak was he in that occasion) not to shame her by taxing her with so base an Action, but by his mild passing it over, to ingage her Gratitude.</p>
            <p>He was so simple as to tell her, He knew of her Intimacy with that Man, but did not love her the less for it, since he could impute it but to an Inchantment, and did not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that a Lady of her Sense could have stoop'd to one so much below her, had not some Infernal Power interpos'd in his behalf. Nay, and he offer'd by his Death to free her from the Wizard, and restore her to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of granting her Favours to those who should use no other Charm but their Love. The Lady, who was no Fool, taking the Hint from what he had said, pretended to believe her Servant dealt with the Devil, but persuaded him that his Art had not been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to make the thing real, but only to impose on his Senses. The Story adds, He was so credulous as to disbelieve his Eyes, and to take what he had seen for a Diabolical Illusion. However, <hi>Manrique</hi>'s Servant was murther'd, and, as it was suppos'd, by the Prince's Order; who being thus deliver'd
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100189:130"/>
from the Magician, persisted in loving <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> and being slighted by her.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being naturally very super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, he imagin'd that his Mistress's Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty proceeded from a continu'd Witchcraft, and caus'd Masses to be said, to drive away the envious Fiend; and what would have been any where else esteem'd the greatest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, was there look'd upon as an effect of his Devotion, which made him use the highest Mysteries of our Religion, to obtain his vicious Ends. But, at last he came to himself again, and concluded his Marriage, which he would not have put off so long, had he not loath'd all other Women, while he was charm'd with the ungrateful <hi>Isabella.</hi> I had no Knowledge of this ridiculous Story, when I courted her, else I should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd her lyable to the same Inchantment, when she could not suffer me under my own Shape, while she was distracted for me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that of an <hi>Algerine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manrique</hi> seeing I had left <hi>Spain,</hi> and thus secur'd my self from his Resentment, gave out that it was I who had personated the Slave, and thus deceiv'd the King and all the World. The King, who had ever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted <hi>Eleonor</hi>'s Kindness for me, doubted not but it was for her sake I had thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd my self; which increasing his Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100189:130"/>
he enquir'd of <hi>Manrique</hi> how he came to know it? who having reply'd, It was through his Wife's good Conduct and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he was desirous of seeing her, to be farther resolv'd. I had never told her of my Amour with <hi>Eleonor,</hi> so that she could not discover any thing to that Prince which might confirm his Suspicion. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, her Vanity made her so careful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade his Majesty, that the great Love she had inspir'd me with, was the only occasion of my Disguise, that he could not believe it possible for a Man, whose Passion for her was so great, to be at the same Time in love with another. But it succeeded as ill for <hi>Eleonor</hi> as if the King had still question'd her Fidelity, for that Prince being ever best pleas'd with the newest Faces, found <hi>Isabella</hi> handsom enough to deserve his Affection.</p>
            <p>The Knowledge <hi>Eleonor</hi> had of it, did her a great Injury; for she was then in very good Repute, and every one was convinc'd that she suffer'd the King's Addresses out of meer Complaisance, and was the only one of all his Mistresses that had withstood his importunate Desires, and by her Vertue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd his Esteem: But she then destroy'd that Opinion, for she no sooner saw the King inclining to a Change, but us'd all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible means to reclaim him, and be reveng'd of her Rival. Having some small Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100189:131"/>
with <hi>Manrique,</hi> she sent for him, and informing him of his Majesty's new Passion, advis'd him to send his Wife into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Success was otherwise than she had design'd, for she not only inspir'd him with a jealousie capable of hurrying him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most dangerous Enterprizes (such as was that of crossing an amorous Prince's Inclinations) but also with a Love more dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet than his Jealousie could be. He wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly follow'd her Directions, and having taken his Measures accordingly, sent <hi>Isabella</hi> to a House he had, on the farthermost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Spain.</hi> Having thus rid her of his Wife, he hop'd <hi>Eleonor</hi> would have requited the Obligation; but the King having lost <hi>Isabella,</hi> and not thinking fit to use his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in recalling her, renew'd his Assidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to <hi>Eleonor,</hi> so that <hi>Manrique</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self under a Necessity to forbear visiting his Mistress, or to recal his Spouse.</p>
            <p>These were very hard Circumstances for a jealous Husband and a passionate Lover to be in, and I believe his Love would have got the better of his Jealousie, had he not fear'd by sending for the one to have disoblig'd the other. He therefore left his Lady in the Country, and carefully watch'd the King's Absence, to visit <hi>Eleonor</hi>; but whether she really had no Inclination for him, or that the King caus'd her to be narrowly observ'd, he
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100189:131"/>
reap'd no other Profit from his Wife's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence but the King's Displeasure: However, he resolv'd <hi>Eleonor</hi> should not enjoy all the Benefit of it, and to that effect endeavour'd what he could to persuade her Husband to send for her; but he who had more respect for his Fortune than his Honour, was little mov'd with his Arguments, and thus <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique</hi> could neither gain his Mistress's Love, nor be reveng'd for her Scorn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isabella,</hi> in the mean while, bore her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement impatiently, and hearing <hi>Eleonor</hi> had, since her departure, grown more than ever in the King's Favour, it redoubl'd her Grief. She was also inform'd, How she ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val'd her as well in her Husband's Affection as in the King's, and hop'd, by giving his Majesty Notice of it, to work a double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. She did, and the Issue was, That <hi>Manrique</hi> was made Governour of a Town far distant from <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not heard any more of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegues, but when I was acquainted that <hi>Eleonor,</hi> for whom I had so great an Esteem, had yielded to <hi>Manrique</hi>'s Desires, I thank'd kind Heaven that had put a stop to my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. It would have vex'd me that a Lady, of whom I had so noble an Idea, should have sacrific'd her Honour to the Vanity of being Mistress to a Monarch, who (tho'
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100189:132"/>
very worthy of the Rank he bore) was no ways accomplish'd for a Lover; but that a Man of so mean Parts as <hi>Manrique</hi> should have won her Love, put me to a <hi>Non Plus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had, during my Sickness, the Leisure to reflect on my former Follies, and tho' I was but Eight and twenty, my Experience of Female Falshood was such, that I began to lament the Time they had made me lose, and to curse them for being the Occasion of the little Progress I had made in the Art Military; for I found my Skill less than even in my first Campaigns, and I well foresaw that while I could not resist that Temptation, I must never think of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing my Fortune. But how, alas! should I withstand it, I found my Inclination still stronger than my Reason, and that I should never be my self, while I remain'd in the World. This made me think of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, to which the Vexation my Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and bad Success gave me, did not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle invite me.</p>
            <p>While I was meditating on it, and taking a Walk, prescrib'd me for the Recovery of my Strength, I met a Man who having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd me, was retiring: But his Habit agreeing with my Thoughts, I had a Desire to converse with him, and, won by my
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100189:132"/>
Instances, tarry'd with me. We at first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scours'd on indifferent Matters, and then I ask'd him, Whether he was not an Hermit, and how he relish'd a solitary Life? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, That he knew not whether he ought to assume the Holy Name of <hi>Hermit,</hi> tho' he had liv'd retir'd for above Twelve or Thirteen Years; since he must own it to his Shame, That he had still been too much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Things of this World, and was then actually endeavouring to return into it; being persuaded that for a true Retreat, a greater Call was necessary than any he had yet had. I ask'd him, If the fair Sex had not some Share in the Motives that had led him to what he had done? To which he answer'd with a Sigh, That they were the only Cause of his Misfortunes. I told him, That, for my part, they had so perplex'd me, that I was inclin'd to do as he had done; <hi>Then,</hi> said he, <hi>I would advise you to go about it with more Consideration than I did, else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will be difficult for you to be more resolute than my self.</hi> I thereupon desir'd him to give me an Account of his Adventures, which he seem'd unwilling to do, but at last my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties prevail'd, and he made me the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Relation of his Life.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:100189:133"/>
I was born in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and tho' my Habit and Looks may not, perhaps, speak me such, I can assure you, That I am near related to King <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> who has these Thirteen Years since found the means to ascend on his Ancestors Throne. I was bred up with him, while he was yet but Duke of <hi>Braganca,</hi> and should have shar'd in his Prosperity, had I not had nearer Friends than he, who engag'd me in the contrary Party; or rather had not Love turn'd my Brain.</p>
               <p>Never was any one, at once, so charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and so perfidious, as the Person I ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She was much about my Age, but of an unsatisfied Ambition; and had a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for me no longer than till she could fix on one, who might satisfie her Pride. She had been plac'd with the Duchess of <hi>Mantua,</hi> then Vice-Queen of <hi>Portugal</hi>; was born of an Illustrious Family, but much inferior to mine; and tho' my Estate was but small, her Fortune was not answerable to it. I was possess'd with an unexpressible Passion, which she did, or at least pretended to return; and tho' we did not at first talk of Marrying, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Duke of <hi>Braganca</hi> would never have suffer'd me to match my self so much to my Disadvantage) yet I swore to her,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100189:133"/>
That I would never have any other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to my Wife, and I liv'd in Hopes of enjoying her, expecting that Duke's Restauration would so much better my Condition, that I should not need to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a Portion.</p>
               <p>The Conspiracy, which plac'd him on his Throne, was then contriving. I was one of the first that was entrusted with that Secret, and I was so strangely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd to my Mistress, that I could not keep it from her. It was the highest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudency in me, since living with the Vice-Queen, I had cause to fear she would discover it to her; but that was not the only Reason I had to complain of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion.</p>
               <p>The Vice-Queen had one <hi>Vasconcellos</hi> to her Secretary, who, tho' a <hi>Portugueze</hi> by Birth, was grown the Tyrant of his own Country, through the Imperiousness wherewith he exercis'd the Power, which the Vice-Queen had Plac'd in him. He was pleas'd to be in Love with my Mistress, but what you will perhaps wonder at is, That she hearken'd to, and encourag'd his Addresses, so highly was she charm'd with the Passion of a Man, who only manag'd all the Affairs of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:100189:134"/>
She at first doubted not but he meant honourably; but soon found his Design was but to rank her with the many Misses his Fortune had procur'd him.</p>
               <p>Her Vertue seem'd to be too great to comply with such Desires, as tended only to her Dishonour; and she told me one Day, That she now hated <hi>Vasconcellos</hi> as much as she had appear'd complaisant to him, while she had Hopes of becoming his Wife. <hi>His Wife!</hi> cry'd I, in a great Surprize, <hi>How could you ever have such a Thought? Why,</hi> reply'd she, <hi>is it not a strong Enticement to be his Mistress, who commands the whole Kingdom?</hi> I reproach'd her for being guilty of that Baseness; and she said, I must forgive her, since even in that, to be in a Capacity of doing me some good, had been her chiefest Aim. This Complement appeas'd me, and I doubted not but that the Scorn she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd for my unworthy Rival was as sincere as it ought to be, after the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very she had made of the injurious Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had of her. Yet I heard from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hands, that it was affected, and that she still kindly entertain'd his Visits and his Presents. Indeed she grew more expensive than usually, and having ask'd her, How her Stock had increas'd, she as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd me it was out of the Vice-Queen's
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100189:134"/>
Bounty. I was deaf to all the Proofs that were given me of the Reality of her Intriegue with <hi>Vasconcellos,</hi> and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in adoring her, with a Respect equal to my Love.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Conspiracy broke out, as every one knows; the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors having made themselves Masters of the City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> seiz'd the Vice-Queen and Archbishop of <hi>Braga. Vasconcellos</hi> was stabb'd and thrown head-long out of a Window, and the Duke of <hi>Braganca</hi> was Four Days after proclaim'd King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> My Hatred to <hi>Vasconcellos</hi> mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to assist those who were order'd to murther him; we went up into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where one of his Clerks having op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd us, I kill'd him at one Blow, and was the first that entred. We could not find him, and while my Comrades were looking for him, I espy'd a little Closet, half open, wherein were some Letters, which I took, and, unperceiv'd, dispos'd into my Pockets. At length, after much seeking, we heard he was hid in a Corner of the Room; we pull'd him out thence, and knowing me again, he conjur'd me, for my Mistress's sake, to save his Life; assuring me, I should oblige her highly in doing it. I thought he had lost his Wits, to make me a Complement, he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100189:135"/>
must needs imagine, I would take as an Affront, and was going to force a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration out of his own Mouth, to clear her Innocency. But I had not that Leisure, for he had scarce spoke to me when they threw him down into the Street.</p>
               <p>The Tumult being appeas'd, and the City quiet, my next Care was to read the Letters I had found. They were most subscrib'd by my unfaithful Mistress, and but too plain Arguments of her Infamy. Some of them contain'd an account of the Plot, and I bless'd my kind Stars, that had directed those Letters to me, which were they fallen into other Hands would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have prov'd my undoing. I kept them, with a Design to confound her, by letting her know, I had those convincing Proofs of her Shame; but I knew not what was become of her, and thought she might have been confin'd with the Vice-Queen: At last I heard, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Portugueze,</hi> she was permitted to retire to one of her Relations. The News of <hi>Vasconcellos</hi> cruel Death put her into such a Fury that she exclaim'd against those who had kill'd him, and against the new King, with such Passion, that she was secur'd as a Disaffected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:100189:135"/>
I was inform'd of all this, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none ought to have been more indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent than my self on that account: Yet I wish'd with earnestness to see her, that I might tax her with her Baseness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. I fancy'd the Hopes of being reveng'd were the only occasion of that Desire, and little consider'd, alas! that my Love was the chief Motive, and that I was only willing to reproach her, because I could not forget her.</p>
               <p>I went to visit her in her Prison, and she ask'd me scornfully, Whether it was by my Order that she was us'd so ill? I answer'd, Had it been so, I should but have discharg'd my Obligations to her, since she was guilty of a higher Crime to me, than any the Government could charge her with; in saying which, I produc'd the Letters I have spoke of, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, If she knew that Hand. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, without the least Surprize, That she was not asham'd to own them, since whether I knew it or no, <hi>Vasconcellos</hi> was her Husband; and that she would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge none for her Friends or Lovers, but such as would assist her, in revenging his Death. How great soever my Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be, to hear her talk thus, I had the Force to conceal it, and continu'd shewing her the Letters wherein she had
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100189:136"/>
so basely betray'd the Secret I had reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her. She told me, It was for my sake she had done it, and that she never would forgive the Secretary, who instead of making use of the Advices she had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, rely'd upon the Duke <hi>de Olivares,</hi> whose temporizing had ruin'd the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Interests. I interrupted her, desiring to know how that Discovery could be advantagious to me; to which she reply'd, I must have but very little Skill in State-Affairs, not to see that the Duke of <hi>Braganca</hi>'s Election could never stand, because of the Discontent of the other Princes of the Blood, who could not expect such Gratifications from him, as they might receive from the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her Discourse should have mov'd me with Indignation, and I ought, above all, to have resented her marrying my Rival. But even that help'd to justifie her; for I had rather hear she had made a Match so much beneath her self, than suspect her of being guilty of a shameful Amour; and I found, that as she spoke to me, my Heart willingly yielded to her Arguments, and took her Part against my self.</p>
               <p>I carry'd on my Blindness so far that I found some Probability in what she said, of the ill Bottom which the new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100189:136"/>
stood on, and grew inclinable to a Revolt. But I did not then Discover it to her, and continu'd that Conversation in the same Strain I had begun. But it is impossible for a Lover to conceal his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and, in spight of my Dissimulation, she perceiv'd the Effect of her deluding Words.</p>
               <p>I imagin'd the Sight of her had occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd my Folly, but her Absence could not cure it; for the Thoughts of her Misery mov'd my Compassion, and I judg'd it not impossible for me to obtain her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I sued for it, representing, That what she had said was spoke in a Heat of Passion, which had put her besides her self, and that she was now grown very penitent. My Request was easily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it was not thought dangerous to release a Maid, too weak to act what her Passion or Grief might prompt her to.</p>
               <p>No better Token can be given of the Strength of my blinded Love, than the Transport I was in. I ran to the Prison, and having kindly reproach'd her, told her, That the better to let him know what a Lover she had been ungrateful to, I was come to acquaint her, That through my means she was free. She was less care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to thank me, than to repeat what she had already said about the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100189:137"/>
and to persuade me, That my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had been more splendid, had <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> remain'd under the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominion. Neither would I then let her know how far her Arguments prevail'd with me; but having taken her out thence, carry'd her to that Relation, at whose House she had been arrested.</p>
               <p>I visited her often, and persisted in lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with as much Zeal, as if I never had had any occasion to complain of her. She seem'd also to have forgot her former Lover, and I dar'd not make too strict an Enquiry into the Nature of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she had had with him, lest I should thence have a Reason to hate her, I was resolv'd to adore. Another would not make so open a Confession, but I freely own it to you, who seem not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the Inchanting Power of Love.</p>
               <p>She had not been long out of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, when I perceiv'd the Duke of <hi>Caminha,</hi> whose Name I shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, since his Misfortune is so publickly known, visited her assiduously enough, to make me fear him as a Rival. The Marquess <hi>de Villa Real,</hi> Father to that Duke, was nearly related to me, as we were all Three to the new King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:100189:137"/>
I did not at first express my Jealousie to my Mistress, but his Visits became so frequent, and they took such care to be in Private, that I could no longer be silent. She answer'd me, That by disclosing a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to me, she would discharge the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation she ow'd me, for that I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly discover'd to her; adding, She did not do it so much to satisfie my Jealousie, as to inspire me with Thoughts worthy of my Birth, and to let me have a Share in a glorious Design then on foot, which concern'd me as much as any one. Then she told me, The Duke of <hi>Caminha</hi> court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and that she had found in him the Noble Sentiments she had in vain expected from me. <hi>In a Word,</hi> continu'd she, <hi>he does not, like you, sit tamely while</hi> Don John <hi>enjoys a Crown he has no better Title to than any of you, and we shall shortly behold our Country under the Dominion of its lawful Sovereign.</hi> Having spoke these Words, she inform'd me of a Conspiracy, which was then contriving, to assassinate <hi>Don Iohn</hi> and his Queen, and re-establish the <hi>Spanish</hi> Government. That the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Braga</hi> was the Head of it, and the Marquis of <hi>Villa Real,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Caminha,</hi> with several other Persons of the First Quality, his Complices; adding,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100189:138"/>
I might, if I pleas'd, be admitted into Society.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, Whether she had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to tell me of it? She said, No; but that she lov'd me well enough to wish I should not be the only one of all my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, who had no Hand in so Noble and Heroick an Enterprize. Then I desir'd her not to let them know she had; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, It was not that I refus'd being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, but resented their having done it without my Knowledge. She reply'd, It was not too late, and that she would persuade the Duke of <hi>Caminha</hi> to discover it to me.</p>
               <p>Being return'd home, I consider'd what I had best do. My Love would soon have determin'd it, had not the Duke of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minha</hi>'s prevented it; for the manner wherein she had acquainted me with his Passion, made me apprehensive, lest if the Design succeeded, she would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd him before me, and I should thus have contributed to my own Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>But I perplex'd my self to no purpose; for Two Days after we had this Discourse, the Plot was discover'd by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's unadvis'dness, who was so rash as to send a Pacquet to <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein was a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100189:138"/>
very particular Account of it, and a List of the Conspirators. They were all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested, and my Name not being menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, I was left at Liberty, tho' the near Relation I had to the Marquis <hi>de Villa Real</hi> and the Instances I had made to procure my Mistress's Liberty, gave Grounds for Suspicion. She was seiz'd with the rest, and the Accusations against her were so weighty and evident, that she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to lose her Life; but the Queen, out of a particular Favour, chang'd the Punishment she was lyable to, into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Imprisonment. The Marquis of <hi>Villa Real,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Caminha</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and the Archbishop of <hi>Braga</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Grief in his Prison; the rest of the Accomplices suffer'd, and thus the whole Design was frustrated.</p>
               <p>Altho' I was not in Custody, I soon saw that I was strictly observ'd, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be secur'd, resolv'd to absent my self. Here you will have an Instance of my Weakness, and of my false Mistress's Perfidiousness. I had not the Courage to leave my Native Country, before I had us'd my Endeavours to deliver her out of her Confinement, tho' the Favours she had granted to <hi>Vasconcellos,</hi> and her later En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with the Duke of <hi>Caminha</hi> ought to have procur'd her my Scorn and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100189:139"/>
Hatred. But I thought by so convincing a Proof of my Affection, to have oblig'd her to return it; and besides, my Passion was indeed so strong that I expected no Happiness out of her Company; and therefore took more care to find out means of favouring her escape than to secure my own.</p>
               <p>It was in a Convent that she was kept Prisoner; and I caus'd a Note to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to her, wherein I gave her notice, That at a certain Time it should be set on Fire, in the Corner next to her Chamber, and that she might, during the Bustle, come to a Wall I describ'd, on the other side of which I should be with a Ladder, ready to throw it over when she should call for it.</p>
               <p>I was as good as my Word, and my Project having been put in Execution, I came to the Place appointed, where hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tarry'd some Time, I got up, and saw no Body on the other Side; however, I staid there till the Fire was over, when I went away heartily vex'd at my ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. But my Grief had been much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, had I known how I was prevented. The Ungrateful Lady, for whose sake I had ventur'd on this desperate Attempt, had no sooner receiv'd my Note, but she sent it to the Queen, thinking by that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100189:139"/>
seeming Generosity to have gain'd the Queen's Esteem, and the easier procur'd her own Liberty. The Queen gave little Heed to it, but, upon Advice that the Convent was on Fire, she sent some Guards to secure me. He who commanded them, on purpose, avoided me, for besides that he had a great Kindness for me, he fear'd lest my Death, joyn'd to that of all my Kindred, should have occasion'd new Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, and considering the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not yet well establish'd, thought he ought, for that Time to wave his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, since he might thereby at once oblige his Friend, and serve his Prince more effectually.</p>
               <p>The next Morning he sent me an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had happen'd, and that all the Reward which my Mistress had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was, that the Queen had permitted her to take a Nun's Habit, if she had an Inclination that way. Her Treachery sorely afflicted me, and I was at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of my Folly, in being thus obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bent to love a Woman so unworthy of my Kindness.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the aforesaid Note was a Presumption strong enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me guilty; several concurring Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances were brought in, to prove me a Traytor, and upon the whole I was
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100189:140"/>
Outlaw'd, and my Estate Confiscated. I have always believ'd, that they were not desirous of having me apprehended; for had any Search been made, I should soon have been found out; but it is very likely, that my Absence was rather wish'd for than my Death.</p>
               <p>I was so depress'd with Grief, that I took no care to seek for a Refuge; and hearing my Mistress had accepted the Queen's Favour, and taken the Veil, I chose to imitate her. I have since endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to enter into several Monasteries, under a fictitious Name, but none would receive me. I was at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Paris,</hi> (where I continu'd some Time) with the same Design, but seeing I could not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, I at last came hither, where I have led this Life above these Six Years.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> having ended his Story, I made him some Objections, which I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore for fear of Interrupting him, for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I could scarce believe what he said, and concluded, That if it was true, he must certainly have been mad. He answer'd them; And I had the Comfort to meet with a Man whose Follies exceeded mine. I afterwards saw him very often, and understood, That wearied with his Condition, he was sollicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Pardon, and to be once more pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100189:140"/>
of his Estate; but that he was afraid one thing would hinder it, which was, That having not been heard of, since his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Portugal</hi> every one there thought him dead, and his Sufferings having made a great Alteration in him, he might be taken for an Impostor. But I endeavour'd to rid him of that Scruple, and to incourage him in his Design.</p>
            <p>I was much more sensible in his Company than alone; for then reflecting on my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Adventures, I thought my Misfortunes at least equal to his. What he would have made me fear, that tho' I had Courage enough to renounce the World, I should soon be tir'd with that Station, had but a small In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over me; and I doubted not but being once engag'd into the Austerities of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachal Life, I should have Resolution enough to go through them; so great is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of vain, ignorant Men, who rely on their own Strength, for what they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but from God's especial Mercy. With the like Arrogance did I fancy my Constancy could be greater than that of the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> whose Irresolution I pity'd. But indeed my Hour was not yet come; and the Desire I had of a Retreat, was only grounded on La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness and Discouragement, the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of a tiresome unfortunate and unquiet Life; which, no doubt, was the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100189:141"/>
Reason why I was not more stedfast in my Purposes. God grant, I may now with more Firmness effect, in my latter Age, what I had resolv'd on in my blooming Years. The Truth is, I would have built a House before I had laid any Foundation; for without any Knowledge of the chief Points of my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the foregoing Practice of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life, I would on a suddain have turn'd Saint; and being wholly taken up with this Design, I took my Leave of the Hermit, and took Post for <hi>Paris</hi>; desiring, before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Religious State, to consult my <hi>Carmelite,</hi> or rather that she should applaud my Intentions, which my Vanity made me conceive as very Praise-worthy.</p>
            <p>That generous Maid, who was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Life I design'd to imbrace, advis'd me not to enter too slightly into it; but before I did, to submit, for some Time, to the Directions of a Holy Father, who might judge better than my self, whether I was really fit for it. I was fright'ned with the long Preparations which she, told me, were necessary, before I openly declar'd my Intentions, and loath to defer so long the Pleasure my Vanity expected, from hearing every one commend my Heroick Courage, in depriving my self, at that Age, of the Pleasures of this Life. Tho' I was asham'd to own my Thoughts, she easily perceiv'd
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100189:141"/>
I was not such as God requires for his more immediate Service; and told me plainly, That I must not think of it, unless I had Resolution enough to retire into some private Place, and spend half a Year at least in the most severe Austerities and sincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>It was one of the most prudent Actions that ever I did, to consult a Woman of so piercing and sound a Judgment; for how many would there have been, who instead of duly weighing all these Considerations, would rather have hurry'd me into what they would have fancy'd a glorious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; and thus my unstedfastness would have expos'd me to Derision. But seeing I could not submit to those Examinations, which she thought absolutely necessary, she told me, I must look upon this Maggot but as a Temptation of my Laziness and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; that it was not what God requir'd of me, only she wish'd I would take more Care of my Conscience, consider what I was born to, and, by fixing in the Army, put an End to my Knight-Errant's Adventures. She added, I had a fair Opportunity to lead a vertuous Life, in that having been some Time from <hi>Paris,</hi> and being thus grown out of People's Knowledge, I might easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake my Rake-Hell Acquaintance, and by
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100189:142"/>
beginning well, avoid the Censure of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and unexpected Change.</p>
            <p>But being, by her Advice, entred into a Religious House for a few Days, that I might the more undisturb'd employ my self in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting me of my former Errors, and in an unfeign'd Devotion, I found in their Library a Volume of <hi>Abaillard</hi>'s Letters. I had the Curiosity to read it, having seen some of them in <hi>Spain</hi>; for tho' I had in that manner been toss'd from Place to Place, and wholly busied in an Active Life, yet I had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got my old Acquaintance with the Muses. I found, in reading them, so great a Resemblance between <hi>Aloisia</hi>'s Character and my <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi>'s, and his Passion and mine, that it kindled afresh, and I lov'd my Nun with more fervency than I had ever done.</p>
            <p>I had but a Glimpse of her Face since my Return from <hi>Spain,</hi> and she had then appear'd so handsom, that the Idea of her Beauty, inflam'd my Desires, which were more strong than in the greatest Heat of our former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. I dwelt wholly on these Thoughts, and my only Pleasure was, to view my Heart in the Description <hi>Abaillard</hi> made of his own. I imagin'd the ill success of all my former Amours, was a Judgment on me, for leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Person I had ever really lov'd. I often reflected that she was my Wife, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100189:142"/>
that all the Law in the World freed her from an Obligation she could not lawfully have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon her self.</p>
            <p>Thus was I taken up with these frivolous Thoughts; and certainly never was a Passion at once more violent and unhappy than mine, for tho' I were marry'd to her, yet I judged it impossible to persuade her to leave the Nunnery; and the less was my Hope, the greater was my Misfortune.</p>
            <p>How often did I repent me of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance, in suffering her to take that Habit! and curs'd the unfortunate Minute of our Parting. I doubted not but my former Flames were never well extinguish'd, and that the Kindness I had for several others, had never reach'd my Heart. But now Love display'd its whole Force in me, and had I a thousand Lives, I would have given them all to be in the same state with her as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when her Vertue was all the Opposition I met with.</p>
            <p>It's Violence robb'd me of Ease and Rest. I spent whole Nights in writing Letters to her, which I burnt in the Morning; not daring to acquaint her with my Sentiments. However, I at last resolv'd to tell her of my Sufferings, and made her a Visit with that Design. Oh! how the charming Accent of her Voice ravish'd my Soul! My Transport was so great it took away my Speech; when
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100189:143"/>
perceiving my Disorder, she ask'd me, What I ail'd? I fell upon my Knees and conjur'd her to hear, and not to hate me. Then I disclos'd the Fierceness of my raging Love, begging she would at least afford her Pity. She yielded her Attention, and only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted me with Sighs. Altho' I could not see her, yet I heard her Weep. <hi>Ah!</hi> cry'd I then, <hi>May I hope you're mov'd with my Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi> She could not curb her Tears impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Stream, and was some Time without replying to me; but at last did thus express her self. <hi>I must confess, with Shame, That I am mov'd, and give too much Way to the pleasing News, That you can love me still; 'tis true that since the Moment I have known you, my Thoughts of you have ever been the same; not Absence nor my Vows could e're destroy, nor Time Deface that Charming, Dear Idea; with Iealousie and Grief I have seen you engag'd to other Women, and do still doat on you with the Tenderness I ever did.</hi> She stopp'd, and I was seiz'd with unspeakable Raptures, but the dreadful Thought of the Condition she was in, and the invincible Impediments which oppos'd my Bliss, soon dampt my forward Joy. <hi>Ah then,</hi> said I, <hi>since we e're lov'd each other, why did we thus deprive us of those Sweets we might together have enjoy'd! What is there then no Hope? Oh! were you half as willing as my self, there are no Tyes which can keep as asunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:100189:143"/>There she stopp'd my Discourse, begging me not to entertain these idle Thoughts, but to sacrifice to the Almighty, as she had done a Passion contrary to his Commands; she told me too, She found her Death drew near, and by a secret Warning, was admonish'd to prepare for it.</p>
            <p>My Sadness at these Words was such, as I cannot express, and I desir'd her to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with Heaven, That since we might not live together, I should at least dye soon after her. This Conversation lasted some Hours, and was the last I had with her; for tho' in a seeming good Health, she had no sooner left me, but was taken with a violent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and a short while after departed this Life: I endeavour'd all I could to visit her once more, and often entreated a Nun she lov'd to speak to her for me; but my <hi>Carmelite</hi> pray'd her, to suffer her to forget me, and all the World, that she might think of God alone. Then she desir'd her to assure me, That she dy'd with the same Affection for me she ever had; and never mention'd me any more, only sometimes reflecting on the Gifts of Divine Providence to her, she im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd Heaven to be as merciful to me; and I doubt not but it is to her Prayers I stand indebted for having liv'd to an Age, when I may reflect on my former Wandrings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:100189:144"/>I shall undertake to describe my Affliction. The Reader may well imagine it was not small, for she dy'd when my love was rais'd to it's highest Pitch.</p>
            <p>I resolv'd to follow the good Counsels she had given me; and at once inform'd my Brother with my Return, and design to lead a better Life. I was fill'd with the best De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires in the World; but the sequel of my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story will shew, that I kept not my Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will afford as odd Adventures as those I have already related; which will, I believe, be read with a greater Pleasure, since I shall have occasion to give an account of the most remarkable Transactions during those Times, wherein my self was often concern'd.</p>
